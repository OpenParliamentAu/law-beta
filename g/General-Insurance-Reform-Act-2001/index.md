             (2)  A condition may be expressed to have effect despite anything in the prudential standards.

             (3)  Without limiting the conditions that APRA may impose on an authorisation, APRA may make the authorisation conditional on a body corporate, of which the general insurer is a subsidiary, being an authorised NOHC.

             (4)  If APRA imposes, varies or revokes the conditions on a general insurer’s authorisation, APRA must:

                     (a)  give written notice to the insurer; and

                     (b)  ensure that notice that the action has been taken is published in the _Gazette_.

### Division 3—Revocation of an authorisation

##### <a id="15"></a>15  When APRA may revoke an authorisation

             (1)  APRA may revoke (in writing) a general insurer’s authorisation under section 12 if APRA is satisfied that the insurer has no liabilities in respect of insurance business carried on by it in Australia and that:

                     (a)  the insurer has failed to comply with:

                              (i)  a requirement of this Act (including the requirement to comply with the prudential standards) or of an instrument made for the purposes of this Act; or

                             (ii)  a requirement of the _Financial Sector (Collection of Data) Act 2001_; or

                            (iii)  a direction to the insurer under this Act; or

                            (iv)  a condition of the insurer’s authorisation; or

                     (b)  it would be contrary to the national interest for the authorisation to remain in force; or

                     (c)  the insurer has failed to pay:

                              (i)  an amount of levy or late penalty to which the _Financial Institutions Supervisory Levies Collection Act 1998_ applies; or

                             (ii)  an amount of charge fixed under section 51 of the _Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998_; or

                     (d)  the insurer is insolvent and is unlikely to return to solvency within a reasonable period of time; or

                     (e)  the insurer has inadequate capital and is unlikely to have adequate capital within a reasonable period of time; or

                      (f)  the insurer has ceased to carry on insurance business in Australia; or

                     (g)  the insurer has not, within the period of 12 months after it was granted an authority under this Part, carried on insurance business in Australia.

             (2)  However, APRA may only revoke a general insurer’s authorisation under this section if APRA has the Treasurer’s written agreement to do so.

             (3)  Before revoking a general insurer’s authorisation, APRA must give written notice to the insurer advising it that:

                     (a)  APRA is considering revoking the authorisation for the reasons specified; and

                     (b)  the insurer may make submissions about the revocation to APRA, in accordance with the notice, by a specified date (which must be at least 90 days after the notice is given).

          (3A)  To avoid doubt, APRA may give a notice under subsection (3) to a general insurer even if, at the time the notice is given, APRA is not satisfied that the insurer has no liabilities in respect of insurance business carried on by it in Australia.

          (3B)  If APRA gives a notice under subsection (3) to a general insurer, APRA must not revoke the insurer’s authorisation until after the date specified in the notice, and after consideration of any submission, as mentioned in paragraph (3)(b).

             (4)  APRA may, with the Treasurer’s written agreement, decide that subsection (3) does not apply if APRA is satisfied that complying with that subsection could result in a delay in revocation that would be contrary to the national interest.

             (5)  If APRA revokes a general insurer’s authorisation, APRA must:

                     (a)  give written notice to the insurer; and

                     (b)  ensure that notice of the revocation is published in the _Gazette_.

             (6)  A revocation is not invalid merely because of a failure to comply with subsection (5).

##### <a id="16"></a>16  When APRA must revoke a general insurer’s authorisation

             (1)  APRA must revoke (in writing) a general insurer’s authorisation under section 12 if:

                     (a)  the insurer asks (in writing) APRA to do so; and

                     (b)  APRA is satisfied that:

                              (i)  the insurer has no liabilities in respect of insurance business carried on by it in Australia; and

                             (ii)  revoking the authorisation would not be contrary to the national interest.

             (2)  If APRA revokes a general insurer’s authorisation, APRA must:

                     (a)  give written notice to the insurer; and

                     (b)  ensure that notice of the revocation is published in the _Gazette_.

             (3)  A revocation is not invalid merely because of a failure to comply with subsection (2).

##### <a id="17"></a>17  Assignment of liabilities to enable revocation

             (1)  If APRA considers that it would, under section 15, revoke a general insurer’s authorisation if the insurer had no liabilities in respect of insurance business carried on by it in Australia, APRA may direct the insurer to arrange, subject to APRA’s approval, to assign those liabilities to one or more other general insurers. The insurer must effect the assignment of the liabilities within the period specified in the direction and comply with such conditions relating to the assignment as are specified by APRA in the direction.

             (2)  Subsection (1) has effect despite subsection 17B(1).

Note:          A general insurer who has asked APRA for a revocation under section 16 may, for the purpose of obtaining the revocation, make an application to the Federal Court under Division 3A for an order transferring the insurer’s insurance business to another general insurer.

             (3)  A general insurer must not assign its liabilities under this section, and a purported assignment under this section is of no effect, unless the assignment is approved by APRA under subsection (4).

             (4)  APRA may only approve a proposed assignment of a general insurer’s liabilities under this section if APRA is satisfied that the assignment is appropriate, having regard to:

                     (a)  the interests of the insurer’s policyholders; and

                     (b)  the interests of the policyholders of the general insurer or insurers to whom the liabilities are to be assigned; and

                     (c)  the national interest; and

                     (d)  any other matter APRA considers relevant.

The approval must be in writing and may be made subject to specified conditions.

          (4A)  Where a general insurer (the **_first general insurer_**) accepts an assignment of liabilities from another general insurer (the **_second general insurer_**) approved by APRA under subsection 17(4), the following are taken to have occurred:

                     (a)  policies in respect of which liability is accepted by the first general insurer (the **_transferring policies_**) are to be treated for all purposes as if each policy had been transferred by novation from the second general insurer to the first general insurer;

                     (b)  a policyholder of a transferring policy is taken to have the same rights against the first general insurer as the person would have against that insurer had the person’s policy been transferred by novation to the first general insurer;

                     (c)  the rights of the first general insurer against policyholders of transferring policies are the same as they would be had the transferring policies been transferred by novation to the first general insurer from the second general insurer.

             (5)  If APRA approves an assignment, the general insurer must:

                     (a)  comply with the conditions on the approval; and

                     (b)  give reasonable notice (in writing) of the assignment to the insurer’s policyholders; and

                     (c)  give APRA such written evidence of the assignment as APRA reasonably requires.

             (6)  An assignment of liabilities under this section may include the assignment of any rights or benefits in connection with contracts of insurance in respect of the insurance business carried on in Australia by the general insurer concerned.

             (7)  A direction under subsection (1) has effect despite anything in the _Insurance Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1991_.

             (8)  A general insurer commits an offence if:

                     (a)  the insurer does, or fails to do, an act; and

                     (b)  by doing or failing to do the act, the insurer fails to comply with a direction under this section.

                    Maximum penalty:    60 penalty units.

             (9)  An offence against subsection (8) is an offence of strict liability.

Note 1:       For **_strict liability_**, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

Note 2:       Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.

Note 3:       If a body corporate is convicted of an offence against this section, subsection 4B(3) of the _Crimes Act 1914_ allows a court to impose a fine of up to 5 times the penalty above.

                     (a)  the terms of the agreement or deed under which the proposed transfer or amalgamation is carried out; and

                     (b)  particulars of any other arrangements necessary to give effect to the scheme.

             (4)  Subsection (1) does not require that a transfer or amalgamation of insurance business be made under a scheme approved by the Federal Court if:

                     (a)  immediately before the transfer or amalgamation, the insurance business is carried on outside Australia; and

                     (b)  the transfer or amalgamation will result in the insurance business being carried on outside Australia.

##### <a id="17C"></a>17C  Steps to be taken before application for confirmation

             (1)  In this section:

                    <a name="affected-policyhold"></a>**_affected policyholder_** means the holder of a policy affected by a scheme.

                    <a name="approved-summari"></a>**_approved summary_** means a summary approved by APRA.

             (2)  An application for confirmation of a scheme may not be made unless:

                     (a)  a copy of the scheme and any actuarial report on which the scheme is based have been given to APRA in accordance with the prudential standards; and

                     (b)  notice of intention to make the application has been published by the applicant in accordance with the prudential standards; and

                     (c)  an approved summary of the scheme has been given to every affected policyholder.

             (3)  Without limiting the provision that may be made by the prudential standards for the purposes of paragraph (2)(b), the notice referred to in that paragraph must include, in relation to each body corporate affected by the scheme, details of the place and time at which an affected policyholder may obtain a copy of the scheme.

             (4)  An affected policyholder is entitled, on the person’s request, to be provided by the company with one copy of the scheme free of charge.

             (5)  The Federal Court may dispense with the need for compliance with paragraph (2)(c) in relation to a particular scheme if it is satisfied that, because of the nature of the scheme or the circumstances attending its preparation, it is not necessary that the paragraph be complied with.

##### <a id="17D"></a>17D  Actuarial report on scheme

             (1)  When a copy of a scheme has been given to APRA for the purpose of paragraph 17C(2)(a), APRA may arrange for an independent actuary to make a written report on the scheme.

             (2)  APRA may give a copy of the report to each body corporate affected by the scheme.

##### <a id="17E"></a>17E  Application to Court

             (1)  Any of the bodies corporate affected by a scheme may apply to the Federal Court for confirmation of the scheme.

             (2)  An application for confirmation must be made in accordance with the prudential standards.

             (3)  APRA is entitled to be heard on an application.

##### <a id="17F"></a>17F  Confirmation of scheme

             (1)  The Federal Court may:

                     (a)  confirm a scheme without modification; or

                     (b)  confirm the scheme subject to such modifications as it thinks appropriate; or

                     (c)  refuse to confirm the scheme.

             (2)  The Federal Court may make such orders as it thinks fit in relation to reinsurance.

##### <a id="17G"></a>17G  Effect of confirmation etc.

                   When a scheme is confirmed:

                     (a)  it becomes binding on all persons; and

                     (b)  it has effect in spite of anything in the constitution of any body corporate affected by the scheme; and

                     (c)  the body corporate on whose application the scheme was confirmed must cause a copy of the scheme to be lodged at an office of ASIC in every State and Territory in which a company affected by the scheme carried on business.

##### <a id="17H"></a>17H  Costs of actuary’s report

             (1)  When a scheme is confirmed, the body corporate that applied for the confirmation becomes liable to pay to the Commonwealth an amount equal to the expenses reasonably incurred by APRA in obtaining a report under section 17D in relation to the scheme.

             (2)  An amount due under subsection (1) may be recovered by the Commonwealth as a debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.

##### <a id="17I"></a>17I  Documents to be lodged in case of transfer or amalgamation

             (1)  If any part of the insurance business carried on by a general insurer is transferred to, or amalgamated with, the insurance business of another body corporate, the latter body corporate must give APRA such documents as are required by the prudential standards.

             (2)  The documents must be lodged within the time fixed by the prudential standards or within such further time as APRA, in accordance with the prudential standards, allows.

### Division 4—Authorisation to be a NOHC of a general insurer

##### <a id="18"></a>18  Authorisation to be a NOHC

             (1)  A body corporate may apply in writing to APRA for an authorisation (a **_NOHC authorisation_**) under this section. The authorisation operates as an authorisation in relation to the body corporate and any general insurers that are subsidiaries of the body corporate from time to time.

Note 1:       The body corporate may want the authority because APRA may refuse to grant a subsidiary of the body corporate a section 12 authorisation unless the body corporate holds a NOHC authorisation (see subsection 12(3)).

Note 2:       The body corporate may also need to consider the implications of the _Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975_, the _Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act 1998_ and the _Insurance Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1991_.

             (2)  APRA may require the body corporate to provide a statutory declaration in relation to information or documents provided in relation to the application.

             (3)  APRA may authorise an applicant if it considers it is appropriate to do so. The authorisation must be in writing.

             (4)  If APRA authorises an applicant, APRA must:

                     (a)  give written notice to the applicant; and

                     (b)  ensure that notice of the authorisation is published in the _Gazette_.

             (5)  The taking of an action is not invalid merely because of a failure to comply with subsection (4).

             (6)  Part VI applies to a refusal of APRA to authorise an applicant under this section.

##### <a id="19"></a>19  Conditions on a NOHC authorisation

             (1)  APRA may, at any time, by giving written notice to an authorised NOHC:

                     (a)  impose conditions, or additional conditions, on the NOHC authorisation; and

                     (b)  vary or revoke conditions imposed on the NOHC authorisation.

The conditions must relate to prudential matters.

             (2)  A condition may be expressed to have effect despite anything in the prudential standards.

             (3)  If APRA imposes, varies or revokes the conditions on a NOHC authorisation, APRA must:

                     (a)  give written notice to the authorised NOHC; and

                     (b)  ensure that notice of the imposition, variation or revocation of the conditions is published in the _Gazette_.

             (4)  The taking of an action is not invalid merely because of a failure to comply with subsection (3).

##### <a id="20"></a>20  Breach of conditions on a NOHC authorisation

             (1)  An authorised NOHC commits an offence if:

                     (a)  the NOHC does an act or fails to do an act; and

                     (b)  doing the act or failing to do the act results in a contravention of a condition of the NOHC authorisation; and

                     (c)  there is no determination in force under subsection 7(1) that this subsection does not apply to the NOHC.

                    Maximum penalty:    60 penalty units.

             (2)  An offence against this section is an offence of strict liability.

Note 1:       For **_strict liability_**, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

Note 2:       Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.

Note 3:       If a body corporate is convicted of an offence against this section, subsection 4B(3) of the _Crimes Act 1914_ allows a court to impose a fine of up to 5 times the penalty above.

##### <a id="21"></a>21  When APRA may revoke a NOHC authorisation

             (1)  APRA may revoke, in writing, a NOHC authorisation if APRA is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the authorised NOHC has failed to comply with:

                              (i)  a requirement of this Act (including the requirement to comply with the prudential standards) or of an instrument made for the purposes of this Act; or

                             (ii)  a requirement of the _Financial Sector (Collection of Data) Act 2001_; or

                            (iii)  a direction to the authorised NOHC under this Act; or

                            (iv)  a condition of the authorisation; or

                     (b)  it would be contrary to the national interest for the authorisation to remain in force; or

                     (c)  the authorised NOHC has failed to pay:

                              (i)  an amount of levy or late penalty to which the _Financial Institutions Supervisory Levies Collection Act 1998_ applies; or

                             (ii)  an amount of charge fixed under section 51 of the _Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998_; or

                     (d)  it would be contrary to the interests of the policyholders of any general insurer who is a subsidiary of the authorised NOHC for the authorisation to remain in force; or

                     (e)  the authorised NOHC has ceased to be a NOHC of any general insurer.

             (2)  However, APRA may only revoke a NOHC authorisation under this section if APRA has the Treasurer’s written agreement to do so.

             (3)  Before revoking a NOHC authorisation, APRA must give written notice to the authorised NOHC advising it that:

                     (a)  APRA is considering revoking the authorisation for the reasons specified; and

                     (b)  the authorised NOHC may make submissions about the revocation to APRA, in accordance with the notice, by a specified date (which must be at least 90 days after the notice is given).

APRA must consider any submissions made by the authorised NOHC by that date.

             (4)  APRA may, with the Treasurer’s written agreement, decide that subsection (3) does not apply if APRA is satisfied that complying with that subsection could result in a delay in revocation that would be:

                     (a)  contrary to the national interest; or

                     (b)  contrary to the interests of the policyholders of any general insurer who is a subsidiary of the authorised NOHC concerned.

             (5)  If APRA revokes a body corporate’s NOHC authorisation, APRA must:

                     (a)  give written notice to the body corporate; and

                     (b)  ensure that notice of the revocation is published in the _Gazette_.

             (6)  A revocation is not invalid merely because of a failure to comply with subsection (5).

##### <a id="22"></a>22  When APRA must revoke a NOHC authorisation

             (1)  APRA must revoke (in writing) a body corporate’s NOHC authorisation if:

                     (a)  the body corporate asks (in writing) APRA to do so; and

                     (b)  APRA is satisfied that revoking the authorisation would not be contrary to either:

                              (i)  the national interest; or

                             (ii)  the interests of the policyholders of any general insurer who is a subsidiary of the body corporate.

             (2)  If APRA revokes a body corporate’s NOHC authorisation, APRA must:

                     (a)  give written notice to the body corporate; and

                     (b)  ensure that notice of the revocation is published in the _Gazette_.

             (3)  A revocation is not invalid merely because of a failure to comply with subsection (2).

##### <a id="23"></a>23  Publication of list of authorised NOHCs

                   APRA may, from time to time, cause a list of authorised NOHCs to be published in the _Gazette_ or in any other way that APRA considers appropriate.

                    Maximum penalty:    Imprisonment for 2 years.

             (3)  A person commits an offence if the person contravenes subsection (1). This is an offence of strict liability.

                    Maximum penalty:    60 penalty units.

             (4)  A body corporate must not allow a disqualified person to be or act as:

                     (a)  if the body corporate is a general insurer (other than a foreign general insurer)—a director or senior manager of the insurer; or

                     (b)  if the body corporate is a foreign general insurer—a senior manager, or agent in Australia for the purpose of section 118, of the insurer; or

                     (c)  if the body corporate is an authorised NOHC—a director or senior manager of the NOHC.

             (5)  A body corporate commits an offence if it contravenes subsection (4).

                    Maximum penalty:    250 penalty units.

             (6)  A body corporate commits an offence if it contravenes subsection (4). This is an offence of strict liability.

                    Maximum penalty:    60 penalty units.

             (7)  In a prosecution under subsection (5), it is a defence if the defendant:

                     (a)  contacted APRA within a reasonable period before allowing the person to be or act as a director, senior manager or agent (as the case may be); and

                     (b)  was advised by APRA that the person was not a disqualified person.

Note:          A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matters in this subsection (see section 13.3(3) of the _Criminal Code_).

             (8)  A failure to comply with this section does not affect the validity of an appointment or transaction.

Note 1:       For **_strict liability_**, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

Note 2:       Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.

Note 3:       If a body corporate is convicted of an offence against this section, subsection 4B(3) of the _Crimes Act 1914_ allows a court to impose a fine of up to 5 times the penalty above.

##### <a id="25"></a>25  Who is a _disqualified person_?

             (1)  A person is a **_disqualified person_** if, at any time:

                     (a)  the person has been convicted of an offence against or arising out of this Act or the _Financial Sector (Collection of Data) Act 2001_; or

                     (b)  the person has been convicted of an offence against or arising out of a law in force in Australia, or the law of a foreign country, if the offence concerns dishonest conduct or conduct relating to a financial sector company (within the meaning of the _Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act 1998_); or

                     (c)  the person has been or becomes bankrupt; or

                     (d)  the person has applied to take the benefit of a law for the relief of bankrupt or insolvent debtors; or

Note:          APRA may determine that a person is not a disqualified person (see section 26).

             (2)  A reference in subsection (1) to a person who has been convicted of an offence includes a reference to a person in respect of whom an order has been made relating to the offence under:

                     (a)  section 19B of the _Crimes Act 1914_; or

                     (b)  a corresponding provision of a law of a State, a Territory or a foreign country.

             (3)  Nothing in this section affects the operation of Part VIIC of the _Crimes Act 1914_ (which includes provisions that, in certain circumstances, relieve persons from the requirement to disclose spent convictions and require persons aware of such convictions to disregard them).

##### <a id="26"></a>26  APRA may determine that a person is not a _disqualified person_

             (1)  Despite section 25, APRA may determine (in writing) that a person is not a **_disqualified person_**. APRA may do so on its own initiative or on the application of the person.

             (2)  However, APRA may only make the determination if it is satisfied that the person is highly unlikely to be a prudential risk to any general insurer or authorised NOHC.

             (3)  The determination takes effect on the day on which it is made and APRA must as soon as practicable give a copy of the determination to the person concerned and to any affected general insurer or authorised NOHC.

             (4)  If a person applies for a determination under this section, APRA must:

                     (a)  either make, or refuse to make, the determination; and

                     (b)  give the person written notice of the decision including, in the case of a refusal, the reasons for the refusal.

             (5)  APRA may revoke a determination under this section by giving written notice to the person concerned and must give a copy of the notice to any affected general insurer or authorised NOHC.

             (6)  Part VI applies to a refusal of APRA to make a determination under this section.

##### <a id="27"></a>27  APRA may remove a director or senior manager of a general insurer or authorised NOHC

                     (c)  a director or senior manager of an authorised NOHC.

             (2)  APRA may direct (in writing) that the general insurer or authorised NOHC remove the person from the position if APRA is satisfied that the person:

                     (a)  is a disqualified person; or

                     (b)  does not meet one or more of the criteria for fitness and propriety set out in the prudential standards.

             (3)  Before directing a general insurer or authorised NOHC to remove a person, APRA must give written notice to:

                     (a)  the person; and

                     (b)  the insurer or NOHC;

giving each of them a reasonable opportunity to make submissions on the matter.

             (4)  A direction takes effect on the day specified in it, which must be at least 7 days after it is made.

             (5)  If APRA directs a general insurer or authorised NOHC to remove a person, APRA must give a copy of the direction to the person and insurer or NOHC.

             (6)  Part VI applies to a direction made by APRA under this section.

             (7)  A general insurer commits an offence if:

                     (a)  the insurer does, or fails to do, an act; and

                     (b)  by doing or failing to do the act, the insurer fails to comply with a direction under this section.

                    Maximum penalty:    60 penalty units.

             (8)  An offence against subsection (7) is an offence of strict liability.

Note 1:       For **_strict liability_**, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

Note 2:       Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.

Note 3:       If a body corporate is convicted of an offence against this section, subsection 4B(3) of the _Crimes Act 1914_ allows a court to impose a fine of up to 5 times the penalty above.

### Division 6—Other matters

##### <a id="28"></a>28  General insurer must hold sufficient assets

                   A general insurer commits an offence if:

                     (a)  it does not hold assets in Australia (excluding goodwill and any other amount excluded by the prudential standards for the purposes of this section) of a value that is equal to or greater than the total amount of its liabilities in Australia; and

                     (b)  APRA has not authorised the insurer to hold assets of a lesser value; and

                     (c)  there is no determination in force under subsection 7(1) determining that this subsection does not apply to the insurer.

                    Maximum penalty:    200 penalty units.

Note 1:       Certain amounts are taken to be assets in Australia, and certain liabilities are taken to be liabilities in Australia, under section 116A.

Note 2:       Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.

Note 3:       If a body corporate is convicted of an offence against this section, subsection 4B(3) of the _Crimes Act 1914_ allows a court to impose a fine of up to 5 times the penalty above.

##### <a id="29"></a>29  Change of name of a general insurer or authorised NOHC

             (1)  A general insurer who changes its name must place a notice in a daily newspaper or newspapers circulating generally in each State or Territory in which the insurer carries on insurance business.

             (2)  The notice must state the old and new names of the insurer and when the change took effect.

             (3)  If APRA is satisfied that a general insurer or authorised NOHC has changed its name, APRA must ensure that notice of that fact is published in the _Gazette_ (whether or not the insurer has also placed a notice under subsection (1)).

             (4)  The authorisation of the insurer under section 12, or NOHC under section 18, (as the case may be) has effect after the _Gazette_ publication as if it had been given under the changed name.

##### <a id="30"></a>30  General insurer or authorised NOHC ceasing to exist

             (1)  If APRA is satisfied that a general insurer or authorised NOHC has ceased to exist, APRA must ensure that notice of that fact is published in the _Gazette_.

             (2)  The authorisation under section 12 or 18 (as the case may be) of the insurer or NOHC is taken to be revoked when the _Gazette_ notice is published.

##### <a id="31"></a>31  Effect of authorisation as a general insurer

                   Nothing in this Part authorises the carrying on by a body corporate of any business that it would not otherwise have been authorised to carry on.

## Part IIIA—Prudential supervision and monitoring of general insurers, authorised NOHCs and their subsidiaries

### Division 1—The prudential standards

##### <a id="32"></a>32  APRA may determine _prudential standards_

             (1)  APRA may determine (in writing) standards (**_prudential standards_**) relating to prudential matters that must be complied with by:

                     (a)  all general insurers; or

                     (b)  all authorised NOHCs; or

                     (c)  the subsidiaries of general insurers or authorised NOHCs; or

                     (d)  a specified class of general insurers, authorised NOHCs or subsidiaries of general insurers or authorised NOHCs.

             (2)  A prudential standard may impose different requirements to be complied with:

                     (a)  by different classes of general insurers, authorised NOHCs, or subsidiaries of general insurers or authorised NOHCs; or

                     (b)  in different situations; or

                     (c)  in respect of different activities.

          (3A)  APRA may modify a prudential standard to replace particular requirements in the standard with an in-house capital adequacy model proposed by a general insurer, authorised NOHC or subsidiary of a general insurer for the purpose of setting its capital requirements. The in-house capital adequacy model proposed by the general insurer, authorised NOHC or subsidiary must comply with criteria set out in the prudential standards.

          (3B)  In modifying a prudential standard, APRA must have regard to the particular business and circumstances of the general insurer, authorised NOHC or subsidiary concerned.

          (3C)  If APRA modifies a prudential standard in respect of a particular general insurer, authorised NOHC or subsidiary of a general insurer or authorised NOHC under subsection (3A), APRA must give written notice of the modification to the general insurer, authorised NOHC or subsidiary concerned.

          (3D)  The prudential standards may provide for APRA to exercise powers and discretions under the standards, including but not limited to discretions to approve, impose, adjust or exclude specific prudential requirements in relation to the following:

                     (a)  a particular general insurer, authorised NOHC or subsidiary of a general insurer or authorised NOHC;

                     (b)  specified general insurers, authorised NOHCs or subsidiaries of general insurers or authorised NOHCs;

                     (c)  a class of general insurers, authorised NOHCs or subsidiaries of general insurers or authorised NOHCs.

           (3E)  APRA must obtain the Treasurer’s written agreement before modifying a prudential standard under subsection (3A).

             (4)  A prudential standard takes effect on the day on which the determination of the standard is made or such later day as is specified in the determination.

             (5)  A determination of a prudential standard, or a variation or revocation of a prudential standard, is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

             (6)  Despite section 49A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_, the standards may make provision for or in relation to a matter by applying, adopting or incorporating any matter contained in an instrument or other writing as in force or existing from time to time.

##### <a id="33"></a>33  Requirement to consult beforehand

             (1)  Before making or varying a prudential standard APRA must consult:

                     (a)  the general insurers or authorised NOHCs to whom the standard applies or will apply; and

                     (b)  if the standard applies or will apply to subsidiaries of general insurers or authorised NOHCs—those insurers or NOHCs.

             (2)  APRA may also consult with such associations or other bodies representing the insurers, NOHCs or subsidiaries as APRA considers appropriate.

             (3)  If APRA is satisfied that the delay involved in undertaking consultation under subsection (1) would materially prejudice the interests of the policyholders of any general insurers, APRA may, with the Treasurer’s written agreement, decide that subsection (1) does not apply.

                     (c)  under the terms of the contract, payments by way of reinsurance are to be made in Australia.

             (2)  For the purposes of section 116 (General insurer not to carry on insurance business after start of winding up) and section 28, a liability is taken to be a liability in Australia of a general insurer if it is undertaken by the insurer under a contract of insurance (including reinsurance) made in Australia or in respect of which a proposal was accepted or a policy issued in Australia, other than a contract:

                     (a)  that relates only to a liability contingent on an event that can happen only outside Australia, not being a liability that the body corporate has undertaken to satisfy in Australia; or

                     (b)  if the insurer carries on insurance business both in and outside Australia—that relates only to a liability that the insurer has undertaken to satisfy outside Australia.

             (3)  For the purposes of section 28, a liability is also taken to be a liability in Australia of a general insurer if it is undertaken by the insurer under a contract of insurance (including reinsurance) made outside Australia or in respect of which a proposal was accepted or a policy issued outside Australia, if the contract:

                     (a)  relates to a liability contingent on an event that can happen only in Australia; or

                     (b)  if the insurer carries on insurance business both in and outside Australia—relates to a liability that the insurer has undertaken to satisfy in Australia;

and any part of the negotiations or arrangements leading to the making of the contract, the acceptance of the proposal or the issue of the policy took place or were made in Australia.

             (4)  For the purposes of section 116 and section 28, unless the contrary intention appears, a reference to liabilities of a body corporate includes a reference to provision for liabilities made in its accounts, or directed in accordance with section 49M to be made, but does not include:

                     (a)  a liability in respect of share capital; or

                     (b)  where the body corporate is registered under the _Life Insurance Act 1995_, a liability that is, in accordance with that Act:

                              (i)  referable to a class of life insurance business carried on by the body corporate in respect of which it has established a statutory fund under that Act; or

                             (ii)  charged on any of the assets of such a statutory fund.

             (5)  The whole or such part as APRA determines of an amount owed to a body corporate by way of portions of premiums retained under a contract of reinsurance by a person outside Australia are, for the purposes of section 28, to be taken to be an asset in Australia of the body corporate.

             (6)  Where:

                     (a)  a determination has been made under subsection (5); and

                     (b)  it appears at any time to APRA that the determination is no longer necessary or should be varied;

                     (b)  any other provisions of the new Act so far as they relate to making or dealing with such applications;

apply after this Act receives the Royal Assent as if those provisions had come into operation at that time.

(2)        An authorisation given before the commencement takes effect on the day specified (in writing) by APRA. That day must not be before the commencement.

## 3  Early approvals of auditors and actuaries

                     (b)  any other provisions of the new Act so far as they relate to such appointments;

            apply after this Act receives the Royal Assent as if those provisions had come into operation at that time.

(2)        An appointment made or approval given before the commencement takes effect on the day specified (in writing) by APRA. That day must not be before the commencement.

## 3A  Effect of authority under old Act

(1)        An authority to carry on insurance business granted to a body corporate under section 23 or 24 of the old Act ceases to be in force immediately after an authority is granted to the body corporate under section 12 of the new Act.

(2)        However, subitem (1) is subject to any determination under item 4 in respect of the body corporate.

## 4  Application of the old Act during the transition period

(1)        APRA may determine that all or specified provisions of the old Act continue to apply to a person or class of persons for a specified period during the transition period.

(2)        The determination may include a different specified period in respect of:

                     (a)  different provisions of the old Act; or

                     (b)  different persons or classes of persons.

(3)        The determination may be made subject to specified conditions.

(4)        A copy of the determination must be published in the _Gazette_ and, on _Gazette_ publication, has effect according to its terms.

## 5  Application of the new Act during the transition period

(1)        APRA may determine that all or specified provisions of the new Act do not apply to a person or class of persons for a specified period during the transition period.

## 6  Body corporate covered by both the old Act and the new Act

(1)        This item applies if during the transition period:

                     (a)  a body corporate:

                              (i)  is authorised under the old Act to carry on insurance business; or

                             (ii)  is a general insurer under the new Act; and

                     (b)  the effect of determinations under items 4 and 5 is that provisions of both the old Act and the new Act apply to the body corporate.

(2)        While the determinations have that effect:

                     (a)  if the body corporate is not authorised under the old Act to carry on insurance business—it is taken to be so authorised for the purposes of the provisions of the old Act that apply to the body corporate; and

                     (b)  if the body corporate is not a general insurer under the new Act—it is taken to be a general insurer for the purposes of the provisions of the new Act that apply to the body corporate.

## 7  Direction to assign liabilities

(1)        This item applies to a body corporate if:

                     (a)  during the transition period, the body corporate is authorised under the old Act to carry on insurance business because of a determination under item 4; and

                     (b)  APRA considers it appropriate to vary or revoke the determination so that the body corporate will no longer be so authorised; and

                     (c)  the body corporate is not a general insurer under the new Act; and

                     (d)  the body corporate has liabilities in respect of insurance business carried on by it in Australia.

(2)        This item also applies to a body corporate if:

                     (a)  during the transition period, the body corporate is authorised under the old Act to carry on insurance business because of a determination under item 4; and

                     (b)  as at 3 months before the end of the transition period, the body corporate is not a general insurer under the new Act; and

                     (c)  the body corporate has liabilities in respect of insurance business carried on by it in Australia.

(3)        Section 17 of the new Act (which allows APRA to direct the assignment of liabilities) is taken to apply to the body corporate as though:

                     (a)  the body corporate’s authorisation under the old Act to carry on insurance business were an authorisation under the new Act to carry on insurance business; and

                     (b)  APRA considered that it would revoke the authorisation if the body corporate had no liabilities in respect of insurance business carried on by it in Australia.

## 8  Auditors may be taken to be appointed under the new Act

(1)        APRA may determine (in writing) that a person who was, immediately before the commencement, acting in accordance with the old Act as a body corporate’s auditor, is:

                     (a)  on and after the commencement; or

                     (b)  on and after a specified day during the transition period;

taken to have been appointed as the body corporate’s auditor in accordance with section 39 of the new Act.

(2)        APRA may only make the determination with the person’s written agreement.

(3)        APRA must give a copy of the determination to the person and the body corporate to which the person is taken to have been appointed.

## 9  Actuarial investigation under the old Act

If APRA has given a body corporate notice under subsection 48A(2) of the old Act, and a report under section 48A has not been given to APRA before the commencement, sections 48A and 48B of the old Act continue to apply to the body corporate on and after the commencement until the report is given to APRA.

## 10  Directions to deal with the transition

(1)        For the purpose of dealing with the transition from the old Act to the new Act, APRA may give written directions during the transition period to:

                     (a)  a person to whom some or all of the old Act continues to apply during the transition period because of a determination under item 4; or

                     (b)  a person to whom some or all of the new Act does not apply during the transition period because of a determination under item 5; or

                     (c)  a person to whom some or all of the new Act applies.

(2)        A person to whom a direction is given under subitem (1) must comply with the direction within the time specified in the direction.

(1)        Items 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 continue to apply (with the modifications mentioned in subitem (2)) to a body corporate at a time after the end of the transition period if:

                     (a)  the body corporate:

                              (i)  is authorised under the old Act to carry on insurance business; or

                             (ii)  is a general insurer under the new Act; and

                     (b)  APRA is satisfied at that time that the body corporate is carrying on insurance business in Australia for the sole purpose of discharging liabilities that arose before the end of the transition period.

(2)        Items 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 continue to apply to the body corporate as if:

                     (a)  a reference in those items to the transition period included a reference to times after the end of the transition period; and
