                             (ii)  did not, at the time of the death, have a marital or couple relationship with the deceased person but was legally married to the deceased person; and

                            (iii)  in the Commissioner’s opinion, was wholly or substantially dependent on the deceased person at the time of the death.

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Salary of Governor-General

                   The annual sum payable out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the salary of the Governor-General shall be $394,000.

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Allowances

             (1)  Subject to subsection (4), where, after the commencement of this Act, a person ceases to hold office as Governor-General, an allowance is payable under this section to him or her during his or her life-time at such rate as is from time to time payable under paragraph (3)(a).

             (2)  Subject to subsection (4) and section 4A, where, after the commencement of this Act, a person who is Governor-General dies, or a person who has at any time after the commencement of this Act held office as Governor-General dies, an allowance is payable under this section to a spouse of the person during the life-time of the spouse at such rate as is from time to time payable under paragraph (3)(b).

             (3)  The rate of the allowance payable to a person under this section at any time is:

                     (a)  in the case of a person who has held office as Governor-General—60% of the rate of the salary payable to the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia at that time; or

                     (b)  in the case of a person who is a spouse of a deceased person who held office as Governor-General—five-eighths of the rate applicable under paragraph (a) at that time to a person who has held office as Governor-General.

             (4)  The amount of the allowance that, but for this subsection, would be payable to a person under this section in respect of any period is reduced by the amount of any pension or retiring allowance payable to that person, whether by virtue of a law or otherwise, in respect of that period out of money provided in whole or in part by the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory.

##### <a id="4A"></a>4A  Allowance payable when there is more than one spouse

             (1)  If a person who held office or had held office as the Governor-General (**_deceased person_**) dies leaving more than one spouse, the Commissioner must allocate any allowance payable to a spouse of the deceased person under this Act among the spouses.

             (2)  Subject to subsection (3), an allowance is only payable to each spouse in accordance with the allocation.

             (3)  In making the allocation, the Commissioner must:

                     (a)  have regard to the respective needs of each of the spouses; and

                     (b)  ensure that the aggregate of the rates of allowance applicable to the spouses will not exceed 100% of the rate of allowance that would have been applicable to the deceased person under paragraph 4(3)(a); and

                     (c)  ensure that the rate of allowance applicable to each spouse will not exceed the rate specified in paragraph 4(3)(b).

##### <a id="4AA"></a>4AA  Benefit payable where Governor-General or surviving spouse dies on or after 1 July 2006

Scope

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a person who is, or has previously been, the Governor-General dies on or after 1 July 2006 without leaving a spouse; or

                     (b)  a person who is, or has previously been, the Governor-General has died leaving a spouse or spouses and:

                              (i)  if there was only one spouse—that spouse dies on or after 1 July 2006; or

                             (ii)  if there was more than one spouse—both or all of the spouses have died and the death of the last surviving spouse occurs on or after 1 July 2006;

and, on the last day on which the person held office as Governor-General, the person was not a qualified employee (within the meaning of the _Superannuation (Productivity Benefit) Act 1988_).

Benefit

             (2)  Subject to subsection (3), there is payable to the personal representative of the person an amount of benefit equal to the sum of the following amounts:

                     (a)  the total of the minimum amounts that the Commonwealth would have had to contribute to a complying superannuation fund or scheme for the benefit of the person in order to avoid having any individual superannuation guarantee shortfalls in respect of the person if it were assumed that:

                              (i)  the person was an employee of the Commonwealth (within the meaning of the _Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992_) in his or her capacity as the Governor-General and had never been an employee of the Commonwealth (within the meaning of that Act) in any other capacity; and

                             (ii)  section 4 of this Act had not been enacted; and

                            (iii)  those contributions were made on a monthly basis;

                     (b)  the interest that would have accrued on the contributions covered by paragraph (a) if it were assumed that interest on those contributions had accrued in accordance with the method set out in a determination made by the Minister under subsection (6).

Personal representatives

             (3)  The amount of benefit payable to the personal representative of the person under subsection (2) is to be reduced by the sum of the amounts of the allowances (if any) that were paid to the person or any spouse of the person under section 4.

             (4)  If an amount of benefit is payable under subsection (2) to the personal representative of the person and no personal representative can be found, the amount is to be paid to any individual or individuals that the Minister determines.

Appropriation

             (5)  A benefit under subsection (2) is payable out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which is appropriated accordingly.

Interest method determination

             (6)  The Minister must, by writing, determine a method for the purposes of paragraph (2)(b).

             (7)  A method determined under subsection (6) may provide for different interest rates for different periods.

             (8)  A method determined under subsection (6) may be expressed to relate to a period that began before the determination was made.

             (9)  A determination under subsection (6) may be varied, but not revoked, in accordance with subsection 33(3) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

           (10)  Subsection (9) does not limit the application of subsection 33(3) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ to other instruments under this Act.

           (11)  A determination under subsection (6) is a legislative instrument for the purposes of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_.
