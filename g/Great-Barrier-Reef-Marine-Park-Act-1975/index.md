                     (b)  the ship would not pose a threat to the environment because it is likely to remain:

                              (i)  stationary; or

                             (ii)  in a limited area;

                            within the compulsory pilotage area.

                     (a)  under subsection 39FA(6), 39FB(3), section 61AJA or subsection 61B(5) or (5A), a court orders a person to pay an amount; and

                     (b)  the court:

                              (i)  does not have civil jurisdiction; or

                             (ii)  has civil jurisdiction, but does not have civil jurisdiction to the extent of the amount;

a proper officer of the court shall issue to the Minister or the Authority, as the case requires, a certificate in the prescribed form containing the prescribed particulars.

             (3)  The certificate may, in a prescribed manner and subject to the prescribed conditions (if any), be registered in a court having civil jurisdiction to the extent of the amount ordered to be paid to the Commonwealth or the Authority, as the case requires.

             (4)  Upon registration under subsection (3), the certificate is enforceable in all respects as a final judgment of the court in favour of the Commonwealth or the Authority, as the case requires.

          (2A)  Without limiting subsection (1), the regulations may prescribe measures for the management of the discharge of sewage from vessels in the Marine Park.

             (3)  Without limiting the generality of subsection (1) or (2), the regulations may be expressed to apply to or in relation to:

                     (a)  the Marine Park;

                     (b)  a specified part of the Marine Park in respect of which no zoning plan is in force;

                     (c)  a specified zone; or

                     (d)  a specified part of a zone.

             (4)  A regulation is taken not to be inconsistent with a zoning plan merely because it:

                     (a)  further regulates an activity that is allowed or permitted by the zoning plan; or

                     (b)  prohibits an activity that is otherwise allowed or permitted by the zoning plan.

          (4A)  Nothing in subsection (4) allows a regulation to allow or permit an activity that is otherwise prohibited by the zoning plan concerned.

             (5)  Regulations shall not apply to an area within the Marine Park in respect of which no zoning plan is in force if more than 5 years has elapsed since that area became part of the Marine Park.

             (6)  Subject to subsections (7) and (8) and to any contrary intention appearing in a law made after the commencement of this Act, a provision of the regulations has full force and effect notwithstanding that it is inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth made before or after the commencement of this Act.

             (7)  A provision of the regulations regulating navigation in the Marine Park does not have any force or effect to the extent to which it is inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth, but such a provision shall not be taken for the purposes of this subsection to be inconsistent with such a law if it can be complied with without contravention of that law.

             (8)  A provision of the regulations regulating the flying of aircraft over the Marine Park does not have any force or effect to the extent to which it is inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth, but such a provision shall not be taken for the purposes of this subsection to be inconsistent with such a law if it can be complied with without contravention of that law.

             (9)  The power to make regulations conferred by this Act may be exercised:

                     (a)  in relation to all cases to which the power extends, or in relation to all those cases subject to specified exceptions, or in relation to any specified cases or classes of case; and

                     (b)  so as to make, as respects the cases in relation to which it is exercised, the same provision for all those cases or different provision for different cases or classes of case.

           (10)  The power to make regulations conferred by this Act shall not be taken not to include the power to make provision for or in relation to a matter by reason only of the fact that:

                     (a)  a provision is made by this Act in relation to that matter or another matter; or

                     (b)  power is expressly conferred by this Act to make provision by regulation for or in relation to another matter.

           (11)  The regulations may prescribe penalties not exceeding a fine of 50 penalty units for offences against the regulations.

Note:          If a body corporate is convicted of an offence, subsection 4B(3) of the _Crimes Act 1914_ allows a court to impose a fine of an amount that is not greater than 5 times the maximum fine that could be imposed by a court on an individual convicted of the same offence.

           (12)  The limitation imposed by subsection (10) on the penalties that may be prescribed by the regulations does not prevent the regulations from requiring a person to make a statutory declaration.

           (13)  Despite subsection 14(2) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_, the regulations may make provision in relation to a matter by applying, adopting or incorporating any matter contained in an instrument or other writing as in force or existing from time to time.
