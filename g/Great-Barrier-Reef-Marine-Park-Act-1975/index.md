the person is guilty of an offence punishable on conviction by a fine of not more than 200 penalty units.

             (2)  In subsection (1):

                    <a name="respons-person"></a>**_responsible person_**, in relation to a vessel or aircraft, means:

Note:          If a body corporate is convicted of an offence, subsection 4B(3) of the _Crimes Act 1914_ allows a court to impose a fine of an amount that is not greater than 5 times the maximum fine that could be imposed by a court on an individual convicted of the same offence.

##### <a id="38L"></a>38L  Offences involving the discharge of waste from a vessel, aircraft or platform

the responsible person is guilty of an indictable offence punishable on conviction by a fine of not more than 2,000 penalty units.

                     (a)  the court is satisfied that it is proper to do so; and

                     (b)  the defendant and the prosecutor consent.

             (3)  If, under subsection (2), a court of summary jurisdiction convicts a person of an offence against subsection (1), the maximum fine that the court may impose is one-tenth of the maximum fine that could have been imposed had the offence been tried on indictment.

          (3B)  Regulations made for the purposes of subsection (3A) may provide a maximum penalty for an offence against the regulations not exceeding the maximum penalty for an offence against subsection (1), but nothing in this subsection enables the regulations to provide penalties of imprisonment.

                              (i)  stationary; or

                             (ii)  in a limited area;

                            within the compulsory pilotage area.

             (4)  Without limiting the considerations the Minister may take into account in deciding whether or not to grant an exemption under paragraph (3)(b), the Minister must consider:

                     (d)  a specified part of a zone.

             (4)  A regulation is taken not to be inconsistent with a zoning plan merely because it:

             (6)  Subject to subsections (7) and (8) and to any contrary intention appearing in a law made after the commencement of this Act, a provision of the regulations has full force and effect notwithstanding that it is inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth made before or after the commencement of this Act.

             (7)  A provision of the regulations regulating navigation in the Marine Park does not have any force or effect to the extent to which it is inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth, but such a provision shall not be taken for the purposes of this subsection to be inconsistent with such a law if it can be complied with without contravention of that law.

             (8)  A provision of the regulations regulating the flying of aircraft over the Marine Park does not have any force or effect to the extent to which it is inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth, but such a provision shall not be taken for the purposes of this subsection to be inconsistent with such a law if it can be complied with without contravention of that law.

             (9)  The power to make regulations conferred by this Act may be exercised:

                     (a)  in relation to all cases to which the power extends, or in relation to all those cases subject to specified exceptions, or in relation to any specified cases or classes of case; and

                     (b)  so as to make, as respects the cases in relation to which it is exercised, the same provision for all those cases or different provision for different cases or classes of case.

           (10)  The power to make regulations conferred by this Act shall not be taken not to include the power to make provision for or in relation to a matter by reason only of the fact that:

                     (a)  a provision is made by this Act in relation to that matter or another matter; or

                     (b)  power is expressly conferred by this Act to make provision by regulation for or in relation to another matter.

           (11)  The regulations may prescribe penalties not exceeding a fine of 50 penalty units for offences against the regulations.

Note:          If a body corporate is convicted of an offence, subsection 4B(3) of the _Crimes Act 1914_ allows a court to impose a fine of an amount that is not greater than 5 times the maximum fine that could be imposed by a court on an individual convicted of the same offence.

           (12)  The limitation imposed by subsection (10) on the penalties that may be prescribed by the regulations does not prevent the regulations from requiring a person to make a statutory declaration.
