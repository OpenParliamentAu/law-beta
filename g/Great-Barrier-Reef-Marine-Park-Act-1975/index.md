                              (i)  does not have civil jurisdiction; or

                             (ii)  has civil jurisdiction, but does not have civil jurisdiction to the extent of the amount;

a proper officer of the court shall issue to the Minister or the Authority, as the case requires, a certificate in the prescribed form containing the prescribed particulars.

             (3)  The certificate may, in a prescribed manner and subject to the prescribed conditions (if any), be registered in a court having civil jurisdiction to the extent of the amount ordered to be paid to the Commonwealth or the Authority, as the case requires.

                     (b)  the place where an animal, plant, aircraft, vessel or article referred to in the information or complaint is alleged to have been at the time of the alleged offence was in the Marine Park or in a specified zone;

is _prima facie_ evidence of the matter averred.

##### <a id="63"></a>63  Jurisdiction of courts

             (1)  A provision of the _Judiciary Act 1903_ by which a court of a State is invested with jurisdiction with respect to offences against the laws of the Commonwealth has effect, in relation to offences against this Act, as if that jurisdiction were so invested without limitation as to locality.

             (2)  Subject to section 80 of the Constitution, where a person has committed an offence against this Act outside a Territory and is found in, or brought into, the Territory, a court of the Territory has the same jurisdiction in respect of the offence as it would have if the offence had been committed in the Territory.

             (3)  The trial on indictment of an offence against this Act not committed within a State may be held by a court of competent jurisdiction at any place where the court may sit.

##### <a id="64"></a>64  Conduct of directors, servants and agents

             (1)  Where it is necessary, for the purposes of this Act, to establish the state of mind of a body corporate in respect of conduct engaged in, or deemed by subsection (2) to have been engaged in, by the body corporate, it is sufficient to show that a director, servant or agent of the body corporate, being a director, servant or agent by whom the conduct was engaged in within the scope of his or her actual or apparent authority, had that state of mind.

             (2)  Any conduct engaged in on behalf of a body corporate:

                     (a)  by a director, servant or agent of the body corporate within the scope of his or her actual or apparent authority; or

                     (b)  by any other person at the direction or with the consent or agreement (whether express or implied) of a director, servant or agent of the body corporate, where the giving of the direction, consent or agreement is within the scope of the actual or apparent authority of the director, servant or agent;

shall be deemed, for the purposes of this Act, to have been engaged in by the body corporate unless the body corporate establishes that the body corporate took reasonable precautions and exercised due diligence to avoid the conduct.

             (3)  Where it is necessary, for the purposes of this Act, to establish the state of mind of a person in relation to conduct deemed by subsection (4) to have been engaged in by the person, it is sufficient to show that a servant or agent of the person, being a servant or agent by whom the conduct was engaged in within the scope of his or her actual or apparent authority, had that state of mind.

             (4)  Conduct engaged in on behalf of a person other than a body corporate:

                     (a)  by a servant or agent of the person within the scope of his or her actual or apparent authority; or

                     (b)  by any other person at the direction or with the consent or agreement (whether express or implied) of a servant or agent of the first-mentioned person, where the giving of the direction, consent or agreement is within the scope of the actual or apparent authority of the servant or agent;

shall be deemed, for the purposes of this Act, to have been engaged in by the first-mentioned person unless the first-mentioned person establishes that the first-mentioned person took reasonable precautions and exercised due diligence to avoid the conduct.

             (5)  A reference in this section to the state of mind of person includes a reference to the knowledge, intention, opinion, belief or purpose of the person and the reasons for the intention, opinion, belief or purpose.

             (6)  A reference in this section to a director of a body corporate includes a reference to a constituent member of a body corporate incorporated for a public purpose by a law of the Commonwealth, of a State or of a Territory.

             (7)  A reference in this section to engaging in conduct includes a reference to failing or refusing to engage in conduct.

             (8)  Part 2.5 of the _Criminal Code_ does not apply to an offence against this Act.

Note:          Part 2.5 of the _Criminal Code_ deals with corporate criminal responsibility.

##### <a id="65"></a>65  Act to apply subject to international obligations

             (1)  Subject to this section, this Act applies, according to its tenor, to all persons, including foreigners, and to all vessels and aircraft, including foreign vessels and aircraft, whether or not they are within the limits of Australia and the Australian coastal sea.

             (2)  This Act has effect subject to the obligations of Australia under international law, including obligations under any agreement between Australia and another country or countries.

##### <a id="66"></a>66  Regulations

             (1)  The Governor-General may make regulations, not inconsistent with this Act or with a zoning plan, prescribing all matters required or permitted by this Act to be prescribed or necessary or convenient to be prescribed for carrying out or giving effect to this Act.

             (2)  Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), regulations may be made:

                             (a)  the mooring of vessels;

                             (b)  the landing of aircraft; or

                             (c)  the use of vessels;

                            in the Marine Park;

                    (m)  providing for the removal of vessels from places in the Marine Park where they have been left in contravention of this Act or have been abandoned and for the impounding of such vessels;

                     (n)  enabling a person who is alleged to have contravened a provision of the regulations to pay to the Authority, as an alternative to prosecution, a stated penalty that is not more than one-fifth of the maximum penalty by which a contravention of that provision is otherwise punishable;

                     (o)  regulating the use of vessels in, and the passage of vessels through, the Marine Park and the landing and use of aircraft in, and the flying of aircraft over, the Marine Park;

                     (p)  regulating or prohibiting the taking of animals or plants into, or out of, the Marine Park;

                     (v)  providing for any matter incidental to or connected with any of the foregoing.

             (3)  Without limiting the generality of subsection (1) or (2), the regulations may be expressed to apply to or in relation to:

                     (a)  the Marine Park;

                     (b)  a specified part of the Marine Park in respect of which no zoning plan is in force;

                     (c)  a specified zone; or

                     (d)  a specified part of a zone.

             (4)  A regulation is taken not to be inconsistent with a zoning plan merely because it:

                     (a)  further regulates an activity that is allowed or permitted by the zoning plan; or

                     (b)  prohibits an activity that is otherwise allowed or permitted by the zoning plan.

          (4A)  Nothing in subsection (4) allows a regulation to allow or permit an activity that is otherwise prohibited by the zoning plan concerned.

             (5)  Regulations shall not apply to an area within the Marine Park in respect of which no zoning plan is in force if more than 5 years has elapsed since that area became part of the Marine Park.

             (6)  Subject to subsections (7) and (8) and to any contrary intention appearing in a law made after the commencement of this Act, a provision of the regulations has full force and effect notwithstanding that it is inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth made before or after the commencement of this Act.

             (7)  A provision of the regulations regulating navigation in the Marine Park does not have any force or effect to the extent to which it is inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth, but such a provision shall not be taken for the purposes of this subsection to be inconsistent with such a law if it can be complied with without contravention of that law.

             (8)  A provision of the regulations regulating the flying of aircraft over the Marine Park does not have any force or effect to the extent to which it is inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth, but such a provision shall not be taken for the purposes of this subsection to be inconsistent with such a law if it can be complied with without contravention of that law.

             (9)  The power to make regulations conferred by this Act may be exercised:

                     (a)  in relation to all cases to which the power extends, or in relation to all those cases subject to specified exceptions, or in relation to any specified cases or classes of case; and

                     (b)  so as to make, as respects the cases in relation to which it is exercised, the same provision for all those cases or different provision for different cases or classes of case.

           (10)  The power to make regulations conferred by this Act shall not be taken not to include the power to make provision for or in relation to a matter by reason only of the fact that:

                     (a)  a provision is made by this Act in relation to that matter or another matter; or

                     (b)  power is expressly conferred by this Act to make provision by regulation for or in relation to another matter.

           (11)  The regulations may prescribe penalties not exceeding a fine of 50 penalty units for offences against the regulations.

Note:          If a body corporate is convicted of an offence, subsection 4B(3) of the _Crimes Act 1914_ allows a court to impose a fine of an amount that is not greater than 5 times the maximum fine that could be imposed by a court on an individual convicted of the same offence.

           (12)  The limitation imposed by subsection (10) on the penalties that may be prescribed by the regulations does not prevent the regulations from requiring a person to make a statutory declaration.

# Schedule 1

_Section 3_

                     (a)  commences at the point that, at low water, is the northernmost extremity of Cape York Peninsula Queensland;
