Note 1:       See also section 25B of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

Note 2:       Subject to section 6 of this Act, the _Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997_ applies to CSC. That Act deals with matters relating to Commonwealth authorities, including reporting and accountability, banking and investment, and the conduct of officers.

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Modification of the _Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997_

             (1)  Despite section 5 of this Act:

                     (a)  section 15 of the _Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997_; and

                     (b)  any other provision of that Act prescribed by the regulations;

do not apply in relation to CSC’s management and investment of money that forms part of a superannuation fund administered by CSC.

             (2)  If, at any time, CSC does not hold money on its own account, then, despite section 7 of the _Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997_, CSC is treated as if it were a Commonwealth authority for the purposes of that Act.

             (1)  CSC:

                     (a)  must have a seal; and

                     (c)  may sue and be sued in its corporate name.

             (2)  The seal of CSC is to be kept in such custody as the Board directs and must not be used except as authorised by the Board.

             (3)  All courts, judges and persons acting judicially must:

                     (a)  take judicial notice of the imprint of the seal of CSC appearing on a document; and

                     (c)  to do anything incidental to, or conducive to, the performance of the above functions.

             (2)  To avoid doubt, when performing a function under an Act administered by CSC, CSC is performing the function under the relevant Act and not this Act.

             (3)  When performing a function under:

                     (a)  a determination made under Part IIIAA of the _Defence Act 1903_; or

                     (b)  the _Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973_; or

                     (c)  the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948_; or
