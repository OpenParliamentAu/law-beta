	(1)	The objectives of this Act, which are to be pursued on both a national basis and a regional basis, are:

	(a)	to promote a better financial, technical and management performance from the farm sector; and
	(b)	to provide support, either directly or indirectly, to farmers who have prospects of sustainable long‑term profitability with a view to improving the productivity of their farm units; and
	(c)	in the case of direct support to farmers—to provide that support in a way that ensures that the farmers who are supported become financially independent of that support within a reasonable period; and
	(d)	to provide that support through, but not limited to:
	(i)	grants for the purposes of subsidies for interest payable on, and associated costs of, loans, whether the loans are provided by a State or by another person; and
	(ii)	grants for the purposes of farm training, planning, appraisal, support services and rural adjustment research; and
	(e)	to support farmers who do not have prospects of sustainable long‑term profitability to leave the farm sector; and
	(f)	to enable grants of money to be made to persons other than farmers for purposes relating to rural adjustment; and
