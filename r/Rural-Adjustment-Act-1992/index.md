## An Act relating to rural adjustment

## Part 1—Preliminary

##### <a id="1"></a>1  Short title [_see_ Note 1]

                   This Act may be cited as the _Rural Adjustment Act 1992_.

##### <a id="2"></a>2  Commencement

                   This Act commences on 1 January 1993.

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Objectives of this Act

             (1)  The objectives of this Act, which are to be pursued on both a national basis and a regional basis, are:

                     (a)  to foster the development of a more profitable farm sector that is able to operate competitively in a deregulated financial and market environment; and

                     (b)  to improve the competitiveness of the farm sector in a sustainable manner.

             (2)  In order to achieve those objectives, this Act is intended:

                     (a)  to promote a better financial, technical and management performance from the farm sector; and

                     (b)  to provide support, either directly or indirectly, to farmers who have prospects of sustainable long‑term profitability with a view to improving the productivity of their farm units; and

                     (c)  in the case of direct support to farmers—to provide that support in a way that ensures that the farmers who are supported become financially independent of that support within a reasonable period; and

                     (d)  to provide that support through, but not limited to:

                              (i)  grants for the purposes of subsidies for interest payable on, and associated costs of, loans, whether the loans are provided by a State or by another person; and

                             (ii)  grants for the purposes of farm training, planning, appraisal, support services and rural adjustment research; and

                     (e)  to support farmers who do not have prospects of sustainable long‑term profitability to leave the farm sector; and

                      (f)  to enable grants of money to be made to persons other than farmers for purposes relating to rural adjustment; and

                     (g)  to enable loans of money (whether secured or unsecured) to be made to farmers or other persons for purposes relating to rural adjustment.
