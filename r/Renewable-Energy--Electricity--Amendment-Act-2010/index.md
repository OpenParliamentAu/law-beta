##### <a id="30K"></a>30K  Application for certificate to be entered into the clearing house

             (1)  A person who:

                     (a)  is the registered owner of a small‑scale technology certificate; or

                     (b)  has both:

                              (i)  created a small‑scale technology certificate; and

                             (ii)  advised the Regulator of the creation of the certificate under subsection 26(2);

may apply to the Regulator for the certificate to be entered into the clearing house.

             (2)  The application must:

                     (a)  be in writing; and

                     (b)  be in a form approved, in writing, by the Regulator; and

                     (c)  be accompanied by any information required by the regulations; and

                     (d)  be accompanied by any documents required by the regulations.

##### <a id="30L"></a>30L  Regulator to enter certificate into the clearing house

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  an application is made in accordance with section 30K in relation to a small‑scale technology certificate; and

                     (b)  the certificate is or becomes registered in the register of small‑scale technology certificates;

the Regulator must enter the certificate into the clearing house by including the certificate on the clearing house transfer list in accordance with the regulations.

             (2)  The **_clearing house transfer list_** is a list, maintained by the Regulator in accordance with the regulations, of the certificates that are available for transfer through the clearing house. The list must be maintained so that:

                     (a)  subject to paragraph (b), certificates are included on the list in the order in which applications relating to the certificates are received (with the certificates to which the most recent applications relate at the bottom of the list); and

                     (b)  if a certificate to which an application relates does not become registered until after the application was received, paragraph (a) applies as if the application was received when the certificate was registered; and

                     (c)  a certificate must be removed from the list if:

                              (i)  the certificate is withdrawn from the clearing house; or

                             (ii)  the certificate is transferred under section 30N; or

                            (iii)  the certificate is cancelled under section 30P.

Note:          Regulations under section 30U may allow the Regulator to remove certificates from the list in other circumstances.

             (3)  If the Regulator includes a certificate on the clearing house transfer list, the Regulator must:

                     (a)  alter the register of small‑scale technology certificates to show that the certificate is in the clearing house; and

                     (b)  take such other steps as are prescribed by the regulations.

             (4)  While a certificate is on the clearing house transfer list, the certificate may still be transferred by its registered owner to another person otherwise than under this Part. Despite that transfer, the certificate will remain on the clearing house transfer list, and may be dealt with under this Part, unless the new registered owner withdraws the certificate from the clearing house.

Note:          See also sections 27 (certificates may be transferred) and 28 (Regulator to be notified of transfer).

             (5)  The clearing house transfer list is not a legislative instrument.

##### <a id="34A"></a>34A  Overview of Part

* * *

This Part deals with liability to renewable energy shortfall charge.

Subdivision A of Division 1 defines who is a liable entity.

There are 2 types of renewable energy shortfall charge:

               (a)     large‑scale generation shortfall charge (see Subdivision B of Division 1), which is calculated by reference to a liable entity’s relevant acquisitions of electricity, its partial exemptions, the number of large‑scale generation certificates it surrenders and the renewable energy power percentage; and

              (b)     small‑scale technology shortfall charge (see Subdivision C of Division 1), which is calculated by reference to a liable entity’s relevant acquisitions of electricity, its partial exemptions, the number of small‑scale technology certificates it surrenders and the small‑scale technology percentage.

Division 1A deals with the determination of the amount (if any) of a liable entity’s partial exemption from charge.

Division 2 deals with the renewable power percentage for large‑scale generation shortfall charge.

Division 2A deals with the small‑scale technology percentage for small‑scale technology charge.

#### Subdivision B—Large‑scale generation shortfall charge

##### <a id="36"></a>36  Large‑scale generation shortfall charge payable by liable entity

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), if a liable entity has a large‑scale generation shortfall for a year, **_large‑scale generation shortfall charge_** is payable in respect of the shortfall.

             (2)  No large‑scale generation shortfall charge is payable by a liable entity for a year if its large‑scale generation shortfall for the year is less than 10% of the liable entity’s required large‑scale renewable energy for the year. However, the large‑scale generation shortfall becomes a **_carried forward shortfall_** for the year.

             (3)  Large‑scale generation shortfall charge imposed in respect of a liable entity’s large‑scale generation shortfall for a year is payable by the liable entity.

Note:          Large‑scale generation shortfall charge is imposed by the _Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Large‑scale Generation Shortfall Charge) Act 2000_.

##### <a id="37"></a>37  Amount of charge

                   The amount of large‑scale generation shortfall charge payable by a liable entity is worked out using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00857/Html/ca94cb0d-3e4c-429a-b1ed-fd5e0904ba72_files/image002.gif)

where:

                    <a name="rate-charg"></a>**_rate of charge_** is the rate of charge as specified in section 6 of the _Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Large‑scale Generation Shortfall Charge) Act 2000_.

##### <a id="38"></a>38  Determination of large‑scale generation shortfall

                   The following method statement shows how to work out a liable entity’s **_large‑scale generation shortfall_** for a year:

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.   Work out the total amount, in MWh, of electricity acquired by the liable entity during the year under relevant acquisitions.

Step 2.   Subtract from the total electricity acquired the amount of the liable entity’s partial exemption for the year.

Step 3.   Multiply the result of step 2 by the renewable power percentage for the year and round the result to the nearest MWh (rounding 0.5 upwards). Add to the result any carried forward shortfall from the previous year or subtract any carried forward surplus for the previous year. The result is the liable entity’s **_required large‑scale renewable energy_** for the year.

Step 4.   Subtract the total value, in MWh, of large‑scale generation certificates surrendered for that year, under Subdivision A of Division 1 of Part 5, by the liable entity from the required large‑scale renewable energy for the year.

Result: If the result is greater than zero, the liable entity has a large‑scale generation shortfall for the year equal to the result.

              If the result is zero, the liable entity does not have a large‑scale generation shortfall for the year.

              If the result is less than zero, the liable entity has a **_carried forward surplus_** for the year equal to the result (expressed as a positive).

* * *

#### Subdivision C—Small‑scale technology shortfall charge

##### <a id="38AA"></a>38AA  Interpretive provisions relating to liability for small‑scale technology shortfall charge etc.

             (1)  This section defines expressions that are used in provisions that deal with the determination of a liable entity’s liability to small‑scale technology shortfall charge for a year (the **_assessment year_**), and related matters.

Assessment year’s reduced acquisitions

             (2)  The **_assessment year’s reduced acquisitions_** is the amount worked out by subtracting the amount of the liable entity’s partial exemption (if any) for the assessment year from the total amount, in MWh, of electricity acquired during the assessment year by the liable entity under relevant acquisitions.

Previous year’s reduced acquisitions

             (3)  The **_previous year’s reduced acquisitions_** is the amount worked out by subtracting the amount of the liable entity’s partial exemption (if any) for the previous year from the amount, in MWh, of electricity acquired by the liable entity during the previous year under relevant acquisitions.

             (4)  For the purpose of subsection (3):

                     (a)  the amount, in MWh, of electricity acquired during the previous year by the liable entity under relevant acquisitions is taken to be the amount stated as having been so acquired in the liable entity’s energy acquisition statement for the previous year (taking account of any amendments to that statement that were made before 1 April in the assessment year); and

                     (b)  the amount of the liable entity’s partial exemption for the previous year is taken to be the total amount of partial exemption claimed in the liable entity’s energy acquisition statement for the previous year (taking account of any amendments to that statement that were made before 1 April in the assessment year); and

                     (c)  if, for any reason, the liable entity has not lodged an energy acquisition statement for the previous year before 1 April in the assessment year, the liable entity is taken not to have any previous year’s reduced acquisitions.

Note:          If paragraph (4)(c) applies, the liable entity may make an application under section 38AG to have an amount apply as if it were the previous year’s reduced acquisitions. If the entity does not do so, the default rule in section 38AH will apply.

The quarters of a year

             (5)  Each year consists of **_quarters_** as follows:

                     (a)  January, February and March in the year (the **_first quarter_**);

                     (b)  April, May and June in the year (the **_second quarter_**);

                     (c)  July, August and September in the year (the **_third quarter_**);

                     (d)  October, November and December in the year (the **_fourth quarter_**).

The surrender period for a quarter

             (6)  The **_surrender period_** for a quarter of a year is as follows (inclusive of the specified dates):

                     (a)  for the first quarter—the period from 15 February to 28 April in the year;

                     (b)  for the second quarter—the period from 29 April to 28 July in the year;

                     (c)  for the third quarter—the period from 29 July to 28 October in the year;

                     (d)  for the fourth quarter—the period from 29 October in the year to the time by which the liable entity is required to lodge an energy acquisition statement for the year.

Note:          The period described in paragraph (6)(d) will end on 14 February in the next year, unless the Regulator allows a later day under paragraph 44(1)(b).

             (7)  Section 36 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ does not affect the time when the surrender period for the first, second or third quarter of a year ends.

##### <a id="38AB"></a>38AB  Small‑scale technology shortfall charge payable by liable entity

             (1)  If a liable entity has a small‑scale technology shortfall for a year, **_small‑scale technology shortfall charge_** is payable in respect of the shortfall.

             (2)  Small‑scale technology shortfall charge imposed in respect of a liable entity’s small‑scale technology shortfall for a year is payable by the liable entity.

Note:          Small‑scale technology shortfall charge is imposed by the _Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Small‑scale Technology Shortfall Charge) Act 2010_.

Add:

Adjustment of targets according to number of valid certificates as at the end of 2010

          (1A)  If, as at the end of the year 2010, the total value, in GWh, of valid renewable energy certificates exceeds 34,500, the table in subsection (1) has effect in accordance with the following paragraphs:

                     (a)  the number of GWh specified in the table for each of the following years is taken to be increased by half of the excess:

                              (i)  the year 2012;

                             (ii)  the year 2013;

                     (b)  the number of GWh specified in the table for each of the following years is taken to be reduced by one quarter of the excess:

                              (i)  the year 2016;

                             (ii)  the year 2017;

                            (iii)  the year 2018;

                            (iv)  the year 2019.

          (1B)  As soon as practicable after the end of the year 2010, the Regulator must publish on its website the total value referred to in subsection (1A).

Adjustment of targets if there is a WCMG start day

             (2)  If the regulations prescribe a day (the **_WCMG start day_**) for the purpose of subparagraph 17A(1)(a)(i), the table in subsection (1) has effect (after first taking account of subsection (1A)) in accordance with subsections (3) and (4).

             (3)  The number of GWh specified in the table for the year that includes the WCMG start day is taken to be increased by the amount worked out using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00857/Html/ca94cb0d-3e4c-429a-b1ed-fd5e0904ba72_files/image005.gif)

where:

                    <a name="remain-dai-year"></a>**_remaining days in the year_** means the number of days in the year after the WCMG start day.

             (4)  The number of GWh specified in the table in subsection (1) for each later year, other than any year after 2020, is taken to be increased by 850 GWh.

             (5)  If, for the year in which the WCMG start day occurs, regulations were made before that day specifying the renewable power percentage for the year, the validity of those regulations is not affected by the fact that the required GWh of renewable source electricity for the year changed, because of subsection (3), after the regulations were made.

                            (iii)  whether the body corporate had a corporate culture conducive to compliance; and

                     (g)  if the contravention is of  subsection 24A(1)—whether the person has surrendered any renewable energy certificates under section 28A to compensate for the contravention.

Civil enforcement of penalty

             (8)  A pecuniary penalty is a civil debt payable to the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth may enforce the civil penalty order as if it were an order made in civil proceedings against the person to recover a debt due by the person. The debt arising from the order is taken to be a judgment debt.

##### <a id="154C"></a>154C  Who may apply for a civil penalty order

             (1)  Only the Regulator may apply for a civil penalty order.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not exclude the operation of the _Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983_.

##### <a id="154F"></a>154F  Civil evidence and procedure rules for civil penalty orders

                   The Court must apply the rules of evidence and procedure for civil matters when hearing proceedings for a civil penalty order.

##### <a id="154G"></a>154G  Civil proceedings after criminal proceedings

                   The Court must not make a civil penalty order against a person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision if the person has been convicted of an offence constituted by conduct that is substantially the same as the conduct constituting the contravention.

##### <a id="154H"></a>154H  Criminal proceedings during civil proceedings

             (1)  Proceedings for a civil penalty order against a person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision are stayed if:

                     (a)  criminal proceedings are started or have already been started against the person for an offence; and

                     (b)  the offence is constituted by conduct that is substantially the same as the conduct alleged to  constitute the contravention.

             (2)  The proceedings for the order may be resumed if the person is not convicted of the offence. Otherwise, the proceedings for the order are dismissed.

##### <a id="154J"></a>154J  Criminal proceedings after civil proceedings

                   Criminal proceedings may be started against a person for conduct that is substantially the same as conduct constituting a contravention of a civil penalty provision regardless of whether a civil penalty order has been made against the person.

##### <a id="154K"></a>154K  Evidence given in proceedings for a civil penalty order not admissible in criminal proceedings

                   Evidence of information given, or evidence of production of documents, by an individual is not admissible in criminal proceedings against the individual if:

                     (a)  the individual previously gave the evidence or produced the documents in proceedings for a civil penalty order against the individual for a contravention of a civil penalty provision (whether or not the order was made); and

                     (b)  the conduct alleged to constitute the offence is substantially the same as the conduct that was claimed to constitute the contravention.

However, this does not apply to a criminal proceeding in respect of the falsity of the evidence given by the individual in the proceedings for the civil penalty order.

##### <a id="154L"></a>154L  Mistake of fact

             (1)  A person is not liable to have a civil penalty order made against the person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision if:

                     (a)  at or before the time of the conduct constituting the contravention, the person:

                              (i)  considered whether or not facts existed; and

                             (ii)  was under a mistaken but reasonable belief about those facts; and

                     (b)  had those facts existed, the conduct would not have constituted a contravention of the civil penalty provision.

             (2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), a person may be regarded as having considered whether or not facts existed if:

                     (a)  the person had considered, on a previous occasion, whether those facts existed in the circumstances surrounding that occasion; and

                     (b)  the person honestly and reasonably believed that the circumstances surrounding the present occasion were the same, or substantially the same, as those surrounding the previous occasion.

             (3)  A person who wishes to rely on subsection (1) or (2) in proceedings for a civil penalty order bears an evidential burden in relation to that matter.

                     (b)  such a high risk that the contravention would occur;

that the conduct merits the imposition of a pecuniary penalty.

Civil penalty provision

             (4)  Subsection (1) is a **_civil penalty provision_**.

Note:          Division 1 provides for pecuniary penalties for breaches of civil penalty provisions.

##### <a id="154P"></a>154P  Reasonable steps to prevent contravention
