                     (b)  it is an offence to fail to vote at a referendum without a valid and sufficient reason for the failure; and

                     (c)  if the elector does not wish to have the apparent failure to vote dealt with by a court, the elector may, within the prescribed time:

             (8)  If, within the prescribed time:

                     (a)  an elector responds to a penalty notice in the manner indicated in subparagraph (5)(c)(i) or (ii) and the DRO to whom the response has been given is satisfied:

                              (i)  in the case of a response of the kind referred to in subparagraph (5)(c)(i)—that the elector did vote as required by this Act; or

                             (ii)  in the case of a response of the kind referred to in subparagraph (5)(c)(ii)—that the reason for the failure to vote is a valid and sufficient reason; or

                     (b)  in the case of a response of the kind referred to in subparagraph (5)(c)(ii)—that the reason for the failure to vote is a valid and sufficient reason;

the DRO must send by post or deliver to the elector, at his or her latest known address, a notice in an approved form, notifying the elector that:

                     (c)  the DRO is not so satisfied; and

                     (d)  if the elector does not wish to have the apparent failure to vote without a valid and sufficient reason for such failure dealt with by a court, he or she may, within the prescribed time, pay to the DRO a penalty of $20.

           (10)  If, in response to a notice under subsection (9), the penalty of $20 is paid to the DRO within the prescribed time, proceedings against the elector for a contravention of subsection (14) are prohibited.

           (11)  If an elector is unable, by reason of absence from his or her place of living or physical incapacity, to respond to a penalty notice or to a notice under subsection (9) within the prescribed time, any other elector who has a personal knowledge of the facts may, subject to the regulations, respond to the notice within that time, and such response is to be treated as compliance by the first-mentioned elector with the notice.

           (12)  The DRO must prepare a list of all electors to whom a penalty notice has been sent or delivered and note on that list in relation to each elector:

                     (a)  whether there has been a response to the notice; and

                     (b)  if there has been a response:

                              (i)  whether the DRO is satisfied that the elector did in fact vote or that there was a valid and sufficient reason for the elector’s failure to vote; or

                             (ii)  whether the penalty has been paid.

           (13)  The DRO must note on the list prepared under subsection (12) in relation to each elector to whom a notice under subsection (9) has been sent or delivered:

                     (a)  the fact that a notice has been sent or delivered under subsection (9); and

                     (b)  whether there has been a response to the notice; and

                     (c)  if there has been a response—whether the penalty has been paid.

        (13A)  Without limiting the circumstances that may constitute a valid and sufficient reason for not voting, the fact that an elector believes it to be part of his or her religious duty to abstain from voting constitutes a valid and sufficient reason for the failure of the elector to vote.

           (14)  An elector is guilty of an offence if the elector fails to vote at a referendum.

                    Penalty:  $50.

        (14A)  Strict liability applies to an offence against subsection (14).

Note:          For **_strict liability_**, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

             (2)  The regulations must provide that a person may vote by an electronically assisted voting method at the referendum referred to in subsection (1) only if the referendum is held on the same day as an election at which sight-impaired people are able to vote by an electronically assisted voting method under regulations that have effect for the purposes of Division 1 of Part XVB of the _Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918_.

             (3)  Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), the regulations may:

Note:          Pre-poll votes are a kind of declaration vote. This Act will therefore apply to votes cast using the electronically assisted voting method as if they were that kind of declaration vote.

             (2)  For the purposes of this Act as it applies because of subsection (1):

                     (a)  a vote record is to be treated as if it were a pre-poll vote ballot-paper; and

             (4)  The regulations may make additional provisions relating to how this Act applies in relation to votes cast using the electronically assisted voting method.

# Schedule 3—Grounds of application for postal or pre-poll vote

_Sections 54 and 72_

       1.     Throughout the hours of voting on voting day, the elector will be absent from the State or Territory for which the elector is enrolled.

       2.     The elector will not, at any time during the hours of voting on voting day, be within 8 kilometres by the nearest practicable route of any polling booth in the State or Territory for which the elector is enrolled.

       3.     Throughout the hours of voting on voting day, the elector will be travelling under conditions that will prevent the elector attending a polling booth in the State or Territory for which the elector is enrolled.

       4.     The elector will be unable to attend a polling booth on voting day because of:

                     (a)  serious illness;

                     (b)  infirmity; or

                     (c)  recent or approaching childbirth.

              (In the case of an elector who will be a patient at a hospital on voting day, this paragraph applies regardless of the operation of sections 48 and 49.)

       5.     On voting day, the elector will be unable to attend a polling booth because the elector will be at a place (other than a hospital) caring for a person who is seriously ill or infirm or who has recently given birth or is expected shortly to do so.

       6.     Throughout the hours of voting on voting day, the elector will be a patient at a hospital (other than a special hospital) and unable to vote at the hospital.

       7.     Throughout the hours of voting on voting day, the elector will be a patient at a special hospital but will be unable to have his or her vote taken under section 49.

       8.     Because of the elector’s religious beliefs or membership of a religious order, the elector:

                     (a)  is precluded from attending a polling booth; or

                     (b)  for the greater part of the hours of voting on voting day, is precluded from attending a polling booth.

       9.     On voting day, the elector will be serving a sentence of imprisonment or otherwise under detention.

     10.     The elector’s address has been excluded from the Roll under section 104 of the _Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918_.

     11.     Throughout the hours of voting on voting day, the elector will be engaged in his or her employment or occupation and:

                     (a)  if the elector is an employee, the elector is not entitled to leave of absence under section 133; and

                     (b)  in any other case, the absence of the elector for the purpose of attending at a polling booth to vote would be likely to cause loss to the elector in his or her occupation.

# Schedule 4—Rules for the conduct of a preliminary scrutiny of declaration votes

_Subsection 89A(3)_

       1.     The DRO shall produce unopened all envelopes containing declaration votes of the kind to which the preliminary scrutiny relates received by the DRO:

                     (a)  in the case of the first preliminary scrutiny—before the commencement of that scrutiny; and

                     (b)  in the case of a subsequent preliminary scrutiny—after the commencement of the last preceding preliminary scrutiny and before the commencement of the subsequent preliminary scrutiny.

       2.     All written applications for postal votes not already dealt with at a preliminary scrutiny shall be produced at each preliminary scrutiny of postal votes.

       3.     The DRO shall compare the signature of the elector on each postal vote application with the signature on the relevant postal vote certificate and allow the scrutineers to inspect both signatures.

    3A.     For each postal vote certificate not dealt with under paragraph 3, the DRO must compare the signature of the elector on the postal vote certificate with the signature of the elector on:

                     (a)  the elector’s application for registration as a general postal voter under the _Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918_; or

                     (b)  the elector’s application for enrolment or transfer of enrolment under the _Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918_;

              and allow the scrutineers to inspect both signatures.

       4.     The DRO shall divide the envelopes being dealt with into groups, as follows:

                     (a)  in one group, the envelopes that meet the requirements of paragraph 6;

                     (b)  in another group, the envelopes that do not meet those requirements.

       5.     The DRO shall, without opening the envelopes, subject to the operation of paragraphs 19 and 20, exclude from further scrutiny the ballot-papers contained in envelopes that do not meet the requirements of paragraph 6.

       6.     An envelope meets the requirements of this paragraph if the DRO is satisfied:

                     (a)  in the case of an envelope purporting to contain a postal ballot-paper, other than an envelope sent under section 58 to a registered general postal voter who was registered on the ground specified in paragraph 184A(2)(e) or (f) of the _Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918_, that the signature on the certificate is that of the elector and that:

                              (i)  the signature purports to be witnessed by an authorised witness; or

                             (ii)  the signature is taken to be witnessed by an authorised witness because of subsection 65(1A); and

                     (b)  in the case of an envelope purporting to contain a pre-poll vote ballot-paper, that the certificate has been signed in accordance with section 73D and that the signature purports to be witnessed by the officer who issued the certificate; and

                     (c)  in the case of an envelope purporting to contain an absent vote ballot-paper or a provisional vote ballot-paper, that the declaration has been signed in accordance with section 46 or 37, or under subsection 36(4), as the case may be, and that the signature purports to be witnessed in accordance with that section or subsection, as the case requires; and

                    (ca)  in the case of an envelope purporting to contain a provisional vote ballot-paper—if the elector (other than an elector to whom subsection 104(4) of the _Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918_ applies) did not provide evidence of his or her identity in accordance with section 37 at the time of casting the vote, the elector has provided that evidence by the first Friday following the voting day for that referendum; and

                    (cb)  in the case of an envelope purporting to contain a postal ballot-paper, a pre-poll vote ballot-paper, an absent vote ballot-paper or a provisional vote ballot-paper, cast by an elector who is provisionally enrolled—that, by the first Friday following the polling day for that election, the elector has provided an officer with evidence that the elector has become an Australian citizen under the _Australian Citizenship Act 2007_

                     (d)  in the case of an envelope purporting to contain a ballot-paper recording a vote cast at a station in Antarctica, the envelope is signed in accordance with subsection 85(1); and

                     (e)  in the case of an envelope purporting to contain a postal ballot-paper, that the vote marked on the ballot-paper was recorded prior to the close of the voting.

    6A.     If the DRO is satisfied that more than one envelope that meets the requirements of paragraph 6 purports to contain a declaration vote by the same elector, the DRO must:

                     (a)  treat only one of the envelopes, as selected by the DRO, as meeting the requirements of paragraph 6; and

                     (b)  exclude from further scrutiny the ballot-papers contained in the other envelope or envelopes, without opening the envelope or envelopes; and

                     (c)  seal up in a parcel the envelope or envelopes excluded from further scrutiny by subparagraph (b); and

                     (d)  write on the parcel a description of its contents, the name of the Division and the date of the commencement of the preliminary scrutiny.

              In applying subparagraph (a), the DRO should, to the extent that it is possible, select the envelope that was received first.

    6B.     Paragraphs 19 and 20 do not apply to envelopes excluded from further scrutiny because of subparagraph 6A(b).

       7.     Where the envelope purporting to contain a postal ballot-paper bears a postmark that includes a date after voting day, the vote marked on the ballot-paper shall be taken not to have been recorded prior to the close of voting.

    7A.     A vote marked on a postal ballot-paper must be taken not to have been recorded prior to the close of voting if:

                     (a)  in the case of a ballot-paper taken to be witnessed because of subsection 65(1A)—the envelope purporting to contain the ballot-paper does not bear a legible postmark; or

                     (b)  in any other case—the envelope purporting to contain the ballot-paper does not bear a legible postmark and the signature of the witness bears a date after voting day.

       8.     An envelope purporting to contain an absent vote ballot-paper, a provisional vote ballot-paper or a pre-poll vote ballot-paper shall not be regarded as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph 6 only because the declaration or certificate, as the case requires, is not witnessed if the voter’s name appears on a record made under subsection 34(2) or section 73F, as the case requires, or, if neither of those requirements is met, if the DRO is satisfied that the ballot-paper was properly issued.

       9.     The DRO shall seal up in a parcel the envelopes that do not meet the requirements of paragraph 6 and shall write on the parcel a description of its contents, the name of the Division and the date of commencement of the preliminary scrutiny.

     10.     The DRO shall divide the envelopes that meet the requirements of paragraph 6 into groups as follows:

                     (a)  in one group, the envelopes bearing certificates or declarations by persons who are enrolled for the Division or whose claims for enrolment are claims to which subsection 102(4A) of the _Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918_ applies;

                     (b)  in another group the envelopes to which paragraph 11 applies;

                     (c)  in another group, the envelopes bearing certificates or declarations by persons who are not enrolled for the Division but are enrolled for the State or Territory in which the Division is situated;

                     (d)  in another group, the envelopes bearing certificates or declarations by persons who are not enrolled for the Division or for the State or Territory in which the Division is situated.

     11.     This paragraph applies to an envelope if the DRO is satisfied:

                     (a)  that the elector who signed a certificate or declaration on the envelope is not enrolled for the Division; and

                     (b)  after making enquiry:

                              (i)  that the elector was, at the time of voting, entitled to be enrolled for the Division; and

                             (ii)  that the omission of the elector’s name from the Roll for the Division was due to an error made by an officer or to a mistake of fact; and

                            (iii)  that the omission was not attributable to subsection 118(4A) of the _Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918_.

     12.     Subparagraph 11(b) does not apply if:

                     (a)  more than one election (excluding the election to which the scrutiny relates) has been held since the error or mistake was made; or

                     (b)  where there has been a redistribution of the State or Territory that includes the Division since the last election but one before the election to which the scrutiny relates, the error or mistake was made before the last such redistribution.

     13.     In paragraph 12, election means:

                     (a)  a general election for the House of Representatives;

                     (b)  a Senate election not held concurrently with a general election for the House of Representatives; or

                     (c)  a referendum not held concurrently with a general election.

     14.     The DRO shall, without opening the envelopes, subject to the operation of paragraphs 19 and 21, exclude from further scrutiny the ballot-papers contained in envelopes referred to in subparagraph 10(d).

     15.     The DRO shall seal up in a parcel the envelopes referred to in subparagraph 10(d) and shall write on the parcel a description of the contents, the name of the Division and the date.

     16.     The DRO shall, after the close of voting in the Division, without unfolding or inspecting them or allowing any other person to do so, withdraw the ballot-papers from envelopes referred to in paragraph 10 that still remain in the preliminary scrutiny.

     17.     Ballot-papers withdrawn from envelopes referred to in subparagraph 10(a) or (b) shall be placed in a ballot-box by themselves for further scrutiny.

     18.     Where a ballot-paper has been finally excluded from further scrutiny, other than because of subparagraph 6A(b), the DRO shall send to the voter a written statement of the reason for the rejection.

     19.     In the course of a preliminary scrutiny of declaration votes, the DRO, as soon as practicable after the ballot-papers that are required, under that scrutiny, to be placed in a ballot-box under paragraph 17 are so placed, but not before the close of the poll for the Division, must:

                     (a)  open the parcel of envelopes that contains the ballot-papers that are, under paragraph 5 and subject to the operation of this paragraph and paragraph 20, excluded from scrutiny, and deal further with those declaration votes in accordance with paragraph 20; and

                     (b)  open the parcel of envelopes that contains the ballot-papers that are, under paragraph 14 and subject to the operation of this paragraph and paragraph 21, excluded from scrutiny, and deal further with those declaration votes in accordance with paragraph 21.

     20.     For the purpose of dealing further with declaration votes referred to in subparagraph 19(a), paragraphs 3 to 18, inclusive, reapply in relation to those votes as if:

                     (a)  the words “subject to the operation of paragraphs 19 and 20,” were omitted from paragraph 5; and

                     (b)  the words “subject to the operation of paragraphs 19 and 21,” were omitted from paragraph 14.

     21.     For the purpose of dealing further with declaration votes referred to in subparagraph 19(b), paragraphs 10 to 18, inclusive, reapply in relation to those votes as if the words “subject to the operation of paragraphs 19 and 21,” were omitted from paragraph 14.
