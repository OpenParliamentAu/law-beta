##### <a id="1C"></a>1C  When may a person elect to salary sacrifice?

                             (ii)  the person has been chosen or appointed to hold the place of a senator in accordance with section 15 of the Constitution, but his or her entitlement to parliamentary allowance as a senator has not yet commenced.

             (1)  The member may elect to forgo a percentage or amount of the parliamentary allowance that he or she would otherwise expect to receive and instead have contributions (the **_additional contributions_**) made to a specified fund, scheme or account (the **_additional contributions fund_**).

Note:          An election can be varied or revoked (see clauses 1H and 1I).

             (2)  The specified fund, scheme or account must, at the time the election is made, be either:

                     (a)  a complying superannuation fund that is not a self managed superannuation fund; or

             (3)  There can only be one additional contributions fund at any particular time in relation to the member.

##### <a id="1E"></a>1E  How to make an election

             (1)  An election must be in writing and be signed by the member.

             (2)  The election must:

                     (a)  specify the percentage or amount (the **_specified salary sacrifice_**) of parliamentary allowance that is forgone; and

                     (b)  specify the name of, and contact details for, the additional contributions fund; and

                     (c)  specify the date (the **_start date_**) from which the election is to have effect, being a date:

                              (i)  that is the first day of the next month following the month in which the election is made, or the first day of a later month; and

                             (ii)  if the election is made before the start of a new scheme contribution period of the person as permitted by paragraph 1C(b)—that is not before the start of the new scheme contribution period; and

                     (d)  contain such other information (if any) as is required by the regulations.

             (3)  The specified salary sacrifice must be either:

                     (a)  a specified percentage of the monthly amount of parliamentary allowance; or

                     (b)  a specified amount per month.

Note:          In deciding what amount or percentage to specify, consideration should be given to the effect of subclause 1G(3).

             (4)  The election must be accompanied by evidence that the additional contributions fund will accept the additional contributions. However such evidence is not required if:

                     (a)  the additional contributions fund is the default basic contributions fund; or

                     (b)  the additional contributions fund is the chosen basic contributions fund of the member, and the evidence that accompanied the notice choosing that fund indicates that the fund will accept the additional contributions.

             (5)  The election must be given to the administering authority.

             (6)  For the purpose of subparagraph (2)(c)(i), the election is **_made_** when it is given to the administering authority.

##### <a id="1F"></a>1F  Duration of an election

                   An election comes into force on the start date for the election and remains in force until whichever of the following occurs first:

                     (a)  the contribution payable under this Division in respect of the month in which the  member next ceases to be entitled to parliamentary allowance has been paid; or

                     (b)  a revocation of the election takes effect (see clause 1I).

##### <a id="1G"></a>1G  Effect of an election

             (1)  If the member makes an election in accordance with clauses 1C, 1D and 1E, then this clause  has effect in relation to each month during the period when the election is in force.

             (2)  Subject to subclauses (3) and (5), the amount (the **_basic amount_**) of parliamentary allowance to which the member would otherwise be entitled in respect of a month is reduced (but not below zero) by whichever of the following amounts (the **_reduction amount_**) is applicable:

                     (a)  if the specified salary sacrifice is a percentage—the amount that is that percentage of the basic amount;

                     (b)  if the specified salary sacrifice is an amount—that amount.

             (3)  If the reduction amount for a month is greater than the amount (the **_maximum reduction_**) that is 50% of the sum of:

                     (a)  the basic amount; and

                     (b)  the amount (if any) of salary to which the member is entitled because he or she was a Minister of State for some or all of the month; and

                     (c)  the amount (if any) of allowance by way of salary to which the member is entitled because he or she was an office holder for some or all of the month;

the basic amount for the month is instead reduced by the maximum reduction.

             (4)  Subject to subclause (5), the Commonwealth must, in respect of each month, make a contribution to the additional contributions fund, in respect of the member, of an amount equal to the amount by which the basic amount for the month is reduced under subclause (2) or (3).

             (5)  If either:

                     (a)  the additional contributions fund:

                              (i)  ceases to exist; or

                             (ii)  ceases to accept the additional contributions; or

                            (iii)  ceases to be a complying superannuation fund or an RSA; or

                            (iv)  becomes a self managed superannuation fund; or

                     (b)  the member dies;

before the Commonwealth  makes a contribution as required by subclause (4) in respect of a month, then:

                     (c)  no reduction under subclause (2) or (3) is to be made in respect of that month; and

                     (d)  no contribution under subclause (4) is to be made in respect of that month.

##### <a id="1H"></a>1H  Variation of an election

             (1)  The member may vary an election he or she has made by notice in writing signed by the member  and given to the administering authority.

             (2)  The only variations that are permitted are:

                     (a)  to change the additional contributions fund to another fund or scheme that is, at the time notice is given:

                              (i)  a complying superannuation fund that is not a self managed superannuation fund; or

                             (ii)  an RSA; or

                     (b)  to change the specified salary sacrifice to another specified percentage or amount that complies with subclause 1E(3); or

                     (c)  to change the start date to a later date (but only if the start date has not already occurred).

             (3)  The notice of variation must specify a date (the **_variation date_**) from which the variation is to take effect, being a date that is the first day of the next month following the giving of the notice, or the first day of a later month.

             (4)  A notice of variation to change the additional contributions fund to another complying superannuation fund or RSA (the **_new fund_**) must:

                     (a)  specify the name of, and contact details for, the new fund; and

                     (b)  be accompanied by evidence that the new fund will accept the additional contributions.

             (5)  However, evidence referred to in paragraph (4)(b) is not required if:

                     (a)  the new fund is the default basic contributions fund; or

                     (b)  the new fund is the chosen basic contributions fund of the member, and the evidence that accompanied the notice choosing that fund indicates that the fund will accept the additional contributions.

             (6)  If the notice of variation complies with this clause, it varies the election accordingly (subject to any later variations) in relation to months starting on or after the variation date.

##### <a id="1I"></a>1I  Revocation of an election

             (1)  The member may revoke an election he or she has made by notice in writing signed by the member and given to the administering authority.

             (2)  The notice of revocation must specify a date from which the revocation is to take effect, being a date that is the first day of the next month following the giving of the notice, or the first day of a later month.

             (3)  If the notice of revocation complies with this clause, the revocation takes effect on the specified date.
