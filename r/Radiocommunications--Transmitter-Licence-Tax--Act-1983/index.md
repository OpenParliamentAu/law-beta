## 2  Transitional—deeming provisions for the transition from tax purportedly imposed on issued licences to tax actually imposed

Definitions

(1)        In this item:

(4)        For the purposes of the Licence Tax Act, a person who, before this item commenced, purportedly notified the ACA in accordance with subsection 6(5) of that Act that that subsection is to apply to an issued licence, is taken instead to have notified the ACA at that time that subsection 6(11) is to apply to the licence.

                     (a)  any reference in the determination to subsection 6(2) of that Act is taken also to include a reference to subsection 6(7); and

                     (b)  any reference in the determination to subsection 6(3) of that Act is taken also to include a reference to subsection 6(8); and
