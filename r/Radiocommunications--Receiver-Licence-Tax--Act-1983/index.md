	(b)	a licence for such a period is issued to the person;
tax is imposed on the issue of the licence for the period the licence is in force.

	(a)	a person applying for a receiver licence for a period of more than 12 months has made an election under subsection (4) that this subsection apply; and
	(b)	a licence for such a period is issued to the person;
tax is imposed on:

	(d)	each anniversary of the issue of the licence occurring during the period the licence is in force.
	(4)	A person applying for a receiver licence for a period exceeding 12 months must elect, in the application for the licence, that either subsection (2) or (3) is to apply in respect of the receiver licence.
	(5)	If the holder of a receiver licence:
	(a)	at the time when the person applied for the licence, elects that subsection (3) apply; and
	(b)	subsequently notifies the ACA, in writing, at least 21 days before the next anniversary of the issue of the licence that is more than 12 months before the end of the period that the licence is in force, that this subsection is to apply;
