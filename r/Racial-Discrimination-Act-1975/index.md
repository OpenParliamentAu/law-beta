                     (b)  an act or omission by a person that constitutes an offence against that law also constitutes an offence against this Act;

                     (a)  any provision of the governing rules (within the meaning of the _Australian Charities and Not‑for‑profits Commission Act 2012_) of a registered charity, if the provision:

                              (i)  confers charitable benefits; or

                             (ii)  enables charitable benefits to be conferred;

                            on persons of a particular race, colour or national or ethnic origin; or

                     (b)  any act done in order to comply with such a provision.

             (3)  In this section, **_charitable benefits_** means benefits for purposes that are exclusively charitable according to the law in force in any State or Territory.

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Racial discrimination to be unlawful

             (1)  It is unlawful for a person to do any act involving a distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of any human right or fundamental freedom in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.

          (1A)  Where:

                     (a)  a person requires another person to comply with a term, condition or requirement which is not reasonable having regard to the circumstances of the case; and

                     (b)  the other person does not or cannot comply with the term, condition or requirement; and

                     (c)  the requirement to comply has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, by persons of the same race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin as the other person, of any human right or fundamental freedom in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life;

the act of requiring such compliance is to be treated, for the purposes of this Part, as an act involving a distinction based on, or an act done by reason of, the other person’s race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin.

             (2)  A reference in this section to a human right or fundamental freedom in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life includes any right of a kind referred to in Article 5 of the Convention.

             (3)  This section does not apply in respect of the employment, or an application for the employment, of a person on a ship or aircraft (not being an Australian ship or aircraft) if that person was engaged, or applied, for that employment outside Australia.

             (1)  If, by reason of, or of a provision of, a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory, persons of a particular race, colour or national or ethnic origin do not enjoy a right that is enjoyed by persons of another race, colour or national or ethnic origin, or enjoy a right to a more limited extent than persons of another race, colour or national or ethnic origin, then, notwithstanding anything in that law, persons of the first‑mentioned race, colour or national or ethnic origin shall, by force of this section, enjoy that right to the same extent as persons of that other race, colour or national or ethnic origin.

             (2)  A reference in subsection (1) to a right includes a reference to a right of a kind referred to in Article 5 of the Convention.

             (3)  Where a law contains a provision that:

                     (a)  authorizes property owned by an Aboriginal or a Torres Strait Islander to be managed by another person without the consent of the Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander; or

                     (b)  prevents or restricts an Aboriginal or a Torres Strait Islander from terminating the management by another person of property owned by the Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander;

not being a provision that applies to persons generally without regard to their race, colour or national or ethnic origin, that provision shall be deemed to be a provision in relation to which subsection (1) applies and a reference in that subsection to a right includes a reference to a right of a person to manage property owned by the person.

                   It is unlawful for a person:

                     (a)  to refuse to allow another person access to or use of any place or vehicle that members of the public are, or a section of the public is, entitled or allowed to enter or use, or to refuse to allow another person access to or use of any such place or vehicle except on less favourable terms or conditions than those upon or subject to which he or she would otherwise allow access to or use of that place or vehicle;

                     (c)  to require another person to leave or cease to use any such place or vehicle or any such facilities;

by reason of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of that other person or of any relative or associate of that other person.

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Land, housing and other accommodation

             (1)  It is unlawful for a person, whether as a principal or agent:

                     (b)  to dispose of such an estate or interest or such accommodation to a second person on less favourable terms and conditions than those which are or would otherwise be offered;

                     (c)  to treat a second person who is seeking to acquire or has acquired such an estate or interest or such accommodation less favourably than other persons in the same circumstances;

                     (d)  to refuse to permit a second person to occupy any land or any residential or business accommodation; or

                     (e)  to terminate any estate or interest in land of a second person or the right of a second person to occupy any land or any residential or business accommodation;

             (1)  Any provision of the rules or other document constituting, or governing the activities of, a trade union that prevents or hinders a person from joining that trade union by reason of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of that person is invalid.

                     (c)  to dismiss a second person from his or her employment;

by reason of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of that second person or of any relative or associate of that second person.

             (2)  It is unlawful for a person concerned with procuring employment for other persons or procuring employees for any employer to treat any person seeking employment less favourably than other persons in the same circumstances by reason of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of the person so seeking employment or of any relative or associate of that person.

             (3)  It is unlawful for an organization of employers or employees, or a person acting or purporting to act on behalf of such an organization, to prevent, or to seek to prevent, another person from offering for employment or from continuing in employment by reason of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of that other person or of any relative or associate of that other person.

             (4)  This section does not apply in respect of the employment, or an application for the employment, of a person on a ship or aircraft (not being an Australian ship or aircraft) if that person was engaged, or applied, for that employment outside Australia.

             (5)  Nothing in this section renders unlawful an act in relation to employment, or an application for employment, in a dwelling‑house or flat occupied by the person who did the act or a person on whose behalf the act was done or by a relative of either of those persons.

##### <a id="16"></a>16  Advertisements

                   It is unlawful for a person to publish or display, or cause or permit to be published or displayed, an advertisement or notice that indicates, or could reasonably be understood as indicating, an intention to do an act that is unlawful by reason of a provision of this Part or an act that would, but for subsection 12(3) or 15(5), be unlawful by reason of section 12 or 15, as the case may be.

##### <a id="17"></a>17  Unlawful to incite doing of unlawful acts

                   It is unlawful for a person:

                     (a)  to incite the doing of an act that is unlawful by reason of a provision of this Part; or

                     (b)  to assist or promote whether by financial assistance or otherwise the doing of such an act.

##### <a id="18"></a>18  Acts done for 2 or more reasons

                   Where:

                     (a)  an act is done for 2 or more reasons; and

                     (b)  one of the reasons is the race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin of a person (whether or not it is the dominant reason or a substantial reason for doing the act);

then, for the purposes of this Part, the act is taken to be done for that reason.

##### <a id="18A"></a>18A  Vicarious liability

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), if:

                     (a)  an employee or agent of a person does an act in connection with his or her duties as an employee or agent; and

                     (b)  the act would be unlawful under this Part if it were done by that person;

this Act applies in relation to that person as if that person had also done the act.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply to an act done by an employee or agent of a person if it is established that the person took all reasonable steps to prevent the employee or agent from doing the act.

                     (b)  one of the reasons is the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of a person (whether or not it is the dominant reason or a substantial reason for doing the act);

then, for the purposes of this Part, the act is taken to be done because of the person’s race, colour or national or ethnic origin.

##### <a id="18C"></a>18C  Offensive behaviour because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin

             (1)  It is unlawful for a person to do an act, otherwise than in private, if:

                     (b)  the act is done because of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of the other person or of some or all of the people in the group.

Note:          Subsection (1) makes certain acts unlawful. Section 46P of the _Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986_ allows people to make complaints to the Australian Human Rights Commission about unlawful acts. However, an unlawful act is not necessarily a criminal offence. Section 26 says that this Act does not make it an offence to do an act that is unlawful because of this Part, unless Part IV expressly says that the act is an offence.

             (2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), an act is taken not to be done in private if it:

                     (b)  is done in a public place; or

                     (c)  is done in the sight or hearing of people who are in a public place.

                   Section 18C does not render unlawful anything said or done reasonably and in good faith:

                     (a)  in the performance, exhibition or distribution of an artistic work; or

                     (b)  in the course of any statement, publication, discussion or debate made or held for any genuine academic, artistic or scientific purpose or any other genuine purpose in the public interest; or

                     (c)  in making or publishing:

                              (i)  a fair and accurate report of any event or matter of public interest; or

                             (ii)  a fair comment on any event or matter of public interest if the comment is an expression of a genuine belief held by the person making the comment.

##### <a id="18E"></a>18E  Vicarious liability

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), if:

                     (a)  an employee or agent of a person does an act in connection with his or her duties as an employee or agent; and

                     (b)  the act would be unlawful under this Part if it were done by the person;

this Act applies in relation to the person as if the person had also done the act.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply to an act done by an employee or agent of a person if it is established that the person took all reasonable steps to prevent the employee or agent from doing the act.

##### <a id="18F"></a>18F   State and Territory laws not affected

                   This Part is not intended to exclude or limit the concurrent operation of any law of a State or Territory.

# Schedule—International Convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination

_Section 3(1)_

_The States Parties to this Convention_,

_Considering_ that the Charter of the United Nations is based on the principles of the dignity and equality inherent in all human beings, and that all Member States have pledged themselves to take joint and separate action, in co‑operation with the Organization, for the achievement of one of the purposes of the United Nations which is to promote and encourage universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion, 

_Considering_ that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set out therein, without distinction of any kind, in particular as to race, colour or national origin,

_Considering_ that all human beings are equal before the law and are entitled to equal protection of the law against any discrimination and against any incitement to discrimination,

_Considering_ that the United Nations has condemned colonialism and all practices of segregation and discrimination associated therewith, in whatever form and wherever they exist, and that the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples of 14 December 1960 (General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV)) has affirmed and solemnly proclaimed the necessity of bringing them to a speedy and unconditional end,

_Considering_ that the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination of 20 November 1963 (General Assembly resolution 1904 (XVIII)) solemnly affirms the necessity of speedily eliminating racial discrimination throughout the world in all its forms and manifestations and of securing understanding of and respect for the dignity of the human person,

_Convinced_ that any doctrine of superiority based on racial differentiation is scientifically false, morally condemnable, socially unjust and dangerous, and that there is no justification for racial discrimination, in theory or in practice, anywhere,

_Reaffirming_ that discrimination between human beings on the grounds of race, colour or ethnic origin is an obstacle to friendly and peaceful relations among nations and is capable of disturbing peace and security among peoples and the harmony of persons living side by side even within one and the same State,

_Convinced_ that the existence of racial barriers is repugnant to the ideals of any human society,

_Alarmed_ by manifestations of racial discrimination still in evidence in some areas of the world and by governmental policies based on racial superiority or hatred, such as policies of _apartheid_, segregation or separation,

_Resolved_ to adopt all necessary measures for speedily eliminating racial discrimination in all its forms and manifestations, and to prevent and combat racist doctrines and practices in order to promote understanding between races and to build an international community free from all forms of racial segregation and racial discrimination,

_Bearing in mind_ the Convention concerning Discrimination in respect of Employment and Occupation adopted by the International Labour Organisation in 1958, and the Convention against Discrimination in Education adopted by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in 1960,

_Desiring_ to implement the principles embodied in the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and to secure the earliest adoption of practical measures to that end,

_Have agreed_ as follows:

PART I

_Article_ 1

1.       In this Convention, the term “racial discrimination” shall mean any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.

2.         This Convention shall not apply to distinctions, exclusions, restrictions or preferences made by a State Party to this Convention between citizens and non‑citizens.

4.         Special measures taken for the sole purpose of securing adequate advancement of certain racial or ethnic groups or individuals requiring such protection as may be necessary in order to ensure such groups or individuals equal enjoyment or exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms shall not be deemed racial discrimination, provided, however, that such measures do not, as a consequence, lead to the maintenance of separate rights for different racial groups and that they shall not be continued after the objectives for which they were taken have been achieved. 

_Article_ 2

1.         States Parties condemn racial discrimination and undertake to pursue by all appropriate means and without delay a policy of eliminating racial discrimination in all its forms and promoting understanding among all races, and, to this end:

(e)     Each State Party undertakes to encourage, where appropriate, integrationist multi‑racial organizations and movements and other means of eliminating barriers between races, and to discourage anything which tends to strengthen racial division.

2.       States Parties shall, when the circumstances so warrant, take, in the social, economic, cultural and other fields, special and concrete measures to ensure the adequate development and protection of certain racial groups or individuals belonging to them, for the purpose of guaranteeing them the full and equal enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. These measures shall in no case entail as a consequence the maintenance of unequal or separate rights for different racial groups after the objectives for which they were taken have been achieved.

_Article_ 3

States Parties particularly condemn racial segregation and _apartheid_ and undertake to prevent, prohibit and eradicate all practices of this nature in territories under their jurisdiction.

_Article_ 4

States Parties condemn all propaganda and all organizations which are based on ideas or theories of superiority of one race or group of persons of one colour or ethnic origin, or which attempt to justify or promote racial hatred and discrimination in any form, and undertake to adopt immediate and positive measures designed to eradicate all incitement to, or acts of, such discrimination and, to this end, with due regard to the principles embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the rights expressly set forth in article 5 of this Convention, _inter alia_:

(a)     Shall declare an offence punishable by law all dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred, incitement to racial discrimination, as well as all acts of violence or incitement to such acts against any race or group of persons of another colour or ethnic origin, and also the provision of any assistance to racist activities, including the financing thereof;

(b)     Shall declare illegal and prohibit organizations, and also organized and all other propaganda activities, which promote and incite racial discrimination, and shall recognize participation in such organizations or activities as an offence punishable by law;

(c)     Shall not permit public authorities or public institutions, national or local, to promote or incite racial discrimination.
