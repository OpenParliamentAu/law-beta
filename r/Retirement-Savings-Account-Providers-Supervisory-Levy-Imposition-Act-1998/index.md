             (1)  This Act commences on the commencement of the _Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998_.

             (2)  If this Act commences during a financial year (but not on 1 July of that financial year), this Act has effect in relation to that financial year subject to the modifications specified in the regulations.

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Act binds the Crown

                   This Act binds the Crown in each of its capacities.

##### <a id="4"></a>4  <st1:place style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x"><st1:placename>External</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Territories</st1:placetype></st1:place>

                   This Act extends to each external Territory.

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Definitions

                   In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears:

                    <a name="index-factor"></a>**_indexation factor_** means the indexation factor calculated under section 8.

                    <a name="index-number"></a>**_index number_**, in relation to a quarter, means the All Groups Consumer Price Index number, being the weighted average of the 8 capital cities, published by the Australian Statistician in respect of that quarter.

                    <a name="levi-imposit-dai"></a>**_levy imposition day_**, in relation to an RSA provider for a financial year, means:

                     (a)  if the RSA provider is an RSA provider on 1 July of the financial year—that day; or

                     (b)  in any other case—the day, during the financial year, on which the RSA provider becomes an RSA provider.

                    <a name=""></a><a name="rsa-provid"></a>**_RSA provider_** has the same meaning as in the _Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997_.

                    <a name="statutori-upper-limit"></a>**_statutory upper limit_** means:

                     (a)  in relation to the financial year commencing on <st1:date style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x" month="7" day="1" year="2005">1 July 2005</st1:date>—$1,500,000; or

                     (b)  in relation to a later financial year—the amount calculated by multiplying the statutory upper limit for the previous financial year by the indexation factor for the later financial year.

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Imposition of RSA providers supervisory levy

                   Levy payable in accordance with subsection 8(5) of the _Financial Institutions Supervisory Levies Collection Act 1998_ is imposed.

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Amount of levy

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), the amount of levy payable by an RSA provider for a financial year is the sum of the restricted levy component and the unrestricted levy component for the financial year.

Note:          For **_restricted levy component_**, see subsection (1A). For **_unrestricted levy component_**, see subsection (1B).

          (1A)  The **_restricted levy_** **_component_** for the financial year is:

                     (a)  unless paragraph (b) or (c) applies—the amount that, for the financial year, is the restricted levy percentage of the RSA provider’s asset value; or

                     (b)  if the amount worked out under paragraph (a) exceeds the maximum restricted levy amount for the financial year—the maximum restricted levy amount; or

                     (c)  if the amount worked out under paragraph (a) is less than the minimum restricted levy amount for the financial year—the minimum restricted levy amount.

Note:          The restricted levy percentage, maximum restricted levy amount, minimum restricted levy amount and the method of working out the RSA provider’s asset value are as determined under subsection (3).

          (1B)  The **_unrestricted levy_** **_component_** for the financial year is the amount that, for the financial year, is the unrestricted levy percentage of the RSA provider’s asset value.

Note:          The unrestricted levy percentage is as determined under subsection (3).

             (2)  If the levy imposition day for the RSA provider for the financial year is later than 1 July in the financial year, the amount of levy payable by the RSA provider for the financial year is the amount worked out using the following formula:

<v:shape id="_x0000_i1026" style="WIDTH: 249.75pt; HEIGHT: 59.25pt" o:ole="" type="#_x0000_t75" coordsize="21600,21600"><v:imagedata o:title="" src="RetSavAcPrSLImp88_WD02_files/image003.wmz"></v:imagedata></v:shape>

             (3)  The Treasurer is, in writing, to determine:

                     (a)  the **_maximum restricted levy_** **_amount_** for each financial year; and

                     (b)  the **_minimum restricted levy amount_** for each financial year; and

                     (c)  the **_restricted levy percentage_** for each financial year; and

                    (ca)  the **_unrestricted levy percentage_** for each financial year; and

                     (d)  how an **_RSA provider’s asset value_** is to be worked out.

             (4)  An amount determined under subsection (3) as the maximum restricted levy amount must not exceed the statutory upper limit as at the time when the determination is made.

             (5)  The Treasurer’s determination under paragraph (3)(d) of how an RSA provider’s asset value is to be worked out is to include, but is not limited to, a determination of the day as at which the RSA provider’s asset value is to be worked out. That day must be:

                     (a)  if the RSA provider was an RSA provider at all times from and including 17 March of the previous financial year to and including the following 30 June—a day in the period from and including that 17 March to and including the following 14 April; or

                     (b)  if the RSA provider was not an RSA provider at all times from and including 17 March of the previous financial year to and including the following 30 June—the day after that 17 March when the RSA provider became, or becomes, an RSA provider.

             (6)  A determination under subsection (3) may make different provision for different classes of RSA providers.

             (7)  A determination under subsection (3) is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Calculation of indexation factor

             (1)  The indexation factor for a financial year is the number worked out by:

                     (a)  dividing the index number for the March quarter immediately preceding that financial year by the index number for the March quarter immediately preceding that first-mentioned March quarter; and

                     (b)  adding 0.030 to the number worked out under paragraph (a).

             (2)  The indexation factor is to be calculated to 3 decimal places, but increased by .001 if the 4th decimal place is more than 4.

             (3)  Calculations under paragraph (1)(a):

                     (a)  are to be made using only the index numbers published in terms of the most recently published reference base for the Consumer Price Index; and

                     (b)  are to be made disregarding index numbers that are published in substitution for previously published index numbers (except where the substituted numbers are published to take account of changes in the reference base).

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Regulations

                   The Governor-General may make regulations for the purposes of subsection 2(2).
