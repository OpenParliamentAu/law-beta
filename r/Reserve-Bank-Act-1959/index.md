             (2)  It is the duty of the Reserve Bank Board, within the limits of its powers, to ensure that the monetary and banking policy of the Bank is directed to the greatest advantage of the people of Australia and that the powers of the Bank under this Act and any other Act, other than the _Payment Systems (Regulation) Act 1998_, the _Payment Systems and Netting Act 1998_ and Part 7.3 of the _Corporations Act 2001_, are exercised in such a manner as, in the opinion of the Reserve Bank Board, will best contribute to:
