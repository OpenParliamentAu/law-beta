##### <a id="1"></a>1  Short title <span style="font-size:9.0pt; font-weight:normal">[_see_ Note 1]</span>

                   This Act may be cited as the _Fisheries Management Act 1991_.

##### <a id="2"></a>2  Commencement <span style="font-size:9.0pt; font-weight:normal">[_see_ Note 1]</span>

             (1)  Sections 1 and 2 commence on the day on which this Act receives the Royal Assent.

             (2)  Part 5 commences upon the repeal or the ceasing to have effect (as the case may be) of Part IVA of the _Fisheries Act 1952_.

             (3)  Subject to subsection (4), the remaining provisions of this Act commence on a day or days to be fixed by Proclamation.

             (4)  If a provision mentioned in subsection (3) does not commence under that subsection within the period of 6 months commencing on the day on which this Act receives the Royal Assent, it commences on the first day after the end of that period.

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Objectives

             (1)  The following objectives must be pursued by the Minister in the administration of this Act and by AFMA in the performance of its functions:

                     (a)  implementing efficient and cost-effective fisheries management on behalf of the Commonwealth; and

                     (b)  ensuring that the exploitation of fisheries resources and the carrying on of any related activities are conducted in a manner consistent with the principles of ecologically sustainable development (which include the exercise of the precautionary principle), in particular the need to have regard to the impact of fishing activities on non-target species and the long term sustainability of the marine environment; and

                     (c)  maximising the net economic returns to the Australian community from the management of Australian fisheries; and

                     (d)  ensuring accountability to the fishing industry and to the Australian community in AFMA’s management of fisheries resources; and

                     (e)  achieving government targets in relation to the recovery of the costs of AFMA.

             (2)  In addition to the objectives mentioned in subsection (1), or in section 78 of this Act, the Minister, AFMA and Joint Authorities are to have regard to the objectives of:

                     (a)  ensuring, through proper conservation and management measures, that the living resources of the AFZ are not endangered by over-exploitation; and

                     (b)  achieving the optimum utilisation of the living resources of the AFZ; and

                     (c)  ensuring that conservation and management measures in the AFZ and the high seas implement Australia’s obligations under international agreements that deal with fish stocks; and

                     (d)  to the extent that Australia has obligations:

                              (i)  under international law; or

                             (ii)  under the Compliance Agreement or any other international agreement;

                            in relation to fishing activities by Australian-flagged boats on the high seas that are additional to the obligations referred to in paragraph (c)—ensuring that Australia implements those first-mentioned obligations;

but must ensure, as far as practicable, that measures adopted in pursuit of those objectives must not be inconsistent with the preservation, conservation and protection of all species of whales.

##### <a id="3A"></a>3A  Principles of ecologically sustainable development

                   The following principles are **_principles of ecologically sustainable development_**:

                     (a)  decision-making processes should effectively integrate both long-term and short-term economic, environmental, social and equity considerations;

                     (b)  if there are threats of serious or irreversible environmental damage, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to prevent environmental degradation;

                     (c)  the principle of inter-generational equity—that the present generation should ensure that the health, diversity and productivity of the environment is maintained or enhanced for the benefit of future generations;

                     (d)  the conservation of biological diversity and ecological integrity should be a fundamental consideration in decision-making;

                     (e)  improved valuation, pricing and incentive mechanisms should be promoted.

it is the Parliament’s intention that the provision is not to have the invalid application, but is to have every valid application.

             (2)  Despite subsection (1), the provision is not to have a particular valid application if:

                     (a)  apart from this section, it is clear, taking into account the provision’s context and the purpose or object underlying this Act, that the provision was intended to have that valid application only if every invalid application, or a particular invalid application, of the provision had also been within the Commonwealth’s legislative power; or

                     (b)  the provision’s operation in relation to that valid application would be different in a substantial respect from what would have been its operation in relation to that valid application if every invalid application of the provision had been within the Commonwealth’s legislative power.

             (2)  Subject to subsection (3), the Parliament intends that this Act is to apply to the exclusion of any law of a State or Territory relating to fish or fishing so far as that law would, but for this Act, apply to:

                     (a)  activities in the AFZ; or

                     (b)  activities in the coastal waters of a State or Territory in respect of which a fishery to which an arrangement mentioned in section 12K of the _Fisheries Act 1952_, or section 76 of this Act, relates; or

                     (c)  activities in the AFZ to which, because of section 77, this Act does not apply.

             (4)  The reference in paragraph 10(2)(c) to prohibiting the landing in a State or Territory of fish taken under a statutory fishing right or fishing permit includes a reference to:

                     (a)  directly prohibiting the landing of such fish in the State or Territory; or

                     (b)  directly prohibiting or regulating the possession or processing of, or other dealing with, such fish in the State or Territory in any respect that would be likely to substantially discourage the landing of such fish in the State or Territory.

             (5)  For the avoidance of doubt, the reference in subsection (2) to a law of a State or Territory relating to fish or fishing does not include such a law that is for the protection of public health, for ensuring safety or for any similar objective.

             (2)  Where by this Act (other than Part 5), or the regulations, provision is made in relation to fishing in the AFZ or a fishery, such provision, to the extent that it is capable of doing so, extends by force of this section to fishing for sedentary organisms, in or on any part of the Australian continental shelf not within the AFZ or the fishery as if they were within the AFZ or the fishery.

             (3)  Without limiting the operation of subsection (2), a reference in that subsection to making provision in relation to fishing includes a reference to making provision in respect of:

##### <a id="16B"></a>16B  Australian-flagged boats that have previously undermined conservation and management measures

             (1)  Subject to subsection (5), AFMA must not, under this Part, grant a fishing concession authorising the use for fishing activities on the high seas of an Australian-flagged boat that was previously registered in a foreign country and authorised by that country for such fishing activities if:

                     (a)  AFMA believes, on reasonable grounds, that the boat is a boat to which subsection (2) or (3) applies; and

                     (b)  subsection (4) does not apply.

             (2)  This subsection applies to an Australian-flagged boat that was previously registered in a foreign country that is a party to the Compliance Agreement if:

                     (a)  that foreign country has, because the owner or operator of that boat has undermined international conservation and management measures, suspended the authority to use that boat on the high seas for a period and that period has not expired; or

                     (b)  that foreign country has, because the owner or operator of that boat has undermined international conservation and management measures, cancelled the authority to use that boat on the high seas and a period of 3 years has not elapsed since that cancellation.

             (3)  This subsection applies to an Australian-flagged boat that was previously registered in a foreign country that is not a party to the Compliance Agreement if, on the basis of information available to it, AFMA is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the foreign country has, because the owner or operator of that boat has undermined international conservation and management measures, suspended the authority to use that boat on the high seas for a period and that period has not expired; or

                     (b)  the foreign country has, because the owner or operator of that boat has undermined international conservation and management measures, cancelled the authority for use of that boat on the high seas and a period of 3 years has not elapsed since that cancellation.

             (4)  If the person seeking the grant of a fishing concession authorising the use of a boat to which subsection (2) or (3) applies for fishing activities on the high seas satisfies AFMA that the owner or operator of the boat at the time the authority to use it was suspended or cancelled has no present legal, beneficial or financial interest in, or control of, the boat, AFMA may grant such a fishing concession authorising the use of the boat despite the application of subsection (2) or (3).

             (5)  Despite subsection (1), AFMA may grant a fishing concession authorising the use of an Australian-flagged boat to which subsection (2) or (3) applies for fishing activities on the high seas if, having regard to the circumstances in which a foreign country’s authorisation for the use of that boat for fishing activities on the high seas was suspended or cancelled, AFMA is satisfied that the grant of that fishing concession will not be likely to undermine international conservation and management measures.

             (6)  Nothing in this section implies that AFMA may not take other matters into consideration when deciding whether or not to grant a fishing concession authorising the use of an Australian-flagged boat for fishing activities on the high seas.

### Division 2—Plans of management

##### <a id="17"></a>17  Plans of management

             (1)  Subject to subsection (1A), AFMA must, in writing, after consultation with such persons engaged in fishing as appear to AFMA to be appropriate and after giving due consideration to any representations mentioned in subsection (3), determine plans of management for all fisheries.

          (1A)  If, in all the circumstances, AFMA is of the view that a plan of management is not warranted for a particular fishery, AFMA may make a determination accordingly, including in the determination its reasons for making the determination. While a determination under this subsection is in force, AFMA is not required to determine a plan of management for a fishery.

        (1AB)  If, at any time after making a determination under subsection (1A) that a plan of management is not warranted for a particular fishery, AFMA ceases to be of the view, AFMA may make a further determination revoking the determination under subsection (1A).

          (1B)  A determination under subsection (1A) must be notified:

                     (a)  in the _Gazette_; and

                     (b)  to all persons and organisations listed in the register established under section 17A, at their addresses as shown on the register.

             (2)  Before determining a plan of management for a fishery, AFMA must prepare a draft of the plan and, by public notice:

                     (a)  state that it intends to determine a plan of management in respect of the fishery; and

                     (b)  invite interested persons to make representations in connection with the draft plan by a date specified in the notice, not being less than one month after the date of publication of the notice in the _Gazette_; and

                     (c)  specify:

                              (i)  an address from which copies of the draft plan may be obtained; and

                             (ii)  an address to which representations may be forwarded.

          (2A)  In addition to issuing a public notice under subsection (2) and before determining a plan of management for a fishery, AFMA must notify the persons and organisations listed in the register established under section 17A, at their addresses as shown on the register, of the terms of the public notice.

             (3)  A person may, not later than the date specified in the notice, make representations to AFMA in connection with the draft plan.

             (4)  In this section, a reference to public notice is a reference to notice published:

                     (a)  in the _Gazette_; and

                     (b)  in each State and Territory, in a newspaper circulating throughout that State or Territory; and

                     (c)  in such other newspaper or publication (if any) that appears to AFMA to be appropriate in the circumstances.

             (5)  A plan of management for a fishery is to set out:

                     (a)  the objectives of the plan of management; and

                     (b)  measures by which the objectives are to be attained; and

                     (c)  performance criteria against which, and time frames within which, the measures taken under the plan of management may be assessed.

       (5AA)  The objectives to be set out under paragraph (5)(a) must be consistent with, but are not limited to, the objectives set out in section 3.

          (5A)  The measures to be set out under paragraph (5)(b) in a plan of management for a fishery include:

                     (a)  providing for AFMA, after such consultations (if any) as are set out in the plan of management, to direct that fishing is not to be engaged in in the fishery, or a particular part of the fishery, during a particular period or periods; and

                     (b)  providing for holders of fishing concessions in respect of the fishery to be notified of the direction; and

                     (c)  obliging those holders to comply with the direction.

          (5B)  A direction under paragraph (5A)(a) in relation to a part of a fishery may identify the part concerned in any way or ways, including by reference to a particular area, a particular species or type of fish, a particular kind or quantity of fishing equipment, a particular method of fishing, or any combination of the above.

          (5C)  A plan of management for a fishery affecting straddling fish stocks, highly migratory fish stocks or ecologically related fish stocks (within the meaning of the Fish Stocks Agreement) must set out stock-specific reference points (within the meaning of that Agreement) for the stocks.

             (6)  Without limiting the operation of subsection (5), a plan of management for a fishery may:

                     (a)  determine the method or methods by which the fishing capacity of the fishery or a part of the fishery is to be measured, which may be or include, but are not limited to, a method based on a particular area, a particular species or type or a particular quantity of fish, a particular kind, size or quantity of fishing equipment, a particular number of boats, a particular period of fishing, or any combination of the above; and

                    (aa)  determine, or provide for AFMA to determine, the fishing capacity, measured by that method or those methods, permitted for the fishery or a part of the fishery in respect of a particular period or periods; and

                     (b)  provide for the management of the fishery by means of a system of statutory fishing rights, and other fishing concessions; and

                     (c)  contain a description of the fishery by reference to area, fish species, fishing methods to be employed or any other matter; and

                     (d)  subject to section 28, formulate procedures to be followed for selecting persons to whom fishing concessions are to be granted including, in the case of fishing rights:

                              (i)  the holding of an auction; or

                             (ii)  the calling of tenders; and

                     (e)  specify the kind and quantity of equipment that may be used in the fishery; and

                      (f)  specify the circumstances in which a statutory fishing right may authorise fishing by or from a foreign boat; and

                     (g)  impose obligations on the holders of fishing concessions; and

                     (h)  prohibit or regulate recreational fishing in the fishery; and

                      (i)  prohibit or regulate fishing for scientific research purposes in the fishery.

          (6A)  Paragraph (6)(aa) authorises the making of a determination in respect of the fishing capacity of a fishery or a part of a fishery that has the effect that no fishing capacity is permitted for the fishery or that part of the fishery in respect of a particular period or periods.

          (6B)  A direction given by AFMA under paragraph (5A)(a) or a determination made by AFMA under paragraph (6)(aa) is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

          (6C)  If a plan of management for a fishery provides for the management of the fishery by means of a system that consists of or includes statutory fishing rights, the plan:

                     (a)  may oblige a person who holds, in respect of the fishery, a fishing concession of a particular kind or fishing concessions of particular kinds also to hold, in respect of the fishery, a fishing concession of another kind or fishing concessions of other kinds, as stated in the plan; and

                     (b)  without limiting the generality of paragraph (a), may oblige a person who holds, in respect of the fishery, a fishing right of a particular kind or fishing rights of particular kinds also to hold, in respect of the fishery, a fishing right of another kind or fishing rights of other kinds, as stated in the plan; and

                     (c)  in respect of each kind of fishing right that a person holds in respect of the fishery—may do either or both of the following:

                              (i)  oblige the person to hold not fewer than such number of fishing rights of that kind as is stated in the plan or worked out using a formula so stated;

                             (ii)  oblige the person not to hold more than such number of fishing rights of that kind as is stated in the plan or worked out using a formula so stated.

          (6D)  A plan of management for a fishery must contain measures directed at reducing to a minimum:

                     (a)  the incidental catch of fish not taken under and in accordance with that plan; and

                     (b)  the incidental catch of other species.

             (7)  A plan of management for a fishery must:

                     (a)  if the plan makes provision in relation to the management
 of the fishery by means of a system of statutory fishing rights—provide for registration of persons who are to be eligible for the grant of fishing rights and specify the conditions relevant to such registration; and

                     (b)  contain a statement of any right of review that a person has in relation to such registration or the grant, or refusal to make a grant, of a fishing concession.

             (8)  A plan of management may make provision in relation to a matter by applying, adopting or incorporating, with or without modification:

                     (a)  a provision of any Act or any regulation made under an Act, or of any other determination, as in force at a particular time or as in force from time to time; or

                     (b)  any matter contained in any other instrument or writing as in force or existing at the time when the determination takes effect.

             (9)  A plan of management has no effect to the extent that it is inconsistent with a provision of this Act.

           (10)  While a plan of management is in force for a fishery, AFMA must perform its functions, and exercise its powers, under this Act in relation to the fishery in accordance with the plan of management.

           (11)  AFMA may, by writing under its common seal, delegate any powers conferred on it under a plan of management in accordance with paragraph (5A)(a) or (6)(aa) to the CEO, but to no other person.

##### <a id="17A"></a>17A  Register of persons concerned about plans of management

             (1)  AFMA must maintain a register containing a list of the names and postal addresses of persons and organisations who are to be notified of, or of determinations affecting the preparation of, draft plans of management.

             (2)  As soon as is practicable after the commencement of this section and on each anniversary of that commencement, AFMA must give public notice:

                     (a)  inviting persons and organisations to have their names and postal addresses entered on the register; and

                     (b)  in the case of the second or a later notice—inviting persons and organisations on the register (if any) to have their names and postal addresses left on the register.

             (3)  A notice must state that the acceptance of an invitation:

                     (a)  is to be in writing, sent to AFMA at a place specified in the notice and accompanied by particulars of the name and postal address of the acceptor; and

                     (b)  is to be given:

                              (i)  in the case of a person, or organisation, in existence on the publication of the notice—within one month after that publication; and

                             (ii)  in any other case—within 12 months after that publication.

             (4)  Where a person or organisation accepts an invitation in the way required by the notice, AFMA is to enter, or retain, the name and postal address of the person or organisation on the register.

             (5)  AFMA may vary the address on the register of a person or organisation at the written request of the person or organisation.

             (6)  AFMA must remove the name and address of a person or organisation from the register if:

                     (a)  in the case of a name and address that was on the register before the most recent notice under subsection (2)—the invitation to keep that name and address on the register was not accepted within one month after the publication of that notice; or

                     (b)  the person or organisation makes a written request for the removal; or

                     (c)  AFMA becomes satisfied that:

                              (i)  in the case of a natural person—the person has died; or

                             (ii)  in any other case—the person or organisation has ceased to exist.

             (7)  In subsection (2), a reference to public notice is a reference to a notice published:

                     (a)  in the _Gazette_; and

                     (b)  in each State and internal Territory in a newspaper circulating generally in that State or Territory; and

                     (c)  in each external Territory that the Minister considers appropriate (if any) in a newspaper circulating generally in that external Territory.

##### <a id="18"></a>18  Action after determining a plan of management

             (1)  When AFMA has determined a plan of management for a fishery, it must:

                     (a)  submit the plan to the Minister; and

                     (b)  inform the Minister of the nature of any representations it received, and the consultations it conducted, before determining the plan.

             (2)  The Minister must accept the plan if it appears to the Minister that:

                     (a)  AFMA gave due consideration to any representations it received, and conducted adequate consultations, before determining the plan; and

                     (b)  the plan is consistent with AFMA’s corporate plan and current annual operational plan.

             (3)  If the Minister does not accept the plan, the Minister must refer it to AFMA and inform AFMA why it was not accepted.

             (4)  When the plan has been so referred to AFMA, AFMA must, as soon as practicable after receipt of the plan, take such steps as appear to it to be necessary to ensure acceptance of the plan by the Minister and again submit the plan to the Minister.

             (5)  If the Minister again does not accept the plan, the procedures mentioned in subsections (3) and (4) continue to apply in relation to the plan until it is accepted by the Minister or withdrawn by AFMA.

##### <a id="19"></a>19  Tabling, disallowance etc. of determinations

             (1)  AFMA must cause to be published in the _Gazette_, in respect of each determination made under section 17 and accepted by the Minister, notice of:

                     (a)  the fact that the determination has been made; and

                     (b)  the place or places where copies of the determination can be obtained.

             (2)  Sections 48 (other than paragraph (1)(a)), 48A, 48B, 49 and 50 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ apply to determinations as if, in those sections, references to regulations were references to determinations and references to a regulation were references to a provision of a determination.

             (3)  Determinations are not statutory rules within the meaning of the _Statutory Rules Publication Act 1903_.

             (5)  A determination is taken to be an enactment for the purposes of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_.

##### <a id="20"></a>20  Amendment or revocation of plan of management

             (1)  AFMA may at any time amend a plan of management.

             (2)  If AFMA amends a plan of management, it must:

                     (a)  give written notification of that fact to each person who is the holder of a statutory fishing right granted in accordance with the plan; and

                     (b)  inform the person where copies of the amended plan may be obtained.

             (3)  AFMA may revoke a plan of management.

             (4)  Where a plan of management for a fishery is revoked under subsection (3), statutory fishing rights, fishing permits, foreign fishing licences, scientific permits, foreign master fishing licences and fish receiver permits granted by AFMA that relate to the fishery cease to have effect in relation to the fishery.

             (5)  Sections 17, 18 and 19 apply in relation to an amendment of a plan of management and the revocation of a plan of management in the same way as they apply to a plan of management prepared under section 17.

### Division 3—Statutory fishing rights

##### <a id="21"></a>21  Nature of a statutory fishing right

             (1)  For the purposes of this Act, each of the following rights is a separate statutory fishing right:

                     (a)  a right to take a particular quantity of fish, or to take a particular quantity of fish of a particular species or type, from, or from a particular area in, a managed fishery;

                     (b)  a right to a particular proportion of the fishing capacity that is permitted, by or under a plan of management, for, or for a part of, a managed fishery;

                     (c)  a right to engage in fishing in a managed fishery at a particular time or times, on a particular number of days, during a particular number of weeks or months, or in accordance with any combination of the above, during a particular period or periods;

                     (d)  a right to use a boat in a managed fishery for purposes stated in a plan of management;

                     (e)  a right to use particular fishing equipment in a managed fishery;

                      (f)  a right to use, in a managed fishery, fishing equipment that is of a particular kind, of a particular size or of a particular quantity or is a combination of any of the above;

                     (g)  a right to use a particular type of boat in a managed fishery;

                     (h)  a right to use a boat of a particular size or having a particular engine power, or of a particular size and having a particular engine power, in a managed fishery;

                      (i)  any other right in respect of fishing in a managed fishery.

          (1A)  A plan of management for a fishery may do any one or more of the following:

                     (a)  provide for a statutory fishing right of a kind mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) even though, in a particular period, the quantity of fish to which the fishing right relates is nil or negligible;

                     (b)  provide for a statutory fishing right of a kind mentioned in paragraph (1)(b) even though the proportion of fishing capacity to which the fishing right relates would result in a nil or negligible quantity of fish;

                     (c)  provide for a statutory fishing right of a kind mentioned in paragraph (1)(f) even though it may be impracticable to make or use fishing equipment of the size or quantity, or size and quantity, to which the fishing right relates;

                     (d)  provide for a statutory fishing right of a kind mentioned in paragraph (1)(h) even though it may be impracticable to build or use a boat of the size or having the engine power, or of the size and having the engine power, to which the fishing right relates.

          (1B)  For the purposes of subsection (1C), the fishing rights in respect of a particular fishery that are referred to in any one of the following paragraphs together constitute a class of fishing rights:

                     (a)  2 or more identical fishing rights of a kind mentioned in paragraph (1)(a);

                     (b)  2 or more identical fishing rights of a kind mentioned in paragraph (1)(b);

                     (c)  2 or more identical fishing rights of a kind mentioned in paragraph (1)(c);

                     (d)  2 or more identical fishing rights of a kind mentioned in paragraph (1)(f);

                     (e)  2 or more identical fishing rights of a kind mentioned in paragraph (1)(h).

          (1C)  If a person holds a class of fishing rights in respect of a managed fishery, the fishing rights in the class together confer fishing rights in respect of:

                     (a)  if the fishing rights in the class are fishing rights of a kind mentioned in paragraph (1)(a)—a quantity of fish, or of fish of the relevant species or type, equal to the sum of the quantities of fish, or of fish of that species or type, in relation to, or in relation to the area in, the fishery, stated in the fishing rights in the class; or

                     (b)  if the fishing rights in the class are fishing rights of a kind mentioned in paragraph (1)(b)—a proportion of fishing capacity equal to the sum of the proportions of the fishing capacity stated in the fishing rights in the class; or

                     (c)  if the fishing rights in the class are fishing rights of a kind mentioned in paragraph (1)(c) and each fishing right relates to a particular number of days, weeks or months during a particular period or periods—a number of days, weeks or months equal to the sum of the numbers of days, weeks or months, as the case may be, during that period or those periods, stated in the fishing rights in the class; or

                     (d)  if the fishing rights in the class are fishing rights of a kind mentioned in paragraph (1)(f)—fishing equipment the total size or quantity of which is not greater than the sum of the sizes or quantities, or the total size and total quantity of which are not greater than the sum of the sizes and the sum of the quantities, as the case may be, stated in the fishing rights in the class;

                     (e)  if the fishing rights in the class are fishing rights of a kind mentioned in paragraph (1)(h)—a boat of a size not greater than the sum of the sizes, having an engine power not greater than the sum of the engine powers, or of a size not greater than the sum of the sizes and having an engine power not greater than the sum of the engine powers, as the case may be, stated in the fishing rights in the class.

             (2)  A fishing right may authorise fishing:

                     (a)  by or from an Australian boat; and

                     (b)  if the relevant plan of management so provides—by or from a foreign boat.

##### <a id="22"></a>22  AFMA to establish system of statutory fishing rights

             (1)  Where a plan of management provides for the management by AFMA of a fishery by means of a system of statutory fishing rights, AFMA is to establish and administer such a system in accordance with the plan.

             (2)  AFMA is to give to a person to whom it grants a fishing right a certificate evidencing the grant of the fishing right.

             (3)  A fishing right is granted subject to the following conditions:

                     (a)  the holder of the fishing right must comply with any obligations imposed by, or imposed by AFMA under, the relevant plan of management on the holder of such a fishing right;

                     (b)  the fishing right will cease to have effect if the plan of management for the fishery to which the fishing right relates is revoked under subsection 20(3);

                     (c)  the fishing right may, under subsection 75(7), cease to have effect or, under subsection 79(3), cease to apply to a fishery;

                     (d)  the fishing right may be cancelled under section 39;

                     (e)  no compensation is payable because the fishing right is cancelled, ceases to have effect or ceases to apply to a fishery.

Note:          Sections 42 and 42A also impose conditions on statutory fishing rights.

             (4)  A fishing right:

                     (a)  is subject to such other conditions as are specified in the certificate, including conditions relating to the suspension or cancellation of the fishing right and the transferability or otherwise of the fishing right; and

                     (b)  comes into force on the day specified for the purpose in the certificate, or, if no day is so specified, on the day on which it is granted; and

                     (c)  subject to this Act, remains in force:

                              (i)  until the day specified for the purpose in the certificate; or

                             (ii)  if no such day is specified, until cancelled or surrendered or it otherwise ceases to have effect, under this Act.

             (5)  AFMA may, by written notice given to the holder of a fishing right, whether or not at the request of the holder, vary or revoke a condition of the fishing right (not being a condition mentioned in subsection (3)) or specify a condition or a further condition to which the fishing right is to be subject.

          (5A)  After the commencement of this subsection and without limiting the generality of subsection (5), if a statutory fishing right authorises an Australian-flagged boat to fish on the high seas, AFMA may attach a further condition to that right to the effect that another boat may not be substituted for the first-mentioned boat without AFMA’s prior written agreement to the substitution.

             (6)  A fishing right ceases to be in force if the holder of the fishing right surrenders it by written notice given to AFMA.

##### <a id="23"></a>23  Certain decisions to be provisional

             (1)  Where AFMA or a Joint Authority makes a decision as to the person or persons to whom the grant of a fishing right in a managed fishery is to be made, not being a grant or grants to be made after:

                     (a)  the holding of an auction in respect of the grant; or

                     (b)  the calling of tenders in respect of the grant;

the following provisions of this section apply.

             (2)  AFMA or the Joint Authority, as the case may be, by notice published in the _Gazette_, must set out the name of the person or persons to whom the fishing rights are to be granted and a summary of the fishing rights to be granted to each such person.

             (3)  A grant of a fishing right must not be made to such a person:

                     (a)  before the end of the period within which, under section 143, applications to the Panel may be made for review of the decision in relation to the grant; or

                     (b)  if an application in relation to the decision is made to the Panel under section 143—before the application is dealt with by the Panel or otherwise disposed of.

### Division 4—Ways of granting statutory fishing rights

##### <a id="24"></a>24  Notice of intention to grant fishing rights

             (1)  AFMA may, by public notice, declare that it intends to grant a fishing right or fishing rights specified in the notice in relation to fishing in a specified managed fishery.

             (2)  A reference in subsection (1) to public notice is a reference to notice published:

                     (a)  in the _Gazette_; and

                     (b)  in each State and Territory, in a newspaper circulating throughout that State or Territory; and

                     (c)  in such other newspaper or publication (if any) that appears to AFMA to be appropriate in the circumstances.

##### <a id="25"></a>25  Contents of notice

                   AFMA must, in a notice under section 24:

                     (a)  describe the fishing activities that will be authorised by the fishing right or fishing rights; and

                     (b)  specify the way in which the grant is to be made and, if the grant is to be made otherwise than by auction or tender, give full particulars of the procedures to be followed for selecting a person to whom the grant will be made available under section 29; and

                     (c)  set out the conditions (if any) that are to be satisfied by persons applying under section 26 for registration as eligible persons for the grant before they may be so registered; and

                     (d)  if an auction is to be held, specify the lowest bid that will be a qualifying bid for the purposes of subsection 29(1); and

                     (e)  specify:

                              (i)  the fees (if any) payable by persons applying for registration; and

                             (ii)  the period (if any) for which the fishing right will be in force unless it is sooner cancelled or otherwise ceases to apply or have effect; and

                            (iii)  if the grant is to be made otherwise than by auction or by calling tenders—the amount (if any) that is the amount of charge on the grant for the purposes of the _Statutory Fishing Rights Charge Act 1991_; and

                            (iv)  whether any charge imposed on the grant under the _Statutory Fishing Rights Charge Act 1991_ is to be paid in one lump sum or by instalments and, if the charge is to be paid by instalments, the number and frequency of those instalments; and

                             (v)  the right of review available to persons in relation to the grant of, or the refusal to grant, a fishing right; and

                            (vi)  an address from which copies of the plan of management may be obtained; and

                           (vii)  any other matter in respect of the grant that, in the opinion of AFMA, should be notified to prospective applicants; and

                      (f)  invite interested persons to apply to AFMA, in the approved form, within the period specified in the notice, to be registered as eligible persons for the grant.

##### <a id="26"></a>26  Registration of applicants

             (1)  A person may apply to AFMA, in the approved form, for registration as an eligible person for a grant of a fishing right.

             (2)  Subject to section 31K, AFMA must register as an eligible person for a grant of a fishing right each applicant who:

                     (a)  satisfies the conditions (if any) for registration specified in the plan of management in relation to the grant; and

                     (b)  has paid the prescribed fee; and

                     (c)  in the case of an applicant tendering for the grant—has complied with subsections 27(2) and (3).

             (3)  AFMA must, as soon as practicable, notify the applicant in writing of its decision to register or not to register the applicant as an eligible person for a grant of a fishing right and of the right of review that the person has in relation to that decision.

##### <a id="27"></a>27  Tenders for fishing rights

             (1)  This section applies where, under a plan of management, tenders are to be called in respect of the grant of a fishing right or fishing rights.

             (2)  An application for registration must be accompanied by a tender made in accordance with subsection (3).

             (3)  The tender must:

                     (a)  specify the amount that the applicant is willing to pay to the Commonwealth for the grant; and

                     (b)  be enclosed in a sealed, opaque envelope on which is written only:

                              (i)  the name and address of the applicant; and

                             (ii)  words identifying the grant to which the tender relates.

             (4)  AFMA must take reasonable steps to ensure that the envelope containing the tender is kept in such a way as to prevent premature disclosure of the amount specified in the tender and, in particular, must take reasonable steps to ensure that the envelope is not interfered with until it is opened in accordance with the regulations.

##### <a id="28"></a>28  Prescribed procedures for grant of fishing rights

             (1)  Where a grant of a fishing right is required to be made by auction or tender, the regulations must prescribe the procedures to be followed for selecting the person to whom the grant will be made available under section 29.

             (2)  Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), those procedures must include:

                     (a)  in the case of an auction—the procedures to be followed for:

                              (i)  holding the auction; and

                             (ii)  where a grant of a fishing right, being a grant that was available to a person under section 29 as a result of an auction, has ceased to be so available, holding another auction in respect of the grant; and

                     (b)  in the case of tenders—the procedures to be followed for:

                              (i)  opening the envelopes containing the tenders lodged by the persons registered under subsection 26(2) as eligible persons for the grant; and

                             (ii)  recording the amount specified in each of those tenders; and

                            (iii)  ranking those persons by reference to the amounts so recorded; and

                     (d)  the preparation, where tenders have been called, of a list (in this Division called the **_precedence list_**) of all the persons who have been registered under section 26 as eligible persons for the grant in the order in which they have, in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the regulations, been ranked for the purposes of the grant.

##### <a id="29"></a>29  Grant made available to highest bidder etc.

             (1)  Where an auction has been held in respect of the grant of a fishing right, the grant is available to the person who made the highest qualifying bid for the grant at the auction.

             (2)  Where tenders have been called in respect of the grant of a fishing right, the grant is available to the person ranked highest on the precedence list prepared for the purposes of the grant.

             (3)  Where subsections (1) and (2) do not apply in relation to a grant of a fishing right, the grant is available to the person selected in accordance with the procedures specified for that purpose in the plan of management relating to the grant.

             (4)  Where a grant of a fishing right is available to a person under this section, AFMA must, as soon as practicable:

                     (a)  notify that fact in writing to that person and to each other person who was registered under section 26 as an eligible person for the grant of that fishing right; and

                     (b)  give to each such person a statement in writing of the reasons for making the grant so available and of any right of review that the person has in relation to the decision to make the grant so available.

##### <a id="30"></a>30  Amount of charge to be tendered

             (1)  If a person to whom a grant becomes available under subsection 29(1) does not, immediately after having been notified of that fact, tender the amount of charge due and payable at that time under the _Statutory Fishing Rights Charge Act 1991_ in respect of the grant, the grant ceases to be available to the person.

             (2)  If, within 30 days after a grant of fishing rights has become available to a person, either because of subsection 29(2) or (3) or because of a previous application of this subsection, the person does not tender the amount of any charge due and payable under the _Statutory Fishing Rights Charge Act 1991_ in respect of the grant:

                     (a)  the grant ceases to be available to the person; and

                     (b)  if a precedence list has been prepared for the purposes of the grant:

                              (i)  the name of the person is, by force of this subsection, deleted from the list; and

                             (ii)  the grant is available to the person who then becomes the highest ranking person on that list.

##### <a id="31"></a>31  AFMA to grant fishing right

                   Upon the request of a person to whom the grant of a fishing right is available, AFMA must grant the fishing right to that person.

### Division 4A—Statutory fishing rights options

##### <a id="31A"></a>31A  Options arising when plan of management for fishery is revoked

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), if a plan of management for a fishery (the **_former plan_**) is revoked, each person (a **_former holder of fishing rights_**) who held statutory fishing rights of a particular class of fishing rights (the **_relevant class_**) in respect of the fishery under the former plan immediately before it was revoked holds a statutory fishing rights option in respect of fishing rights of the relevant class.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply if:

                     (a)  a new plan of management is determined for the fishery immediately after the revocation of the former plan; and

                     (b)  the new plan is in all substantial respects identical to the former plan; and

                     (c)  the persons who held statutory fishing rights under the former plan are granted equivalent statutory fishing rights under the new plan.

             (3)  Subsection 21(1B) applies in determining the kinds of statutory fishing rights that together constitute a class of fishing rights in respect of a fishery for the purposes of this Division, except that fishing rights that, in AFMA’s opinion, are substantially the same are taken to be identical for the purposes of that subsection.

             (4)  A **_statutory fishing rights option_** entitles the holder of the option to be granted statutory fishing rights of the relevant class under any plan of management (the **_new plan_**) determined for a fishery after the revocation of the former plan if section 31B or 31C applies to the new plan. The nature and extent of the entitlements are set out in subsection 31B(2) or 31C(2), as the case may be.

##### <a id="31B"></a>31B  Rights of option holder where the new plan of management is the same or substantially the same as the former plan of management

             (1)  This section applies to the new plan if:

                     (a)  the new plan applies to a geographical area that consists of or includes the whole or a part of the geographical area to which the former plan applied; and

                     (b)  the description (other than the description of the geographical area) of the fishery to which the new plan applies is, in AFMA’s opinion, the same, or substantially the same, as the description of the fishery to which the former plan applied; and

                     (c)  the new plan provides for the granting of classes of statutory fishing rights that are the same, or substantially the same, as the classes of statutory fishing rights provided for in the former plan; and

                     (d)  under the new plan the only persons who are entitled to be granted statutory fishing rights are persons who hold statutory fishing rights options in respect of statutory fishing rights under the new plan.

             (2)  If a person holds a statutory fishing rights option in respect of statutory fishing rights under the new plan, the option entitles the person, subject to subsections (3) and (4), to be granted under the new plan, to the extent to which the person exercises the option in accordance with subsection 31D(1), the number of statutory fishing rights of the relevant class worked out in accordance with the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00394/Html/FishMangmtAct1991_WD02_image002.gif)

where:

                    <a name="person-previou-right"></a>**_person’s previous rights_** means the number of statutory fishing rights of the relevant class held by:

                     (a)  if the person was a former holder of fishing rights—the person; or

                     (b)  otherwise—the former holder of fishing rights from whose statutory fishing rights under the former plan the person directly or indirectly became entitled to the option;

under the former plan immediately before it was revoked.

                    <a name="total-previou-right"></a>**_total previous rights_** means the total number of statutory fishing rights of the relevant class held by all persons under the former plan immediately before it was revoked.

                    <a name="total-new-right"></a>**_total new rights_** means the total number of statutory fishing rights of the relevant class that are available to be granted under the new plan.

             (3)  If the number of statutory fishing rights worked out under subsection (2) includes a fraction, the number is to be rounded off to the next highest or lowest whole number, as AFMA determines to be reasonable in the circumstances.

             (4)  In making a determination under subsection (3), AFMA may have regard to any matters that it considers appropriate, including the total number of statutory fishing rights of the relevant class that are available to be granted under the new plan.

##### <a id="31C"></a>31C  Rights of option holder where new plan of management has some features in common with the former plan of management

             (1)  This section applies to the new plan if:

                     (a)  in AFMA’s opinion section 31B does not apply to the new plan; and

                     (b)  the new plan applies to a geographical area that consists of or includes the whole or a part of the geographical area to which the former plan applied; and

                     (c)  at least one of the species of fish in respect of which statutory fishing rights are available to be granted under the new plan (except any species that is a by-catch) was also a species of fish in respect of which statutory fishing rights were granted under the former plan immediately before it was revoked.

             (2)  If a person holds a statutory fishing rights option in respect of statutory fishing rights under the new plan, the option entitles the person to be granted such number of such classes of statutory fishing rights under the new plan as AFMA determines to be fair and equitable having particular regard to the number and classes of statutory fishing rights:

                     (a)  if the person was a former holder of fishing rights—held by the person; or

                     (b)  otherwise—held by the former holder of fishing rights from whose fishing rights under the former plan the person directly or indirectly became entitled to the option;

under the former plan immediately before it was revoked.

             (3)  In determining the number of a class of statutory fishing rights to be granted to a person under the new plan in accordance with subsection (2), AFMA must take into account:

                     (a)  the extent to which the new plan applies to the fishery to which the former plan applied; and

                     (b)  the number and classes of statutory fishing rights:

                              (i)  if the person was a former holder of fishing rights—held by the person; or

                             (ii)  otherwise—held by the former holder of fishing rights from whose fishing rights under the former plan the person directly or indirectly became entitled to the option;

                            under the former plan immediately before it was revoked; and

                     (c)  the procedures to be followed under the new plan for the granting of fishing rights; and

                     (d)  the conditions relevant to the registration under the new plan of persons who are to be eligible for the grant of statutory fishing rights.

##### <a id="31D"></a>31D  Exercise and lapsing of option

             (1)  A person who holds a statutory fishing rights option is taken to exercise the option if the person has received a notice under paragraph 31K(1)(a) and, within the period stated in the notice, notifies AFMA, by writing signed by the person, that the person exercises the option in respect of all, or a stated number, of the statutory fishing rights to which the option relates.

             (2)  If a person does not exercise a statutory fishing rights option in respect of all or some of the statutory fishing rights to which the option relates, the option lapses in respect of the statutory fishing rights in respect of which the option is not exercised.

##### <a id="31E"></a>31E  The Register of Statutory Fishing Rights Options

             (1)  AFMA is to keep a Register of Statutory Fishing Rights Options (the **_Register_**).

             (2)  The Register may be kept wholly or partly by use of a computer.

             (3)  If the Register is kept wholly or partly by use of a computer:

                     (a)  references in this Act to an entry in the Register include references to a record of particulars kept by use of a computer and comprising the Register or part of the Register; and

                     (b)  references in this Act to particulars being registered, or entered in the Register, include references to the keeping of a record of those particulars as part of the Register by use of the computer.

             (4)  The Register must, in relation to each statutory fishing rights option:

                     (a)  set out the name and address of the person who for the time being holds the option; and

                     (b)  contain such particulars as are necessary to identify the former plan whose revocation gave rise to the option; and

                     (c)  set out the number and class of statutory fishing rights to which the option relates; and

                     (d)  if the option has been exercised in respect of any statutory fishing rights—state the date of the exercise and the number and class of rights in respect of which the option has been exercised; and

                     (e)  if the option has lapsed in respect of any statutory fishing rights—state the date of the lapse and the number and class of rights in respect of which the option has lapsed.

##### <a id="31F"></a>31F  Creation etc. of interests in statutory fishing rights options

             (1)  This section applies to a dealing that would, apart from subsection (2), have the effect of creating, assigning, transmitting or extinguishing an interest in a statutory fishing rights option.

             (2)  The dealing has no effect of a kind mentioned in subsection (1) until it is registered under this section.

             (3)  A party to the dealing may lodge with AFMA:

                     (a)  an application, in the form approved by AFMA, for registration of the dealing; and

                     (b)  the instrument evidencing the dealing; and

                     (c)  an instrument setting out such particulars (if any) as are prescribed for the purposes of an application for registration of the dealing; and

                     (d)  one copy each of the application and of the instruments mentioned in paragraphs (b) and (c).

             (4)  A party to the dealing may, instead of lodging the instrument evidencing the dealing, lodge with AFMA a summary of that instrument containing the particulars required by AFMA for the purposes of this subsection.

             (5)  Subject to subsections (6) and (7), if an application for registration of the dealing, either the instrument evidencing the dealing or a summary of that instrument that complies with subsection (4), and the other documents referred to in paragraphs (3)(c) and (d), are lodged with AFMA, AFMA must:

                     (a)  register the dealing by entering in the Register the following particulars:

                              (i)  the name and address of the person acquiring the interest in the option;

                             (ii)  the number and class of statutory fishing rights to which the dealing relates; and

                     (b)  endorse on the instrument evidencing the dealing and the copy of that instrument the fact of the entry having been made together with the date and time of the making of the entry.

             (6)  For the purposes of this Division, if a statutory fishing rights option is assigned to a person in respect of some only of the statutory fishing rights to which the option relates:

                     (a)  the assignee is taken to hold a new statutory fishing rights option in respect of the statutory fishing rights assigned to the assignee; and

                     (b)  the assignor continues to hold the first-mentioned option in respect of such of the statutory fishing rights as have not been assigned.

             (7)  AFMA may only refuse to register a dealing if the registration of the dealing would be contrary to the requirements of the new plan or a condition of statutory fishing rights in respect of which the option is held.

             (8)  If a dealing is registered:

                     (a)  the copies referred to in paragraph (3)(d) and the summary (if any) lodged under subsection (4) are to be kept by AFMA; and

                     (b)  if a summary is not lodged under subsection (4), the copy of the instrument evidencing the dealing is to be made available for inspection in accordance with this Division; and

                     (c)  if a summary is lodged under subsection (4), the summary is to be made available for inspection in accordance with this Division; and

                     (d)  the original instrument is to be returned to the person who made the application for registration.

             (9)  If a dealing creates a charge over some or all of a body corporate’s assets, the party to the dealing who lodged the application for registration of the dealing is taken to have complied with paragraph (3)(b), and with paragraph (3)(d) in so far as that paragraph requires a copy of the instrument evidencing the dealing to be lodged with AFMA, if the party has lodged with AFMA 2 copies of each document required to be lodged with the Australian Securities Commission relating to the creation of that charge under section 263 of the _Corporations Act 2001_.

           (10)  AFMA is not concerned with the effect in law of any instrument lodged under this section.

##### <a id="31G"></a>31G  Claims of interests in statutory fishing rights options

             (1)  If a person lodges with AFMA a notice, in the form approved by AFMA:

                     (a)  stating that a dealing of a kind referred to in subsection 31F(1) that is described in the statement has taken place; and

                     (b)  claiming that, if the dealing were registered, the person would have an interest in a statutory fishing rights option; and

                     (c)  setting out particulars of the interest; and

                     (d)  requesting AFMA to register the claim;

AFMA must register the claim by entering in the register the person’s name and particulars of the interest claimed.

             (2)  If, after the registration of a claim to an interest in a statutory fishing rights option, the claimant, by notice lodged with AFMA in the form approved by AFMA, withdraws the claim, AFMA must cancel the registration by omitting from the register the entry relating to the claim.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  a claim to an interest in a statutory fishing rights option is registered; and

                     (b)  an application is made to AFMA for registration of a dealing in respect of the option;

AFMA must not register the dealing unless:

                     (c)  AFMA has given written notice of the application to the person whose name appears in the register in relation to the claim; and

                     (d)  either:

                              (i)  the person has withdrawn the claim under subsection (2); or

                             (ii)  21 days have elapsed since the notice was given to the person.

##### <a id="31H"></a>31H  Trusts not registrable

                   Notice of any kind of trust relating to a statutory fishing rights option is not receivable by AFMA and must not be entered in the Register.

##### <a id="31J"></a>31J  Power of holder of statutory fishing rights option to deal with option

             (1)  The holder of a statutory fishing rights option may, subject only to any rights appearing in the Register to be vested in another person, deal with the option, in respect of all or any of the statutory fishing rights to which the option relates, as absolute owner and give good discharges for any consideration for any such dealing.

             (2)  Subsection (1) only protects a person who deals with a holder of a statutory fishing rights option as a purchaser in good faith for value and without notice of any fraud on the part of the holder.

             (3)  Equities in relation to a statutory fishing rights option may be enforced against the holder of the option except to the prejudice of a person protected by subsection (2).

##### <a id="31K"></a>31K  Obligations of AFMA in respect of granting statutory fishing rights under the new plan

             (1)  AFMA must not grant any statutory fishing rights under the new plan unless:

                     (a)  it has given written notice to each person who holds a statutory fishing rights option in relation to the plan asking the person to tell AFMA in writing within the period of 30 days after a date stated in the notice (being a date not earlier than 2 days after the day on which the notice is sent):

                              (i)  whether the person wishes to exercise the option; and

                             (ii)  if so, the number of fishing rights in respect of which the person exercises the option; and

                     (b)  that period has elapsed.

             (2)  AFMA must develop procedures that will ensure that the holders of options that are exercised are granted the statutory fishing rights under the new plan to which they are entitled.

             (3)  AFMA may remove particulars of an option from the Register when all the statutory fishing rights to which the option relates have been granted or the option has lapsed.

##### <a id="31L"></a>31L  Administrative provisions

                   Sections 52 to 57 apply to the Register of Statutory Fishing Rights Options and documents subject to inspection under this Division in the same way as those sections apply to the Register of Statutory Fishing Rights and documents subject to inspection under Part 4.

### Division 5—Fishing permits

##### <a id="32"></a>32  Grant of fishing permits

             (1)  AFMA may, upon application made in the approved form, grant to a person a fishing permit authorising, subject to subsections (1A), (1B), (1C) and (1D), the use by that person, or by a person acting on that person’s behalf, of an Australian boat for fishing in a specified area of the AFZ or a specified fishery.

          (1A)  Subject to subsections (1C) and (1D), if an Australian boat is specified in the permit, the permit authorises the use as mentioned in subsection (1) of:

                     (a)  subject to paragraph (b)—that boat; or

                     (b)  if the person to whom the permit is granted, from time to time, by written notice given to AFMA, nominates for the purposes of the permit another Australian boat in lieu of that boat—the boat so nominated.

          (1B)  Subject to subsections (1C) and (1D), if no Australian boat is specified in the permit, the permit authorises the use as mentioned in subsection (1) of such Australian boat (if any) as the person to whom the permit is granted, from time to time, by written notice given to AFMA, nominates for the purposes of the permit.

        (1BA)  After the commencement of this subsection, a boat may be nominated under subsection (1A) or (1B) only if:

                     (a)  either:

                              (i)  the boat’s particulars are already registered on the Fishing Permits Register; or

                             (ii)  the boat is an Australian boat; and

                     (b)  the acceptance of the nomination would not be contrary to:

                              (i)  a condition of the permit; or

                             (ii)  the regulations; and

                     (c)  for the purposes of a permit to fish in a specified fishery on the high seas—the boat is an Australian-flagged boat.

          (1C)  The permit does not authorise the use of an Australian boat unless the boat complies with any conditions to which the permit is subject.

          (1D)  If subsection 16A(1) prohibits AFMA from authorising a use of a boat for a period described in subsection 16A(2), the permit does not authorise the use of the boat during the period.

Note:          Subsection 16A(1) prohibits AFMA from authorising the use of a boat to fish on the high seas for a conserved fish stock if the boat has been used in the commission of certain offences and the penalties for those offences have not been complied with.

             (2)  An application made for the grant of a fishing permit must provide AFMA with such information as it reasonably requires for a proper consideration of the application.

             (3)  Without limiting the operation of subsection (1), AFMA may refuse to grant a fishing permit if it has reason to believe that a requirement of a law of the Commonwealth, or of a State or Territory, has not been complied with in relation to the boat.

             (4)  A fishing permit may authorise the use of a boat:

                     (a)  for commercial fishing generally; or

                     (b)  for recreational fishing generally (whether from a charter boat or otherwise); or

                     (d)  for specified fishing activities, including:

                              (i)  the carrying of fish; or

                             (ii)  the processing of fish; or

                            (iii)  the testing of fishing equipment.

             (5)  A fishing permit is granted subject to the following conditions:

                     (a)  if the fishing permit authorises fishing in a specified managed fishery—the holder of the permit must comply with any obligations imposed by, or imposed by AFMA under, the relevant plan of management on the holder of such a fishing permit;

                     (b)  if the fishing permit authorises fishing in a specified managed fishery—the permit will cease to have effect if the plan of management for the fishery is revoked under subsection 20(3);

                     (c)  the fishing permit may, under subsection 75(7), cease to have effect or, under subsection 79(3), cease to apply to a fishery;

                     (d)  the fishing permit may be cancelled under section 39;

                     (e)  no compensation is payable because the fishing permit is cancelled, ceases to have effect or ceases to apply to a fishery.

Note:          Sections 42 and 42A also impose conditions on fishing permits.

             (6)  A fishing permit:

             (1)  The purpose of this section is to enable quick action to be taken:

                     (a)  to deal with:

                              (i)  emergencies; or

                             (ii)  other circumstances where urgent action is required for purposes related to the management of a fishery; or

                            (iii)  the maintenance of straddling fish stocks, highly migratory fish stocks or ecologically related fish stocks (within the meaning of the Fish Stocks Agreement) before a plan of management is determined, amended or revoked; or

                     (b)  to correct errors or anomalies in a plan of management.

             (2)  If AFMA is satisfied that:

                     (a)  it is necessary to take action for the purpose of this section; and

                     (b)  the action contemplated is consistent with AFMA’s objectives; and

                     (c)  no other action is appropriate;

AFMA may make an order, consistent with this Act and the regulations, with respect to:

                     (d)  any matter directly or indirectly connected with fishing:

                              (i)  in a managed fishery; or

                             (ii)  in the AFZ but not in a managed fishery; or

                            (iii)  that is the subject of an international agreement and occurs outside the AFZ; or

                     (e)  any other matter relating to a managed fishery, being a matter that may be provided for by a plan of management; or

                      (f)  any incidental matter.

             (3)  AFMA may at any time make an order cancelling a previous order.

             (4)  An order ceases to have effect:

                     (a)  on a day specified in the order; or

                     (b)  on being cancelled by another order; or

                     (c)  at the end of 6 months after the order is made;

whichever is soonest.

             (5)  Subject to subsections (6) and (7), AFMA must not make an order the same in substance as a previous order within 6 months after the previous order has ceased to have effect.

             (6)  While an order is in force, AFMA may make one, and only one, further order the same in substance as the first-mentioned order.

             (7)  Nothing in subsections (5) and (6) prevents AFMA from making a further order the same in substance as a previous order to deal with a different emergency.

             (8)  AFMA may, by writing under its common seal, delegate its powers under this section to the CEO, but to no other person.

             (9)  If an order is inconsistent with a provision of:

                     (a)  a plan of management; or

                     (b)  a fishing concession, scientific permit, foreign master fishing licence or fish receiver permit;

the order overrides the provision and, to that extent, the provision has no effect.

           (10)  When an order ceases to have effect, any provision overridden by the order revives, subject to this Act, unless the regulations provide otherwise.

           (11)  An order is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of
 section 46A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

## Part 4—Register of Statutory Fishing Rights

##### <a id="44"></a>44  The Register

             (1)  AFMA is to keep a Register of Statutory Fishing Rights.

##### <a id="46"></a>46  Creation etc. of interests in fishing rights

             (1)  This section applies to a dealing that would, but for subsection (2), have the effect of creating, assigning, transferring, transmitting or extinguishing an interest in a fishing right.

             (2)  The dealing has no effect of a kind mentioned in subsection (1) until it is registered under this section.

             (3)  A party to the dealing may lodge with AFMA:

             (4)  Subject to subsections (4C) and (4D), if an application for registration of the dealing, either the instrument evidencing the dealing or a summary of that instrument that complies with subsection (3A), and the other documents referred to in paragraphs (3)(c) and (d), are lodged with AFMA, AFMA must:

                     (a)  register the dealing by entering in the Register the following particulars:

                     (b)  claiming that, if the dealing were registered, the person would have an interest in a fishing right; and

                     (c)  setting out particulars of the interest; and

                     (d)  requesting AFMA to register the claim;

AFMA must register the claim by entering in the register the person’s name and particulars of the interest claimed.

          (4B)  If, after the registration of a claim to an interest in a fishing right, the claimant, by notice lodged with AFMA in the form approved by AFMA, withdraws the claim, AFMA must cancel the registration by omitting from the register the entry relating to the claim.

          (4C)  If:

                     (a)  a claim to an interest in a fishing right is registered; and

                     (b)  an application is made to AFMA for registration of a dealing in respect of the fishing right;

AFMA must not register the dealing unless:

                     (c)  AFMA has given written notice of the application to the person whose name appears in the register in relation to the claim; and

                     (d)  either:

                              (i)  the person has withdrawn the claim under subsection (4B); or

                             (ii)  21 days have elapsed since the notice was given to the person.

          (4D)  AFMA must register a lease, or transfer of ownership, of a fishing right unless:

                     (a)  the fishing right is suspended under section 38; or

                     (b)  the holder of the fishing right:

                              (i)  is being investigated for a fisheries offence; or

                             (ii)  has been convicted of a fisheries offence; or

                     (c)  a levy on the fishing right that is due has not been paid; or

                     (d)  other circumstances that are prescribed under the regulations exist.

           (4E)  Subsection (4D) applies despite the fact that any requirement in a plan of management relating to the lease, or transfer, has not been satisfied.

             (5)  If a dealing is registered:

                     (a)  the copies referred to in paragraph (3)(d) and the summary (if any) lodged under subsection (3A) are to be kept by AFMA; and

                     (b)  if a summary is not lodged under subsection (3A), the copy of the instrument evidencing the dealing is to be made available for inspection in accordance with this Part; and

                     (c)  if a summary is lodged under subsection (3A), the summary is to be made available for inspection in accordance with this Part; and

                     (d)  the original instrument is to be returned to the person who made the application for registration.

             (6)  If a dealing creates a charge over some or all of a body corporate’s assets, the party to the dealing who lodged the application for registration of the dealing is taken to have complied with paragraph (3)(b), and with paragraph (3)(d) in so far as that paragraph requires a copy of the instrument evidencing the dealing to be lodged with AFMA, if the party has lodged with AFMA 2 copies of each document required to be lodged with the Australian Securities Commission relating to the creation of that charge under section 263 of the _Corporations Act 2001_.

##### <a id="47"></a>47  Trusts not registrable

                   Notice of any kind of trust relating to a fishing right is not receivable by AFMA and must not be registered.

##### <a id="48"></a>48  Power of holder of fishing right to deal with fishing right

             (1)  Except where a condition of a fishing right provides otherwise, a holder of a fishing right may, subject only to any rights appearing in the Register to be vested in another person and to section 49, deal with the fishing right as its absolute owner and give good discharges for any consideration for any such dealing.

             (2)  Subsection (1) only protects a person who deals with such a holder as a purchaser in good faith for value and without notice of any fraud on the part of the holder.

             (3)  Equities in relation to a fishing right may be enforced against the holder of the fishing right except to the prejudice of a person protected by subsection (2).

##### <a id="50"></a>50  Suspension, cancellation etc. of fishing right to be noted in Register

             (1)  Where a fishing right registered under this Part is suspended, cancelled or ceases to have effect (other than because of subsection 43(9)), or a suspension of a fishing right is revoked, then:

                     (b)  if the fishing right is cancelled or ceases to have effect—AFMA must make a notation in the Register to that effect and cancel the registration of the fishing right.

             (2)  Where, because of a decision made by AFMA, a Joint Authority, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or a court, a notation made by AFMA under subsection (1) is no longer correct, AFMA must rectify the Register accordingly.

             (3)  Where:

                     (a)  AFMA does anything under subsection (1) or (2) in relation to a fishing right; and

                     (b)  a person other than the holder of the fishing right has an interest in the fishing right, being an interest in relation to which a dealing has been registered under section 46;

AFMA must give the person written notification of what it has done.

             (4)  Where, because of subsection 43(9), a provision of a fishing right registered under this Part has no effect, AFMA must make a notation in the Register to that effect.

             (5)  Where AFMA has made a notation in the Register under subsection (4) and the relevant provision of the fishing right revives, AFMA must make a notation in the Register to that effect.

##### <a id="51"></a>51  AFMA not concerned with certain matters

                   AFMA is not concerned with the effect in law of any instrument lodged under section 46 and the registration of the dealing does not give to the instrument any effect that it would not have if this Part had not been enacted.

             (2)  If the High Seas Register is kept wholly or partly by use of a computer, subsection (1) is taken to have been complied with, to the extent that the Register is so kept, by giving members of the public access to a computer terminal so that they can inspect the Register, either on a screen or in the form of a computer print-out.

##### <a id="57E"></a>57E  Application of sections 53 to 56

                   Sections 53, 54, 55 and 56 apply to the High Seas Register in like manner as they apply to the Register established and maintained under Part 4.

             (3)  A Joint Authority may be abolished by a further such instrument, but such an instrument does not take effect while there is in operation an arrangement under Division 3 providing that the Joint Authority is to have the management of a particular fishery.

             (4)  The Commonwealth Minister is to cause a copy of every instrument so approved to be published in the _Gazette_ and, subject to subsection (3), the instrument takes effect on the day of publication.

##### <a id="62"></a>62  Functions of Joint Authority

             (5)  A certificate signed by a member of a Joint Authority stating any matter with respect to a delegation of a power under this section by the Joint Authority is prima facie evidence of that matter.

             (6)  Nothing in this Part is intended to prevent the delegation by a Joint Authority, in accordance with the law of a State, of powers conferred on the Joint Authority by the law of that State.

##### <a id="66"></a>66  Procedure of Joint Authorities

             (5)  A decision of the Commonwealth Minister made under subsection (4) has effect as the decision of the Joint Authority.

             (6)  Before deciding in accordance with subsection (4), the Commonwealth Minister must:

                     (a)  submit the matter for consideration by the members of the Australian Fisheries Council, being the body known by that name constituted by the Commonwealth Minister and Ministers of the States and certain of the Territories; and

                     (b)  for that purpose, if so requested by a member of that Council, convene a meeting of that Council;

                     (b)  board a boat in relation to which a fishing concession is in force for the purpose of ascertaining whether a condition of the fishing concession or a provision of a temporary order is being, or has been, complied with and, in furtherance of that purpose, may search the boat and break open any hold, compartment, container or other receptacle on the boat; and

                     (c)  examine anything found by action taken under paragraph (a), (aaa) or (b); and

                     (d)  where the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that there is on any land or in any premises anything that may afford evidence as to the commission of an offence against this Act, with the consent of the owner or occupier of the land or premises or under a warrant issued under section 85:

                              (i)  enter the land or premises; and

                             (ii)  search the land or premises and break open and search any cupboard, drawer, chest, trunk, box, package or other receptacle, whether a fixture or not, in which the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that there is any such thing; and

                      (f)  examine any equipment found in any place, being equipment that the officer has reasonable grounds to believe has been used, is being used, or is intended to be used, for fishing in the AFZ; and

                    (fa)  if a fishing concession provides for the use of equipment of a particular type—require the holder of the concession to give the officer such help as the officer reasonably requires for the purpose of measuring the equipment; and

                              (i)  that is on, in or attached to a boat and that forms part of the boat; and

                             (ii)  that is the property of the Commonwealth because of the operation of section 106AD or that the officer has reasonable grounds to believe is the property of the Commonwealth because of the operation of that section; and

                     (h)  enter on land or premises specified in a fish receiver permit for the purpose of finding out whether a condition of the permit is being, or has been, complied with or whether a person is contravening or has contravened a provision of this Act and, in furtherance of that purpose:

                              (i)  search the land or premises for, and examine, fish; and

                             (ii)  search the land or premises for, inspect, take extracts from, and make copies of, any documents relating to the receiving of fish; and

                            (iii)  if the officer finds, during the course of the search, any thing that he or she believes, on reasonable grounds, may provide evidence of a contravention of a provision of this Act, secure the thing pending the obtaining of a warrant to seize it; and

                      (i)  with the consent of the holder of a fish receiver permit or under a warrant issued under section 85, seize any thing found during the course of a search that the officer believes, on reasonable grounds, may provide evidence of a contravention of this Act; and

                      (j)  without warrant, arrest a person whom the officer has reasonable grounds to believe has committed an offence against this Act; and

                     (k)  if the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that a boat has been used, is being used or is intended to be used in contravention of this Act, require the master of the boat:

                              (i)  if the boat is at a place in Australia or a Territory—to remain in control of the boat at that place; or

                             (ii)  if the boat is not at a place in Australia or a 
 Territory—to bring the boat to such a place, or to a place at sea, specified by the officer and to remain in control of the boat at that place;

                            until an officer permits the master to depart from that place; and

                      (l)  require the master of a boat who, because of a requirement under paragraph (k) or a previous requirement under this paragraph, is in control of the boat at a place to take the boat to another place in Australia or in a Territory, or to a place at sea, specified by the officer and to remain in control of the boat at that place until an officer permits the master to depart from that place; and

                    (m)  bring a boat that the officer has reasonable grounds to believe has been used, is being used or is intended to be used in contravention of this Act to a place in Australia or in a Territory (whether or not the boat has previously been brought to another place or other places) and may remain in control of that boat pending the taking and determination of proceedings in respect of that contravention; and

                      (r)  require a person who is on board a boat in relation to which a fishing concession under this Act is in force, or a Treaty boat in respect of which a Treaty licence is in force, or who is engaged in fishing in the AFZ, or whom he or she reasonably suspects of having committed an offence against this Act, to state the person’s name and address; and

                      (s)  require a person found on any land or premises entered under paragraph (d) or in any vehicle or aircraft detained or searched under paragraph (e):

                              (i)  to state the person’s name and address; or

                             (ii)  to produce any documents in the person’s possession or under the person’s control relating to any fish found on the land or in the premises, vehicle or aircraft; or

                            (iii)  to give information concerning any such fish; and

                      (t)  sell or otherwise dispose of any fish seized by him or her under this Act.

Note:          Schedule 1A gives officers powers relating to detention of suspected illegal foreign fishers.

       (1AA)  Subject to subsection (1AB), the powers of an officer under paragraph (1)(e) in respect of any vehicle or aircraft must not be exercised without either:

                     (a)  the consent of the owner or person in charge of the vehicle or aircraft to the exercise of those powers; or

                     (b)  the obtaining of a warrant under section 85 or 86 authorising the exercise of those powers.

        (1AB)  If:

                     (a)  the owner or person in charge of a vehicle or aircraft referred to in subsection (1AA) refuses to consent to the exercise by an officer of powers under paragraph (1)(e); and

                     (b)  an officer seeking to exercise those powers believes, on reasonable grounds:

                              (i)  that there is in the vehicle or aircraft anything that may afford evidence of an offence against this Act; and

                             (ii)  that the delay that would occur if an application for a warrant were made (either in person or under section 86) would frustrate the effective execution of the warrant;

those powers may be exercised without a warrant but, if that is done, the officer must:

                     (c)  if it is practicable to do so, notify the owner or person in charge of a vehicle or aircraft that the officer will be exercising powers under paragraph (1)(e) without a warrant and that the reasons for the exercise of those powers may be requested; and

                     (d)  as soon as reasonably practicable, record the reasons for the exercise of those powers without a warrant; and

                     (e)  upon request by the owner or person in charge of the vehicle or aircraft—provide the record of those reasons to the person affected by the exercise of those powers.

          (1A)  If an officer takes any action under subparagraph (1)(g)(i) or (ii), the officer must, within 7 days after the action is taken, give written notice of the grounds for the taking of the action to the person believed by the officer:

                     (a)  if the action is taken in relation to any fish—to have taken, processed, carried or landed the fish, as the case may be; or

                     (b)  if the action is taken in relation to any boat—to be the owner of the boat; or

                     (c)  if the action is taken in relation to any net, trap or other equipment—to have used, to be using or to be intending to use the net, trap or other equipment, as the case may be.

Note:          Subdivision C of Division 6 deals with notice of seizure of things under paragraph 84(1)(ga), (gb), (gc) or (gd).

          (1B)  To avoid doubt, the validity of the seizure of a boat by an officer under paragraph (1)(g) is not affected merely because:

                     (a)  the boat is brought or taken under escort to a place; and

                     (b)  the boat had to travel on the high seas to reach the place.

        (1BA)  If there is a restraint on the liberty of a person on a boat resulting from an officer’s exercise of a power under paragraph (1)(g), (k), (l) or (m) (applying of its own force or because of another provision of this Act) in relation to a boat:

                     (a)  the restraint is not unlawful; and

                     (b)  civil or criminal proceedings in respect of the restraint may not be instituted or continued in any court against:

                              (i)  the officer; or

                             (ii)  any person assisting the officer in the exercise of the power; or

                            (iii)  AFMA; or

                            (iv)  the Commonwealth.

This subsection is not intended to affect the jurisdiction of the High Court under section 75 of the Constitution.

          (1C)  To avoid doubt, paragraphs (1)(k) and (l) allow an officer to require the master of a boat to bring or take the boat to a specified place and remain in control of the boat there even if it is necessary for the boat to travel on the high seas to reach the place.

          (1D)  To avoid doubt, paragraph (1)(m) allows an officer to bring a boat to a place and remain in control of it there even if it is necessary for the boat to travel on the high seas to reach the place.

             (2)  Subject to subsection (3), a Pacific Island party officer may, for a relevant Treaty purpose, exercise any of the powers described in paragraphs (1)(a), (c), (g), (k), (l), (n), (o), (p), (q) and (r) and, where a Pacific Island party officer exercises such a power, he or she is taken, for the purposes of this Act, to have exercised the power as an officer.

             (3)  Subsections (4) and (6) apply in relation to the exercise of powers under this section by Pacific Island party officers as if:

                     (a)  references in those subsections to an officer were references to a Pacific Island party officer; and

                     (b)  references in those subsections to an officer’s identity card were references to a document:

                              (i)  issued to a person by a Pacific Island party; and

                             (ii)  identifying the person as a Pacific Island party officer authorised to perform the functions and duties of an observer on a Treaty boat.

             (4)  Where an officer (other than a member of the Defence Force who is in uniform) boards a boat, the officer must:

                     (a)  in the case of a prescribed person—produce, for inspection by the master of the boat, written evidence of the fact that the officer is a prescribed person; or

                     (b)  in any other case—produce, for inspection by the master of the boat, the officer’s identity card;

and, if the officer fails to do so, the officer is not authorised to remain on board the boat.

             (5)  Where an officer (other than a member of the Defence Force who is in uniform) proposes to enter and search, or to detain, a vehicle or aircraft, the officer must, if there is a person in charge of the vehicle or aircraft:

                     (a)  where the officer is a prescribed person—produce, for inspection by the person in charge of the vehicle or aircraft, written evidence of the fact that the officer is a prescribed person; or

                     (b)  in any other case—produce, for inspection by the person in charge of the vehicle or aircraft, the officer’s identity card;

and, if the officer fails to do so, the officer is not authorised to enter and search, or to detain, the vehicle or aircraft.

             (6)  Where an officer (other than a member of the Defence Force who is in uniform) makes a requirement of a person (in this subsection called the **_relevant person_**) under subsection (1) the officer must make all reasonable efforts to identify himself or herself and must, unless subsection (6A) applies:

                     (a)  in the case of a prescribed person—produce, for inspection by the relevant person, written evidence of the fact that the officer is a prescribed person; or

                     (b)  in any other case—produce, for inspection by the relevant person, the officer’s identity card;

and, if the officer fails to do so, the relevant person is not obliged to comply with the requirement.

          (6A)  If the requirement under subsection (1) is made in such circumstances that it is impossible to produce the written evidence referred to in paragraph (6)(a) or the identity card referred to in paragraph (6)(b), as the case requires, at the time of making the requirement, that evidence or identity card must be produced for inspection by the relevant person at the first available opportunity after the making of the requirement.

             (7)  A reference in this section to an offence against, or a contravention of, this Act or a particular provision of this Act includes a reference to an offence against, or a contravention of:

                     (a)  section 6 of the _Crimes Act 1914_; or

                     (b)  section 11.1, 11.4 or 11.5 of the _Criminal Code_;

that relates to this Act or that provision.

             (8)  In this section:

                    <a name="examin"></a>**_examine_** includes count, measure, weigh, grade or gauge.

                    <a name="prescrib-person"></a>**_prescribed person_** means a member or special member of the Australian Federal Police or a member of the police force of a State or Territory or an officer of Customs (as defined in the _Customs Act 1901_).

                    <a name="act"></a>**_this Act_** includes the regulations.

##### <a id="84AA"></a>84AA  Searches under paragraph 84(1)(aaa)

             (1)  A search under paragraph 84(1)(aaa) of a person (the **_subject_**) may only be conducted by an officer of the same sex as the subject.

             (2)  However, if an officer of the same sex as the subject is not available to conduct the search, it may be conducted by another person who:

                     (a)  is of the same sex as the subject; and

                     (b)  agrees, at the request of an officer, to conduct the search.

             (3)  Paragraph 84(1)(aaa) and this section do not authorise the officer or other person:

                     (a)  to remove any of the subject’s clothing; or

                     (b)  to require the subject to remove any of his or her clothing; or

                     (c)  to use more force, or subject the subject to greater indignity, than is reasonably necessary to conduct the search.

             (4)  If, in conducting a search, an officer finds a weapon, or a thing mentioned in subparagraph 84(1)(aaa)(iv) or (v), an officer may:

                     (a)  take possession of the weapon or thing; and

                     (b)  keep the weapon or thing for such time as he or she thinks necessary for the purposes of this Act.

             (5)  If, in conducting a search, the other person finds a weapon or thing mentioned in subsection (4):

                     (a)  he or she must take possession of it and give it to an officer; and

                     (b)  an officer may keep it for such time as he or she thinks necessary for the purposes of this Act.

             (6)  If:

                     (a)  under subsection (4) or (5) an officer is keeping a weapon, or a thing mentioned in subparagraph 84(1)(aaa)(iv), found in a search of the subject; and

                     (b)  the subject is detained under this Act;

the officer may continue to keep the weapon or thing for such time as he or she thinks necessary for the purposes of this Act or the _Migration Act 1958_.

Note:          Once the subject ceases to be detained under this Act, the subject will generally need to be detained under the _Migration Act 1958_ while he or she is in the migration zone (because his or her enforcement visa under that Act will cease to have effect). Subsection (6) ensures the officer can keep the weapon or thing while the subject is detained under this Act or that Act.

##### <a id="84C"></a>84C  Customs officers may carry arms in exercise of powers under this Act

             (1)  Subject to any directions from the Chief Executive Officer of Customs (**_CEO_**), the commander of a Customs vessel:

                     (a)  may issue approved firearms and other approved items of personal defence equipment to officers of Customs under his or her command for the purpose of enabling the safe exercise, by such officers, of powers conferred on them as officers within the meaning of section 4; and

                     (b)  must take all reasonable steps to ensure that approved firearms, and other approved items of personal defence equipment, that are available for issue under paragraph (1)(a), are kept in secure storage at all times when not required for use.

             (2)  Directions given by the CEO for the purposes of subsection 189A(2) of the _Customs Act 1901_ relating to the deployment of approved firearms and other approved items of personal defence equipment may extend to the deployment of such firearms and other items of equipment under this section. 

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  approved firearms and other approved items of personal defence equipment are issued to officers of Customs in accordance with subsection 189A(1) of the _Customs Act 1901_; and

                     (b)  those officers are subsequently required, while carrying such firearms or other items of equipment, to exercise powers conferred on them under this Act;

then:

                     (c)  the deployment of such firearms or other items of equipment has effect as if the firearms or other items of equipment had been issued under this section; and

                     (d)  any directions given by the CEO that relate to any aspect of that deployment have effect accordingly.

             (4)  An officer of Customs is not required under, or by reason of, a law of a State or Territory:

                     (a)  to obtain a licence or permission for the possession or use of an approved firearm or approved item of personal defence equipment in the circumstances set out in this section; or

                     (b)  to register such a firearm or other item of equipment.

             (5)  In this section:

##### <a id="85"></a>85  When search warrants can be issued

             (1)  A magistrate may, upon application by an officer, issue a warrant to search premises if the magistrate is satisfied by information on oath that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that there is, or there will be within the next 72 hours, any evidential material at the premises.

             (2)  If the person applying for the warrant suspects that, in executing the warrant, it will be necessary to use firearms, the person must state the suspicion, and the grounds for the suspicion, in the information.

             (3)  If a magistrate issues a warrant, the magistrate is to set out in the warrant:

                     (a)  the offence to which the warrant relates; and

                     (b)  a description of the premises to which the warrant relates; and

                     (c)  the kinds of evidential material that are to be searched for under the warrant; and

                     (d)  the name of the officer who, unless he or she inserts the name of another officer in the warrant, is to be responsible for executing the warrant; and

                     (e)  the period for which the warrant remains in force, which must not be more than 7 days; and

                      (f)  whether the warrant may be executed at any time or only during particular hours.

             (4)  The magistrate is also to state that the warrant authorises the seizure of a thing (other than evidential material of the kind referred to in paragraph (3)(c)) found at the premises in the course of the search that the executing officer or a person helping believes on reasonable grounds to be:

                     (a)  evidential material in relation to an offence to which the warrant relates; or

                     (b)  a thing relevant to another offence against this Act or the regulations that is an indictable offence;

if the executing officer or a person helping believes on reasonable grounds that seizure of the thing is necessary to prevent its concealment, loss or destruction or its use in committing an offence against this Act or the regulations.

             (5)  Paragraph (3)(e) does not prevent the issue of successive warrants in relation to the same premises.

             (6)  If the application for the warrant is made under section 86, this section applies as if:

                     (a)  subsection (1) referred to 48 hours rather than 72 hours; and

                     (b)  paragraph (3)(e) referred to 48 hours rather than 7 days.

             (7)  A magistrate in New South Wales or the Australian   Capital Territory may issue a warrant in relation to premises in the Jervis Bay  Territory.

             (8)  A magistrate in a State or internal Territory may:

                     (a)  issue a warrant in relation to premises in that State or Territory; or

                     (b)  issue a warrant in relation to premises in an external Territory; or

                     (c)  issue a warrant in relation to premises in another State or internal Territory (including the Jervis Bay Territory) if he or she is satisfied that there are special circumstances that make the issue of the warrant appropriate.

##### <a id="85A"></a>85A  The things that are authorised by a search warrant

             (1)  A warrant authorises the executing officer or a person helping:

                     (a)  to enter the warrant premises and, if the premises are a conveyance, to enter the conveyance, wherever it is; and

                     (b)  to search for and record fingerprints found at the premises and to take samples of things found at the premises for forensic purposes; and

                     (c)  to search the premises for the kinds of evidential material specified in the warrant, and to seize things of that kind found at the premises; and

                     (d)  to seize other things found at the premises in the course of the search that the executing officer or a person helping believes on reasonable grounds to be:

                              (i)  evidential material in relation to an offence to which the warrant relates; or

                             (ii)  evidential material in relation to another offence against this Act or the regulations that is an indictable offence;

                            if the executing officer or a person helping believes on reasonable grounds that seizure of the things is necessary to prevent their concealment, loss or destruction or their use in committing an offence against this Act or the regulations.

             (2)  If the warrant states that it may be executed only during particular hours, the warrant must not be executed outside those hours.

                     (b)  a thing that an officer seizes under paragraph 84(1)(gc) or (gd):

                              (i)  because the thing is the property of the Commonwealth because of the operation of Subdivision BA; or

##### <a id="106C"></a>106C  Notice of seizure

Giving notice

             (1)  The officer must give written notice of the seizure of the thing:

                     (a)  if the thing is, or was on, a boat, or was used in connection with a boat:

                              (i)  to the person who was the master of the boat immediately before the seizure; or

                             (ii)  to the person whom the officer has reasonable grounds to believe was the master of the boat immediately before the seizure; or

                     (b)  in a case not covered by paragraph (a):

                              (i)  to the owner of the thing; or

                             (ii)  to the person who had possession, custody or control of the thing immediately before it was seized.

          (1A)  However, if the officer cannot conveniently give the notice to the person in person, the officer may give written notice of the seizure of the thing by fixing the notice to a prominent part of the thing, unless the thing is a fish.

Content of notice

             (2)  The notice must:

                     (a)  identify the thing; and

                     (b)  state that the thing has been seized; and

                     (c)  state that the thing will be condemned as forfeited unless the owner of the thing or the person who had possession, custody or control of the thing immediately before it was seized gives the CEO within 30 days a written claim in English for the thing; and

                     (d)  specify the address of the CEO.

Note:          Section 106E condemns the thing if it is not claimed within 30 days. Section 106G condemns the thing if it is claimed but the claimant does not get a court order supporting the claim.

##### <a id="106D"></a>106D  Dealing with thing before it is condemned

             (1)  On behalf of the Commonwealth, AFMA may cause the thing to be disposed of or destroyed if it is a boat and AFMA is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the boat is unseaworthy; or

                     (b)  the boat poses a serious risk to safety, public health or quarantine; or

                     (c)  the boat poses a serious risk of damage to other property or the environment; or

                     (d)  the expenses of custody and maintenance of the boat between its seizure and condemnation are likely to be greater than its value.

             (2)  If AFMA causes the boat to be disposed of, it may cause the disposal to be made subject to specified conditions.

             (3)  The table lists some other provisions relevant to dealing with things before they are condemned as forfeited to the Commonwealth:

             (2)  The CEO may give the notice to the claimant by posting it prepaid as a letter to the last address of the claimant that is known to the CEO. If the CEO does so, the letter is taken to be properly addressed for the purposes of section 29 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not limit the ways in which the notice may be given.

##### <a id="106L"></a>106L  Debt in relation to pursuit costs

             (1)  This Subdivision applies to a foreign boat if:

                     (a)  the foreign boat is forfeited to the Commonwealth under section 106A; and

                     (b)  the master of the boat fails:

                              (i)  to stop the boat in accordance with the requirement under paragraph 84(1)(aa); or

##### <a id="106M"></a>106M  Preliminary notice of debt

             (1)  As soon as practicable after bringing a foreign boat to which this Subdivision applies to its processing place and after notice of seizure of the boat has been given under section 106C, an AFMA staff member must give written notice to the person:

                     (b)  whom the officer has reasonable grounds to believe was the master of the boat immediately before its apprehension;

of the fact that a debt for the pursuit costs has been incurred in respect of that boat.

However, if the officer cannot conveniently give the notice to the person in person, the officer may give notice of the debt in respect of the boat by fixing the notice to a prominent part of the boat.

             (2)  The notice must:

                     (a)  state that a debt for pursuit costs has been incurred; and

                     (b)  specify the circumstances in which the debt has been incurred; and

                     (c)  state that full particulars of the pursuit costs will be provided in accordance with section 106N as soon as they are available and not later than 10 days after the date of giving the notice; and

                     (d)  indicate that, on provision of full particulars of the debt, the debt is required to be paid unless the owner of the boat informs the CEO, within 30 days of those full particulars being provided under section 106N, that the owner will institute proceedings in the Federal Court to contest the debt; and

                     (e)  specify the address of the CEO.

##### <a id="106N"></a>106N  Full particulars of the pursuit costs

             (1)  Within 10 days of the giving of a preliminary notice of debt in relation to pursuit costs in respect of a foreign boat, an AFMA staff member must give a further notice setting out full particulars of the debt and the means of its calculation.

             (2)  The notice must be given to the person referred to in subsection 106M(1) or, if the officer cannot conveniently give the notice to the person in person, the officer may give the notice by fixing it to a prominent part of the boat.

##### <a id="106P"></a>106P  Debt for pursuit costs payable if no notification of intention to contest debt

             (1)  By force of this section, if the owner of a foreign boat in respect of which full particulars of pursuit costs have been provided under a notice under section 106N does not, within 30 days after the giving of that notice, inform the CEO, by notice in writing, of an intention to contest the debt, the debt is due and payable at the expiration of that period.

             (2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), the notice of intention to contest the debt:

                     (a)  must be in English; and

                     (b)  must set out an address for service for the person proposing to contest the debt.

##### <a id="106Q"></a>106Q  Debt for pursuit costs payable if no action taken to contest debt

             (1)  If the owner of a foreign boat gives a notice of intention to contest a debt for pursuit costs in respect of a foreign boat as described in section 106N, the CEO must inform the owner that the debt for those costs will become due and payable at the end of the period of 2 months after the giving of the notice of intention unless the owner institutes proceedings against the Commonwealth in the Federal Court, not later than the end of that period, for an order that:

                     (a)  the debt is not payable because the boat was not forfeited to the Commonwealth; or

                     (b)  the debt, or a part of the debt, was not reasonably incurred.

             (2)  If the owner does not institute the proceedings referred to in subsection (1) before the end of the period of 2 months referred to in that subsection, the debt is due and payable at the expiration of that period.

             (3)  For the avoidance of doubt, the reference in subsection (1) to proceedings instituted against the Commonwealth for an order that the debt for pursuit costs payable in respect of a foreign boat is not payable because the boat was not forfeited to the Commonwealth is taken to include a reference to any proceedings instituted in accordance with section 106F for a declaration that the boat is not forfeited, even if those proceedings do not directly relate to the liability for pursuit costs.

##### <a id="106R"></a>106R  Federal Court may determine contested debt

             (1)  Jurisdiction is conferred on the Federal Court to hear and determine any proceedings to contest a debt for pursuit costs.

                     (b)  in all the circumstances of the case, the owner should be permitted to contest the debt even though the owner did not give that notice;

                     (a)  sections 106P and 106Q cease to apply; and

                     (b)  unless the owner institutes proceedings against the Commonwealth of the kind described in subsection 106Q(1) within the period of 2 months after the making of the order, or the provision of full particulars of pursuit costs in accordance with the order—the debt becomes due and payable at the expiration of that period.

             (4)  If the owner of a foreign boat institutes proceedings of the kind referred to in subsection 106Q(1) either:

                     (a)  under that subsection; or

                     (b)  under this section;

to contest a debt for pursuit costs in respect of that boat before the end of the period of 2 months referred to in subsection 106Q(1) or in subsection (3) of this section, as the case requires, the Federal Court may:

                     (c)  if the Court is satisfied that the boat is not forfeited to the Commonwealth—make an order that the pursuit costs are not payable to the Commonwealth; and

                     (d)  if the Court is satisfied, having regard to the circumstances of the case, that the pursuit costs, or any particular part of the pursuit costs, claimed in respect of the boat are not costs reasonably incurred—make an order that the pursuit costs, or that particular part of the pursuit costs, are not so payable to the Commonwealth.

##### <a id="106S"></a>106S  Burden of proof

                     (b)  the onus lies on the Commonwealth to establish, on the balance of probabilities:

                             (ii)  that the pursuit costs notified in relation to the boat are reasonable and have been correctly worked out.

## Part 9—Miscellaneous

### Division 1—Electronic decision-making

##### <a id="163A"></a>163A  What this Division is about

                   This Division is about AFMA using a computer program to make certain decisions.

##### <a id="163B"></a>163B  Electronic decision-making

             (1)  AFMA may approve a computer program, which is under AFMA’s control, to be used to make a decision under:

                     (a)  section 32; or

                     (b)  section 32A; or

                     (c)  section 46; or

                     (d)  section 91; or

                     (e)  a plan of management; or

                      (f)  another provision of the fisheries legislation that is prescribed under the regulations.

             (2)  While the approval is in force, the outcome of the use of the computer program (an **_electronic decision_**) is taken to be:

                     (a)  a decision; and

                     (b)  a decision made by AFMA.

             (3)  AFMA’s approval must be made in writing.

             (4)  An approval made under this section is not a legislative instrument.

##### <a id="163C"></a>163C  Replacing an electronic decision

             (1)  This section applies if AFMA is satisfied that an electronic decision that was made by a computer program was made at a time when the computer program was not functioning correctly.

             (2)  A computer program is not functioning correctly if the electronic decision that was made by the computer program is not the same as the decision that AFMA would have made if an employee of AFMA had made the decision.

Example:    A computer program may not be functioning correctly because of a computer virus or because of a typographical error that was made when data was entered into the computer.

             (3)  AFMA may revoke the electronic decision and replace it with the decision that AFMA would have made if an employee of AFMA had made the decision.

             (4)  AFMA may do so:

                     (a)  on its own initiative; or

                     (b)  on the written application of the applicant who had sought the electronic decision.

             (5)  If AFMA revokes an electronic decision after AFMA has notified the applicant about the electronic decision, AFMA must, as soon as practicable after revoking the electronic decision, give to the applicant a written notice that states:

                     (a)  that the electronic decision has been revoked; and

                     (b)  the reasons for revoking the electronic decision; and

                     (c)  the new decision.

##### <a id="163D"></a>163D  Evidence of whether computer is functioning correctly

             (1)  In any proceedings, a computer function notice is prima facie evidence of the matters that are stated in the notice.

             (2)  A **_computer function notice_** is a document that:

                     (a)  is, or is purported to be, signed by the CEO; and

                     (b)  states whether or not a specified computer program was functioning correctly:

                              (i)  in relation to a specified electronic decision; and

                             (ii)  at a specified time or during a specified period.

             (3)  A computer program is functioning correctly if an electronic decision that the computer program makes is the same as the decision that AFMA would have made if an employee of AFMA had made the decision.

##### <a id="163E"></a>163E  Return of fishing concession certificate not necessary

             (1)  This section applies if a plan of management requires the holder of a fishing concession to return the fishing concession certificate to AFMA.

             (2)  The **_fishing concession certificate_** is the certificate that AFMA issued to the holder of the fishing concession as evidence of the grant of the fishing concession.

             (3)  The holder of the fishing concession is no longer required to return the fishing concession certificate to AFMA.

# Schedule 1A—Provisions relating to detention of suspected illegal foreign fishers

_Note:       See section 105Q._

## Part 1—Preliminary

### Division 1—Objects of this Schedule

##### <a id="1"></a>1  Main objects of this Schedule

             (1)  This Schedule has 3 main objects.

             (2)  The first main object is to provide for the detention (**_fisheries detention_**) in Australia or a Territory of persons who:

                     (a)  are reasonably suspected by an officer of having committed an offence involving the use of a foreign boat; and

                     (b)  are not Australian citizens or Australian residents;

for a limited period for the purposes of determining whether to charge them with the offence.

             (3)  The second main object is to provide for persons in fisheries detention to be searched, screened, given access to facilities for obtaining legal advice, and identified.

             (4)  The third main object is to facilitate the transition of persons from fisheries detention to immigration detention under the _Migration Act 1958_:

                     (a)  by providing for the things mentioned in subclause (3) to be done in a way corresponding to the way that Act provides for those things to be done to persons in immigration detention; and

                     (b)  by authorising the disclosure of personal information about individuals who are or have been in fisheries detention to persons, agencies and organisations responsible for holding the individuals in immigration detention, for the purpose of the immigration detention and welfare of the individuals.

Note:          The enforcement visa of a person who is neither an Australian citizen nor an Australian resident ceases to have effect under the _Migration Act 1958_ when the person ceases to be in fisheries detention, so that Act requires the person to be taken into immigration detention.

### Division 2—Definitions

##### <a id="2"></a>2  Definitions

                   In this Schedule, unless the contrary intention appears:

                    <a name="authorised-offic"></a>**_authorised officer_** means an officer, or detention officer, who is authorised under Division 4 for the purposes of the provision in which the expression occurs.

                    <a name="detaine"></a>**_detainee_** means a person detained under Part 2.

                    <a name="detent"></a>**_detention_** means detention under Part 2.

                    <a name="detent-offic"></a>**_detention officer_** means a person appointed under clause 3 to be a detention officer.

### Division 3—Appointment etc. of detention officers

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Minister may appoint persons to be detention officers

             (1)  The Minister may, by instrument, appoint one or more persons (except persons who are officers) to be detention officers.

Note:          Officers have the same powers as detention officers, as well as other powers, so there is no reason for officers to be appointed as detention officers.

             (2)  An instrument appointing persons to be detention officers:

                     (a)  may identify the persons by reference to a class; and

                     (b)  may provide for persons to be appointed when they become members of the class at or after a time specified in the instrument.

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Detention officers subject to directions

                   A detention officer is, in the exercise of his or her powers, and the performance of his or her duties, under this Schedule, subject to the directions given by the Minister or AFMA.

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Detention officer etc. not liable to certain actions

             (1)  A detention officer, or a person assisting a detention officer in the exercise of powers under this Act or the regulations, is not liable to an action, suit or proceeding for or in respect of anything done in good faith or omitted to be done in good faith in the exercise or purported exercise of any power conferred by this Act or the regulations.

Note:          Section 90 makes similar provision for officers and their assistants.

             (2)  However, subsection (1) does not affect a contractual liability of a detention officer or person assisting a detention officer.

### Division 4—Authorisation of officers and detention officers

##### <a id="6"></a>6  AFMA may authorise officers and detention officers

             (1)  AFMA may, by instrument, authorise one or more officers and/or detention officers for the purposes of a specified provision of this Schedule, from among officers and/or detention officers who have successfully completed minimum training prescribed by a legislative instrument.

             (2)  An instrument authorising officers and/or detention officers:

                     (a)  may identify them by reference to a class; and

                     (b)  may provide for them to be authorised when they become members of the class at or after a time specified in the instrument.

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Persons who are authorised officers for purposes of _Migration Act 1958_ are taken to be authorised for this Schedule

             (1)  A person who:

                     (a)  is an officer or detention officer; and

                     (b)  is an authorised officer (as defined in the _Migration Act 1958_) for a provision of that Act listed in column 2 of an item of the table;

is, while he or she meets the conditions in paragraphs (a) and (b), taken to be authorised under clause 6 for the purposes of the provision of this Schedule listed in column 3 of the item.

                     (b)  has been presented, while detained by that officer, to a detention officer for detention by a detention officer.

                     (b)  in a case where an authorised officer of the same sex as the detainee is not available to conduct the search—any other person who is of the same sex and:

                              (i)  is requested by an authorised officer; and

                             (ii)  agrees;

                            to conduct the search.

             (6)  An action or proceeding, whether civil or criminal, does not lie against a person who, at the request of an authorised officer, conducts a search under this clause if the person acts in good faith and does not contravene subclause (7).

             (7)  An authorised officer or other person who conducts a search under this clause must not use more force, or subject a detainee to greater indignity, than is reasonably necessary in order to conduct the search.

             (8)  To avoid doubt, a search of a detainee may be conducted under this clause irrespective of whether a screening procedure is conducted in relation to the detainee under clause 16 or a strip search of the detainee is conducted under clause 17.

                     (a)  to inflict bodily injury; or

                     (b)  to help the detainee, or any other detainee, to escape from detention.

                             (ii)  if the detainee is at least 10 but under 18—a magistrate orders the strip search because he or she is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for those suspicions.

                             (ii)  if that is not acceptable to the detainee or subparagraph (i) does not apply—another person (other than an authorised officer) who is capable of representing the detainee’s interests and who, as far as is practicable in the circumstances, is acceptable to the detainee; and

                      (i)  must not involve a search of the detainee’s body cavities; and

                      (j)  must not involve the removal of more items of clothing, or more visual inspection, than the authorised officer conducting the search believes on reasonable grounds to be necessary to determine whether there is hidden on the detainee, in his or her clothing or in a thing in his or her possession a weapon or other thing described in subclause 17(1); and

                     (k)  must not be conducted with greater force than is reasonably necessary to conduct the strip search.

             (3)  Paragraphs (1)(d) and (e) do not apply to a person nominated by the detainee under paragraph (1)(h) to attend the strip search.

             (4)  Neither:

                     (a)  a detainee’s refusal or failure to nominate a person under paragraph (1)(h) within a reasonable time; nor

                     (b)  a detainee’s inability to nominate a person under that paragraph who is readily available at the same place as the detainee and willing to attend the strip search within a reasonable time;

prevents a strip search being conducted.

             (5)  A strip search of a detainee may be conducted with the assistance of another person if the authorised officer conducting the strip search considers that to be necessary for the purposes of conducting it. That person must not be of the opposite sex to the detainee unless:

                     (b)  the period of 60 days after the authorised officer takes possession of the thing ends.

                              (i)  proceedings in respect of which the thing might provide evidence have been instituted before the end of the 60 day period and have not been completed (including an appeal to a court in relation to those proceedings); or

                             (ii)  the authorised officer may retain the thing because of an order under clause 21; or

                     (b)  in any case—the authorised officer is otherwise authorised (by a law, or an order of a court or a tribunal, of the Commonwealth or a State or Territory) to retain, destroy or dispose of the thing.

Note:          This clause corresponds closely to section 252C of the _Migration Act 1958_.

                     (a)  60 days after the authorised officer takes possession of the thing; or

                     (b)  a period previously specified in an order of a magistrate under clause 21.

             (2)  The authorised officer may apply to a magistrate for an order that the officer may retain the thing for a further period.

                     (b)  if it is practicable to do so, notify each person who the authorised officer believes to be such a person of the proposed application.

Note:          This clause corresponds closely to section 252D of the _Migration Act 1958_.

             (4)  A notice under paragraph (3)(b) is not a legislative instrument.

##### <a id="21"></a>21  Magistrate may order that thing be retained

             (1)  The magistrate may order that the authorised officer who made an application under clause 20 may retain the thing if the magistrate is satisfied that it is necessary for the authorised officer to do so:

                     (a)  for the purposes of an investigation as to whether an offence has been committed; or

                     (b)  to enable evidence of an offence to be secured for the purposes of a prosecution.

             (2)  The order must specify the period for which the authorised officer may retain the thing.

             (3)  A power conferred on a magistrate by this clause is conferred on the magistrate in a personal capacity and not as a court or a member of a court.

             (4)  The magistrate need not accept the power conferred.

             (5)  A magistrate exercising a power under this clause has the same protection and immunity as if he or she were exercising that power as, or as a member of, the court of which the magistrate is a member.

Note:          This clause corresponds closely to section 252E of the _Migration Act 1958_.

             (2)  To the extent that the State or Territory law confers that power, or affects the exercise of that power, it applies to the detainee as though it were a law of the Commonwealth.

             (3)  Clauses 16 and 17 do not apply to a detainee to whom this clause applies.

Note:          This clause corresponds closely to section 252F of the _Migration Act 1958_.

                             (ii)  disrupt the order or security arrangements on the premises.

             (2)  Such an authorised officer is not an authorised officer in relation to carrying out an identification test that is not of a type so specified.

Note:          This clause corresponds closely to section 5D of the _Migration Act 1958_.

### Division 2—Identification of detainees

#### Subdivision A—Provision of personal identifiers

##### <a id="28"></a>28  Detainees must provide personal identifiers

             (1)  A non-citizen in detention must (other than in the prescribed circumstances) provide to an authorised officer one or more personal identifiers.

Note:          A person who is an Australian citizen, or is a non-citizen but an Australian resident, may be in detention but must be released as soon as an officer or detention officer knows or reasonably believes the person is an Australian citizen or resident.

             (2)  An authorised officer must not require, for the purposes of subclause (1), a detainee to provide a personal identifier other than any of the following (including any of the following in digital form):

                     (a)  fingerprints or handprints of the detainee (including those taken using paper and ink or digital livescanning technologies);

                     (b)  a measurement of the detainee’s height and weight;

                     (c)  a photograph or other image of the detainee’s face and shoulders;

                     (d)  the detainee’s signature;

                     (e)  any other personal identifier of a type prescribed for the purposes of this paragraph.

Note:          Division 3 sets out further restrictions on the personal identifiers that minors and incapable persons can be required to provide.

             (3)  The one or more personal identifiers are to be provided by way of one or more identification tests carried out by the authorised officer in accordance with this Division.

Note 1:       Subject to certain restrictions, clause 32 allows reasonable force to be used to carry out identification tests under this Division.

Note 2:       This clause corresponds closely to section 261AA of the _Migration Act 1958_.

##### <a id="29"></a>29  Authorised officers must require and carry out identification tests

             (1)  The authorised officer must, other than in the circumstances prescribed for the purposes of subclause 28(1):

                     (a)  require the non-citizen to provide one or more personal identifiers, of the type or types prescribed, by way of one or more identification tests carried out by the authorised officer; and

                     (b)  carry out the one or more identification tests on the non-citizen.

             (2)  However:

                     (a)  if the types of identification tests that the authorised officer may carry out is specified under clause 27—each identification test must be of a type so specified; and

                     (b)  each identification test must be carried out in accordance with Subdivision B; and

                     (c)  unless the authorised officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the non-citizen is not a minor or an incapable person—each identification test must be carried out in accordance with the additional requirements of Division 3.

Note:          Subclauses (1) and (2) correspond closely to section 261AB of the _Migration Act 1958_.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  the authorised officer is authorised because of clause 7 (which effectively treats as authorised officers for the purposes of certain provisions of this Schedule certain persons who are authorised officers for the purposes of certain provisions of the _Migration Act 1958_); and

                     (b)  an instrument under section 5D of that Act specifies the types of identification test the authorised officer may carry out;

paragraph (2)(a) of this clause has effect as if the specified types (except any specified under subclause 7(3) in relation to the authorised officer) had been specified under clause 27.

##### <a id="30"></a>30  Information to be provided before carrying out identification tests

             (1)  Before carrying out an identification test, the authorised officer must:

                     (a)  inform the non-citizen that the non-citizen may ask that an independent person be present while the identification test is carried out and that the test be carried out by a person of the same sex as the non-citizen; and

                     (b)  inform the non-citizen of such other matters as are specified in the regulations.

             (2)  For the purposes of subclause (1), the authorised officer **_informs_** the non-citizen of a matter if the authorised officer informs the non-citizen of the matter, through an interpreter if necessary, in a language (including sign language or braille) in which the non-citizen is able to communicate with reasonable fluency.

             (3)  The authorised officer may comply with this clause by giving to the non-citizen, in accordance with the regulations, a form setting out the information specified in the regulations. However, the information must be in a language (including braille) in which the non-citizen is able to communicate with reasonable fluency.

Note:          This clause corresponds closely to section 261AC of the _Migration Act 1958_.

             (4)  A form mentioned in subclause (3) is not a legislative instrument.

#### Subdivision B—How identification tests are carried out

##### <a id="31"></a>31  General rules for carrying out identification tests

                   An identification test under this Division:

                     (a)  must be carried out in circumstances affording reasonable privacy to the non-citizen; and

                     (b)  if the non-citizen so requests and it is practicable to comply with the request—must not be carried out in the presence or view of a person who is of the opposite sex to the non-citizen; and

                     (c)  must not be carried out in the presence or view of a person whose presence is not necessary for the purposes of the identification test or is not required or permitted by another provision of this Act; and

                     (d)  must not involve the removal of more clothing than is necessary for carrying out the test; and

                     (e)  must not involve more visual inspection than is necessary for carrying out the test; and

                      (f)  if the test is one of 2 or more identification tests to be carried out on the non-citizen—must be carried out at the same time as the other identification tests, if it is practicable to do so.

Note:          This clause corresponds closely to section 261AD of the _Migration Act 1958_.

##### <a id="32"></a>32  Use of force in carrying out identification tests

When use of force is permitted

             (1)  Subject to subclause (2) and clause 33, an authorised officer, or a person authorised under clause 34 to help the authorised officer, may use reasonable force:

                     (a)  to enable the identification test to be carried out; or

                     (b)  to prevent the loss, destruction or contamination of any personal identifier or any meaningful identifier derived from the personal identifier.

However, this clause does not authorise the use of force against a minor or an incapable person, or if the personal identifier in question is a person’s signature.

             (2)  The authorised officer or person must not use force unless:

                     (a)  the non-citizen required to provide the personal identifier in question has refused to allow the identification test to be carried out; and

                     (b)  all reasonable measures to carry out the identification test without the use of force have been exhausted; and

                     (c)  use of force in carrying out the identification test is authorised under subclause (4).

Applications for authorisation to use force

             (3)  An authorised officer may apply to a senior authorising officer (who is not an authorised officer referred to in subclause (1)) for an authorisation to use force in carrying out the identification test.

Authorisation to use force

             (4)  The senior authorising officer may authorise the use of force in carrying out the identification test if he or she is reasonably satisfied that:

                     (a)  the non-citizen required to provide the personal identifier in question has refused to allow the identification test to be carried out; and

                     (b)  all reasonable measures to carry out the identification test without the use of force have been exhausted.

             (5)  An authorisation under subclause (4):

                     (a)  may be given by telephone, fax or other electronic means; and

                     (b)  must be recorded in writing, and signed by the person giving the authorisation, within one business day after it is given.

             (6)  A record made under paragraph (5)(b) is not a legislative instrument.

             (7)  A failure to comply with paragraph (5)(b) does not affect the validity of an identification test carried out on the basis of that authorisation.

             (8)  The power to give an authorisation under subclause (4) cannot be delegated to any other person.

Definition

             (9)  In this clause:

                    <a name="senior-authorising-offic"></a>**_senior authorising officer_** means an officer, or detention officer, whom AFMA has authorised, or who is included in a class of officers or detention officers whom AFMA has authorised, to perform the functions of a senior authorising officer under this clause.

Note:          This clause corresponds closely to section 261AE of the _Migration Act 1958_.

##### <a id="33"></a>33  Identification tests not to be carried out in cruel, inhuman or degrading manner etc.

                   For the purposes of this Act, the carrying out of the identification test is not of itself taken:

                     (a)  to be cruel, inhuman or degrading; or

                     (b)  to be a failure to treat a person with humanity and with respect for human dignity.

However, nothing in this Act authorises the carrying out of the identification test in a cruel, inhuman or degrading manner, or in a manner that fails to treat a person with humanity and with respect for human dignity.

Note:          This clause corresponds closely to section 261AF of the _Migration Act 1958_.

##### <a id="34"></a>34  Authorised officer may get help to carry out identification tests

                   An authorised officer may ask another authorised officer or an officer or detention officer to help him or her to carry out the identification test, and the other person may give that help.

Note:          This clause corresponds closely to section 261AG of the _Migration Act 1958_.

##### <a id="35"></a>35  Identification tests to be carried out by authorised officer of same sex as non-citizen

                   If the non-citizen requests that the identification test be carried out by an authorised officer of the same sex as the non-citizen, the test must only be carried out by an authorised officer of the same sex as the non-citizen.

Note:          This clause corresponds closely to section 261AH of the _Migration Act 1958_.

##### <a id="36"></a>36  Independent person to be present

                   The identification test must be carried out in the presence of an independent person if:

                     (a)  force is used in carrying out the identification test; or

                     (b)  both of the following apply:

                              (i)  the non-citizen requests that an independent person be present while the identification test is being carried out;

                             (ii)  an independent person is readily available at the same place as the non-citizen and is willing to attend the test within a reasonable time.

Note:          This clause corresponds closely to section 261AI of the _Migration Act 1958_.

##### <a id="37"></a>37  Recording of identification tests

             (1)  An authorised officer may video record the carrying out of the identification test.

             (2)  If the carrying out of the identification test is not video recorded, the authorised officer may decide that the identification test must be carried out in the presence of an independent person.

Note:          This clause corresponds closely to section 261AJ of the _Migration Act 1958_.

##### <a id="38"></a>38  Retesting

When retesting is permitted

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  an authorised officer has carried out an identification test (the **_earlier test_**) on a non-citizen in accordance with this Division (including a test authorised under subclause (4)); and

                     (b)  either:

                              (i)  a personal identifier that is provided as a result of the earlier test being carried out is unusable; or

                             (ii)  an authorised officer, officer or detention officer is not satisfied about the integrity of that personal identifier;

the authorised officer who carried out the earlier test or another authorised officer may require the non-citizen to provide the personal identifier again, and may carry out the test again in accordance with this Division, if:

                     (c)  the requirement is made while the earlier test is being carried out or immediately after it was carried out; or

                     (d)  carrying out the test again is authorised under subclause (4).

             (2)  If the non-citizen is required under subclause (1) to provide the personal identifier again, the non-citizen is taken, for the purposes of this Division, not to have provided the personal identifier as a result of the earlier test being carried out.

Applications for authorisation to retest

             (3)  An authorised officer may apply for an authorisation to carry out the test again. The application is to be made to:

                     (a)  if the earlier test was not a test authorised under subclause (4)—a senior authorising officer (who is not an authorised officer, officer or detention officer referred to in subclause (1)); or

                     (b)  if the earlier test was a test authorised under subclause (4) by a senior authorising officer—the CEO, the Secretary of the Department or an SES Band 3 employee in the Department (who is not an authorised officer, officer or detention officer referred to in subclause (1)).

Authorisation to retest

             (4)  The senior authorising officer, CEO, Secretary or SES Band 3 employee (as the case requires) may authorise the test to be carried out again if:

                     (a)  he or she is reasonably satisfied that the personal identifier that is provided as a result of the earlier test being carried out is unusable; or

                     (b)  he or she is not reasonably satisfied about the integrity of that personal identifier.

             (5)  An authorisation under subclause (4):

                     (a)  may be given by telephone, fax or other electronic means; and

                     (b)  must be recorded in writing, and signed by the person giving the authorisation, within one business day after it is given.

             (6)  A record made under paragraph (5)(b) is not a legislative instrument.

             (7)  A failure to comply with paragraph (5)(b) does not affect the validity of an identification test carried out on the basis of that authorisation.

             (8)  The power to give an authorisation under subclause (4) cannot be delegated to any other person.

Use of force

             (9)  An authorisation under subclause (4) does not authorise the use of force in carrying out an identification test.

Note:          See clause 32 on the use of force in carrying out identification tests.

Effect of refusing to authorise retesting

           (10)  If an application for an authorisation to carry out an identification test again on a non-citizen is refused, the non-citizen is taken, for the purposes of this Act, to have complied with any requirement under this Act to provide the personal identifier in question.

if the identifying information in question relates to a personal identifier of a prescribed type.

Note:          This clause corresponds closely to section 261AKC of the _Migration Act 1958_.

##### <a id="42"></a>42  Providing video recordings

             (1)  A person commits an offence if:

                     (a)  the person’s conduct causes a video recording to be provided to another person; and

                     (b)  the provision of the recording is not a permitted provision of the recording.

4.2   The Government of the United States shall, at the request of the Government of a Pacific  Island party, take all reasonable measures to assist that party in the investigation of an alleged breach of this Treaty by a fishing vessel of the United   States and promptly communicate all the requested information to that party.

4.3   The Government of the United States shall ensure that:

       (a)   each fishing vessel of the United States licensed pursuant to this Treaty is fully insured against all risks and liabilities;

       (b)   all measures are taken to facilitate:

                     (i)    any claim arising out of the activities of a fishing vessel of the United States, including a claim for the total market value of any fish taken from the Licensing Area without authorisation pursuant to this Treaty, and the prompt settlement of that claim;

                     (ii)   the service of legal process by or on behalf of a national or the Government of a Pacific  Island party in any action arising out of the activities of a fishing vessel of the United States;

                     (iv)  the prompt and full satisfaction of any final judgment or other final determination made pursuant to this Treaty; and

                     (v)   the provision of a reasonable level of financial assurances, if, after consultation with the Government of the United States, all Pacific Island parties agree that the collection of any civil or criminal judgment or judgments or determination or determinations made pursuant to this Treaty has become a serious enforcement problem;

       (c)   an amount equivalent to the total value of any forfeiture, fine, penalty or other amount collected by the Government of the United States incurred as a result of any actions, judicial or otherwise, taken pursuant to this Article is paid to the Administrator as soon as possible following the date that the amount is collected.

4.4   The Government of the United States shall, at the request of the Government of a Pacific Island party, fully investigate any alleged infringement of this Treaty involving a vessel of the United States, and report as soon as practicable and in any case within two months to that Government on that investigation and on any action taken or proposed to be taken by the Government of the United States in relation to the alleged infringement.

4.5   In the event that a report provided pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Article shows that a fishing vessel of the United States:

       (a)   while fishing in the Licensing Area did not have a licence to fish in the Licensing Area, except in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 3; or

       (b)   was involved in any incident in which an authorised officer or observer was allegedly assaulted with resultant bodily harm, physically threatened, forcefully resisted, refused boarding or subjected to physical intimidation or physical interference in the performance of his or her duties as authorised pursuant to this Treaty; or

that there was probable cause to believe that a fishing vessel of the United States:

       (c)   was used for fishing in waters closed to fishing pursuant to Annex I, except as authorised in accordance with paragraph 3 of Article 3;

       (d)   was used for fishing in any Limited Area as described in Annex I, except as authorised in accordance with that Annex I;

       (e)   was used for fishing by any method other than the purse seine method, except in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 3;

       (g)   used an aircraft for fishing which was not identified on a form provided pursuant to Schedule 1 of Annex II in relation to that vessel; or

       (h)   was involved in an incident in which evidence which otherwise could have been used in proceedings concerning the vessel has been intentionally destroyed;

and that such vessel has not submitted to the jurisdiction of the Pacific Island party concerned, the Government of the United States shall, at the request of that party, take all necessary measures to ensure that the vessel concerned leaves the Licensing Area and waters closed to fishing pursuant to Annex I immediately and does not return except for the purpose of submitting to the jurisdiction of the party, or after action has been taken by the Government of the United States to the satisfaction of that party.

4.6   In the event that a report provided pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Article shows that a fishing vessel of the United States has been involved in a probable infringement of this Treaty, including an infringement of an applicable national law as identified in Schedule 1 of Annex I, other than an infringement of the kind described in paragraph 5 of this Article, and that the vessel has not submitted to the jurisdiction of the Pacific Island party concerned, the Government of the United States shall, at the request of that party, take all necessary measures to ensure that the vessel concerned:

       (a)   submits to the jurisdiction of that party; or

       (b)   is penalised by the Government of the United States at such level as may be provided for like violations in United States law relating to foreign fishing vessels licensed to fish in the exclusive economic zone of the United States but not to exceed the sum of US$250,000.

4.7   Financial assurances provided pursuant to this Treaty may be drawn against by any Pacific  Island party to satisfy any civil or criminal judgment or other determination in favour of a national or the Government of a Pacific Island party.

4.8   Prior to instituting any legal proceedings pursuant to this Article concerning an alleged infringement of this Treaty in waters within the jurisdiction, for any purpose, as recognised by international law, of a Pacific Island party, the Government of the United States shall notify the Government of that Pacific Island party that such proceedings shall be instituted. Such notice shall include a statement of the facts believed to show an infringement of this Treaty and the nature of the proposed proceedings, including the proposed charges and the proposed penalties to be sought.

       (a)   shall be located in Port Moresby for the purpose of receiving and responding to any legal process issued in accordance with this Article; and

       (b)   shall, within 21 days of notification that legal process has been issued in accordance with this Article, travel to any Pacific Island party, at no expense to that party, for the purpose of receiving and responding to that process.

5.    The vessel shall not be used for directed fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna, or for fishing for any kinds of fish other than tunas, except that other kinds of fish may be caught as an incidental by-catch.

6.    The vessel shall not be used for fishing by any method, except the purse seine method.

7.    The vessel shall not be used for fishing in any Closed Area.

8.    Except for circumstances involving force majeure and other emergencies involving the health or safety of crew members or the safety of the vessel, no aircraft may be used in association with the fishing activities of the vessel unless it is identified in item 6 or 7 of Schedule 1 of Annex II.

9.    The vessel shall not be used for fishing in any Limited Area except in accordance with the requirements set out in Schedule 3, which are applicable to that Limited Area.

PART 5

ENFORCEMENT

14.   The master and each member of the crew of the vessel shall immediately comply with every instruction and direction given by an authorised and identified officer of a Pacific  Island party, including to stop, to move to a specified location, and to facilitate safe boarding and inspection of the vessel, gear, equipment, records, fish and fish products. Such boarding and inspection shall be conducted as much as possible in a manner so as not to interfere unduly with the lawful operation of the vessel. The operator and each member of the crew shall facilitate and assist in any action by an authorised officer of a Pacific  Island party and shall not assault, obstruct, resist, delay, refuse boarding to, intimidate or interfere with an authorised officer in the performance of his or her duties.

ANNEX II

1.    For the purposes of this Annex:

       (a)   “Licensing Period” means the period of validity of licences issued in accordance with this Treaty.

2.    The Government of the United States shall make application for a licence in respect of any fishing vessel of the United States intended by the operator to be used for purse seine fishing in the Licensing Area at any time in the Licensing Period by providing to the Administrator a complete application form as set out in Schedule 1.

3.    Licences issued pursuant to this Treaty shall not take effect until the Administrator has received payment, free of any charges whatsoever, of the amounts set out in Part 1 of Schedule 2 for that Licensing Period in the manner described in that Schedule. Other financial commitments shall be provided during the Licensing Period pursuant to Part 2 of Schedule 2.

4.    Subject to paragraph 5, a licence may be denied:

       (a)   where the application is not in accordance with the requirements of paragraph 2;

       (b)   where the owner or charterer is the subject of proceedings under the bankruptcy laws of the United States, unless reasonable financial assurances have been provided to the Administrator;

       (c)   where the vessel in respect of which application for a licence has been made does not have good standing on the Regional Register of Foreign Fishing Vessels, maintained by the South Pacific Forum Fisheries Agency, provided that:

                     (i)    good standing is withdrawn only as a result of:

                                    (A)  the commission of a serious offence against fisheries laws or regulations of a Pacific  Island State and the operator has not fully complied with any civil or criminal judgment rendered with respect to such an offence;

                                    (B)  evidence existing that gives reasonable cause to believe that the operator has committed a serious offence against the fisheries laws or regulations of any Pacific Island State and that it has not been possible to bring the vessel operator to trial; or

                                    (C)  the vessel operator has failed to comply with information requirements for registration as notified by the Administrator to the Government of the United   States;

SCHEDULE 2

PAYMENTS

The following amounts are payable annually for a period of five (5) years pursuant to paragraph 3 of Annex II.

PART 1

1.    The amounts payable as set forth in this paragraph.

       (a)   Annual industry payments shall be made as follows:

                     (i)    for the first annual Licensing Period, a lump sum of US$1.75 million for 35 vessels, with the next five licences to be made available for the same pro-rata payment as the first 35 licences, and an additional 10 licences to be made available at US$60,000 per vessel;

                     (ii)   for subsequent annual Licensing Periods, 40 vessel licences calculated on the same basis as the first 40 vessel licences in sub-paragraph (i) and indexed to the price of fish as set forth below, with 10 additional licences to be made available at US$60,000 per vessel and indexed to the price of fish as set forth below.

       (b)   The indexation shall be applied as follows:

                     (i)    DEFINITIONS

                                    A.   Base Vessel Payment: The Base Vessel Payment is US$50,000 for the first 40 vessels to be licensed and US$60,000 for vessels to be licensed in excess of 40 vessels.

                                    B.    Adjusted Individual Vessel Payment: The Adjusted Individual Vessel Payment is the individual vessel payment of each annual Licensing Period after the first annual Licensing Period. The Adjusted Individual Vessel Payment will always apply to the Licensing Period immediately following its calculation.

                                    C.    Landed Price: The Landed Price is the published standard price per ton (American Tuna Sales Association) for fish delivered to American Samoa prevailing at the time a United   States purse seine vessel arrives in port for the purpose of offloading its catch.

                                    D.   Average Landed Price: The Average Landed Price is calculated by averaging the established landed price categories for yellowfin and skipjack tuna in American   Samoa. The landed price categories to be used are: over 7.5 pounds, 4 to 7.5 pounds and 3 to 4 pounds for skipjack; over 20 pounds, 7.5 to 20 pounds and 4 to 7.5 pounds for yellowfin.

                                    E.    Base Price: The Base Price is the Average Landed Price for the three months prior to the Treaty entering into force.

                                    F.    Estimated Landed Value: The Estimated Landed Value is the Average Landed Price in effect at the time of a vessel’s landing weighted by the yellowfin/skipjack mix ratio to be calculated from information on Schedule 6 for that vessel.

                                    G.    Average Estimated Landed Value: The Average Estimated Landed Value is the Estimated Landed Value for all landings by United States purse seine vessels in American   Samoa in the four quarters preceding the final quarter of the applicable Licensing Period divided by the total number of those landings for the same period.

                     (ii)   CALCULATION AND APPLICATION OF INDEXING FACTOR

                                    A.   To obtain the indexing factor by which the Adjusted Individual Vessel Payment shall be calculated, divide the Average Estimated Landed Value for the preceding four quarters by the Base Price.

                                    B.    To obtain the Adjusted Individual Vessel Payment, multiply the Base Vessel Payment by the indexing factor obtained in Paragraph (ii) A.

                                    C.    In no case shall the Adjusted Individual Vessel Payment be less than the Base Vessel Payment.

                     (iii)  NOTIFICATIONS

                            The established prices and any changes shall be supplied to the Administrator by the Government of the United States within ten (10) days of their publication. The Administrator shall notify the Government of the United States sixty (60) days before the start of each Licensing Period of the Adjusted Individual Vessel Payment along with the computation used to arrive at the Adjusted Individual Vessel Payment. The Adjusted Individual Vessel Payment shall become final thirty (30) days after receipt by the Government of the United States, unless the Government of the United States advises the Administrator otherwise, in which case consultations shall be held.

                     (iv)  CONSULTATIONS

                            If the established price categories are revised, or if there is a change in the tuna industry structure which makes the price calculations as set forth above inappropriate, the Administrator may consult with representatives of the Government of the United States as necessary to revise the formula.

       (c)   There shall be no pro-ration of the Base Vessel Payment or the Adjusted Individual Vessel Payment. There shall be no refunds of the Base Vessel Payment or the Adjusted Individual Vessel Payment following licence issuance pursuant to Annex II.

2.    Sums payable pursuant to the related Agreement between the South Pacific Forum Fisheries Agency and the Government of the United States.

PART 2

3.    Technical assistance, including provision of assistance by technicians, by the United   States tuna industry valued at US$250,000 annually in response to requests co-ordinated through the Administrator.

AGREEMENT FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF THE SEA OF 10 DECEMBER 1982 RELATING TO THE CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF STRADDLING FISH STOCKS AND HIGHLY MIGRATORY FISH STOCKS

          <u>The States Parties to this Agreement</u>,

          <u>Recalling</u> the relevant provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982,

          <u>Determined</u> to ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks,

          <u>Resolved</u> to improve cooperation between States to that end,

          <u>Calling</u> for more effective enforcement by flag States, port States and coastal States of the conservation and management measures adopted for such stocks,

          <u>Seeking</u> to address in particular the problems identified in chapter 17, programme area C, of Agenda 21 adopted by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, namely, that the management of high seas fisheries is inadequate in many areas and that some resources are overutilized; noting that there are problems of unregulated fishing, over-capitalization, excessive fleet size, vessel reflagging to escape controls, insufficiently selective gear, unreliable databases and lack of sufficient cooperation between States,

          <u>Committing</u> themselves to responsible fisheries,

          <u>Conscious</u> of the need to avoid adverse impacts on the marine environment, preserve biodiversity, maintain the integrity of marine ecosystems and minimize the risk of long-term or irreversible effects of fishing operations,

          <u>Recognizing</u> the need for specific assistance, including financial, scientific and technological assistance, in order that developing States can participate effectively in the conservation, management and sustainable use of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks,

          <u>Convinced</u> that an agreement for the implementation of the relevant provisions of the Convention would best serve these purposes and contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security,

          <u>Affirming</u> that matters not regulated by the Convention or by this Agreement continue to be governed by the rules and principles of general international law,

          <u>Have agreed as follows</u>:

PART II

CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF STRADDLING

FISH STOCKS AND HIGHLY MIGRATORY FISH

STOCKS

<u>Article 5</u>

<u>General principles</u>

          In order to conserve and manage straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks, coastal States and States fishing on the high seas shall, in giving effect to their duty to cooperate in accordance with the Convention:

          (a)     adopt measures to ensure long-term sustainability of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks and promote the objective of their optimum utilization;

          (b)     ensure that such measures are based on the best scientific evidence available and are designed to maintain or restore stocks at levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield, as qualified by relevant environmental and economic factors, including the special requirements of developing States, and taking into account fishing patterns, the interdependence of stocks and any generally recommended international minimum standards, whether subregional, regional or global;

          (c)     apply the precautionary approach in accordance with article 6;

          (d)     assess the impacts of fishing, other human activities and environmental factors on target stocks and species belonging to the same ecosystem or associated with or dependent upon the target stocks;

          (e)     adopt, where necessary, conservation and management measures for species belonging to the same ecosystem or associated with or dependent upon the target stocks, with a view to maintaining or restoring populations of such species above levels at which their reproduction may become seriously threatened;

          (f)      minimize pollution, waste, discards, catch by lost or abandoned gear, catch of non-target species, both fish and non-fish species, (hereinafter referred to as non-target species) and impacts on associated or dependent species, in particular endangered species, through measures including, to the extent practicable, the development and use of selective, environmentally safe and cost-effective fishing gear and techniques;

          (g)     protect biodiversity in the marine environment;

          (h)     take measures to prevent or eliminate overfishing and excess fishing capacity and to ensure that levels of fishing effort do not exceed those commensurate with the sustainable use of fishery resources;

          (i)      take into account the interests of artisanal and subsistence fishers;

          (j)      collect and share, in a timely manner, complete and accurate data concerning fishing activities on, <u>inter alia</u>, vessel position, catch of target and non-target species and fishing effort, as set out in Annex I, as well as information from national and international research programmes;

          (k)     promote and conduct scientific research and develop appropriate technologies in support of fishery conservation and management; and

          (l)      implement and enforce conservation and management measures through effective monitoring, control and surveillance.

<u>Article 6</u>

<u>Application of the precautionary approach</u>

1.       States shall apply the precautionary approach widely to conservation, management and exploitation of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks in order to protect the living marine resources and preserve the marine environment.

2.       States shall be more cautious when information is uncertain, unreliable or inadequate. The absence of adequate scientific information shall not be used as a reason for postponing or failing to take conservation and management measures.

3.       In implementing the precautionary approach, States shall:

          (a)     improve decision-making for fishery resource conservation and management by obtaining and sharing the best scientific information available and implementing improved techniques for dealing with risk and uncertainty;

          (b)     apply the guidelines set out in Annex II and determine, on the basis of the best scientific information available, stock-specific reference points and the action to be taken if they are exceeded;

          (c)     take into account, <u>inter alia</u>, uncertainties relating to the size and productivity of the stocks, reference points, stock condition in relation to such reference points, levels and distribution of fishing mortality and the impact of fishing activities on non-target and associated or dependent species, as well as existing and predicted oceanic, environmental and socio-economic conditions; and

          (d)     develop data collection and research programs to assess the impact of fishing on non-target and associated or dependent species and their environment, and adopt plans which are necessary to ensure the conservation of such species and to protect habitats of special concern.

4.       States shall take measures to ensure that, when reference points are approached, they will not be exceeded. In the event that they are exceeded, States shall, without delay, take the action determined under paragraph 3(b) to restore the stocks.

5.       Where the status of target stocks or non-target or associated or dependent species is of concern, States shall subject such stocks and species to enhanced monitoring in order to review their status and the efficacy of conservation and management measures. They shall revise those measures regularly in the light of new information.

6.       For new or exploratory fisheries, States shall adopt as soon as possible cautious conservation and management measures, including, <u>inter alia</u>, catch limits and effort limits. Such measures shall remain in force until there are sufficient data to allow assessment of the impact of the fisheries on the long-term sustainability of the stocks, whereupon conservation and management measures based on that assessment shall be implemented. The latter measures shall, if appropriate, allow for the gradual development of the fisheries.

7.       If a natural phenomenon has a significant adverse impact on the status of straddling fish stocks or highly migratory fish stocks, States shall adopt conservation and management measures on an emergency basis to ensure that fishing activity does not exacerbate such adverse impact. States shall also adopt such measures on an emergency basis where fishing activity presents a serious threat to the sustainability of such stocks. Measures taken on an emergency basis shall be temporary and shall be based on the best scientific evidence available.

<u>Article 7</u>

<u>Compatibility of conservation and</u>

<u>management measures</u>

1.       Without prejudice to the sovereign rights of coastal States for the purpose of exploring and exploiting, conserving and managing the living marine resources within areas under national jurisdiction as provided for in the Convention, and the right of all States for their nationals to engage in fishing on the high seas in accordance with the Convention:

          (a)     with respect to straddling fish stocks, the relevant coastal States and the States whose nationals fish for such stocks in the adjacent high seas area shall seek, either directly or through the appropriate mechanisms for cooperation provided for in Part III, to agree upon the measures necessary for the conservation of these stocks in the adjacent high seas area;

          (b)     with respect to highly migratory fish stocks, the relevant coastal States and other States whose nationals fish for such stocks in the region shall cooperate, either directly or through the appropriate mechanisms for cooperation provided for in Part III, with a view to ensuring conservation and promoting the objective of optimum utilization of such stocks throughout the region, both within and beyond the areas under national jurisdiction.

2.       Conservation and management measures established for the high seas and those adopted for areas under national jurisdiction shall be compatible in order to ensure conservation and management of the straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks in their entirety. To this end, coastal States and States fishing on the high seas have a duty to cooperate for the purpose of achieving compatible measures in respect of such stocks. In determining compatible conservation and management measures, States shall:

          (a)     take into account the conservation and management measures adopted and applied in accordance with article 61 of the Convention in respect of the same stocks by coastal States within areas under national jurisdiction and ensure that measures established in respect of such stocks for the high seas do not undermine the effectiveness of such measures;

          (b)     take into account previously agreed measures established and applied for the high seas in accordance with the Convention in respect of the same stocks by relevant coastal States and States fishing on the high seas;

          (c)     take into account previously agreed measures established and applied in accordance with the Convention in respect of the same stocks by a subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement;

          (d)     take into account the biological unity and other biological characteristics of the stocks and the relationships between the distribution of the stocks, the fisheries and the geographical particularities of the region concerned, including the extent to which the stocks occur and are fished in areas under national jurisdiction;

          (e)     take into account the respective dependence of the coastal States and the States fishing on the high seas on the stocks concerned; and

          (f)      ensure that such measures do not result in harmful impact on the living marine resources as a whole.

3.       In giving effect to their duty to cooperate, States shall make every effort to agree on compatible conservation and management measures within a reasonable period of time.

4.       If no agreement can be reached within a reasonable period of time, any of the States concerned may invoke the procedures for the settlement of disputes provided for in Part VIII.

5.       Pending agreement on compatible conservation and management measures, the States concerned, in a spirit of understanding and cooperation, shall make every effort to enter into provisional arrangements of a practical nature. In the event that they are unable to agree on such arrangements, any of the States concerned may, for the purpose of obtaining provisional measures, submit the dispute to a court or tribunal in accordance with the procedures for the settlement of disputes provided for in Part VIII.

6.       Provisional arrangements or measures entered into or prescribed pursuant to paragraph 5 shall take into account the provisions of this Part, shall have due regard to the rights and obligations of all States concerned, shall not jeopardize or hamper the reaching of final agreement on compatible conservation and management measures and shall be without prejudice to the final outcome of any dispute settlement procedure.

7.       Coastal States shall regularly inform States fishing on the high seas in the subregion or region, either directly or through appropriate subregional or regional fisheries management organizations or arrangements, or through other appropriate means, of the measures they have adopted for straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks within areas under their national jurisdiction.

8.       States fishing on the high seas shall regularly inform other interested States, either directly or through appropriate subregional or regional fisheries management organizations or arrangements, or through other appropriate means, of the measures they have adopted for regulating the activities of vessels flying their flag which fish for such stocks on the high seas.

PART III

MECHANISMS FOR INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION

CONCERNING STRADDLING FISH STOCKS AND

HIGHLY MIGRATORY FISH STOCKS

<u>Article 8</u>

<u>Cooperation for conservation and management</u>

1.       Coastal States and States fishing on the high seas shall, in accordance with the Convention, pursue cooperation in relation to straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks either directly or through appropriate subregional or regional fisheries management organizations or arrangements, taking into account the specific characteristics of the subregion or region, to ensure effective conservation and management of such stocks.

2.       States shall enter into consultations in good faith and without delay, particularly where there is evidence that the straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks concerned may be under threat of over-exploitation or where a new fishery is being developed for such stocks. To this end, consultations may be initiated at the request of any interested State with a view to establishing appropriate arrangements to ensure conservation and management of the stocks. Pending agreement on such arrangements, States shall observe the provisions of this Agreement and shall act in good faith and with due regard to the rights, interests and duties of other States.

3.       Where a subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement has the competence to establish conservation and management measures for particular straddling fish stocks or highly migratory fish stocks, States fishing for the stocks on the high seas and relevant coastal States shall give effect to their duty to cooperate by becoming members of such organization or participants in such arrangement, or by agreeing to apply the conservation and management measures established by such organization or arrangement. States having a real interest in the fisheries concerned may become members of such organization or participants in such arrangement. The terms of participation in such organization or arrangement shall not preclude such States from membership or participation; nor shall they be applied in a manner which discriminates against any State or group of States having a real interest in the fisheries concerned.

4.       Only those States which are members of such an organization or participants in such an arrangement, or which agree to apply the conservation and management measures established by such organization or arrangement, shall have access to the fishery resources to which those measures apply.

5.       Where there is no subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement to establish conservation and management measures for a particular straddling fish stock or highly migratory fish stock, relevant coastal States and States fishing on the high seas for such stock in the subregion or region shall cooperate to establish such an organization or enter into other appropriate arrangements to ensure conservation and management of such stock and shall participate in the work of the organization or arrangement.

6.       Any State intending to propose that action be taken by an intergovernmental organization having competence with respect to living resources should, where such action would have a significant effect on conservation and management measures already established by a competent subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement, consult through that organization or arrangement with its members or participants. To the extent practicable, such consultation should take place prior to the submission of the proposal to the intergovernmental organization.

<u>Article 9</u>

<u><span style="text-decoration:none"> </span></u>

<u>Subregional and regional fisheries management</u>

<u>organizations and arrangements</u>

1.       In establishing subregional or regional fisheries management organizations or in entering into subregional or regional fisheries management arrangements for straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks, States shall agree, <u>inter alia</u>, on:

          (a)     the stocks to which conservation and management measures apply, taking into account the biological characteristics of the stocks concerned and the nature of the fisheries involved;

          (b)     the area of application, taking into account article 7, paragraph 1, and the characteristics of the subregion or region, including socio-economic, geographical and environmental factors;

          (c)     the relationship between the work of the new organization or arrangement and the role, objectives and operations of any relevant existing fisheries management organizations or arrangements; and

          (d)     the mechanisms by which the organization or arrangement will obtain scientific advice and review the status of the stocks, including, where appropriate, the establishment of a scientific advisory body.

2.       States cooperating in the formation of a subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement shall inform other States which they are aware have a real interest in the work of the proposed organization or arrangement of such cooperation.

<u>Article 10</u>

<u>Functions of subregional and regional</u>

<u>fisheries management organizations</u>

<u>and arrangements</u>

          In fulfilling their obligation to cooperate through subregional or regional fisheries management organizations or arrangements, States shall:

          (c)     require any vessel flying its flag to give information to the investigating authority regarding vessel position, catches, fishing gear, fishing operations and related activities in the area of an alleged violation;

          (d)     if satisfied that sufficient evidence is available in respect of an alleged violation, refer the case to its authorities with a view to instituting proceedings without delay in accordance with its laws and, where appropriate, detain the vessel concerned; and

          (e)     ensure that, where it has been established, in accordance with its laws, a vessel has been involved in the commission of a serious violation of such measures, the vessel does not engage in fishing operations on the high seas until such time as all outstanding sanctions imposed by the flag State in respect of the violation have been complied with.

2.       All investigations and judicial proceedings shall be carried out expeditiously. Sanctions applicable in respect of violations shall be adequate in severity to be effective in securing compliance and to discourage violations wherever they occur and shall deprive offenders of the benefits accruing from their illegal activities. Measures applicable in respect of masters and other officers of fishing vessels shall include provisions which may permit, <u>inter alia</u>, refusal, withdrawal or suspension of authorizations to serve as masters or officers on such vessels.

<u>Article 20</u>

<u><span style="text-decoration:none"> </span></u>

<u>International cooperation</u>

<u>in enforcement</u>

1.       States shall cooperate, either directly or through subregional or regional fisheries management organizations or arrangements, to ensure compliance with and enforcement of subregional and regional conservation and management measures for straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks.

2.       A flag State conducting an investigation of an alleged violation of conservation and management measures for straddling fish stocks or highly migratory fish stocks may request the assistance of any other State whose cooperation may be useful in the conduct of that investigation. All States shall endeavour to meet reasonable requests made by a flag State in connection with such investigations.

3.       A flag State may undertake such investigations directly, in cooperation with other interested States or through the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement. Information on the progress and outcome of the investigations shall be provided to all States having an interest in, or affected by, the alleged violation.

4.       States shall assist each other in identifying vessels reported to have engaged in activities undermining the effectiveness of subregional, regional or global conservation and management measures.

5.       States shall, to the extent permitted by national laws and regulations, establish arrangements for making available to prosecuting authorities in other States evidence relating to alleged violations of such measures.

6.       Where there are reasonable grounds for believing that a vessel on the high seas has been engaged in unauthorized fishing within an area under the jurisdiction of a coastal State, the flag State of that vessel, at the request of the coastal State concerned, shall immediately and fully investigate the matter. The flag State shall cooperate with the coastal State in taking appropriate enforcement action in such cases and may authorize the relevant authorities of the coastal State to board and inspect the vessel on the high seas. This paragraph is without prejudice to article 111 of the Convention.

7.       States Parties which are members of a subregional or regional fisheries management organization or participants in a subregional or regional fisheries management arrangement may take action in accordance with international law, including through recourse to subregional or regional procedures established for this purpose, to deter vessels which have engaged in activities which undermine the effectiveness of or otherwise violate the conservation and management measures established by that organization or arrangement from fishing on the high seas in the subregion or region until such time as appropriate action is taken by the flag State.

<u>Article 21</u>

<u><span style="text-decoration:none"> </span></u>

<u>Subregional and regional cooperation</u>

<u>in enforcement</u>

1.       In any high seas area covered by a subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement, a State Party which is a member of such organization or a participant in such arrangement may, through its duly authorized inspectors, board and inspect, in accordance with paragraph 2, fishing vessels flying the flag of another State Party to this Agreement, whether or not such State Party is also a member of the organization or a participant in the arrangement, for the purpose of ensuring compliance with conservation and management measures for straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks established by that organization or arrangement.

2.       States shall establish, through subregional or regional fisheries management organizations or arrangements, procedures for boarding and inspection pursuant to paragraph 1, as well as procedures to implement other provisions of this article. Such procedures shall be consistent with this article and the basic procedures set out in article 22 and shall not discriminate against non-members of the organization or non-participants in the arrangement. Boarding and inspection as well as any subsequent enforcement action shall be conducted in accordance with such procedures. States shall give due publicity to procedures established pursuant to this paragraph.

3.       If, within two years of the adoption of this Agreement, any organization or arrangement has not established such procedures, boarding and inspection pursuant to paragraph 1, as well as any subsequent enforcement action, shall, pending the establishment of such procedures, be conducted in accordance with this article and the basic procedures set out in article 22.

4.       Prior to taking action under this article, inspecting States shall, either directly or through the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement, inform all States whose vessels fish on the high seas in the subregion or region of the form of identification issued to their duly authorized inspectors. The vessels used for boarding and inspection shall be clearly marked and identifiable as being on government service. At the time of becoming a Party to this Agreement, States shall designate an appropriate authority to receive notifications pursuant to this article and shall give due publicity of such designation through the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement.

5.       Where, following a boarding and inspection, there are clear grounds for believing that a vessel has engaged in any activity contrary to the conservation and management measures referred to in paragraph 1, the inspecting State shall, where appropriate, secure evidence and shall promptly notify the flag State of the alleged violation.

6.       The flag State shall respond to the notification referred to in paragraph 5 within three working days of its receipt, or such other period as may be prescribed in procedures established in accordance with paragraph 2, and shall either:

          (a)     fulfil, without delay, its obligations under article 19 to investigate and, if evidence so warrants, take enforcement action with respect to the vessel, in which case it shall promptly inform the inspecting State of the results of the investigation and of any enforcement action taken; or

          (b)     authorize the inspecting State to investigate.

7.       Where the flag State authorizes the inspecting State to investigate an alleged violation, the inspecting State shall, without delay, communicate the results of that investigation to the flag State. The flag State shall, if evidence so warrants, fulfil its obligations to take enforcement action with respect to the vessel. Alternatively, the flag State may authorize the inspecting State to take such enforcement action as the flag State may specify with respect to the vessel, consistent with the rights and obligations of the flag State under this Agreement.

8.       Where, following boarding and inspection, there are clear grounds for believing that a vessel has committed a serious violation, and the flag State has either failed to respond or failed to take action as required under paragraphs 6 or 7, the inspectors may remain on board and secure evidence and may require the master to assist in further investigation including, where appropriate, by bringing the vessel without delay to the nearest appropriate port, or to such other port as may be specified in procedures established in accordance with paragraph 2\. The inspecting State shall immediately inform the flag State of the name of the port to which the vessel is to proceed. The inspecting State and the flag State and, as appropriate, the port State shall take all necessary steps to ensure the well-being of the crew regardless of their nationality.

9.       The inspecting State shall inform the flag State and the relevant organization or the participants in the relevant arrangement of the results of any further investigation.

10.     The inspecting State shall require its inspectors to observe generally accepted international regulations, procedures and practices relating to the safety of the vessel and the crew, minimize interference with fishing operations and, to the extent practicable, avoid action which would adversely affect the quality of the catch on board. The inspecting State shall ensure that boarding and inspection is not conducted in a manner that would constitute harassment of any fishing vessel.

11.     For the purposes of this article, a serious violation means:

          (a)     fishing without a valid licence, authorization or permit issued by the flag State in accordance with article 18, paragraph 3(a);

          (b)     failing to maintain accurate records of catch and catch-related data, as required by the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement, or serious misreporting of catch, contrary to the catch reporting requirements of such organization or arrangement;

          (c)     fishing in a closed area, fishing during a closed season or fishing without, or after attainment of, a quota established by the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement;

          (d)     directed fishing for a stock which is subject to a moratorium or for which fishing is prohibited;

          (e)     using prohibited fishing gear;

          (f)      falsifying or concealing the markings, identity or registration of a fishing vessel;

          (g)     concealing, tampering with or disposing of evidence relating to an investigation;

          (h)     multiple violations which together constitute a serious disregard of conservation and management measures; or

          (i)      such other violations as may be specified in procedures established by the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement.

12.     Notwithstanding the other provisions of this article, the flag State may, at any time, take action to fulfil its obligations under article 19 with respect to an alleged violation. Where the vessel is under the direction of the inspecting State, the inspecting State shall, at the request of the flag State, release the vessel to the flag State along with full information on the progress and outcome of its investigation.

13.     This article is without prejudice to the right of the flag State to take any measures, including proceedings to impose penalties, according to its laws.

14.     This article applies <u>mutatis mutandis</u> to boarding and inspection by a State Party which is a member of a subregional or regional fisheries management organization or a participant in a subregional or regional fisheries management arrangement and which has clear grounds for believing that a fishing vessel flying the flag of another State Party has engaged in any activity contrary to relevant conservation and management measures referred to in paragraph 1 in the high seas area covered by such organization or arrangement, and such vessel has subsequently, during the same fishing trip, entered into an area under the national jurisdiction of the inspecting State.

15.     Where a subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement has established an alternative mechanism which effectively discharges the obligation under this Agreement of its members or participants to ensure compliance with the conservation and management measures established by the organization or arrangement, members of such organization or participants in such arrangement may agree to limit the application of paragraph 1 as between themselves in respect of the conservation and management measures which have been established in the relevant high seas area.

16.     Action taken by States other than the flag State in respect of vessels having engaged in activities contrary to subregional or regional conservation and management measures shall be proportionate to the seriousness of the violation.

17.     Where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that a fishing vessel on the high seas is without nationality, a State may board and inspect the vessel. Where evidence so warrants, the State may take such action as may be appropriate in accordance with international law.

18.     States shall be liable for damage or loss attributable to them arising from action taken pursuant to this article when such action is unlawful or exceeds that reasonably required in the light of available information to implement the provisions of this article.

<u>Article 22</u>

<u><span style="text-decoration:none"> </span></u>

          (c)     do not interfere with the master’s ability to communicate with the authorities of the flag State during the boarding and inspection;

          (d)     provide a copy of a report on the boarding and inspection to the master and to the authorities of the flag State, noting therein any objection or statement which the master wishes to have included in the report;

          (e)     promptly leave the vessel following completion of the inspection if they find no evidence of a serious violation; and

          (f)      avoid the use of force except when and to the degree necessary to ensure the safety of the inspectors and where the inspectors are obstructed in the execution of their duties. The degree of force used shall not exceed that reasonably required in the circumstances.

2.       The duly authorized inspectors of an inspecting State shall have the authority to inspect the vessel, its licence, gear, equipment, records, facilities, fish and fish products and any relevant documents necessary to verify compliance with the relevant conservation and management measures.

3.       The flag State shall ensure that vessel masters:

          (a)     accept and facilitate prompt and safe boarding by the inspectors;

          (b)     cooperate with and assist in the inspection of the vessel conducted pursuant to these procedures;

          (c)     do not obstruct, intimidate or interfere with the inspectors in the performance of their duties;

          (d)     allow the inspectors to communicate with the authorities of the flag State and the inspecting State during the boarding and inspection;

          (e)     provide reasonable facilities, including, where appropriate, food and accommodation, to the inspectors; and

          (f)      facilitate safe disembarkation by the inspectors.

4.       In the event that the master of a vessel refuses to accept boarding and inspection in accordance with this article and article 21, the flag State shall, except in circumstances where, in accordance with generally accepted international regulations, procedures and practices relating to safety at sea, it is necessary to delay the boarding and inspection, direct the master of the vessel to submit immediately to boarding and inspection and, if the master does not comply with such direction, shall suspend the vessel’s authorization to fish and order the vessel to return immediately to port. The flag State shall advise the inspecting State of the action it has taken when the circumstances referred to in this paragraph arise.

<u>Article 23</u>

<u><span style="text-decoration:none"> </span></u>

<u>Measures taken by a port State</u>

1.       A port State has the right and the duty to take measures, in accordance with international law, to promote the effectiveness of subregional, regional and global conservation and management measures. When taking such measures a port State shall not discriminate in form or in fact against the vessels of any State.

2.       A port State may, <u>inter alia</u>, inspect documents, fishing gear and catch on board fishing vessels, when such vessels are voluntarily in its ports or at its offshore terminals.

3.       States may adopt regulations empowering the relevant national authorities to prohibit landings and transshipments where it has been established that the catch has been taken in a manner which undermines the effectiveness of subregional, regional or global conservation and management measures on the high seas.

4.       Nothing in this article affects the exercise by States of their sovereignty over ports in their territory in accordance with international law.

ANNEX I

STANDARD REQUIREMENTS FOR THE

COLLECTION AND SHARING OF DATA

<u>Article 1</u>

<u><span style="text-decoration:none"> </span></u>

<u>General principles</u>

1.       The timely collection, compilation and analysis of data are fundamental to the effective conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks. To this end, data from fisheries for these stocks on the high seas and those in areas under national jurisdiction are required and should be collected and compiled in such a way as to enable statistically meaningful analysis for the purposes of fishery resource conservation and management. These data include catch and fishing effort statistics and other fishery-related information, such as vessel-related and other data for standardizing fishing effort. Data collected should also include information on non-target and associated or dependent species. All data should be verified to ensure accuracy. Confidentiality of non-aggregated data shall be maintained. The dissemination of such data shall be subject to the terms on which they have been provided.

2.       Assistance, including training as well as financial and technical assistance, shall be provided to developing States in order to build capacity in the field of conservation and management of living marine resources. Assistance should focus on enhancing capacity to implement data collection and verification, observer programs, data analysis and research projects supporting stock assessments. The fullest possible involvement of developing State scientists and managers in conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks should be promoted.

<u>Article 2</u>

<u><span style="text-decoration:none"> </span></u>

<u>Principles of data collection,</u>

<u>compilation and exchange</u>

          The following general principles should be considered in defining the parameters for collection, compilation and exchange of data from fishing operations for straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks:

          (a)     States should ensure that data are collected from vessels flying their flag on fishing activities according to the operational characteristics of each fishing method (e.g., each individual tow for trawl, each set for long-line and purse-seine, each school fished for pole-and-line and each day fished for troll) and in sufficient detail to facilitate effective stock assessment;

          (b)     States should ensure that fishery data are verified through an appropriate system;

          (c)     States should compile fishery-related and other supporting scientific data and provide them in an agreed format and in a timely manner to the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement where one exists. Otherwise, States should cooperate to exchange data either directly or through such other cooperative mechanisms as may be agreed among them;

          (d)     States should agree, within the framework of subregional or regional fisheries management organizations or arrangements, or otherwise, on the specification of data and the format in which they are to be provided, in accordance with this Annex and taking into account the nature of the stocks and the fisheries for those stocks in the region. Such organizations or arrangements should request non-members or non-participants to provide data concerning relevant fishing activities by vessels flying their flag;

          (e)     such organizations or arrangements shall compile data and make them available in a timely manner and in an agreed format to all interested States under the terms and conditions established by the organization or arrangement; and

          (f)      scientists of the flag State and from the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement should analyse the data separately or jointly, as appropriate.

<u>Article 3</u>

<u><span style="text-decoration:none"> </span></u>

<u>Basic fishery data</u>

1.       States shall collect and make available to the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement the following types of data in sufficient detail to facilitate effective stock assessment in accordance with agreed procedures:

          (a)     time series of catch and effort statistics by fishery and fleet;

          (b)     total catch in number, nominal weight, or both, by species (both target and non-target) as is appropriate to each fishery. \[Nominal weight is defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations as the live-weight equivalent of the landings];

          (c)     discard statistics, including estimates where necessary, reported as number or nominal weight by species, as is appropriate to each fishery;

          (d)     effort statistics appropriate to each fishing method; and

          (e)     fishing location, date and time fished and other statistics on fishing operations as appropriate.

2.       States shall also collect where appropriate and provide to the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement information to support stock assessment, including:

          (a)     composition of the catch according to length, weight and sex;

          (b)     other biological information supporting stock assessments such as information on age, growth, recruitment, distribution and stock identity; and

          (c)     other relevant research, including surveys of abundance, biomass surveys, hydro-acoustic surveys, research on environmental factors affecting stock abundance, and oceanographic and ecological studies.

<u>Article 4</u>

<u><span style="text-decoration:none"> </span></u>

<u>Vessel data and information</u>

1.       States should collect the following types of vessel-related data for standardizing fleet composition and vessel fishing power and for converting between different measures of effort in the analysis of catch and effort data:

          (a)     vessel identification, flag and port of registry;

          (b)     vessel type;

          (c)     vessel specifications (e.g., material of construction, date built, registered length, gross registered tonnage, power of main engines, hold capacity and catch storage methods); and

          (d)     fishing gear description (e.g., types, gear specifications and quantity).

2.       The flag State will collect the following information:

          (a)     navigation and position fixing aids;

          (b)     communication equipment and international radio call sign; and

          (c)     crew size.

<u>Article 5</u>

<u><span style="text-decoration:none"> </span></u>

<u>Reporting</u>

          A State shall ensure that vessels flying its flag send to its national fisheries administration and, where agreed, to the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement, logbook data on catch and effort, including data on fishing operations on the high seas, at sufficiently frequent intervals to meet national requirements and regional and international obligations. Such data shall be transmitted, where necessary, by radio, telex, facsimile or satellite transmission or by other means.

<u>Article 6</u>

<u><span style="text-decoration:none"> </span></u>

<u>Data verification</u>

          States or, as appropriate, subregional or regional fisheries management organizations or arrangements should establish mechanisms for verifying fishery data, such as:

          (a)     position verification through vessel monitoring systems;

          (b)     scientific observer programs to monitor catch, effort, catch composition (target and non-target) and other details of fishing operations;

          (c)     vessel trip, landing and transshipment reports; and

          (d)     port sampling.

<u>Article 7</u>

<u><span style="text-decoration:none"> </span></u>

<u>Data exchange</u>

1.       Data collected by flag States must be shared with other flag States and relevant coastal States through appropriate subregional or regional fisheries management organizations or arrangements. Such organizations or arrangements shall compile data and make them available in a timely manner and in an agreed format to all interested States under the terms and conditions established by the organization or arrangement, while maintaining confidentiality of non-aggregated data, and should, to the extent feasible, develop database systems which provide efficient access to data.

2.       At the global level, collection and dissemination of data should be effected through the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Where a subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement does not exist, that organization may also do the same at the subregional or regional level by arrangement with the States concerned.

ANNEX II

GUIDELINES FOR THE APPLICATION OF PRECAUTIONARY REFERENCE POINTS IN CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT

OF STRADDLING FISH STOCKS AND HIGHLY MIGRATORY

FISH STOCKS

1.       A precautionary reference point is an estimated value derived through an agreed scientific procedure, which corresponds to the state of the resource and of the fishery, and which can be used as a guide for fisheries management.

2.       Two types of precautionary reference points should be used: conservation, or limit, reference points and management, or target, reference points. Limit reference points set boundaries which are intended to constrain harvesting within safe biological limits within which the stocks can produce maximum sustainable yield. Target reference points are intended to meet management objectives.

3.       Precautionary reference points should be stock-specific to account, <u>inter alia</u>, for the reproductive capacity, the resilience of each stock and the characteristics of fisheries exploiting the stock, as well as other sources of mortality and major sources of uncertainty.

4.       Management strategies shall seek to maintain or restore populations of harvested stocks, and where necessary associated or dependent species, at levels consistent with previously agreed precautionary reference points. Such reference points shall be used to trigger pre-agreed conservation and management action. Management strategies shall include measures which can be implemented when precautionary reference points are approached.

5.       Fishery management strategies shall ensure that the risk of exceeding limit reference points is very low. If a stock falls below a limit reference point or is at risk of falling below such a reference point, conservation and management action should be initiated to facilitate stock recovery. Fishery management strategies shall ensure that target reference points are not exceeded on average.

6.       When information for determining reference points for a fishery is poor or absent, provisional reference points shall be set. Provisional reference points may be established by analogy to similar and better-known stocks. In such situations, the fishery shall be subject to enhanced monitoring so as to enable revision of provisional reference points as improved information becomes available.

7.       The fishing mortality rate which generates maximum sustainable yield should be regarded as a minimum standard for limit reference points. For stocks which are not overfished, fishery management strategies shall ensure that fishing mortality does not exceed that which corresponds to maximum sustainable yield, and that the biomass does not fall below a predefined threshold. For overfished stocks, the biomass which would produce maximum sustainable yield can serve as a rebuilding target.

# Schedule 3—Compliance Agreement

_Note:       See subsection 4(1) (definition of Compliance Agreement)._

**<u>Agreement to Promote Compliance</u>**

**<u>with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas</u>**

**<u>PREAMBLE</u>**

<u> </u>

**<u>The</u>**<u> **Parties to this Agreement**</u>**,**

<u>Recognizing</u> that all States have the right for their nationals to engage in fishing on the high seas, subject to the relevant rules of international law, as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,

<u>Further recognizing</u> that, under international law as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, all States have the duty to take, or to cooperate with other States in taking, such measures for their respective nationals as may be necessary for the conservation of the living resources of the high seas,

<u>Acknowledging</u> the right and interest of all States to develop their fishing sectors in accordance with their national policies, and the need to promote cooperation with developing countries to enhance their capabilities to fulfil their obligations under this Agreement,

<u>Recalling</u> that Agenda 21, adopted by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, calls upon States to take effective action, consistent with international law, to deter reflagging of vessels by their nationals as a means of avoiding compliance with applicable conservation and management rules for fishing activities on the high seas,

<u>Further recalling</u> that the Declaration of Cancun, adopted by the International Conference on Responsible Fishing, also calls on States to take action in this respect,

<u>Bearing in mind</u> that under Agenda 21, States commit themselves to the conservation and sustainable use of marine living resources on the high seas,

<u>Calling upon</u> States which do not participate in global, regional or subregional fisheries organizations or arrangements to join or, as appropriate, to enter into understandings with such organizations or with parties to such organizations or arrangements with a view to achieving compliance with international conservation and management measures,

<u>Conscious</u> of the duties of every State to exercise effectively its jurisdiction and control over vessels flying its flag, including fishing vessels and vessels engaged in the transhipment of fish,

<u>Mindful</u> that the practice of flagging or reflagging fishing vessels as a means of avoiding compliance with international conservation and management measures for living marine resources, and the failure of flag States to fulfil their responsibilities with respect to fishing vessels entitled to fly their flag, are among the factors that seriously undermine the effectiveness of such measures,

<u>Realizing</u> that the objective of this Agreement can be achieved through specifying flag States’ responsibility in respect of fishing vessels entitled to fly their flags and operating on the high seas, including the authorization by the flag State of such operations, as well as through strengthened international cooperation and increased transparency through the exchange of information on high seas fishing,

<u>Noting</u> that this Agreement will form an integral part of the International Code of Conduct for Responsible Fishing called for in the Declaration of Cancun,

<u>Desiring</u> to conclude an international agreement within the framework of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, hereinafter referred to as FAO, under Article XIV of the FAO Constitution,

**Have agreed as follows**:

**Article I**

**DEFINITIONS**

For the purposes of this Agreement:

(a)       “fishing vessel” means any vessel used or intended for use for the purposes of the commercial exploitation of living marine resources, including mother ships and any other vessels directly engaged in such fishing operations;

(b)       “international conservation and management measures” means measures to conserve or manage one or more species of living marine resources that are adopted and applied in accordance with the relevant rules of international law as reflected in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Such measures may be adopted either by global, regional or subregional fisheries organizations, subject to the rights and obligations of their members, or by treaties or other international agreements;

            (c)        “length” means

(i)         for any fishing vessel built after 18 July 1982, 96 percent of the total length on a waterline at 85 percent of the least moulded depth measured from the top of the keel, or the length from the foreside of the stem to the axis of the rudder stock on that waterline, if that be greater. In ships designed with a rake of keel the waterline on which this length is measured shall be parallel to the designed waterline;

(ii)        for any fishing vessel built before 18 July 1982, registered length as entered on the national register or other record of vessels;

(d)        “record of fishing vessels” means a record of fishing vessels in which are recorded pertinent details of the fishing vessel. It may constitute a separate record for fishing vessels or form part of a general record of vessels;

(e)        “regional economic integration organization” means a regional economic integration organization to which its member States have transferred competence over matters covered by this Agreement, including the authority to make decisions binding on its member States in respect of those matters;

(f)        “vessels entitled to fly its flag” and “vessels entitled to fly the flag of a State”, includes vessels entitled to fly the flag of a member State of a regional economic integration organization.

**Article II**

**APPLICATION**

1.         Subject to the following paragraphs of this Article, this Agreement shall apply to all fishing vessels that are used or intended for fishing on the high seas.

2.         A Party may exempt fishing vessels of less than 24 metres in length entitled to fly its flag from the application of this Agreement unless the Party determines that such an exemption would undermine the object and purpose of this Agreement, provided that such exemptions:

(a)        shall not be granted in respect of fishing vessels operating in fishing regions referred to in paragraph 3 below, other than fishing vessels that are entitled to fly the flag of a coastal State of that fishing region; and

(b)        shall not apply to the obligations undertaken by a Party under paragraph 1 of Article III, or paragraph 7 of Article VI of this Agreement.

3.         Without prejudice to the provisions of paragraph 2 above, in any fishing region where bordering coastal States have not yet declared exclusive economic zones, or equivalent zones of national jurisdiction over fisheries, such coastal States as are Parties to this Agreement may agree, either directly or through appropriate regional fisheries organizations, to establish a minimum length of fishing vessels below which this Agreement shall not apply in respect of fishing vessels flying the flag of any such coastal State and operating exclusively in such fishing region.

**Article III**

**FLAG STATE RESPONSIBILITY**

1.         (a)        Each Party shall take such measures as may be necessary to ensure that fishing vessels entitled to fly its flag do not engage in any activity that undermines the effectiveness of international conservation and management measures.

            (b)        In the event that a Party has, pursuant to paragraph 2 of Article II, granted an exemption for fishing vessels of less than 24 metres in length entitled to fly its flag from the application of other provisions of this Agreement, such Party shall nevertheless take effective measures in respect of any such fishing vessel that undermines the effectiveness of international conservation and management measures. These measures shall be such as to ensure that the fishing vessel ceases to engage in activities that undermine the effectiveness of the international conservation and management measures.

2.         In particular, no Party shall allow any fishing vessel entitled to fly its flag to be used for fishing on the high seas unless it has been authorized to be so used by the appropriate authority or authorities of that Party. A fishing vessel so authorized shall fish in accordance with the conditions of the authorization.

3.         No Party shall authorize any fishing vessel entitled to fly its flag to be used for fishing on the high seas unless the Party is satisfied that it is able, taking into account the links that exist between it and the fishing vessel concerned, to exercise effectively its responsibilities under this Agreement in respect of that fishing vessel.

4.         Where a fishing vessel that has been authorized to be used for fishing on the high seas by a Party ceases to be entitled to fly the flag of that Party, the authorization to fish on the high seas shall be deemed to have been cancelled.

5.         (a)        No Party shall authorize any fishing vessel previously registered in the territory of another Party that has undermined the effectiveness of international conservation and management measures to be used for fishing on the high seas, unless it is satisfied that

(i)                  any period of suspension by another Party of an authorization for such fishing vessel to be used for fishing on the high seas has expired; and

(ii)        no authorization for such fishingvessel to be used for fishing on the high seas has been withdrawn by another Party within the last three years.

(b)        The provisions of subparagraph (a) above shall also apply in respect of fishing vessels previously registered in the territory of a State which is not a Party to this Agreement, provided that sufficient information is available to the Party concerned on the circumstances in which the authorization to fish was suspended or withdrawn.

(c)        The provisions of subparagraphs (a) and (b) shall not apply where the ownership of the fishing vessel has subsequently changed, and the new owner has provided sufficient evidence demonstrating that the previous owner or operator has no further legal, beneficial or financial interest in, or control of, the fishing vessel.

(d)        Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraphs (a) and (b) above, a Party may authorize a fishing vessel, to which those subparagraphs would otherwise apply, to be used for fishing on the high seas, where the Party concerned, after having taken into account all relevant facts, including the circumstances in which the fishing authorization has been withdrawn by the other Party or State, has determined that to grant an authorization to use the vessel for fishing on the high seas would not undermine the object and purpose of this Agreement.

6.         Each party shall ensure that all fishing vessels entitled to fly its flag that it has entered in the record maintained under Article IV are marked in such a way that they can be readily identified in accordance with generally accepted standards, such as the FAO Standard Specifications for the Marking and Identification of Fishing Vessels.

7.         Each Party shall ensure that each fishing vessel entitled to fly its flag shall provide it with such information on its operations as may be necessary to enable the Party to fulfil its obligations under this Agreement, including in particular information pertaining to the area of its fishing operations and to its catches and landings.

8.         Each Party shall take enforcement measures in respect of fishing vessels entitled to fly its flag which act in contravention of the provisions of this Agreement, including, where appropriate, making the contravention of such provisions an offence under national legislation. Sanctions applicable in respect of such contraventions shall be of sufficient gravity as to be effective in securing compliance with the requirements of this Agreement and to deprive offenders of the benefits accruing from their illegal activities. Such sanctions shall, for serious offences, include refusal, suspension or withdrawal of the authorization to fish on the high seas.

**Article IV**

**RECORDS OF** **FISHING VESSELS**

2.         When a fishing vessel is voluntarily in the port of a Party other than its flag State, that Party, where it has reasonable grounds for believing that the fishing vessel has been used for an activity that undermines the effectiveness of international conservation and management measures, shall promptly notify the flag State accordingly. Parties may make arrangements regarding the undertaking by port States of such investigatory measures as may be considered necessary to establish whether the fishing vessel has indeed been used contrary to the provisions of this Agreement.
