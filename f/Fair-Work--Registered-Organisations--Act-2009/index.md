## An Act relating to registered organisations, and for other purposes

# Chapter 1—Preliminary

##### <a id="1"></a>1  Short title

                   This Act may be cited as the _Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009_.

##### <a id="2"></a>2  Commencement

                   This Act commences on a day or days to be fixed by Proclamation.

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Parliament’s intention in enacting this Act

             (1)  It is Parliament’s intention in enacting this Act to enhance relations within workplaces between federal system employers and federal system employees and to reduce the adverse effects of industrial disputation.

             (2)  Parliament considers that those relations will be enhanced and those adverse effects will be reduced, if associations of employers and employees are required to meet the standards set out in this Act in order to gain the rights and privileges accorded to associations under this Act and the Fair Work Act.

             (3)  The standards set out in this Act:

                     (a)  ensure that employer and employee organisations registered under this Act are representative of and accountable to their members, and are able to operate effectively; and

                     (b)  encourage members to participate in the affairs of organisations to which they belong; and

                     (c)  encourage the efficient management of organisations and high standards of accountability of organisations to their members; and

                     (d)  provide for the democratic functioning and control of organisations; and

                     (e)  facilitate the registration of a diverse range of employer and employee organisations.

             (4)  It is also Parliament’s intention in enacting this Act to assist employers and employees to promote and protect their economic and social interests through the formation of employer and employee organisations, by providing for the registration of those associations and according rights and privileges to them once registered.

             (5)  Parliament recognises and respects the role of employer and employee organisations in facilitating the operation of the workplace relations system.

Note:          The Fair Work Act contains many provisions that affect the operation of this Act. For example, provisions of the Fair Work Act deal with some powers and functions of the Fair Work Commission and of the General Manager. Decisions made under this Act may be subject to procedures and rules (for example, about appeals) that are set out in the Fair Work Act.

##### <a id="5A"></a>5A  Act binds Crown

             (1)  This Act binds the Crown in each of its capacities.

             (2)  However, this Act does not make the Crown liable to be prosecuted for an offence.

##### <a id="18C"></a>18C  Federally registrable enterprise associations

             (1)  An **_enterprise association_** is an association the majority of the members of which are employees performing work in the same enterprise.

                              (i)  an employee who could be characterised in the way mentioned in paragraph (a) of the definition of **_federal system employee_** in section 6; and

                             (ii)  an employee who would be eligible for membership of the association;

                     (b)  it does not satisfy paragraphs (b) to (k) of subsection (2).

##### <a id="18D"></a>18D  Constitutional validity

Associations of employers

             (1)  If the Parliament would not have sufficient legislative power to provide for the registration of a particular association of employers if:

                     (a)  a particular class of employers mentioned in paragraphs (a) to (f) of the definition of **_national system employer_** in section 14 of the Fair Work Act were included when working out whether some or all of the association’s members are federal system employers;

that definition applies as if it did not include a reference to that class of employers.

             (2)  If the Parliament would only have sufficient legislative power to provide for the registration of a particular association of employers if the membership of the association were entirely made up of one or more of the following:

                     (a)  federal system employers;

                     (b)  persons (other than employees) who carry on business and who would, if they were employers, be federal system employers;

                     (c)  officers of the association;

then, despite subsection 18A(1), the association is not **_federally registrable_** unless it is either a constitutional corporation or made up in that way.

Associations of employees

             (3)  If the Parliament would not have sufficient legislative power to provide for the registration of an association of employees if:

                     (a)  a particular class of individuals so far as they are employed, or usually employed, as described in paragraph (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) or (f) of the definition of **_national system employer_** in section 14 of the Fair Work Act, by a federal system employer were included when working out whether some or all of the association’s members are federal system employees;

the definition of **_federal system employee_** in section 6 applies as if it did not include a reference to that class of employees.

          (3A)  If the Parliament would not have sufficient legislative power to provide for the registration of an association of employees if:

                     (a)  a particular class of individuals mentioned in paragraph (c) of the definition of **_federal system employee_** in section 6 were included in working out whether some or all of the association’s members are federal system employees;

that definition applies as if it did not include a reference to that class of employees.

             (4)  If the Parliament would only have sufficient legislative power to provide for the registration of a particular association of employees if the membership of the association were entirely made up of one or more of the following:

                     (a)  federal system employees;

                     (b)  persons specified in subsection 18B(4);

                     (c)  officers of the association;

then, despite subsection 18B(1), the association is not **_federally registrable_** unless it is either a constitutional corporation or made up in that way.

Enterprise associations

             (5)  If the Parliament would only have sufficient legislative power to provide for the registration of an enterprise association if the membership of the association were entirely made up of one or more of the following:

                     (a)  federal system employees performing work in the relevant enterprise;

                     (b)  persons specified in subsection 18C(4);

                     (c)  officers of the association;

then, despite subsection 18C(2), the association is not **_federally registrable_** unless it is either a constitutional corporation or made up in that way.

### Division 2—Registration criteria

##### <a id="19"></a>19  Criteria for registration of associations other than enterprise associations

             (1)  The FWC must grant an application for registration made by an association (other than an enterprise association) that, under section 18, may apply for registration as an organisation if, and only if:

                     (a)  the association:

                              (i)  is a genuine association of a kind referred to in paragraph 18(a) or (b); and

                             (ii)  is an association for furthering or protecting the interests of its members; and

                     (b)  in the case of an association of employees—the association is free from control by, or improper influence from, an employer or by an association or organisation of employers; and

                     (c)  in the case of an association of employers—the members who are employers have, in the aggregate, throughout the 6 months before the application, employed on an average taken per month at least 50 employees; and

                     (d)  in the case of an association of employees—the association has at least 50 members who are employees; and

                     (e)  the FWC is satisfied that the association would conduct its affairs in a way that meets the obligations of an organisation under this Act and the Fair Work Act; and

                      (f)  the rules of the association make provision as required by this Act to be made by the rules of organisations; and

                     (g)  the association does not have the same name as that of an organisation or a name that is so similar to the name of an organisation as to be likely to cause confusion; and

                     (h)  a majority of the members present at a general meeting of the association, or an absolute majority of the committee of management of the association, have passed, under the rules of the association, a resolution in favour of registration of the association as an organisation; and

                      (i)  the registration of the association would further Parliament’s intention in enacting this Act (see section 5) and the object set out in section 3 of the Fair Work Act; and

                      (j)  subject to subsection (2), there is no organisation to which members of the association might belong or, if there is such an organisation, it is not an organisation:

                              (i)  to which the members of the association could more conveniently belong; and

                             (ii)  that would more effectively represent those members.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  there is an organisation to which the members of the association might belong; and

                     (b)  the members of the association could more conveniently belong to the organisation; and

                     (c)  the organisation would more effectively represent those members than the association would;

the requirements of paragraph (1)(j) are taken to have been met if the FWC accepts an undertaking from the association that the FWC considers appropriate to avoid demarcation disputes that might otherwise arise from an overlap between the eligibility rules of the organisation and the eligibility rules of the association.

             (3)  Without limiting the matters that the FWC may take into account in considering, under subparagraph (1)(j)(ii), the effectiveness of the representation of an organisation or association, the FWC must take into account whether the representation would be consistent with Parliament’s intention in enacting this Act (see section 5) and the object set out in section 3 of the Fair Work Act.

             (4)  In applying paragraph (1)(e), the FWC must have regard to whether any recent conduct by the association or its members would have provided grounds for an application under section 28 had the association been registered when the conduct occurred.

             (5)  The FWC must not, under this section, grant an application for registration of an association of employers or employees registered under a State or Territory industrial law if the association has a federal counterpart.

##### <a id="20"></a>20  Criteria for registration of enterprise associations

             (1)  The FWC must grant an application for registration made by an enterprise association that, under section 18, may apply for registration as an organisation if, and only if:

                     (a)  the association:

                              (i)  is a genuine association of a kind referred to in paragraph 18(c); and

                             (ii)  is an association for furthering or protecting the interests of its members; and

                     (b)  the association is free from control by, or improper influence from:

                              (i)  any employer, whether at the enterprise in question or otherwise; or

                             (ii)  any person or body with an interest in that enterprise; or

                            (iii)  any organisation, or any other association of employers or employees; and

                     (c)  the association has at least 20 members who are employees; and

                     (d)  the FWC is satisfied that the association would conduct its affairs in a way that meets the obligations of an organisation under this Act and the Fair Work Act; and

                     (e)  the rules of the association make provision as required by this Act to be made by the rules of organisations; and

                      (f)  the association does not have the same name as that of an organisation or a name that is so similar to the name of an organisation as to be likely to cause confusion; and

                     (g)  the FWC is satisfied that a majority of the persons eligible to be members of the association support its registration as an organisation; and

                     (h)  a majority of the members present at a general meeting of the association, or an absolute majority of the committee of management of the association, have passed, under the rules of the association, a resolution in favour of registration of the association as an organisation; and

                      (i)  the registration of the association would further Parliament’s intention in enacting this Act (see section 5) and the object set out in section 3 of the Fair Work Act.

          (1A)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), if a person or body has an interest in the enterprise in question, the FWC may decide that, despite the interest, the association is free from control by, or improper influence from, the person or body.

Note:          The FWC could conclude that the association was free from control etc. by the person if, for example, the nature of the person’s interest was not such as to give the person a major say in the conduct of the enterprise or if the person did not have a significant management role in the association.

             (2)  In applying paragraph (1)(d), the FWC must have regard to whether any recent conduct by the association or its members would have provided grounds for an application under section 28 had the association been registered when the conduct occurred.

### Division 3—Prohibited conduct in relation to formation or registration of employee associations

##### <a id="21"></a>21  Prohibited conduct—employers

             (1)  An employer must not, for a prohibited reason, or for reasons that include a prohibited reason, do or threaten to do any of the following:

                     (c)  alter the position of an independent contractor to the independent contractor’s prejudice;

                     (d)  discriminate against an independent contractor.

             (3)  Conduct referred to in subsection (1) or (2) is for a **_prohibited reason_** if it is carried out because the employee or independent contractor has done, or has omitted to do, any act:

                     (a)  under this Act that relates to the formation or registration of an association referred to in paragraph 18(b) or (c); or

                     (b)  in connection with, or in preparation for, such an act or omission.

             (4)  The following are examples of acts or omissions to which subsection (3) applies:

                     (c)  participating, or encouraging a person to participate, in proceedings before the FWC in relation to such an application;

                     (d)  not participating, or encouraging a person not to participate, in such proceedings;

             (1)  An organisation, or an officer or member of an organisation, must not take, or threaten to take, industrial action whose aim, or one of whose aims, is to coerce a person to breach section 21.

             (2)  An organisation, or an officer or member of an organisation, must not, for a prohibited reason, or for reasons that include a prohibited reason, take or threaten to take, any action whose aim, or one of whose aims, is to prejudice a person in the person’s employment, or an independent contractor in the contractor’s engagement.

             (3)  Conduct referred to in subsection (2) is for a **_prohibited reason_** if it is carried out because the person  has done, or has omitted to do, any act:

                     (a)  under this Act that relates to the formation or registration of an association referred to in paragraph 18(b) or (c); or

                     (b)  in connection with, or in preparation for, such an act or omission.

             (4)  The examples set out in subsection 21(4) are examples of acts or omissions to which subsection (3) of this section applies.

             (5)  An organisation, or an officer or member of an organisation, must not impose, or threaten to impose, a penalty, forfeiture or disability of any kind on a member of the organisation because the member concerned does or proposes to do, for a prohibited reason, an act or omission referred to in subsection 21(3).

##### <a id="23"></a>23  Powers of Federal Court in relation to prohibited conduct

             (1)  The Federal Court may, if the Court considers it appropriate in all the circumstances, make one or more of the following orders in respect of conduct that contravenes section 21 or 22:

                     (a)  an order imposing on a person whose conduct contravenes that section a penalty of not more than:

             (2)  Subparagraphs (1)(a)(iii) and (iv) and paragraph (1)(b) do not apply if:

                     (a)  in relation to subparagraphs (1)(a)(iii) and (iv):

                              (i)  a committee of management of the organisation; or

                             (ii)  a person authorised by the committee; or

### Division 4—Registration process

##### <a id="25"></a>25  Applicant for registration may change its name or alter its rules

             (1)  The FWC may, on the application of an association applying to be registered as an organisation, grant leave to the association, on such terms and conditions as the FWC considers appropriate, to change its name or to alter its rules:

                     (a)  to enable it to comply with this Act; or

                     (b)  to remove a ground of objection taken by an objector under the regulations or by the FWC; or

                     (c)  to correct a formal error in its rules (for example, to remove an ambiguity, to correct spelling or grammar, or to correct an incorrect reference to an organisation or person).

Note:          Paragraph (a)—in order for an organisation to comply with this Act, its rules must not be contrary to the Fair Work Act (see paragraph 142(1)(a) of this Act).

             (2)  An association granted leave under subsection (1) may change its name, or alter its rules, even though the application for registration is pending.

             (3)  Rules of an association as altered in accordance with leave granted under subsection (1) are binding on the members of the association:

                     (a)  in spite of anything in the other rules of the association; and

                     (b)  subject to any further alterations lawfully made.

##### <a id="26"></a>26  Registration

             (1)  When the FWC grants an application by an association for registration as an organisation, the General Manager must immediately enter, in the register kept under paragraph 13(1)(a), such particulars in relation to the association as are prescribed and the date of the entry.

             (2)  An association is to be taken to be registered under this Act when the General Manager enters the prescribed particulars in the register under subsection (1).

             (3)  On registration, an association becomes an organisation.

             (4)  The General Manager must issue to each organisation registered under this Act a certificate of registration in the prescribed form.

Note:          Certificates of registration issued under the _Workplace Relations Act 1996_ continue in force (see the _Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Registration and Accountability of Organisations) (Consequential Provisions) Act 2002_).

             (5)  The certificate is, until proof of cancellation, conclusive evidence of the registration of the organisation specified in the certificate.

             (6)  The General Manager may, as prescribed, issue to an organisation a copy of, or a certificate replacing, the certificate of registration issued under subsection (4) or that certificate as amended under section 160.

##### <a id="26A"></a>26A  Validation of registration

                   If:

                     (a)  an association was purportedly registered as an organisation under this Act before the commencement of this section; and

                     (b)  the association’s purported registration would, but for this section, have been invalid merely because, at any time, the association’s rules did not have the effect of terminating the membership of, or precluding from membership, persons who were persons of a particular kind or kinds;

that registration is taken, for all purposes, to be valid and to have always been valid.

##### <a id="27"></a>27  Incorporation

                   An organisation:

## Part 3—Cancellation of registration

##### <a id="28"></a>28  Application for cancellation of registration

             (1)  An organisation or person interested, or the Minister, may apply to the Federal Court for an order cancelling the registration of an organisation on the ground that:

                     (a)  the conduct of:

                              (i)  the organisation (in relation to its continued breach of a modern award, an order of the FWC or an enterprise agreement, or its continued failure to ensure that its members comply with and observe a modern award, an order of the FWC or an enterprise agreement, or in any other respect); or

                             (ii)  a substantial number of the members of the organisation (in relation to their continued breach of a modern award, an order of the FWC or an enterprise agreement, or in any other respect);

                            has prevented or hindered the achievement of Parliament’s intention in enacting this Act (see section 5) or of an object of this Act or the Fair Work Act; or

                     (b)  the organisation, or a substantial number of the members of the organisation or of a section or class of members of the organisation, has engaged in industrial action (other than protected industrial action) that has prevented, hindered or interfered with:

                              (i)  the activities of a federal system employer; or

                             (ii)  the provision of any public service by the Commonwealth or a State or Territory or an authority of the Commonwealth or a State or Territory; or

                     (c)  the organisation, or a substantial number of the members of the organisation or of a section or class of members of the organisation, has or have been, or is or are, engaged in industrial action (other than protected industrial action) that has had, is having or is likely to have a substantial adverse effect on the safety, health or welfare of the community or a part of the community; or

                     (d)  the organisation, or a substantial number of the members of the organisation or of a section or class of members of the organisation, has or have failed to comply with:

                              (i)  an injunction granted under subsection 421(3) of the Fair Work Act (which deals with orders to stop industrial action); or

                             (ii)  an order made under the Fair Work Act in relation to a contravention of Part 3‑1 of that Act (which deals with general protections); or

                            (iv)  an interim injunction granted under section 545 of the Fair Work Act so far as it relates to conduct or proposed conduct that could be the subject of an injunction or order under a provision of the Fair Work Act mentioned in subparagraphs (i) to (iii); or

                             (v)  an order made under section 23 (which deals with contraventions of the employee associations provisions); or

                            (vi)  an order made under subsection 131(2) (which deals with contraventions of the withdrawal from amalgamation provisions).

          (1A)  The General Manager may apply to the Federal Court for an order cancelling the registration of an organisation on the ground that the organisation has failed to comply with an order of the Federal Court made under subsection 336(5) in relation to the organisation.

Note:          Section 336 deals with the situation where the General Manager is satisfied, after an investigation, that a reporting unit of an organisation has contravened Part 3 of Chapter 8, or guidelines or rules relating to financial matters.

             (2)  An organisation in relation to which an application is made under subsection (1) or (1A) must be given an opportunity of being heard by the Court.

             (3)  If the Court:

                     (a)  finds that a ground for cancellation set out in the application has been established; and

                     (b)  does not consider that it would be unjust to do so having regard to the degree of gravity of the matters constituting the ground and the action (if any) that has been taken by or against the organisation in relation to the matters;

the Court must, subject to subsection (4) and section 29, cancel the registration of the organisation.

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  the Court finds that a ground for cancellation set out in the application has been established; and

                     (b)  that finding is made, wholly or mainly, because of the conduct of a particular section or class of members of the organisation;

the Court may, if it considers it just to do so, instead of cancelling the registration of the organisation under subsection (3), by order:

                     (c)  determine alterations of the eligibility rules of the organisation so as to exclude from eligibility for membership of the organisation persons belonging to the section or class; or

                     (d)  where persons belonging to the section or class are eligible for membership under an agreement of the kind referred to in section 151—declare that the persons are excluded from eligibility for membership in spite of anything in the agreement.

             (5)  If the Court cancels the registration of an organisation, the Court may direct that an application by the former organisation to be registered as an organisation is not to be dealt with under this Act before the end of a specified period.

             (6)  An alteration of rules determined by order under subsection (4) takes effect on the date of the order or on such other day as is specified in the order.

             (7)  A finding of fact in proceedings:

                     (a)  under section 23 or subsection 131(2) of this Act; or

                     (b)  under Division 4 of Part 3‑3 or Part 4‑1 of the Fair Work Act; or

                     (c)  under the Fair Work Act in relation to a contravention of Part 3‑1 of that Act;

is admissible as prima facie evidence of that fact in an application made on a ground specified in paragraph (1)(d).

##### <a id="29"></a>29  Orders where cancellation of registration deferred

             (1)  If the Federal Court finds that a ground of an application under subsection 28(1) or (1A) has been established, the Court may, if it considers it just to do so, instead of cancelling the registration of the organisation concerned under subsection 28(3) or making an order under subsection 28(4), exercise one or more of the powers set out in subsection (2) of this section.

             (2)  The powers that may be exercised by the Court, by order, under subsection (1) are as follows:

                     (a)  the power to suspend, to the extent specified in the order, any of the rights, privileges or capacities of the organisation or of all or any of its members, as such members, under this Act, the Fair Work Act or any other Act, under modern awards or orders made under this Act, the Fair Work Act or any other Act or under enterprise agreements;

                     (b)  the power to give directions as to the exercise of any rights, privileges or capacities that have been suspended;

                     (c)  the power to make provision restricting the use of the funds or property of the organisation or a branch of the organisation, and for the control of the funds or property for the purpose of ensuring observance of the restrictions.

             (3)  If the Court exercises a power set out in subsection (2), it must defer the determination of the question whether to cancel the registration of the organisation concerned until:

                     (a)  the orders made in the exercise of the power cease to be in force; or

                     (b)  on application by a party to the proceeding, the Court considers that it is just to determine the question, having regard to any evidence given relating to the observance or non‑observance of any order and to any other relevant circumstance;

whichever is earlier.

             (4)  An order made in the exercise of a power set out in subsection (2) has effect in spite of anything in the rules of the organisation concerned or a branch of the organisation.

             (5)  An order made in the exercise of a power set out in subsection (2):

                     (a)  may be revoked by the Court, by order, on application by a party to the proceeding concerned; and

                     (b)  unless sooner revoked, ceases to be in force:

                              (i)  6 months after it came into force; or

                             (ii)  such longer period after it came into force as is ordered by the Court on application by a party to the proceeding made while the order remains in force.

##### <a id="30"></a>30  Cancellation of registration on technical grounds etc.

             (1)  The FWC may cancel the registration of an organisation:

                     (a)  on application by the organisation made under the regulations; or

                     (b)  on application by an organisation or person interested or by the Minister, if the FWC has satisfied itself, as prescribed, that the organisation:

                              (i)  was registered by mistake; or

                             (ii)  is no longer effectively representative of the members who are employers or employees, as the case requires; or

                            (iii)  is not free from control by, or improper influence from, a person or body referred to in paragraph 19(1)(b) or 20(1)(b), as the case requires; or

                            (iv)  subject to subsection (6), if the organisation is an enterprise association—the enterprise to which it relates has ceased to exist; or

                     (c)  on the FWC’s own motion, if:

                              (i)  the FWC has satisfied itself, as prescribed, that the organisation is defunct; or

                             (v)  the organisation is not, or is no longer, a federally registrable association.

             (2)  Before the FWC cancels the registration of an organisation under:

                     (b)  paragraph (1)(c);

the FWC must give the organisation an opportunity to be heard.

             (3)  The FWC may also cancel the registration of an organisation if:

                     (a)  the FWC is satisfied that the organisation has breached an undertaking referred to in subsection 19(2); and

                     (b)  the FWC does not consider it appropriate to amend the eligibility rules of the organisation under section 157.

             (4)  A cancellation under subsection (3) may be made:

                     (a)  on application by an organisation or person interested; or

                     (b)  on application by the Minister; or

                     (c)  on FWC’s own motion.

             (5)  For the purposes of subparagraph (1)(b)(iv), the enterprise to which an organisation relates has ceased to exist if:

                     (a)  in the case of an organisation that relates only to an operationally distinct part or parts of the business that constitutes the enterprise—that part or those parts have ceased to exist, or the whole of the business has ceased to exist; or

                     (b)  in the case of an organisation that relates to the whole of the business that constitutes the enterprise—the whole of the business has ceased to exist.

             (6)  Subparagraph (1)(b)(iv) does not apply if:

                     (a)  some or all of the business of the enterprise in question is now conducted by another enterprise; and

                     (b)  all the alterations that are necessary to enable the organisation to operate as an enterprise association in relation to the other enterprise have been made; and

                     (c)  the FWC is satisfied that the organisation still meets the requirements of subsection 20(1).

The FWC must give the organisation a reasonable opportunity to alter its rules as provided in paragraph (b) before the FWC considers cancelling the registration of the organisation on the ground referred to in subparagraph (1)(b)(iv).

##### <a id="31"></a>31  Cancellation to be recorded

                   The cancellation of the registration of an organisation under this Act has the following consequences:

                     (a)  the organisation ceases to be an organisation and a body corporate under this Act, but does not because of the cancellation cease to be an association;

                     (b)  the cancellation does not relieve the association or any of its members from any penalty or liability incurred by the organisation or its members before the cancellation;

                     (c)  from the cancellation, the association and its members are not entitled to the benefits of any modern award, order of the FWC or enterprise agreement that bound the organisation or its members;

                     (d)  the FWC may, on application by an organisation or person interested, make such order as the FWC considers appropriate about the other effects (if any) of such an award, order or agreement on the association and its members;

                     (e)  21 days after the cancellation, such an award, order or agreement ceases, subject to any order made under paragraph (d), in all other respects to have effect in relation to the association and its members;

                      (f)  the Federal Court may, on application by a person interested, make such order as it considers appropriate in relation to the satisfaction of the debts and obligations of the organisation out of the property of the organisation;

                     (g)  the property of the organisation is, subject to any order made under paragraph (f), the property of the association and must be held and applied for the purposes of the association under the rules of the organisation so far as they can still be carried out or observed.

# Chapter 3—Amalgamation and withdrawal from amalgamation

## Part 1—Simplified outline of Chapter

##### <a id="34"></a>34  Simplified outline

* * *

The procedure for the amalgamation of 2 or more organisations is set out in Part 2 of this Chapter.

The 2 main elements of the amalgamation procedure are an application to the FWC seeking approval for a ballot to be held on the question of amalgamation, and the holding of a ballot conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission.

Part 2 also sets out the consequences of an amalgamation (for example, in relation to assets and liabilities of the organisations forming the new amalgamated organisation). It also enables the validation of certain acts done for the purposes of an amalgamation.

The procedure that enables part of an amalgamated organisation to withdraw from it is set out in Part 3 of this Chapter.

The main elements of the procedure to withdraw are an application to the Federal Court for approval to hold a ballot on the question, and the holding of the ballot.

Part 3 also sets out the consequences of a withdrawal from amalgamation (for example, in relation to assets and liabilities of the amalgamated organisation and the constituent part). It also enables the validation of certain acts done for the purposes of a withdrawal from amalgamation.

                     (d)  deal with, and give effect to, the certificate as if the certificate were a proper and appropriate instrument for transactions in relation to assets of that kind.

##### <a id="123"></a>123  Holding office after withdrawal

                     (b)  held that office immediately before withdrawal day;

holds the equivalent office in the newly registered organisation as if he or she were elected under the rules of the newly registered organisation.

             (2)  However, the rules may not permit a person to hold office after the later of:

                     (a)  the day that would have been the person’s last day of term in the constituent office if the withdrawal had not occurred; and

                     (d)  knowledge of facts from which an invalidity arises is not of itself treated as knowledge that the invalidity exists.

                     (a)  the amalgamated organisation; or

##### <a id="133"></a>133  Orders about representation rights of organisations of employees

             (1)  Subject to this Part, Part 4 and subsection 151(6), the FWC may, on the application of an organisation, an employer or the Minister, make the following orders in relation to a demarcation dispute:

                     (a)  an order that an organisation of employees is to have the right, to the exclusion of another organisation or other organisations, to represent under this Act or the Fair Work Act the industrial interests of a particular class or group of employees who are eligible for membership of the organisation;

                     (b)  an order that an organisation of employees that does not have the right to represent under this Act or the Fair Work Act the industrial interests of a particular class or group of employees is to have that right;

                     (c)  an order that an organisation of employees is not to have the right to represent under this Act or the Fair Work Act the industrial interests of a particular class or group of employees who are eligible for membership of the organisation.

Note:          Section 151 deals with agreements between organisations of employees and State unions.

             (2)  The FWC may, on application by an organisation, an employer or the Minister, vary an order made under subsection (1).

                              (i)  is preventing, obstructing or restricting the performance of work; or

                             (ii)  is harming the business of an employer; or

                            as a result of such conduct or threatened conduct.

##### <a id="135"></a>135  Factors to be taken into account by the FWC

                   In considering whether to make an order under section 133, the FWC must have regard to the wishes of the employees who are affected by the dispute and, where the FWC considers it appropriate, is also to have regard to:

                     (a)  the effect of any order on the operations (including operating costs, work practices, efficiency and productivity) of an employer who is a party to the dispute or who is a member of an organisation that is a party to the dispute; and

                     (b)  any agreement or understanding of which the FWC becomes aware that deals with the right of an organisation of employees to represent under this Act or the Fair Work Act the industrial interests of a particular class or group of employees; and

                     (c)  the consequences of not making an order for any employer, employees or organisation involved in the dispute; and

                     (d)  any other order made by the FWC, in relation to another demarcation dispute involving the organisation to which the order under this section would relate, that the FWC considers to be relevant.

##### <a id="136"></a>136  Order may be subject to limits

             (2)  The Federal Court may, on application by the Minister or a person or organisation affected by an order made under section 133, make such orders as it thinks fit to ensure compliance with that order.

## Part 3—Representation orders for workplace groups

##### <a id="137A"></a>137A  Orders about representation rights of organisations of employees

             (1)  Subject to this Part, Part 4 and subsection 151(6), the FWC may, on the application of an organisation, an employer or the Minister, make the following orders in relation to a dispute (including a threatened, impending or probable dispute) about the entitlement of an organisation of employees to represent, under this Act or the Fair Work Act, the industrial interests of employees:

                     (a)  an order that an organisation of employees is to have the right, to the exclusion of another organisation or other organisations, to represent under this Act or the Fair Work Act the industrial interests of the employees in a particular workplace group who are eligible for membership of the organisation;

                     (b)  an order that an organisation of employees is not to have the right to represent under this Act or the Fair Work Act the industrial interests of the employees in a particular workplace group.

Interim orders

             (2)  The FWC may make an interim order in relation to an application under subsection (1) on application by a person or organisation who would have been eligible to make the application under subsection (1).

             (3)  The FWC must not make an order under subsection (2) if the FWC considers that the making of the order would be unfair to a person or organisation other than the applicant.

Variation of orders

             (5)  The FWC may, on application by an organisation, an employer or the Minister, vary an order made under subsection (1) or (2).

             (6)  The FWC may, on its own initiative, vary an order made under subsection (1) or (2) if the order is inconsistent with an order that is in force under subsection 133(1).

Inconsistency with orders under subsection 133(1)

             (7)  The FWC must not make an order under subsection (1) or (2) if the order would be inconsistent with an order that is in force under subsection 133(1).

##### <a id="137B"></a>137B  Factors to be taken into account by the FWC

             (1)  In considering whether to make an order under subsection 137A(1) in relation to a particular workplace group, the FWC must have regard to:

                     (a)  the history of award coverage and agreement making in relation to the employees in the workplace group; and

                     (b)  the wishes of the members of the workplace group; and

                     (c)  the extent to which particular organisations of employees represent the employees in the workplace group, and the nature of that representation; and

                     (d)  any agreement or understanding of which the FWC becomes aware that deals with the right of an organisation of employees to represent under this Act or the Fair Work Act the industrial interests of a particular class or group of employees; and

                     (e)  the consequences of not making the order for any employer, employees or organisation concerned; and

                      (f)  any matter prescribed by the regulations.

             (2)  However, if:

                     (a)  the workplace group relates to a genuine new enterprise (within the meaning of the Fair Work Act) that one or more employers are establishing or propose to establish; and

                     (b)  the employer or employees have not employed any of the persons who will be necessary for the normal conduct of that enterprise;

the FWC must, as far as practicable, have regard to the matters set out in subsection (1) as they would apply in relation to the persons who would be the employees in the workplace group.

Note:          The expression genuine new enterprise includes a genuine new business, activity, project or undertaking (see the definition of **_enterprise_** in section 12 of the Fair Work Act).

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  the eligibility rules of an organisation of employees have been altered with the consent of the General Manager under section 158A; and

                     (b)  because of the alteration, members of an association of employees registered under a State or Territory industrial law have become eligible for membership of the organisation;

a reference in this section to the organisation includes a reference to the association referred to in paragraph (b) of this subsection.

##### <a id="137C"></a>137C  Submissions by peak councils

             (1)  A peak council is entitled to make a submission for consideration in relation to the proposed making of an order under subsection 137A(1).

## Part 4—Miscellaneous

##### <a id="137F"></a>137F  FWC may make orders reflecting State representation orders

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  the eligibility rules of an organisation of employees have been altered with the consent of the General Manager under section 158A; and

                     (b)  because of the alteration, members of an association of employees that is registered under a State or Territory industrial law (a **_State registered association_**) have become eligible for membership of the organisation; and

                     (c)  immediately before the alteration took effect, an order (a **_State representation order_**) was in force that:

                              (i)  was made by a State industrial authority in relation to the State registered association; and

                             (ii)  was an order of the same kind as, or of a similar kind to, an order that the FWC could make under this Chapter in relation to an organisation;

the FWC may, on application by the organisation or by a party to the State representation order, make an order in relation to the organisation that is to the same effect, or substantially the same effect, as the State representation order.

             (2)  The order under subsection (1) applies to each organisation that is:

                     (a)  a federal counterpart of the State registered association; or

                     (b)  a federal counterpart of any other association of employees:

                              (i)  that is registered under a State or Territory industrial law; and

                             (ii)  to which the State representation order applied.

##### <a id="138"></a>138  Exercise of the FWC’s powers under this Chapter

                   The powers of the FWC under this Chapter are exercisable only by a Full Bench.

##### <a id="138A"></a>138A  Representation rights of former State‑registered associations

             (1)  Regulations made for the purposes of this subsection may modify the way in which this Chapter applies in relation to an organisation that, before becoming recognised under this Act, was a State‑registered association or a transitionally recognised association.

             (2)  Without limiting subsection (1), the regulations may specify the weight that the FWC is to give, in making an order in relation to the rights of such an organisation to represent the interests under this Act or the Fair Work Act of a particular class or group of employees, to a State demarcation order.

             (2)  The rules of an organisation of employees may include provision for the eligibility for membership of the organisation of independent contractors who, if they were employees performing work of the kind which they usually perform as independent contractors, would be employees eligible for membership of the organisation.

             (3)  The rules of an organisation may also provide for any other matter.

             (4)  In this section:

                    <a name="offic"></a><a name="committe"></a>**_committee_**, in relation to an organisation or branch of an organisation, means a collective body of the organisation or branch that has powers of the kind mentioned in paragraph (1)(b) of the definition of **_office_** in section 9.

             (2)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(d), rules of an organisation are taken not to discriminate on the basis of age if the rules do not prevent the organisation setting its membership dues by reference to rates of pay even where those rates are set by reference to a person’s age.

### Division 2—Rules relating to elections for office

##### <a id="143"></a>143  Rules to provide for elections for offices

             (1)  The rules of an organisation:

                     (a)  must provide for the election of the holder of each office in the organisation by:

                              (i)  a direct voting system; or

                             (ii)  a collegiate electoral system that, in the case of a full‑time office, is a one‑tier collegiate electoral system; and

                     (b)  must provide for the conduct of every such election (including the acceptance or rejection of nominations) by a returning officer who is not the holder of any office in, or an employee of, the organisation or a branch, section or division of the organisation; and

                     (c)  must provide that, if the returning officer conducting an election finds a nomination to be defective, the returning officer must, before rejecting the nomination, notify the person concerned of the defect and, where practicable, give the person the opportunity of remedying the defect within such period as is applicable under the rules, which must, where practicable, be not less than 7 days after the person is notified; and

                     (d)  must make provision for:

                              (i)  the manner in which persons may become candidates for election; and

                             (ii)  the duties of returning officers; and

                            (iii)  the declaration of the result of an election; and

                     (e)  must provide that, where a ballot is required, it must be a secret ballot, and must make provision for:

                              (i)  in relation to a direct voting system ballot (including a direct voting system ballot that is a stage of an election under a collegiate electoral system)—the day on which the roll of voters for the ballot is to be closed; and

                             (ii)  absent voting; and

                            (iii)  the conduct of the ballot; and

                            (iv)  the appointment, conduct and duties of scrutineers to represent the candidates at the ballot; and

                      (f)  must be such as to ensure, as far as practicable, that no irregularities can occur in relation to an election.

             (2)  Without limiting section 142, the rules of an organisation relating to elections may provide for compulsory voting.

             (3)  The day provided for in the rules of an organisation as the day on which the roll of voters is to be closed (see paragraph (1)(e)) must be a day no earlier than 30 days, and no later than 7 days, before the day on which nominations for the election open.

             (4)  A reference in this section to the rules of an organisation includes a reference to the rules of a branch of the organisation.

             (5)  The reference in paragraph (1)(c) to a nomination being defective does not include a reference to a nomination of a person that is defective because the person is not qualified to hold the office to which the nomination relates.

             (6)  The rules providing for the day on which the roll of voters for a ballot is to be closed are not to be taken to prevent the correction of errors in the roll after that day.

##### <a id="144"></a>144  Rules to provide for elections for office by secret postal ballot

             (1)  Where the rules of an organisation provide for election for an office to be by a direct voting system, the rules must also provide that, where a ballot is required for such an election, it must be a secret postal ballot.

             (2)  An organisation may lodge with the FWC an application for an exemption from subsection (1), accompanied by particulars of proposed alterations of the rules of the organisation, to provide for the conduct of elections of the kind referred to in subsection (1) by a secret ballot other than a postal ballot.

             (3)  If the General Manager is satisfied, on application by an organisation under subsection (2):

                     (a)  that the proposed alterations of the rules:

                              (i)  comply with and are not contrary to this Act (other than subsection (1)), the Fair Work Act, modern awards or enterprise agreements; and

                             (ii)  are not otherwise contrary to law; and

                            (iii)  have been decided on under the rules of the organisation; and

                     (b)  that the conduct of a ballot under the rules of the organisation as proposed to be altered:

                              (i)  is likely to result in a fuller participation by members of the organisation in the ballot than would result from a postal ballot; and

                             (ii)  will afford to members entitled to vote an adequate opportunity of voting without intimidation;

the General Manager may grant to the organisation an exemption from subsection (1).

             (4)  Proposed alterations of the rules of an organisation referred to in subsection (2) take effect if and when the General Manager grants to the organisation an exemption from subsection (1).

             (5)  An exemption under subsection (3) remains in force until revoked under subsection (6).

             (6)  The General Manager may revoke an exemption granted to an organisation under subsection (3):

                     (a)  on application by the organisation, if the General Manager is satisfied that the rules of the organisation comply with subsection (1); or

                     (b)  if the General Manager is no longer satisfied:

                              (i)  that the rules of the organisation provide for the conduct of elections of the kind referred to in subsection (1) by a secret ballot other than a postal ballot; or

                             (ii)  of a matter referred to in paragraph (3)(b);

                            and the General Manager has given the organisation an opportunity, as prescribed, to show cause why the exemption should not be revoked.

             (7)  Where the General Manager revokes an exemption granted to an organisation on the ground specified in paragraph (6)(b), the General Manager may, by instrument, after giving the organisation an opportunity, as prescribed, to be heard, determine such alterations (if any) of the rules of the organisation as are, in the General Manager’s opinion, necessary to bring them into conformity with subsection (1).

             (8)  An alteration of the rules of an organisation determined under subsection (7) takes effect on the date of the instrument.

             (9)  Subsection 604(1) of the Fair Work Act does not apply in relation to a decision of the General Manager to grant an exemption under subsection (3).

Note:          Subsection 604(1) of the Fair Work Act provides for appeals from certain decisions of the General Manager.

           (10)  This section applies in relation to elections for offices in branches of organisations as if references to an organisation were references to a branch of an organisation.

##### <a id="145"></a>145  Rules to provide for terms of office

             (1)  The rules of an organisation must, subject to subsection (2), provide terms of office for officers in the organisation of no longer than 4 years without re‑election.

             (2)  The rules of an organisation, or a branch of an organisation, may provide that a particular term of office is extended for a specified period, where the extension is for the purpose of synchronising elections for offices in the organisation or branch, as the case may be.

             (3)  The term of an office must not be extended under subsection (2) so that the term exceeds 5 years.

             (4)  A reference in this section (other than subsection (2)) to the **_rules of an organisation_** includes a reference to the rules of a branch of the organisation.

             (2)  Rules made under subsection (1) must not permit a casual vacancy, or a further casual vacancy, occurring within the term of an office to be filled, otherwise than by an ordinary election, for so much of the unexpired part of the term as exceeds:

                     (a)  12 months; or

                     (b)  three‑quarters of the term of the office;

whichever is the greater.

             (3)  Where, under rules made under subsection (1), a vacancy in an office in an organisation is filled otherwise than by an ordinary election, the person filling the vacancy must be taken, for the purposes of the relevant provisions, to have been elected to the office under the relevant provisions.

##### <a id="147"></a>147  Model rules for conduct of elections

             (1)  The Minister may, by notice published in the _Gazette_, issue guidelines containing one or more sets of model rules for the conduct of elections for office. An organisation may adopt model rules in whole or in part, and with or without modification.

             (1)  The rules of an organisation must provide that a loan, grant or donation of an amount exceeding $1,000 must not be made by the organisation unless the committee of management:

                             (ii)  in the case of a loan—that, in the circumstances, the security proposed to be given for the repayment of the loan is adequate and the proposed arrangements for the repayment of the loan are satisfactory; and

                     (b)  has approved the making of the loan, grant or donation.

             (2)  In spite of subsection (1), the rules of an organisation may provide for a person authorised by the rules to make a loan, grant or donation of an amount not exceeding $3,000 to a member of the organisation if the loan, grant or donation:

                     (a)  is for the purpose of relieving the member or any of the member’s dependants from severe financial hardship; and

                     (b)  is subject to a condition to the effect that, if the committee of management, at the next meeting of the committee, does not approve the loan, grant or donation, it must be repaid as determined by the committee.

             (5)  In this section, a reference to an **_organisation_** includes a reference to a branch of an organisation.

           (10)  The General Manager must as soon as practicable:

##### <a id="152"></a>152  Assets and liabilities agreements

                     (b)  does not adversely affect the interests of any lessor, lessee or creditor of the organisation or State union.

                     (b)  resolving any difficulty in the operation or interpretation of the agreement;

and the Court may make such orders as it thinks fit.

##### <a id="154"></a>154  Termination of section 152 agreement

             (1)  If an organisation and a State union agree, in writing, to terminate an agreement made under section 152 (a **_section 152 agreement_**), the termination has no effect unless the parties apply to the Federal Court for approval under this section and the Court gives its approval.

             (2)  The Court must not approve the termination unless:

                     (a)  the parties have made an agreement (a **_termination agreement_**) that makes appropriate provision for the management and control of the assets and liabilities of the organisation and State union after termination of the section 152 agreement; or

                     (b)  the Court makes orders that will, in the Court’s opinion, make appropriate provision for the management and control of the assets and liabilities of the organisation and State union after termination of the section 152 agreement.

             (3)  In determining whether a termination agreement, or orders, make appropriate provision as required by subsection (2), the Court must have regard to the following factors:

##### <a id="156"></a>156  General Manager may determine alterations of rules

             (1)  Where the rules of an organisation do not, in the General Manager’s opinion, make provision required by this Act, the General Manager may, by instrument, after giving the organisation an opportunity, as prescribed, to be heard on the matter, determine such alterations of the rules as are, in the General Manager’s opinion, necessary to bring them into conformity with this Act.

             (2)  Alterations determined under subsection (1) take effect on the date of the instrument.

##### <a id="157"></a>157  FWC may determine alteration of rules where there has been a breach of an undertaking

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  in the course of an organisation being registered under section 19, an undertaking was given under subsection 19(2) to avoid demarcation disputes that might otherwise arise from an overlap between its eligibility rules and the eligibility rules of another organisation; and

                     (b)  the first‑mentioned organisation has breached the undertaking;

the FWC may, by instrument, determine such alterations of the rules of the organisation as are, in the FWC’s opinion, necessary to remove the overlap.

             (2)  The FWC must give the organisation and the other organisation an opportunity, as prescribed, to be heard on the matter.

             (3)  Alterations determined under subsection (1) take effect on the date of the instrument.

##### <a id="158"></a>158  Change of name or alteration of eligibility rules of organisation

             (1)  A change in the name of an organisation, or an alteration of the eligibility rules of an organisation, does not take effect unless:

                     (b)  in the case of an alteration of the eligibility rules of the organisation:

                              (i)  the FWC consents to the alteration under this section; or

                             (ii)  the General Manager consents to the alteration under section 158A.

             (2)  The FWC may consent to a change or alteration in whole or part, but must not consent unless the FWC is satisfied that the change or alteration has been made under the rules of the organisation.

             (3)  The FWC must not consent to a change in the name of an organisation unless the FWC is satisfied that the proposed new name of the organisation:

                     (a)  is not the same as the name of another organisation; and

                     (b)  is not so similar to the name of another organisation as to be likely to cause confusion.

             (4)  The FWC must not consent to an alteration of the eligibility rules of an organisation if, in relation to persons who would be eligible for membership because of the alteration, there is, in the opinion of the FWC, another organisation:

                     (a)  to which those persons could more conveniently belong; and

                     (b)  that would more effectively represent those members.

             (5)  However, subsection (4) does not apply if the FWC accepts an undertaking from the organisation seeking the alteration that the FWC considers appropriate to avoid demarcation disputes that might otherwise arise from an overlap between the eligibility rules of that organisation and the eligibility rules of the other organisation.

             (6)  The FWC may refuse to consent to an alteration of the eligibility rules of an organisation if satisfied that the alteration would contravene an agreement or understanding to which the organisation is a party and that deals with the organisation’s right to represent under this Act and the Fair Work Act the industrial interests of a particular class or group of persons.

             (7)  The FWC may also refuse to consent to an alteration of the eligibility rules of an organisation if it:

                     (a)  is satisfied that the alteration would change the effect of any order made by the FWC under section 133 about the right of the organisation to represent under this Act and the Fair Work Act  the industrial interests of a particular class or group of employees; and

                     (b)  considers that such a change would give rise to a serious risk of a demarcation dispute which would prevent, obstruct or restrict the performance of work in an industry, or harm the business of an employer.

                     (a)  if a day is specified in the consent—that day; or

             (3)  An alteration of rules that has been certified under subsection (1) takes effect on the day of certification.

             (4)  This section does not apply in relation to an alteration of the rules of an organisation that is:

##### <a id="166"></a>166  Entitlement to become and to remain a member

Employee organisations

             (1)  Subject to any modern award or order of the FWC, a person who is eligible to become a member of an organisation of employees under the eligibility rules of the organisation that relate to the occupations in which, or the industry or enterprise in relation to which, members are to be employed is, unless of general bad character, entitled, subject to payment of any amount properly payable in relation to membership:

                     (a)  to be admitted as a member of the organisation; and

                     (b)  to remain a member so long as the person complies with the rules of the organisation.

Note 1:       Rules of an organisation must provide for the circumstances in which a person ceases to be a member of an organisation (see subparagraph 141(1)(b)(vii)).

Note 2:       If a member fails to pay his or her membership dues for 24 months, this may result in the person ceasing to be a member, regardless of the rules of the organisation (see section 172).

Note 3:       See also section 168, which deals with a special case of entitlement to membership (person treated as having been a member).

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not entitle a person to remain a member of an organisation if the person ceases to be eligible to become a member and the rules of the organisation do not permit the person to remain a member.

             (3)  A person who is qualified to be employed in a particular occupation, and seeks to be employed in the occupation:

                     (a)  is taken to be an employee for the purposes of this section; and

                     (b)  in spite of anything in the rules of the organisation, is not to be treated as not being eligible for membership of an organisation merely because the person has never been employed in the occupation.

Employer organisations

             (4)  Subject to subsection (5) and to any modern award or order of the FWC, an employer who is eligible to become a member of an organisation of employers is entitled, subject to payment of any amount properly payable in relation to membership:

                     (a)  to be admitted as a member of the organisation; and

                     (b)  to remain a member so long as the employer complies with the rules of the organisation.

             (5)  Subsection (4) does not entitle an employer:

                     (a)  to become a member of an organisation if the employer is:

                              (i)  a natural person who is of general bad character; or

                             (ii)  a body corporate whose constituent documents make provisions inconsistent with the purposes for which the organisation was formed; or

             (4)  The orders that the Court may make under subsection (3) include an order requiring the organisation concerned to treat a person to whom subsection (1) applies as being a member of the organisation and as having been a member during the times referred to in subsection (1).

                   The Federal Court may, on the application of an organisation, order that a person’s membership of that organisation or another organisation is to cease from a day, and for a period, specified in the order.

##### <a id="171A"></a>171A  Cessation of membership if member is not an employee etc.

             (1)  If a person is a member of an organisation and the person is not, or is no longer:

                     (a)  if the organisation is an association of employers—a person of a kind mentioned in paragraph 18A(3)(a), (b), (c) or (d); or

                     (b)  if the organisation is an association of employees—a person of a kind mentioned in paragraph 18B(3)(a), (b), (c) or (d); or

the person’s membership of the organisation immediately ceases.

             (2)  Subsection (1) has effect despite anything in the rules of the organisation.

             (3)  A person whose name is removed from the register under this section ceases to be a member of the organisation on the day his or her name is removed. This subsection has effect in spite of anything in the rules of the organisation.

Note:          A non‑financial member’s membership might cease and his or her name be removed from the register earlier than is provided for by this section if the organisation’s own rules provide for this to happen.

##### <a id="173"></a>173  No entrance fee if person re‑joins within 6 months

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a person applies for membership of an organisation within 6 months after the person’s membership has ceased under section 172; and

                     (b)  the application is accepted by the organisation;

the organisation must not require the person to pay any fee associated with a new membership (other than membership dues) in relation to the membership for which the person has applied.

             (2)  This section is not to be taken to prevent an organisation requiring (whether by means of its rules or otherwise) payment of outstanding dues in order for a person to maintain continuity of financial membership.

##### <a id="174"></a>174  Resignation from membership

             (1)  A member of an organisation may resign from membership by written notice addressed and delivered to a person designated for the purpose in the rules of the organisation or a branch of the organisation.

             (2)  A notice of resignation from membership of an organisation takes effect:

                     (a)  where the member ceases to be eligible to become a member of the organisation:

                              (i)  on the day on which the notice is received by the organisation; or

                             (ii)  on the day specified in the notice, which is a day not earlier than the day when the member ceases to be eligible to become a member;

                            whichever is later; or

                     (b)  in any other case:

                              (i)  at the end of 2 weeks, or such shorter period as is specified in the rules of the organisation, after the notice is received by the organisation; or

                             (ii)  on the day specified in the notice;

                            whichever is later.

             (3)  Any dues payable but not paid by a former member of an organisation, in relation to a period before the member’s resignation from the organisation took effect, may be sued for and recovered in the name of the organisation, in a court of competent jurisdiction, as a debt due to the organisation.

             (4)  A notice delivered to the person mentioned in subsection (1) is taken to have been received by the organisation when it was delivered.

             (5)  A notice of resignation that has been received by the organisation is not invalid because it was not addressed and delivered in accordance with subsection (1).

             (6)  A resignation from membership of an organisation is valid even if it is not effected in accordance with this section if the member is informed in writing by or on behalf of the organisation that the resignation has been accepted.

Note:          Regulations may require employers who offer payroll deduction facilities to inform employees that cessation of payroll deduction by an employee does not constitute resignation (see section 359).

## Part 4—False information, disputes and arrears of dues

##### <a id="175"></a>175  False representation as to membership of organisation

                   A person must not, in an application made under this Act or the Fair Work Act, make a statement about the person’s membership of an organisation if the person knows, or is reckless as to whether, the statement is false or misleading.

Note:          This section is a civil penalty provision (see section 305).

##### <a id="176"></a>176  False representation about resignation from organisation

                   A person (the **_first person_**) must not provide information about resignation from an organisation to a member, or a person eligible to become a member, of the organisation if the person knows, or is reckless as to whether, the information is false or misleading.

Note:          This section is a civil penalty provision (see section 305).

##### <a id="177"></a>177  Disputes between organisations and members

             (1)  A dispute between an organisation and any of its members is to be decided under the rules of the organisation.

             (2)  Any fine, fee, levy or dues payable to an organisation by a member in relation to a period after the organisation was registered may be sued for and recovered, in the name of the organisation, as a debt due to the organisation, in a court of competent jurisdiction.

             (3)  A court of competent jurisdiction may, on application brought in the name of an organisation, order the payment by a member of any contribution (not exceeding $20) to a penalty incurred or money payable by the organisation under a modern award, order or enterprise agreement.

##### <a id="178"></a>178  Recovery of arrears

             (1)  In spite of subsection 177(2), legal proceedings for the recovery of an amount payable by a person in relation to the person’s membership of an organisation must not be commenced after the end of the period of 12 months starting on the day on which the amount became payable.

             (2)  The amount ceases to be payable at the end of the period if legal proceedings to recover the amount have not been commenced by then.

##### <a id="179"></a>179  Liability for arrears

             (1)  Where a person has ceased to be eligible to become a member of an organisation and that person has not actively participated in the affairs of the organisation since that time, those circumstances are a defence to an action by the organisation for arrears of dues payable from the time when the person ceased to be so eligible.

             (2)  Where such a defence is successful, that person is taken to have ceased to be a member from the time that the person ceased to be so eligible.

## Part 5—Conscientious objection to membership

##### <a id="180"></a>180  Conscientious objection to membership of organisations

             (1)  Where a natural person:

                              (i)  in the case of a person who is an employer or is otherwise eligible to join an organisation of employers—that the person’s conscientious beliefs do not allow the person to be a member of an association of the kind described in paragraph 18(a); or

                             (ii)  in the case of a person who is an employee or is otherwise eligible to join an organisation of employees—that the person’s conscientious beliefs do not allow the person to be a member of an association of the kind described in paragraph 18(b) or (c); and

                     (b)  pays the prescribed fee to the General Manager;

the General Manager must issue to the person a certificate to that effect in the prescribed form.

             (2)  An appeal does not lie to the FWC under section 604 of the Fair Work Act against a decision of the General Manager to issue a certificate under subsection (1).

             (3)  Subject to subsection (4), a certificate under subsection (1) remains in force for the period (not exceeding 12 months) specified in the certificate, but may, as prescribed, be renewed from time to time by the General Manager for such period (not exceeding 12 months) as the General Manager considers appropriate.

             (4)  Where:

                     (a)  the General Manager becomes aware of a matter that was not known to the General Manager when a certificate was issued by the General Manager to a person under subsection (1); and

                     (b)  if the General Manager had been aware of the matter when the application for the certificate was being considered, the General Manager would not have issued the certificate;

the General Manager may, after giving the person an opportunity, as prescribed, to show cause why the certificate should not be revoked, revoke the certificate.

             (6)  In this section:

                    <a name="appropri-organis"></a>**_appropriate organisation_**, in relation to a person who has made an application under subsection (1), means the organisation that, in the opinion of the General Manager dealing with the application, would, but for the person’s conscientious beliefs, be the appropriate organisation for the person to join having regard to:

                     (a)  in the case of a person who is an employer—the industry in relation to which the person is an employer; or

                     (b)  in the case of a person who is otherwise eligible to join an organisation of employers—the business carried on by the person; or

                     (c)  in the case of a person who is an employee—the past employment (if any), and the future prospects of employment, of the person; or

                     (d)  in the case of a person who is otherwise eligible to join an organisation of employees—the work done by the person or the enterprise in which the person works.

                    <a name="conscienti-belief"></a>**_conscientious beliefs_** means any conscientious beliefs, whether the grounds for the beliefs are or are not of a religious character and whether the beliefs are or are not part of the doctrine of any religion.

                    <a name="prescrib-fee"></a>**_prescribed fee_**, in relation to a person who has made an application under subsection (1), means a fee equal to the annual subscription that would be payable by the person if the person were a member of the appropriate organisation.

                     (b)  the conduct alleged to constitute the offence is substantially the same as the conduct that was claimed to constitute the contravention.

However, this does not apply to a criminal proceeding in respect of the falsity of the evidence given by the individual in the proceedings for the pecuniary penalty order.

##### <a id="315"></a>315  Relief from liability for contravention of civil penalty provision

             (1)  In this section:

                    <a name="elig-proceing"></a>**_eligible proceedings_**:

                     (a)  means proceedings for a contravention of a civil penalty provision; and

                     (b)  does not include proceedings for an offence.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  eligible proceedings are brought against a person or organisation; and

                     (b)  in the proceedings it appears to the Federal Court that the person or organisation has, or may have, contravened a civil penalty provision but that:

                              (i)  the person or organisation has acted honestly; and

                             (ii)  having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the person or organisation ought fairly to be excused for the contravention;

the Court may relieve the person or organisation either wholly or partly from a liability to which the person or organisation would otherwise be subject, or that might otherwise be imposed on the person or organisation, because of the contravention.

             (3)  If a person or organisation thinks that eligible proceedings will or may be begun against them, they may apply to the Federal Court for relief.

             (4)  On an application under subsection (3), the Court may grant relief under subsection (2) as if the eligible proceedings had been begun in the Court.

##### <a id="316"></a>316  Power to grant relief

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  civil proceedings are brought against an officer of an organisation for negligence, default, breach of trust or breach of duty in a capacity as such an officer; and

                     (b)  in the proceedings it appears to the court before which the proceedings are taken that:

                              (i)  the officer is or may be liable in respect of the negligence, default or breach; and

                             (ii)  the officer has acted honestly; and

                            (iii)  having regard to all the circumstances of the case (including those connected with the officer’s appointment), the officer ought fairly to be excused for the negligence, default or breach;

the court may relieve the officer either wholly or partly from liability on the terms that the court thinks appropriate.

             (2)  An officer of an organisation who has reason to apprehend that a claim will or might be made against him or her for negligence, default, breach of trust or breach of duty in a capacity as such an officer may apply to the Federal Court for relief. On the application, the Court has the same power to relieve the officer as it would have had under subsection (1) if it had been a court before which proceedings against the officer for negligence, default, breach of trust or breach of duty had been brought.

             (2)  The branch fund is to consist of:

                     (a)  real or personal property of which the branch of the organisation, by the rules or by any established practice not inconsistent with the rules, has, or in the absence of a limited term lease, bailment or arrangement, would have, the right of custody, control or management; and

                     (a)  whether there is, in relation to the organisation, an associated body registered under a prescribed State Act; and

             (3)  In the case of an alteration to a rule that may effect a change in the class of persons eligible for membership of a branch of the organisation that is registered under the law of a State, the FWC must, before consenting, give notice of the proposed change to the industrial registrar or similar officer appointed under the law of the State in which the branch operates and, if so requested, consult with the industrial registrar or officer.

##### <a id="364"></a>364  Branch autonomy

             (2)  For the purpose of participating, a branch of an organisation may become registered under a law of a State so long as that registration does not involve the branch in becoming incorporated, or otherwise becoming a legal entity, under the law of the State.

             (3)  Where an organisation participates, its rules may provide that the secretary of the branch of the organisation in the State is the person to sue or to be sued under the law of the State in relation to any acts or omissions arising from its participation.

                     (b)  a member of the associated body; or

                     (c)  a registered association in the State in which the associated body functions;

because there is another organisation to which the members of the associated body, whose eligibility for membership would depend on the alteration, could more conveniently belong.

             (7)  Objection may be made to the amalgamation by a member of the organisation or of the associated body on the ground that:

                     (a)  the provisions of this section have not been complied with; or

                     (b)  determine to whom and in what manner notice of the day and place of the hearing shall be given.

             (9)  If the FWC:

                     (a)  finds that no duly made objection is justified; and

                     (b)  is satisfied that the provisions of this section have been complied with; and

                     (c)  is satisfied that the amalgamation would not do substantial injustice to the members of the organisation or of the associated body; and

                     (d)  is satisfied that any proposed alterations of the rules of the organisation:

                              (i)  comply with and are not contrary to this Act and applicable modern awards; and

                             (ii)  are not otherwise contrary to law; and

                            (iii)  have been decided on under the rules of the organisation;

the FWC must, subject to subsection (10), approve the amalgamation and fix the day on which the amalgamation is to take effect, but otherwise the FWC must refuse to approve the amalgamation.

           (10)  The FWC must not approve an amalgamation unless the FWC is satisfied as to arrangements made relating to property and liabilities of the associated body.

           (11)  On the day on which the amalgamation takes effect, any alteration of the rules of the organisation takes effect.

           (12)  On the day on which the amalgamation takes effect, all members of the associated body who are not already members of the organisation but are or become, on that day, eligible for membership of the organisation:

                     (a)  become members of the organisation; and

                     (b)  are to be taken to have been members for the period ending on that day during which they were members of the associated body.

          (1A)  The recognition under this Schedule of a transitionally recognised association that has been granted transitional recognition in relation to an application under subclause 2(1A) ends:

                     (a)  when it is cancelled under clause 5; or

                     (b)  when the association becomes an organisation; or

                     (c)  in any other case—at the end of the latest of the following days:

                              (i)  the day (the **_default day_**) that is the later of the fifth anniversary of the day the _Fair Work Amendment (Transfer of Business) Act 2012_ commenced and a day prescribed by the regulations;

                             (ii)  if the FWC grants the association an extension under subclause (2)—the anniversary of the default day;

                            (iii)  if the FWC grants the association a further extension under subclause (3)—the second anniversary of the default day.

             (2)  The FWC may, on application by a transitionally recognised association, grant the association an extension for the purposes of subparagraph (1)(c)(ii) or (1A)(c)(ii) if the FWC is satisfied that the association has made progress towards:

                     (a)  becoming an organisation; or

                     (b)  rationalising its internal affairs with those of its federal counterpart.

             (3)  The FWC may, on application by a transitionally recognised association, grant the association a further extension for the purposes of subparagraph (1)(c)(iii) or (1A)(c)(iii) if the FWC is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the association has made further progress towards:

                              (i)  becoming an organisation; or

                             (ii)  rationalising its internal affairs with those of its federal counterpart; and

                     (b)  there are extenuating circumstances justifying the further extension.

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Modification of this Act

                   Regulations made for the purposes of this clause may modify how section 19 of this Act applies in relation to an association that is a transitionally recognised association.

# Schedule 2—Recognised State‑registered associations

_Note:       See section 5C._

##### <a id="1"></a>1  Recognition of State‑registered associations

             (1)  A State‑registered association may apply to the General Manager for recognition under this Schedule if:

                     (a)  the association has no federal counterpart; and

                     (b)  the law of a State under which the association is registered is a law to which subclause (2) applies.

             (2)  This subclause applies to a law of a State if the regulations so provide.

             (3)  The application must be accompanied by:

                     (a)  a copy of the current rules of the association; and

                     (b)  a statement setting out:

                              (i)  the address of the association; and

                             (ii)  each office in the association; and

                            (iii)  the name and address of each person holding office in the association.

             (4)  If the General Manager is satisfied that the association satisfies subclause (1), the General Manager must, by written instrument, grant the application and record the fact that he or she is so satisfied.

             (5)  An instrument under subclause (4) is not a legislative instrument.

             (6)  The General Manager must give a copy of the instrument to the association.

             (7)  A State‑registered association is taken to be recognised under this Schedule when the General Manager grants the application.

##### <a id="2"></a>2  Application of Fair Work Act to recognised State‑registered associations

             (1)  The provisions of the _Fair Work Act 2009_ and Part 3 of Chapter 4 of this Act apply in relation to a recognised State‑registered association:

                     (a)  in the same way as they apply in relation to an organisation; and

                     (b)  as if a recognised State‑registered association were a person.

             (2)  To avoid doubt, this section does not confer on a recognised State‑registered association:

                     (a)  a legal identity that it would not otherwise have; or

                     (b)  a right to represent its members’ industrial interests outside the State in relation to which it is a State‑registered association.

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Cancellation of recognition

Cancellation by the Federal Court

             (1)  A person interested or the Minister may apply to the Federal Court for an order cancelling the recognition under this Schedule of a recognised State‑registered association on the ground that:

                     (a)  the conduct of:

                              (i)  the association (in relation to its continued breach of an order of the FWC or an industrial instrument, or its continued failure to ensure that its members comply with and observe an order of the FWC or an industrial instrument, or in any other respect); or

                             (ii)  a substantial number of the members of the association (in relation to their continued breach of an order of the FWC or an industrial instrument, or in any other respect);

                            has, on or after the commencement of this Schedule, prevented or hindered the achievement of an object of this Act as in force at that time; or

                     (b)  the association, or a substantial number of the members of the association or of a section or class of members of the association, has engaged in industrial action (other than protected industrial action) that has, on or after the commencement of this Schedule, prevented, hindered or interfered with:

                              (i)  the activities of a federal system employer; or

                             (ii)  the provision of any public service by the Commonwealth or a State or Territory or an authority of the Commonwealth or a State or Territory; or

                     (c)  the association, or a substantial number of the members of the association or of a section or class of members of the association, has or have been, or is or are, engaged, on or after the commencement of this Schedule, in industrial action (other than protected industrial action) that has had, is having or is likely to have a substantial adverse effect on the safety, health or welfare of the community or a part of the community; or

                     (d)  the association, or a substantial number of the members of the association or of a section or class of members of the association, has or have failed to comply with one of the following, made on or after the commencement of this Schedule:

                              (i)  an injunction granted under subsection 421(3) of the Fair Work Act (which deals with orders to stop industrial action);

                             (ii)  an order made under the Fair Work Act in relation to a contravention of Part 3‑1 of that Act (which deals with general protections);

                            (iii)  an interim injunction granted under section 545 of the Fair Work Act so far as it relates to conduct or proposed conduct that could be the subject of an injunction under a provision mentioned in subparagraph (i) or (ii);

                            (iv)  an order under section 23 of this Act (which deals with contraventions of the employee associations provisions).

             (2)  The Court must give the association an opportunity to be heard.

             (3)  If the Court:

                     (a)  finds that a ground for cancellation set out in the application has been established; and

                     (b)  does not consider that it would be unjust to do so having regard to the degree of gravity of the matters constituting the ground and the action (if any) that has been taken by or against the association in relation to the matters;

the Court must cancel the recognition of the association under this Schedule.

             (4)  A finding of fact in:

                     (a)  proceedings commenced on or after the commencement of this Schedule:

                              (i)  under section 421 of the Fair Work Act; or

                             (ii)  under the Fair Work Act in relation to a contravention of Part 3‑1 of that Act; or

                     (b)  proceedings under section 23 of this Act;

is admissible as prima facie evidence of that fact in an application made on a ground specified in paragraph (1)(d).

Cancellation by the FWC

             (5)  The FWC may cancel the recognition under this Schedule of a recognised State‑registered association:

                     (a)  on application by the association made under the regulations; or

                     (b)  on application by a person interested or by the Minister, if the FWC has satisfied itself, as prescribed:

                              (i)  that the association was recognised by mistake; or

                             (ii)  that the association is no longer a State‑registered association; or

                            (iii)  that the association has been found by another industrial body (within the meaning of the Fair Work Act) to have contravened a State or Territory industrial law, and that the contravention constitutes serious misconduct.

Cancellation by General Manager

             (6)  The General Manager may, by written instrument, cancel the recognition under this Schedule of a recognised State‑registered association if he or she is satisfied that the association no longer exists.

             (7)  An instrument under subclause (6) is not a legislative instrument.

Cancellation if subclause 1(2) no longer applies

             (8)  The recognition under this Schedule of a recognised State‑registered association is taken to be cancelled if the law of a State under which the association is registered ceases to be a law to which subclause 1(2) applies.

## Schedule 4

## 11  Transitional—applications under section 118A of the Workplace Relations Act in respect of which the substantive hearing has not begun

(1)       This item applies to an application made under section 118A of the Workplace Relations Act but in respect of which the Commission had not begun the substantive hearing before the commencement of this item.

(2)       After the commencement of this item, the application has effect as if it were an application made under section 118A of the Workplace Relations Act as amended by this Schedule.

## 12  Transitional—applications under section 118A of the Workplace Relations Act in respect of which the substantive hearing has begun

(1)       This item applies to an application made under section 118A of the Workplace Relations Act and in respect of which the Commission had begun the substantive hearing before the commencement of this item.

(2)       Despite the amendments made to section 118A of the Workplace Relations Act by this Schedule, that section as in force immediately before the commencement of this item continues to apply in relation to the hearing of the application.

(3)       An order made as a result of the hearing of the application has effect as if it had been made under section 118A of the Workplace Relations Act as amended by this Schedule.

## Schedule 5  

## 46  Interpretation

In this Part:

                    <a name="interim-period"></a>**_interim period_** means the period of 18 months beginning on the day on which section 89A of the Principal Act commences.

                    <a name="princip-act"></a>**_Principal Act_** means the Workplace Relations Act.

                    <a name="special-consent-provision"></a>**_special consent provisions_** has the meaning given by item 48.

                    <a name="termin-time"></a>**_termination time_**, in relation to special consent provisions, means the end of the period that is specified in the award under section 147 of the Principal Act.

## 47  Exercise of Commission’s powers under this Part

In exercising its powers under this Part, the Commission is to have regard to the desirability of assisting parties to awards to agree on appropriate variations to their awards, rather than have parts of awards cease to have effect under item 50 at the end of the interim period.

## 48  Special consent provisions

For the purposes of this Part, **_special consent provisions_** are provisions of an award that give effect to a decision of the Commission that is expressed to be made in accordance with one or more of the following principles:

                     (a)  the Enterprise Bargaining Principle adopted by the Commission in the National Wage Case decision of October 1991 (Dec 1150/91, Print K0300);

                     (b)  the Enterprise Awards Principle adopted by the Commission in its Review of the Wage Fixing Principles decision of October 1993 (Dec 1300/93, Print K9700);

                     (c)  Principle 2.2 (Consent Award or Award Variation to Give Effect to an Enterprise Agreement), adopted by the Commission in its Review of the Wage Fixing Principles decision of August 1994 (Dec 1408/94, Print L4700) and incorporated without amendment in wages principles established by the Commission in its Safety Net Adjustment &amp; Section 150A Review decision of October 1995 (Dec 2120/95, Print M5600).

## 49  Variation of awards during the interim period

(1)       If one or more of the parties to an award apply to the Commission for a variation of the award under this item, the Commission may, during the interim period, vary the award so that it only deals with allowable award matters.

(2)       For the purposes of this item, an exceptional matters order is taken to relate wholly to allowable award matters.

(3)       Special consent provisions cannot be varied under this item before the termination time for those provisions.

(4)       The Commission may only deal with the application by arbitration if it is satisfied that the applicant or applicants have made reasonable attempts to reach agreement with the other parties to the award about how the award should be varied and the treatment of matters that are not allowable award matters.

(5)       If:

                     (a)  the award provides for rates of pay that, in the opinion of the Commission:

                              (i)  are not operating as minimum rates; or

                             (ii)  were made on the basis that they were not intended to operate as minimum rates; and

                     (b)  the application under this item seeks to have such rates of pay varied so that they are expressed as minimum rates of pay;

the Commission may vary the award so that it provides for minimum rates of pay consistent with sections 88A and 88B of the Principal Act and the limitation on the Commission’s power in subsection 89A(3) of that Act.

(6)       If the Commission varies the award under subitem (5), it must include in the award provisions that ensure that overall entitlements to pay provided by the award are not reduced by that variation, unless the Commission considers that it would be in the public interest not to include such provisions.

(7)       The Commission must, if it considers it appropriate, review the award to determine whether or not it meets the following criteria:

                     (a)  it does not include matters of detail or process that are more appropriately dealt with by agreement at the workplace or enterprise level;

                     (b)  it does not prescribe work practices or procedures that restrict or hinder the efficient performance of work;

                     (c)  it does not contain provisions that have the effect of restricting or hindering productivity, having regard to fairness to employees.

(8)       The Commission must also review the award to determine whether or not it meets the following criteria:

                     (a)  where appropriate, it contains facilitative provisions that allow agreement at the workplace or enterprise level, between employers and employees (including individual employees), on how the award provisions are to apply;

                     (b)  where appropriate, it contains provisions enabling the employment of regular part‑time employees;

                     (c)  it is expressed in plain English and is easy to understand in both structure and content;

                     (d)  it does not contain provisions that are obsolete or that need updating;

                     (e)  where appropriate, it provides support to training arrangements through appropriate trainee wages and a supported wage system for people with disabilities;

                      (f)  it does not contain provisions that discriminate against an employee because of, or for reasons including, race, colour, sex, sexual preference, age, physical or mental disability, marital status, family responsibilities, pregnancy, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin.

(9)       If the Commission determines that the award does not meet the criteria set out in subitem (7) or (8), the Commission may take whatever steps it considers appropriate to facilitate the variation of the award so that it does meet those criteria.

## 50  Parts of awards cease to have effect at the end of the interim period

(1)       At the end of the interim period, each award ceases to have effect to the extent that it provides for matters other than allowable award matters.

(2)       For the purposes of this item, an exceptional matters order is taken to relate wholly to allowable award matters.

(3)       For the purposes of this item, an award that is made under subsection 170MX(3) of the Principal Act, or varied under item 49 of this Schedule, is taken to provide wholly for allowable award matters.

(4)       If the termination time for special consent provisions is after the end of the interim period, then this item and item 51 apply to the special consent provisions as if a reference to the end of the interim period were instead a reference to the termination time.

## 51  Variation of awards after the end of the interim period

(1)       As soon as practicable after the end of the interim period, the Commission must review each award:

                     (a)  that is in force; and

                     (b)  that the Commission is satisfied has been affected by item 50.

(2)       The Commission must vary the award to remove provisions that ceased to have effect under item 50.

(3)       When varying the award under subitem (2), the Commission may also vary the award so that, in relation to an allowable award matter, the award is expressed in a way that reasonably represents the entitlements of employees in respect of that matter as provided in the award as in force immediately before the end of the interim period.

(4)       If, immediately before the end of the interim period, the award provided for rates of pay that, in the opinion of the Commission:

                     (a)  were not operating as minimum rates of pay; or

                     (b)  were made on the basis that they were not intended to operate as minimum rates;

the Commission may vary the award so that it provides for minimum rates of pay consistent with sections 88A and 88B of the Principal Act and the limitation on the Commission’s power in subsection 89A(3) of that Act.

(5)       If the Commission varies the award under subitem (4), it must include in the award provisions that ensure that overall entitlements to pay provided by the award are not reduced by that variation, unless the Commission considers that it would be in the public interest not to include such provisions.

(6)       The Commission must, if it considers it appropriate, review the award to determine whether or not it meets the following criteria:

                     (a)  it does not include matters of detail or process that are more appropriately dealt with by agreement at the workplace or enterprise level;

                     (b)  it does not prescribe work practices or procedures that restrict or hinder the efficient performance of work;

                     (c)  it does not contain provisions that have the effect of restricting or hindering productivity, having regard to fairness to employees.

(7)       The Commission must also review the award to determine whether or not it meets the following criteria:

                     (a)  where appropriate, it contains facilitative provisions that allow agreement at the workplace or enterprise level, between employers and employees (including individual employees), on how the award provisions are to apply;

                     (b)  where appropriate, it contains provisions enabling the employment of regular part‑time employees;

                     (c)  it is expressed in plain English and is easy to understand in both structure and content;

                     (a)  has a rule that complies with section 148C; but

                     (b)  considers that special circumstances exist in relation to the organisation that mean that the rule is too onerous;

the organisation may lodge with FWA an application for an exemption from section 148C.

             (2)  The application must be accompanied by:

                     (a)  a statement of the special circumstances that exist in relation to the organisation; and

                     (b)  particulars of proposed alterations of the rules of the organisation to provide for disclosures, in relation to payments made by the organisation, that are appropriate for the organisation’s special circumstances and provide appropriate transparency; and

                     (c)  that the proposed alterations of the rules:

                              (i)  comply with and are not contrary to this Act (other than section 148C); and

                             (ii)  are not otherwise contrary to law; and

the General Manager may grant to the organisation an exemption from section 148C.

             (4)  Proposed alterations of the rules of an organisation referred to in subsection (2) take effect if and when the General Manager grants to the organisation an exemption from section 148C.

             (5)  If the General Manager grants to the organisation an exemption from section 148C, the rule of the organisation that takes effect in accordance with subsection (4) is, for the purposes of this Act other than this section, taken to be a rule made under section 148C.

             (6)  An exemption under subsection (3) remains in force until the earlier of:

                     (a)  the day the exemption is revoked under subsection (7); and

and the General Manager has given the organisation an opportunity, as prescribed, to show cause why the exemption should not be revoked.

             (8)  If the General Manager revokes an exemption granted to an organisation on the ground specified in paragraph (7)(b), the General Manager may, by instrument, after giving the organisation an opportunity, as prescribed, to be heard, determine such alterations (if any) of the rules of the organisation as are, in the General Manager’s opinion, necessary to bring them into conformity with section 148C.

             (9)  An alteration of the rules of an organisation determined under subsection (8) takes effect on the date of the instrument.

           (10)  Subsection 604(1) of the Fair Work Act does not apply in relation to a decision of the General Manager under subsection (3).

Note:          Subsection 604(1) of the Fair Work Act provides for appeals from certain decisions of the General Manager.

           (11)  This section applies in relation to a branch of an organisation as if references to an organisation were references to a branch of an organisation.
