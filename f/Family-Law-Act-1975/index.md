                     (a)  a divorce order in relation to a marriage; or

                     (b)  a decree of nullity of marriage;

          (1B)  An application for a divorce order in relation to a marriage shall not, without the leave of the court granted under subsection (1C), be filed within the period of 2 years after the date of the marriage unless there is filed with the application a certificate:

                     (a)  stating that the parties to the marriage have considered a reconciliation with the assistance of a specified person, who is:

                              (i)  a family counsellor; or

                             (ii)  if the court is the Family Court, the Federal Magistrates Court or the Family Court of a State—an individual or an organisation nominated for the parties by a family consultant; or

                            (iii)  if the court is not the Family Court, the Federal Magistrates Court or the Family Court of a State—an individual or an organisation nominated for the parties by an appropriately qualified officer of the court; and

                     (b)  signed by that person or on behalf of that organisation, as the case may be.

          (1C)  Notwithstanding subsection (1B), if the court is satisfied that there are special circumstances by reason of which the hearing of an application for a divorce order in relation to a marriage should proceed notwithstanding that the parties have not considered a reconciliation with assistance of the kind referred to in subsection (1B), the court may:

                     (a)  if the application has not been filed—give leave for the application to be filed; or

                     (b)  if the application has been filed—at any time before or during the hearing of the application, declare that it is so satisfied;

and, where the court makes a declaration under paragraph (b), the application shall be deemed to have been duly filed and everything done pursuant to that application shall be as valid and effectual as if the court had, before the application was filed, given leave under paragraph (a) for the application to be filed.

             (2)  Notwithstanding subsections (3) and (3A), a respondent may, in an answer to an application, include an application for any decree or declaration under this Act.

                     (a)  a divorce order has taken effect; or

                     (b)  a decree of nullity of marriage has been made;

proceedings of a kind referred to in paragraph (c), (caa), (ca) or (cb) of the definition of **_matrimonial cause_** in subsection 4(1) (not being proceedings under section 78 or 79A or proceedings seeking the discharge, suspension, revival or variation of an order previously made in proceedings with respect to the maintenance of a party) shall not be instituted, except by leave of the court in which the proceedings are to be instituted or with the consent of both of the parties to the marriage, after the expiration of 12 months after:

                     (c)  in a case referred to in paragraph (a)—the date on which the divorce order took effect; or

                     (d)  in a case referred to in paragraph (b)—the date of the making of the decree.

The court may grant such leave at any time, even if the proceedings have already been instituted.

       (3AA)  However, if such proceedings are instituted with the consent of both of the parties to the marriage, the court may dismiss the proceedings if it is satisfied that, because the consent was obtained by fraud, duress or unconscionable conduct, allowing the proceedings to continue would amount to a miscarriage of justice.

          (3A)  Notwithstanding subsection (3), where, whether before or after the commencement of section 21 of the _Family Law Amendment Act 1983_:

                     (a)  a divorce order has taken effect or a decree of nullity of marriage has been made; and

                     (b)  the approval under section 87 of a maintenance agreement between the parties to the marriage has been revoked;

                     (c)  within the period of 12 months after:

                              (i)  the date on which the divorce order took effect or the date of the making of the decree of nullity, as the case may be; or

                             (ii)  the date on which the approval of the maintenance agreement was revoked;

                            whichever is the later; or

          (1C)  If the court subsequently gives leave to a party to object to the proceedings being so heard and determined, the court must transfer the proceedings to:

                     (a)  the Family Court; or

                     (b)  the Supreme Court of a State or Territory; or

             (5)  Without prejudice to the duty of a court of summary jurisdiction to comply with this section, failure by such a court so to comply does not invalidate any order of the court in the proceedings.

##### <a id="50"></a>50  Effect of resumption of cohabitation

             (1)  For the purposes of proceedings for a divorce order, where, after the parties to the marriage separated, they resumed cohabitation on one occasion but, within a period of 3 months after the resumption of cohabitation, they again separated and thereafter lived separately and apart up to the date of the filing of the application, the periods of living separately and apart before and after the period of cohabitation may be aggregated as if they were one continuous period, but the period of cohabitation shall not be deemed to be part of the period of living separately and apart.

             (2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), a period of cohabitation shall be deemed to have continued during any interruption of the cohabitation that, in the opinion of the court, was not substantial.

             (3)  For the purposes of this section, a child (including an ex‑nuptial child of either the husband or the wife, a child adopted by either of them or a child who is not a child of either of them) is a child of the marriage if the child was treated by the husband and wife as a child of their family at the relevant time.

#### Subdivision BA—Best interests of the child

##### <a id="60CA"></a>60CA  Child’s best interests paramount consideration in making a parenting order

                   In deciding whether to make a particular parenting order in relation to a child, a court must regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration.

##### <a id="60CB"></a>60CB  Proceedings to which Subdivision applies

             (1)  This Subdivision applies to any proceedings under this Part in which the best interests of a child are the paramount consideration.

Note:          Division 10 also allows a court to make an order for a child’s interests to be independently represented by a lawyer in proceedings under this Part in which the best interests of a child are the paramount consideration.

             (2)  This Subdivision also applies to proceedings, in relation to a child, to which subsection 60G(2), 63F(2) or 63F(6) or section 68R applies.

##### <a id="60CC"></a>60CC  How a court determines what is in a child’s best interests

Determining child’s best interests

             (1)  Subject to subsection (5), in determining what is in the child’s best interests, the court must consider the matters set out in subsections (2) and (3).

Primary considerations

             (2)  The primary considerations are:

                     (a)  the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents; and

                     (b)  the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.

Note:          Making these considerations the primary ones is consistent with the objects of this Part set out in paragraphs 60B(1)(a) and (b).

Additional considerations

             (3)  Additional considerations are:

                     (a)  any views expressed by the child and any factors (such as the child’s maturity or level of understanding) that the court thinks are relevant to the weight it should give to the child’s views;

                     (b)  the nature of the relationship of the child with:

                              (i)  each of the child’s parents; and

                             (ii)  other persons (including any grandparent or other relative of the child);

                     (c)  the willingness and ability of each of the child’s parents to facilitate, and encourage, a close and continuing relationship between the child and the other parent;

                     (d)  the likely effect of any changes in the child’s circumstances, including the likely effect on the child of any separation from:

                              (i)  either of his or her parents; or

                             (ii)  any other child, or other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child), with whom he or she has been living;

                     (e)  the practical difficulty and expense of a child spending time with and communicating with a parent and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect the child’s right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis;

                      (f)  the capacity of:

                              (i)  each of the child’s parents; and

                             (ii)  any other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child);

                            to provide for the needs of the child, including emotional and intellectual needs;

                     (g)  the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of the child and of either of the child’s parents, and any other characteristics of the child that the court thinks are relevant;

                     (h)  if the child is an Aboriginal child or a Torres Strait Islander child:

                              (i)  the child’s right to enjoy his or her Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander culture (including the right to enjoy that culture with other people who share that culture); and

                             (ii)  the likely impact any proposed parenting order under this Part will have on that right;

                      (i)  the attitude to the child, and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of the child’s parents;

                      (j)  any family violence involving the child or a member of the child’s family;

                     (k)  any family violence order that applies to the child or a member of the child’s family, if:

                              (i)  the order is a final order; or

                             (ii)  the making of the order was contested by a person;

                      (l)  whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to the child;

                    (m)  any other fact or circumstance that the court thinks is relevant.

             (4)  Without limiting paragraphs (3)(c) and (i), the court must consider the extent to which each of the child’s parents has fulfilled, or failed to fulfil, his or her responsibilities as a parent and, in particular, the extent to which each of the child’s parents:

                     (a)  has taken, or failed to take, the opportunity:

                              (i)  to participate in making decisions about major long‑term issues in relation to the child; and

                             (ii)  to spend time with the child; and

                            (iii)  to communicate with the child; and

                     (b)  has facilitated, or failed to facilitate, the other parent:

                              (i)  participating in making decisions about major long‑term issues in relation to the child; and

                             (ii)  spending time with the child; and

                            (iii)  communicating with the child; and

                     (c)  has fulfilled, or failed to fulfil, the parent’s obligation to maintain the child.

          (4A)  If the child’s parents have separated, the court must, in applying subsection (4), have regard, in particular, to events that have happened, and circumstances that have existed, since the separation occurred.

Consent orders

             (5)  If the court is considering whether to make an order with the consent of all the parties to the proceedings, the court may, but is not required to, have regard to all or any of the matters set out in subsection (2) or (3).

Right to enjoy Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander culture

             (6)  For the purposes of paragraph (3)(h), an Aboriginal child’s or a Torres Strait Islander child’s right to enjoy his or her Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander culture includes the right:

                     (a)  to maintain a connection with that culture; and

                     (b)  to have the support, opportunity and encouragement necessary:

                              (i)  to explore the full extent of that culture, consistent with the child’s age and developmental level and the child’s views; and

                             (ii)  to develop a positive appreciation of that culture.

##### <a id="60CD"></a>60CD  How the views of a child are expressed

             (1)  Paragraph 60CC(3)(a) requires the court to consider any views expressed by a child in deciding whether to make a particular parenting order in relation to the child. This section deals with how the court informs itself of views expressed by a child.

             (2)  The court may inform itself of views expressed by a child:

                     (a)  by having regard to anything contained in a report given to the court under subsection 62G(2); or

                     (b)  by making an order under section 68L for the child’s interests in the proceedings to be independently represented by a lawyer; or

                     (c)  subject to the applicable Rules of Court, by such other means as the court thinks appropriate.

Note 1:       Paragraph (a)—subsection 62G(3A) generally requires the person giving the report to ascertain the child’s views and include those views in the report.

Note 2:       Paragraph (b)—paragraph 68LA(5)(b) requires the independent children’s lawyer for the child to ensure that the child’s views are fully put before the court.

##### <a id="60CE"></a>60CE  Children not required to express views

                   Nothing in this Part permits the court or any person to require the child to express his or her views in relation to any matter.

##### <a id="60CF"></a>60CF  Informing court of relevant family violence orders

             (1)  If a party to the proceedings is aware that a family violence order applies to the child, or a member of the child’s family, that party must inform the court of the family violence order.

             (2)  If a person who is not a party to the proceedings is aware that a family violence order applies to the child, or a member of the child’s family, that person may inform the court of the family violence order.

             (3)  Failure to inform the court of the family violence order does not affect the validity of any order made by the court.

##### <a id="60CG"></a>60CG  Court to consider risk of family violence

             (1)  In considering what order to make, the court must, to the extent that it is possible to do so consistently with the child’s best interests being the paramount consideration, ensure that the order:

                     (a)  is consistent with any family violence order; and

                     (b)  does not expose a person to an unacceptable risk of family violence.

             (2)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), the court may include in the order any safeguards that it considers necessary for the safety of those affected by the order.

#### Subdivision C—Interpretation and application of Part

##### <a id="60E"></a>60E  Application of Part to void marriages

                   This Part applies in relation to a purported marriage that is void as if:

                     (a)  the purported marriage were a marriage; and

                     (b)  the parties to the purported marriage were husband and wife.

#### Subdivision D—Interpretation—how this Act applies to certain children

##### <a id="60EA"></a>60EA  Definition of _de facto partner_

                   For the purposes of this Subdivision, a person is the **_de facto partner_** of another person if:

                     (a)  a relationship between the person and the other person (whether of the same sex or a different sex) is registered under a law of a State or Territory prescribed for the purposes of section 2E of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ as a kind of relationship prescribed for the purposes of that section; or

                     (b)  the person is in a de facto relationship with the other person.

##### <a id="60F"></a>60F  Certain children are children of marriage etc.

             (1)  A reference in this Act to a child of a marriage includes, subject to subsection (3), a reference to each of the following children:

                     (a)  a child adopted since the marriage by the husband and wife or by either of them with the consent of the other;

                     (b)  a child of the husband and wife born before the marriage;

                     (c)  a child who is, under subsection 60H(1) or section 60HB, the child of the husband and wife.

             (2)  A reference in this Act to a child of a marriage includes a reference to a child of:

                     (a)  a marriage that has been terminated by divorce or annulled (in Australia or elsewhere); or

                     (b)  a marriage that has been terminated by the death of one party to the marriage.

             (3)  A child of a marriage who is adopted by a person who, before the adoption, is not a prescribed adopting parent ceases to be a child of that marriage for the purposes of this Act.

             (4)  The following provisions apply in relation to a child of a marriage who is adopted by a prescribed adopting parent:

                     (a)  if a court granted leave under section 60G for the adoption proceedings to be commenced—the child ceases to be a child of the marriage for the purposes of this Act;

                     (b)  in any other case—the child continues to be a child of the marriage for the purposes of this Act.

          (4A)  To avoid doubt, for the purposes of this Act, a child of a marriage is a child of the husband and of the wife in the marriage.

             (5)  In this section:

                    <a name="act"></a>**_this Act_** includes:

                     (a)  the standard Rules of Court; and

                     (b)  the related Federal Magistrates Rules.

##### <a id="60G"></a>60G  Family Court may grant leave for adoption proceedings by prescribed adopting parent

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), the Family Court, the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory or the Family Court of a State may grant leave for proceedings to be commenced for the adoption of a child by a prescribed adopting parent.

             (2)  In proceedings for leave under subsection (1), the court must consider whether granting leave would be in the child’s best interests, having regard to the effect of paragraph 60F(4)(a), or paragraph 60HA(3)(a), and of sections 61E and 65J.

Note:          Sections 60CB to 60CG deal with how a court determines a child’s best interests.

##### <a id="60H"></a>60H  Children born as a result of artificial conception procedures

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a child is born to a woman as a result of the carrying out of an artificial conception procedure while the woman was married to, or a de facto partner of, another person (the **_other intended parent_**); and

                     (b)  either:

                              (i)  the woman and the other intended parent consented to the carrying out of the procedure, and any other person who provided genetic material used in the procedure consented to the use of the material in an artificial conception procedure; or

                             (ii)  under a prescribed law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory, the child is a child of the woman and of the other intended parent;

then, whether or not the child is biologically a child of the woman and of the other intended parent, for the purposes of this Act:

                     (c)  the child is the child of the woman and of the other intended parent; and

                     (d)  if a person other than the woman and the other intended parent provided genetic material—the child is not the child of that person.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  a child is born to a woman as a result of the carrying out of an artificial conception procedure; and

                     (b)  under a prescribed law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory, the child is a child of the woman;

then, whether or not the child is biologically a child of the woman, the child is her child for the purposes of this Act.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  a child is born to a woman as a result of the carrying out of an artificial conception procedure; and

                     (b)  under a prescribed law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory, the child is a child of a man;

then, whether or not the child is biologically a child of the man, the child is his child for the purposes of this Act.

             (5)  For the purposes of subsection (1), a person is to be presumed to have consented to an artificial conception procedure being carried out unless it is proved, on the balance of probabilities, that the person did not consent.

                     (b)  the child is adopted by the person and the person’s de facto partner or by either of them with the consent of the other; or

                     (c)  the child is, under subsection 60H(1) or section 60HB, a child of the person and the person’s de facto partner.

This subsection has effect subject to subsection (2).

             (2)  A child of current or former de facto partners ceases to be a child of those partners for the purposes of this Act if the child is adopted by a person who, before the adoption, is not a prescribed adopting parent.

             (3)  The following provisions apply in relation to a child of current or former de facto partners who is adopted by a prescribed adopting parent:

                     (a)  if a court granted leave under section 60G for the adoption proceedings to be commenced—the child ceases to be a child of those partners for the purposes of this Act;

                     (b)  in any other case—the child continues to be a child of those partners for the purposes of this Act.

#### Subdivision E—Family dispute resolution

##### <a id="60I"></a>60I  Attending family dispute resolution before applying for Part VII order

Object of this section

             (1)  The object of this section is to ensure that all persons who have a dispute about matters that may be dealt with by an order under this Part (a **_Part VII order_**) make a genuine effort to resolve that dispute by family dispute resolution before the Part VII order is applied for.

Phase 1 (from commencement to 30 June 2007)

             (2)  The dispute resolution provisions of the _Family Law Rules 2004_ impose the requirements for dispute resolution that must be complied with before an application is made to the Family Court of Australia for a parenting order.

             (3)  By force of this subsection, the dispute resolution provisions of the _Family Law Rules 2004_ also apply to an application to a court (other than the Family Court of Australia) for a parenting order. Those provisions apply to the application with such modifications as are necessary.

             (4)  Subsection (3) applies to an application for a parenting order if the application is made:

                     (a)  on or after the commencement of this section; and

                     (b)  before 1 July 2007.

Phase 2 (from 1 July 2007 to 30 June 2008)

             (5)  Subsections (7) to (12) apply to an application for a Part VII order in relation to a child if:

                     (a)  the application is made on or after 1 July 2007 and before 1 July 2008; and

                     (b)  none of the parties to the proceedings on the application has applied, before 1 July 2007, for a Part VII order in relation to the child.

Phase 3 (from 1 July 2008)

             (6)  Subsections (7) to (12) apply to all applications for a Part VII order in relation to a child that are made on or after 1 July 2008.

Requirement to attempt to resolve dispute by family dispute resolution before applying for a parenting order

             (7)  Subject to subsection (9), a court exercising jurisdiction under this Act must not hear an application for a Part VII order in relation to a child unless the applicant files in the court a certificate given to the applicant by a family dispute resolution practitioner under subsection (8). The certificate must be filed with the application for the Part VII order.

Certificate by family dispute resolution practitioner

             (8)  A family dispute resolution practitioner may give one of these kinds of certificates to a person:

                     (a)  a certificate to the effect that the person did not attend family dispute resolution with the practitioner and the other party or parties to the proceedings in relation to the issue or issues that the order would deal with, but the person’s failure to do so was due to the refusal, or the failure, of the other party or parties to the proceedings to attend;

                    (aa)  a certificate to the effect that the person did not attend family dispute resolution with the practitioner and the other party or parties to the proceedings in relation to the issue or issues that the order would deal with, because the practitioner considers, having regard to the matters prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph, that it would not be appropriate to conduct the proposed family dispute resolution;

                     (b)  a certificate to the effect that the person attended family dispute resolution with the practitioner and the other party or parties to the proceedings in relation to the issue or issues that the order would deal with, and that all attendees made a genuine effort to resolve the issue or issues;

                     (c)  a certificate to the effect that the person attended family dispute resolution with the practitioner and the other party or parties to the proceedings in relation to the issue or issues that the order would deal with, but that the person, the other party or another of the parties did not make a genuine effort to resolve the issue or issues;

                     (d)  a certificate to the effect that the person began attending family dispute resolution with the practitioner and the other party or parties to the proceedings in relation to the issue or issues that the order would deal with, but that the practitioner considers, having regard to the matters prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph, that it would not be appropriate to continue the family dispute resolution.

Note:          When an applicant files one of these certificates under subsection (7), the court may take the kind of certificate into account in considering whether to make an order referring to parties to family dispute resolution (see section 13C) and in determining whether to award costs against a party (see section 117).

Exception

             (9)  Subsection (7) does not apply to an application for a Part VII order in relation to a child if:

                     (a)  the applicant is applying for the order:

                              (i)  to be made with the consent of all the parties to the proceedings; or

                             (ii)  in response to an application that another party to the proceedings has made for a Part VII order; or

                     (b)  the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that:

                              (i)  there has been abuse of the child by one of the parties to the proceedings; or

                             (ii)  there would be a risk of abuse of the child if there were to be a delay in applying for the order; or

                            (iii)  there has been family violence by one of the parties to the proceedings; or

                            (iv)  there is a risk of family violence by one of the parties to the proceedings; or

                     (c)  all the following conditions are satisfied:

                              (i)  the application is made in relation to a particular issue;

                             (ii)  a Part VII order has been made in relation to that issue within the period of 12 months before the application is made;

                            (iii)  the application is made in relation to a contravention of the order by a person;

                            (iv)  the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person has behaved in a way that shows a serious disregard for his or her obligations under the order; or

                     (d)  the application is made in circumstances of urgency; or

                     (e)  one or more of the parties to the proceedings is unable to participate effectively in family dispute resolution (whether because of an incapacity of some kind, physical remoteness from dispute resolution services or for some other reason); or

                      (f)  other circumstances specified in the regulations are satisfied.

Referral to family dispute resolution when exception applies

           (10)  If:

                     (a)  a person applies for a Part VII order; and

                     (b)  the person does not, before applying for the order, attend family dispute resolution with a family dispute resolution practitioner and the other party or parties to the proceedings in relation to the issue or issues that the order would deal with; and

                     (c)  subsection (7) does not apply to the application because of subsection (9);

the court must consider making an order that the person attend family dispute resolution with a family dispute resolution practitioner and the other party or parties to the proceedings in relation to that issue or those issues.

           (11)  The validity of:

                     (a)  proceedings on an application for a Part VII order; or

                     (b)  any order made in those proceedings;

is not affected by a failure to comply with subsection (7) in relation to those proceedings.

           (12)  In this section:

                    <a name="disput-resolut-provision"></a>**_dispute resolution provisions_** of the _Family Law Rules 2004_ means:

                     (a)  Rule 1.05 of those Rules; and

                     (b)  Part 2 of Schedule 1 to those Rules;

to the extent to which they deal with dispute resolution.

##### <a id="60J"></a>60J  Family dispute resolution not attended because of child abuse or family violence

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  subsections 60I(7) to (12) apply to an application for a Part VII order (see subsections 60I(5) and (6)); and

                     (b)  subsection 60I(7) does not apply to the application because the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that:

                              (i)  there has been abuse of the child by one of the parties to the proceedings; or

                             (ii)  there has been family violence by one of the parties to the proceedings;

a court must not hear the application unless the applicant has indicated in writing that the applicant has received information from a family counsellor or family dispute resolution practitioner about the services and options (including alternatives to court action) available in circumstances of abuse or violence.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply if the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that:

                     (a)  there would be a risk of abuse of the child if there were to be a delay in applying for the order; or

                     (b)  there is a risk of family violence by one of the parties to the proceedings.

             (3)  The validity of:

                     (a)  proceedings on an application for a Part VII order; or

                     (b)  any order made in those proceedings;

is not affected by a failure to comply with subsection (1) in relation to those proceedings.

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  the applicant indicates in writing that the applicant has not received information about the services and options (including alternatives to court action) available in circumstances of abuse or violence; and

                     (b)  subsection (2) does not apply;

the principal executive officer of the court concerned must ensure that the applicant is referred to a family counsellor or family dispute resolution practitioner in order to obtain information about those matters.

##### <a id="60K"></a>60K    Court to take prompt action in relation to allegations of child abuse or family violence

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  an application is made to a court for a Part VII order in relation to a child; and

                     (b)  a document is filed in the court, on or after the commencement of this section, in relation to the proceedings for the order; and

                     (c)  the document alleges, as a consideration that is relevant to whether the court should grant or refuse the application, that:

                              (i)  there has been abuse of the child by one of the parties to the proceedings; or

                             (ii)  there would be a risk of abuse of the child if there were to be a delay in applying for the order; or

                            (iii)  there has been family violence by one of the parties to the proceedings; or

                            (iv)  there is a risk of family violence by one of the parties to the proceedings; and

                     (d)  the document is a document of the kind prescribed by the applicable Rules of Court for the purposes of this paragraph.

             (2)  The court must:

                     (a)  consider what interim or procedural orders (if any) should be made:

                              (i)  to enable appropriate evidence about the allegation to be obtained as expeditiously as possible; and

                             (ii)  to protect the child or any of the parties to the proceedings; and

                     (b)  make such orders of that kind as the court considers appropriate; and

                     (c)  deal with the issues raised by the allegation as expeditiously as possible.

          (2A)  The court must take the action required by paragraphs (2)(a) and (b):

                     (a)  as soon as practicable after the document is filed; and

                     (b)  if it is appropriate having regard to the circumstances of the case—within 8 weeks after the document is filed.

             (3)  Without limiting subparagraph (2)(a)(i), the court must consider whether orders should be made under section 69ZW to obtain reports from State and Territory agencies in relation to the allegations.

             (4)  Without limiting paragraph (2)(a)(ii), the court must consider whether orders should be made, or an injunction granted, under section 68B.

             (5)  A failure to comply with a provision of this section in relation to an application does not affect the validity of any order made in the proceedings in relation to the application.

### Division 2—Parental responsibility

##### <a id="61A"></a>61A  What this Division does

                   This Division deals with the concept of parental responsibility including, in particular:

                     (a)  what parental responsibility is; and

                     (b)  who has parental responsibility.

##### <a id="61B"></a>61B  Meaning of _parental responsibility_

                   In this Part, **_parental responsibility_**, in relation to a child, means all the duties, powers, responsibilities and authority which, by law, parents have in relation to children.

##### <a id="61C"></a>61C  Each parent has parental responsibility (subject to court orders)

             (1)  Each of the parents of a child who is not 18 has parental responsibility for the child.

Note 1:       This section states the legal position that prevails in relation to parental responsibility to the extent to which it is not displaced by a parenting order made by the court. See subsection (3) of this section and subsection 61D(2) for the effect of a parenting order.

Note 2:       This section does not establish a presumption to be applied by the court when making a parenting order. See section 61DA for the presumption that the court does apply when making a parenting order.

Note 3:       Under section 63C, the parents of a child may make a parenting plan that deals with the allocation of parental responsibility for the child.

             (2)  Subsection (1) has effect despite any changes in the nature of the relationships of the child’s parents. It is not affected, for example, by the parents becoming separated or by either or both of them marrying or re‑marrying.

             (3)  Subsection (1) has effect subject to any order of a court for the time being in force (whether or not made under this Act and whether made before or after the commencement of this section).

Note:          Section 111CS may affect the attribution of parental responsibility for a child.

##### <a id="61D"></a>61D  Parenting orders and parental responsibility

             (1)  A parenting order confers parental responsibility for a child on a person, but only to the extent to which the order confers on the person duties, powers, responsibilities or authority in relation to the child.

             (2)  A parenting order in relation to a child does not take away or diminish any aspect of the parental responsibility of any person for the child except to the extent (if any):

                     (a)  expressly provided for in the order; or

                     (b)  necessary to give effect to the order.

##### <a id="61DA"></a>61DA  Presumption of equal shared parental responsibility when making parenting orders

             (1)  When making a parenting order in relation to a child, the court must apply a presumption that it is in the best interests of the child for the child’s parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child.

Note:          The presumption provided for in this subsection is a presumption that relates solely to the allocation of parental responsibility for a child as defined in section 61B. It does not provide for a presumption about the amount of time the child spends with each of the parents (this issue is dealt with in section 65DAA).

             (2)  The presumption does not apply if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a parent of the child (or a person who lives with a parent of the child) has engaged in:

                     (a)  abuse of the child or another child who, at the time, was a member of the parent’s family (or that other person’s family); or

                     (b)  family violence.

             (3)  When the court is making an interim order, the presumption applies unless the court considers that it would not be appropriate in the circumstances for the presumption to be applied when making that order.

             (4)  The presumption may be rebutted by evidence that satisfies the court that it would not be in the best interests of the child for the child’s parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child.

##### <a id="61DB"></a>61DB  Application of presumption of equal shared parental responsibility after interim parenting order made

                   If there is an interim parenting order in relation to a child, the court must, in making a final parenting order in relation to the child, disregard the allocation of parental responsibility made in the interim order.

##### <a id="61E"></a>61E  Effect of adoption on parental responsibility

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a child is adopted; and

                     (b)  immediately before the adoption, a person had parental responsibility for the child, whether in full or to a limited extent and whether because of section 61C or because of a parenting order.

             (2)  The person’s parental responsibility for the child ends on the adoption of the child, unless the adoption is by a prescribed adopting parent and leave was not granted under section 60G for the adoption proceedings to be commenced.

##### <a id="61F"></a>61F  Application to Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander children

                   In:

                     (a)  applying this Part to the circumstances of an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander child; or

                     (b)  identifying a person or persons who have exercised, or who may exercise, parental responsibility for such a child;

the court must have regard to any kinship obligations, and child‑rearing practices, of the child’s Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander culture.

### Division 3—Reports relating to children under 18

##### <a id="62A"></a>62A  What this Division does

                   This Division deals with the preparation of reports for use in proceedings relating to children who are under 18.

##### <a id="62B"></a>62B  Court’s obligation to inform people to whom Part VII orders apply about family counselling, family dispute resolution and other family services

                   If a court makes an order in proceedings under this Part, the court must inform the parties to the proceedings about the family counselling services, family dispute resolution services and other courses, programs and services available to help the parties adjust to the consequences of that order.

Note:          Before informing the parties, the court must consider seeking the advice of a family consultant about the services appropriate to the parties’ needs (see section 11E).

##### <a id="62G"></a>62G  Reports by family consultants

             (1)  This section applies if, in proceedings under this Act, the care, welfare and development of a child who is under 18 is relevant.

             (2)  The court may direct a family consultant to give the court a report on such matters relevant to the proceedings as the court thinks desirable.

             (3)  If the court makes a direction under subsection (2), it may, if it thinks it necessary, adjourn the proceedings until the report has been given to the court.

          (3A)  A family consultant who is directed to give the court a report on a matter under subsection (2) must:

                     (a)  ascertain the views of the child in relation to that matter; and

                     (b)  include the views of the child on that matter in the report.

Note:          A person cannot require a child to express his or her views in relation to any matter (see section 60CE).

          (3B)  Subsection (3A) does not apply if complying with that subsection would be inappropriate because of:

                     (a)  the child’s age or maturity; or

                     (b)  some other special circumstance.

             (4)  The family consultant may include in the report, in addition to the matters required to be included in it, any other matters that relate to the care, welfare or development of the child.

             (5)  For the purposes of the preparation of the report, the court may make any other orders, or give any other directions, that the court considers appropriate (including orders or directions that one or more parties to the proceedings attend, or arrange for the child to attend, an appointment or a series of appointments with a family consultant).

Note:          Before making orders under this section, the court must consider seeking the advice of a family consultant about the services appropriate to the parties’ needs (see section 11E).

             (6)  If:

                     (a)  a person fails to comply with an order or direction under subsection (5); or

                     (b)  a child fails to attend an appointment with a family consultant as arranged in compliance with an order or direction under subsection (5);

the family consultant must report the failure to the court.

             (7)  On receiving a report under subsection (6), the court may give such further directions in relation to the preparation of the report as it considers appropriate.

             (8)  A report given to the court pursuant to a direction under subsection (2) may be received in evidence in any proceedings under this Act.

### Division 4—Parenting plans

##### <a id="63A"></a>63A  What this Division does

                   This Division explains what parenting plans are.

##### <a id="63B"></a>63B  Parents encouraged to reach agreement

                   The parents of a child are encouraged:

                     (a)  to agree about matters concerning the child; and

                     (b)  to take responsibility for their parenting arrangements and for resolving parental conflict; and

                     (c)  to use the legal system as a last resort rather than a first resort; and

                     (d)  to minimise the possibility of present and future conflict by using or reaching an agreement; and

                     (e)  in reaching their agreement, to regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration.

Note:          Parents are encouraged to reach an informal agreement between themselves about matters concerning their children by entering into a parenting plan. Parents who seek enforceable arrangements require court orders. These can be obtained by consent.

##### <a id="63C"></a>63C  Meaning of _parenting plan_ and related terms

             (1)  A **_parenting plan_** is an agreement that:

                     (a)  is in writing; and

                     (b)  is or was made between the parents of a child; and

                   (ba)  is signed by the parents of the child; and

                   (bb)  is dated; and

                     (c)  deals with a matter or matters mentioned in subsection (2).

          (1A)  An agreement is not a **_parenting plan_** for the purposes of this Act unless it is made free from any threat, duress or coercion.

             (2)  A parenting plan may deal with one or more of the following:

                     (a)  the person or persons with whom a child is to live;

                     (b)  the time a child is to spend with another person or other persons;

                     (c)  the allocation of parental responsibility for a child;

                     (d)  if 2 or more persons are to share parental responsibility for a child—the form of consultations those persons are to have with one another about decisions to be made in the exercise of that responsibility;

                     (e)  the communication a child is to have with another person or other persons;

                      (f)  maintenance of a child;

                     (g)  the process to be used for resolving disputes about the terms or operation of the plan;

                     (h)  the process to be used for changing the plan to take account of the changing needs or circumstances of the child or the parties to the plan;

                      (i)  any aspect of the care, welfare or development of the child or any other aspect of parental responsibility for a child.

Note:          Paragraph (f)—if the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989_ applies, provisions in a parenting plan dealing with the maintenance of a child (as distinct from child support under that Act) are unenforceable and of no effect unless the provisions in the plan are a child support agreement (see section 63CAA and subsection 63G(5) of this Act).

          (2A)  The person referred to in subsection (2) may be, or the persons referred to in that subsection may include, either a parent of the child or a person other than the parent of the child (including a grandparent or other relative of the child).

          (2B)  Without limiting paragraph (2)(c), the plan may deal with the allocation of responsibility for making decisions about major long‑term issues in relation to the child.

          (2C)  The communication referred to in paragraph (2)(e) includes (but is not limited to) communication by:

                     (a)  letter; and

                     (b)  telephone, email or any other electronic means.

             (3)  An agreement may be a parenting plan:

                     (a)  whether made before or after the commencement of this section; and

                     (b)  whether made inside or outside Australia; and

                     (c)  whether other persons as well as a child’s parents are also parties; and

                     (d)  whether it deals with other matters as well as matters mentioned in subsection (2).

Note:          One of the other matters with which a parenting plan may deal is child support (see section 63CAA).

             (4)  Provisions of a parenting plan that deal with matters other than the maintenance of a child are **_child welfare provisions_**.

             (5)  Provisions of a parenting plan that deal with the matter mentioned in paragraph (2)(f) are **_child maintenance provisions_**.

             (6)  A **_registered parenting plan_** is a parenting plan:

                     (a)  that was registered in a court under section 63E as in force at any time before the commencement of the _Family Law Amendment Act 2003_; and

                     (b)  that continued to be registered immediately before the commencement of the _Family Law Amendment Act 2003_.

##### <a id="63CAA"></a>63CAA  Parenting plans may include child support provisions

             (1)  If a parenting plan includes provisions of a kind referred to in subsection 84(1) of the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989_, the provisions do not have effect for the purposes of this Act.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not affect the operation of the provisions for any other purpose.

             (3)  Nothing in this Division is to be taken to prevent the same agreement being both a parenting plan under this Part and a child support agreement under Part 6 of the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989_.

##### <a id="63D"></a>63D  Parenting plan may be varied or revoked by further written agreement

                   A parenting plan, other than a plan to which section 63DB applies, may be varied or revoked by agreement in writing between the parties to the plan.

##### <a id="63DA"></a>63DA  Obligations of advisers

             (1)  If an adviser gives advice or assistance to people in relation to parental responsibility for a child following the breakdown of the relationship between those people, the adviser must:

                     (a)  inform them that they could consider entering into a parenting plan in relation to the child; and

                     (b)  inform them about where they can get further assistance to develop a parenting plan and the content of the plan.

             (2)  If an adviser gives advice to people in connection with the making by those people of a parenting plan in relation to a child, the adviser must:

                     (a)  inform them that, if the child spending equal time with each of them is:

                              (i)  reasonably practicable; and

                             (ii)  in the best interests of the child;

                            they could consider the option of an arrangement of that kind; and

                     (b)  inform them that, if the child spending equal time with each of them is not reasonably practicable or is not in the best interests of the child but the child spending substantial and significant time with each of them is:

                              (i)  reasonably practicable; and

                             (ii)  in the best interests of the child;

                            they could consider the option of an arrangement of that kind; and

                     (c)  inform them that decisions made in developing parenting plans should be made in the best interests of the child; and

                     (d)  inform them of the matters that may be dealt with in a parenting plan in accordance with subsection 63C(2); and

                     (e)  inform them that, if there is a parenting order in force in relation to the child, the order may (because of section 64D) include a provision that the order is subject to a parenting plan they enter into; and

                      (f)  inform them about the desirability of including in the plan:

                              (i)  if they are to share parental responsibility for the child under the plan—provisions of the kind referred to in paragraph 63C(2)(d) (which deals with the form of consultations between the parties to the plan) as a way of avoiding future conflicts over, or misunderstandings about, the matters covered by that paragraph; and

                             (ii)  provisions of the kind referred to in paragraph 63C(2)(g) (which deals with the process for resolving disputes between the parties to the plan); and

                            (iii)  provisions of the kind referred to in paragraph 63C(2)(h) (which deals with the process for changing the plan to take account of the changing needs or circumstances of the child or the parties to the plan); and

                     (g)  explain to them, in language they are likely to readily understand, the availability of programs to help people who experience difficulties in complying with a parenting plan; and

                     (h)  inform them that section 65DAB requires the court to have regard to the terms of the most recent parenting plan in relation to the child when making a parenting order in relation to the child if it is in the best interests of the child to do so.

Note:          Paragraphs (a) and (b) only require the adviser to inform the people that they could consider the option of the child spending equal time, or substantial and significant time, with each of them. The adviser may, but is not obliged to, advise them as to whether that option would be appropriate in their particular circumstances.

             (3)  For the purposes of paragraph (2)(b), a child will be taken to spend **_substantial and significant time_** with a parent only if:

                     (a)  the time the child spends with the parent includes both:

                              (i)  days that fall on weekends and holidays; and

                             (ii)  days that do not fall on weekends or holidays; and

                     (b)  the time the child spends with the parent allows the parent to be involved in:

                              (i)  the child’s daily routine; and

                             (ii)  occasions and events that are of particular significance to the child; and

                     (c)  the time the child spends with the parent allows the child to be involved in occasions and events that are of special significance to the parent.

             (4)  Subsection (3) does not limit the other matters to which regard may be had in determining whether the time a child spends with a parent would be substantial and significant.

                     (a)  a legal practitioner; or

             (2)  To apply for registration of an agreement (**_revocation agreement_**_)_ revoking a registered parenting plan:

                     (a)  an application for registration of the revocation agreement must be lodged in accordance with the applicable Rules of Court; and

                     (b)  the application must be accompanied by:

                     (a)  must have regard to the information accompanying the application for registration; and

                     (b)  may, but is not required to, have regard to all or any of the matters set out in subsections 60CC(2) and (3).

##### <a id="63F"></a>63F  Child welfare provisions of registered parenting plans

Application of section

             (1)  This section applies to a registered parenting plan that contains child welfare provisions.

             (2)  The court may, by order, vary the child welfare provisions in the plan if it considers the variation is required in the best interests of a child.

             (3)  The child welfare provisions have effect, subject to subsections (5) and (6), as if they were provisions of a parenting order.

Note:          Provisions of this Act relevant to the child welfare provisions having effect as provided in this subsection include:

(a)    Subdivisions C, D and E of Division 6 of this Part (dealing with obligations created by parenting orders (other than child maintenance orders)); and

(b)    Division 13A of this Part and Part XIII (dealing generally with enforcement of orders and sanctions for contravening orders); and

(c)    subsection 65D(2) (providing for discharge, variation, suspension and revival of parenting orders other than child maintenance orders); and

             (4)  If provisions of the plan have effect under subsection (3) as a court order, a person who is a party to the plan is taken (for example, for the purposes of section 65Y) to be a party to the proceedings in which the order was made.

             (5)  Subsection (3) does not apply to the plan (whenever registered) to the extent (if at all) that the plan purports to determine that the child concerned is to live with a person who is not a parent of the child.

             (6)  Even though the plan is registered, the court, or another court having jurisdiction under this Part, must not enforce the child welfare provisions if it considers that to do so would be contrary to the best interests of a child.

Note:          Sections 60CB to 60CG deal with how a court determines a child’s best interests.

##### <a id="63G"></a>63G  Child maintenance provisions of registered parenting plans—where not enforceable as maintenance agreements

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a registered parenting plan contains child maintenance provisions; and

                     (b)  the plan is not a maintenance agreement or, if it is a maintenance agreement, the child concerned is not a child of the relevant marriage.

             (2)  The child maintenance provisions have effect, subject to subsections (3), (4) and (5), as if they were a child maintenance order made by the court.

Note:          Provisions of this Act relevant to the child maintenance provisions having effect as a child maintenance order include: 

(a)    Parts XIII and XIIIA (dealing generally with enforcement of orders and sanctions for contravening orders); and

(b)    section 66S (providing for discharge, variation, suspension and revival of child maintenance orders); and

(c)    other provisions of this Act that refer to parenting orders, or to child maintenance orders.

             (3)  Unless the plan provides otherwise, the child maintenance provisions (other than provisions for the periodic payment of maintenance) continue to operate in spite of the death of a party to the plan and operate in favour of, and are binding on, the legal personal representative of that party.

             (4)  If the child maintenance provisions include provisions (the **_periodic provisions_**) for the periodic payment of maintenance:

                     (a)  the periodic provisions continue to operate, if the plan so provides, in spite of the death of a party to the plan who is liable to make the periodic payments, and are binding on the legal personal representative of that party; but

                     (b)  the periodic provisions do not continue to operate, in spite of anything in the plan, after the death of the person entitled to receive the periodic payments.

             (5)  The child maintenance provisions have no effect, and are not enforceable in any way, at any time when an application could properly be made under the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989_ by one of the parties to the plan for administrative assessment of child support (within the meaning of that Act) for the child concerned.

Note:          This subsection does not affect the operation of provisions of a parenting plan referred to in section 63CAA (child support matters).

             (6)  Subsection (5) has effect whether or not an application for administrative assessment of child support for the child has in fact been made by a party to the plan.

##### <a id="63H"></a>63H    Court’s powers to set aside, discharge, vary, suspend or revive registered parenting plans

          (1A)  This section applies to a registered parenting plan.

             (1)  The court in which the plan was registered may set aside the plan, and its registration, if the court is satisfied:

                     (a)  that the concurrence of a party was obtained by fraud, duress or undue influence; or

                     (b)  that the parties want the plan set aside; or

                     (c)  that it is in the best interests of a child to set aside the plan.

             (2)  In proceedings under subsection (1), to the extent that they are proceedings on the ground mentioned in paragraph (1)(c), the best interests of the child concerned are the paramount consideration.

Note:          Sections 60CB to 60CG deal with how a court determines a child’s best interests.

             (3)  Other provisions of this Act under which provisions of the parenting plan may be set aside or otherwise affected are:

                     (b)  subsection 65D(2)—under that subsection a court may make a parenting order that discharges, varies, suspends or revives provisions of the plan that have effect as if they were a parenting order (other than a child maintenance order); and

                     (c)  section 66S—under that section a court may discharge, vary, suspend or revive provisions of the plan that have effect as if they were a child maintenance order.

             (4)  Except as permitted by subsection (1) or by a provision mentioned in subsection (3), a court must not set aside, discharge, vary, suspend or revive the whole or a part of the parenting plan.

### Division 5—Parenting orders—what they are

##### <a id="64A"></a>64A  What this Division does

                   This Division explains what parenting orders are.

##### <a id="64B"></a>64B  Meaning of _parenting order_ and related terms

             (1)  A **_parenting order_** is:

                     (a)  an order under this Part (including an order until further order) dealing with a matter mentioned in subsection (2); or

                     (b)  an order under this Part discharging, varying, suspending or reviving an order, or part of an order, described in paragraph (a).

However, a declaration or order under Subdivision E of Division 12 is not a **_parenting order_**.

             (2)  A parenting order may deal with one or more of the following:

                     (a)  the person or persons with whom a child is to live;

                     (b)  the time a child is to spend with another person or other persons;

                     (c)  the allocation of parental responsibility for a child;

                     (d)  if 2 or more persons are to share parental responsibility for a child—the form of consultations those persons are to have with one another about decisions to be made in the exercise of that responsibility;

                     (e)  the communication a child is to have with another person or other persons;

                      (f)  maintenance of a child;

                     (g)  the steps to be taken before an application is made to a court for a variation of the order to take account of the changing needs or circumstances of:

                             (ii)  the parties to the proceedings in which the order is made;

                     (h)  the process to be used for resolving disputes about the terms or operation of the order;

                      (i)  any aspect of the care, welfare or development of the child or any other aspect of parental responsibility for a child.

The person referred to in this subsection may be, or the persons referred to in this subsection may include, either a parent of the child or a person other than the parent of the child (including a grandparent or other relative of the child).

Note:          Paragraph (f)—a parenting order cannot deal with the maintenance of a child if the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989_ applies.

             (3)  Without limiting paragraph (2)(c), the order may deal with the allocation of responsibility for making decisions about major long‑term issues in relation to the child.

             (4)  The communication referred to in paragraph (2)(e) includes (but is not limited to) communication by:

                     (a)  letter; and

                     (b)  telephone, email or any other electronic means.

          (4A)  Without limiting paragraphs (2)(g) and (h), the parenting order may provide that the parties to the proceedings must consult with a family dispute resolution practitioner to assist with:

                     (a)  resolving any dispute about the terms or operation of the order; or

                     (b)  reaching agreement about changes to be made to the order.

             (5)  To the extent (if at all) that a parenting order deals with the matter mentioned in paragraph (2)(f), the order is a **_child maintenance order_**.

             (6)  For the purposes of this Act:

                     (a)  a parenting order that provides that a child is to live with a person is **_made in favour_** of  that person; and

                     (b)  a parenting order that provides that a child is to spend time with a person is **_made in favour_** of that person; and

                     (c)  a parenting order that provides that a child is to have communication with a person is **_made_** **_in favour_** of that person; and

                     (d)  a parenting order that:

                              (i)  allocates parental responsibility for a child to a person; or

                             (ii)  provides that a person is to share parental responsibility for a child with another person;

                            is **_made_** **_in favour_** of that person.

             (9)  In this section:

                    <a name="act"></a>**_this Act_** includes:

                     (a)  the standard Rules of Court; and

                     (b)  the related Federal Magistrates Rules.

##### <a id="64C"></a>64C  Parenting orders may be made in favour of parents or other persons

                   A parenting order in relation to a child may be made in favour of a parent of the child or some other person.

##### <a id="64D"></a>64D  Parenting orders subject to later parenting plans

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), a parenting order in relation to a child is taken to include a provision that the order is subject to a parenting plan that is:

                     (a)  entered into subsequently by the child’s parents; and

                     (b)  agreed to, in writing, by any other person (other than the child) to whom the parenting order applies.

             (2)  The court may, in exceptional circumstances, include in a parenting order a provision that the parenting order, or a specified provision of the parenting order, may only be varied by a subsequent order of the court (and not by a parenting plan).

             (3)  Without limiting subsection (2), exceptional circumstances for the purposes of that subsection include the following:

                     (a)  circumstances that give rise to a need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence;

                     (b)  the existence of substantial evidence that one of the child’s parents is likely to seek to use coercion or duress to gain the agreement of the other parent to a parenting plan.

### Division 6—Parenting orders other than child maintenance orders

#### Subdivision A—Introductory

##### <a id="65A"></a>65A  What this Division does

             (1)  This Division deals with:

                     (a)  applying for and making parenting orders, other than child maintenance orders (Subdivision B); and

                     (b)  the general obligations created by parenting orders, other than child maintenance orders (Subdivision C); and

                     (c)  dealing with people who have been arrested (Subdivision D); and

                     (d)  the obligations under parenting orders, other than child maintenance orders, relating to taking or sending children from Australia (Subdivision E).

Note:          Paragraph (a)—section 60I provides that people with disputes about matters that may be dealt with in a Part VII order (which includes a parenting order) should generally make use of family dispute resolution before applying for the order.

             (2)  Measures designed to improve communication between separated parents and to educate parents about their respective responsibilities in relation to their children are contained in this Division (see section 65DA).

Note:          Division 13A provides for the compliance regime for dealing with contraventions, and alleged contraventions, of parenting orders.

##### <a id="65AA"></a>65AA  Child’s best interests paramount consideration in making a parenting order

                   Section 60CA provides that in deciding whether to make a particular parenting order in relation to a child, a court must regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration.

##### <a id="65B"></a>65B  Division does not apply to child maintenance orders

                   This Division does not apply to parenting orders to the extent that they consist of child maintenance orders. Child maintenance orders are dealt with in Division 7.

#### Subdivision B—Applying for and making parenting orders

##### <a id="65C"></a>65C  Who may apply for a parenting order

                   A parenting order in relation to a child may be applied for by:

                     (a)  either or both of the child’s parents; or

                     (b)  the child; or

                   (ba)  a grandparent of the child; or

                     (c)  any other person concerned with the care, welfare or development of the child.

##### <a id="65D"></a>65D    Court’s power to make parenting order

             (1)  In proceedings for a parenting order, the court may, subject to sections 61DA (presumption of equal shared parental responsibility when making parenting orders) and 65DAB (parenting plans) and this Division, make such parenting order as it thinks proper.

Note:          Division 4 of Part XIIIAA (International protection of children) may affect the jurisdiction of a court to make a parenting order.

             (2)  Without limiting the generality of subsection (1) and subject to section 61DA (presumption of equal shared parental responsibility when making parenting orders) and 65DAB (parenting plans) and this Division, a court may make a parenting order that discharges, varies, suspends or revives some or all of an earlier parenting order.

             (3)  If the application for the parenting order was made as a result of the adjournment under paragraph 70NEB(1)(c) of proceedings under Subdivision E of Division 13A of Part VII:

                     (a)  the court must hear and determine the application as soon as practicable; and

                     (b)  if the court makes a parenting order on the application, the court may, if it thinks it is appropriate to do so, dismiss the proceedings under that Subdivision.

Note:          The applicant may apply to the Family Court or to the Federal Magistrates Court for the application for the parenting order or for the proceedings under Subdivision E of Division 13A of Part VII, or both, to be transferred to the Federal Magistrates Court or to the Family Court, as the case requires (see section 33B of this Act and section 39 of the _Federal Magistrates Act 1999_).

##### <a id="65DAA"></a>65DAA  Court to consider child spending equal time or substantial and significant time with each parent in certain circumstances

Equal time

             (1)  Subject to subsection (6), if a parenting order provides (or is to provide) that a child’s parents are to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child, the court must:

                     (a)  consider whether the child spending equal time with each of the parents would be in the best interests of the child; and

                     (b)  consider whether the child spending equal time with each of the parents is reasonably practicable; and

                     (c)  if it is, consider making an order to provide (or including a provision in the order) for the child to spend equal time with each of the parents.

Note 1:       The effect of section 60CA is that in deciding whether to go on to make a parenting order for the child to spend equal time with each of the parents, the court will regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration.

Note 2:       See subsection (5) for the factors the court takes into account in determining what is reasonably practicable.

Substantial and significant time

             (2)  Subject to subsection (6), if:

                     (a)  a parenting order provides (or is to provide) that a child’s parents are to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child; and

                     (b)  the court does not make an order (or include a provision in the order) for the child to spend equal time with each of the parents; and

the court must:

                     (c)  consider whether the child spending substantial and significant time with each of the parents would be in the best interests of the child; and

                     (d)  consider whether the child spending substantial and significant time with each of the parents is reasonably practicable; and

                     (e)  if it is, consider making an order to provide (or including a provision in the order) for the child to spend substantial and significant time with each of the parents.

Note 1:       The effect of section 60CA is that in deciding whether to go on to make a parenting order for the child to spend substantial time with each of the parents, the court will regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration.

Note 2:       See subsection (5) for the factors the court takes into account in determining what is reasonably practicable.

             (3)  For the purposes of subsection (2), a child will be taken to spend **_substantial and significant time_** with a parent only if:

                     (a)  the time the child spends with the parent includes both:

                              (i)  days that fall on weekends and holidays; and

                             (ii)  days that do not fall on weekends or holidays; and

                     (b)  the time the child spends with the parent allows the parent to be involved in:

                              (i)  the child’s daily routine; and

                             (ii)  occasions and events that are of particular significance to the child; and

                     (c)  the time the child spends with the parent allows the child to be involved in occasions and events that are of special significance to the parent.

             (4)  Subsection (3) does not limit the other matters to which a court can have regard in determining whether the time a child spends with a parent would be substantial and significant.

Reasonable practicality

             (5)  In determining for the purposes of subsections (1) and (2) whether it is reasonably practicable for a child to spend equal time, or substantial and significant time, with each of the child’s parents, the court must have regard to:

                     (a)  how far apart the parents live from each other; and

                     (b)  the parents’ current and future capacity to implement an arrangement for the child spending equal time, or substantial and significant time, with each of the parents; and

                     (c)  the parents’ current and future capacity to communicate with each other and resolve difficulties that might arise in implementing an arrangement of that kind; and

                     (d)  the impact that an arrangement of that kind would have on the child; and

                     (e)  such other matters as the court considers relevant.

Note 1:       Behaviour of a parent that is relevant for paragraph (c) may also be taken into account in determining what parenting order the court should make in the best interests of the child. Subsection 60CC(3) provides for considerations that are taken into account in determining what is in the best interests of the child. These include:

(a)    the willingness and ability of each of the child’s parents to facilitate, and encourage, a close and continuing relationship between the child and the other parent (paragraph 60CC(3)(c));

(b)    the attitude to the child, and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of the child’s parents (paragraph 60CC(3)(i)).

Note 2:       Paragraph (c) reference to future capacity—the court has power under section 13C to make orders for parties to attend family counselling or family dispute resolution or participate in courses, programs or services.

Consent orders

             (6)  If:

                     (a)  the court is considering whether to make a parenting order with the consent of all the parties to the proceedings; and

                     (b)  the order provides (or is to provide) that a child’s parents are to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child;

the court may, but is not required to, consider the matters referred to in paragraphs (1)(a) to (c) or (if applicable) the matters referred to in paragraphs (2)(c) to (e).

             (7)  To avoid doubt, subsection (6) does not affect the application of section 60CA in relation to a parenting order.

Note:          Section 60CA requires the best interests of the child to be the paramount consideration in a decision whether to make a particular parenting order.

##### <a id="65DAB"></a>65DAB  Court to have regard to parenting plans

                   When making a parenting order in relation to a child, the court is to have regard to the terms of the most recent parenting plan (if any) that has been entered into between the child’s parents (to the extent to which that plan relates to the child) if doing so would be in the best interests of the child.

##### <a id="65DAC"></a>65DAC  Effect of parenting order that provides for shared parental responsibility

             (1)  This section applies if, under a parenting order:

                     (a)  2 or more persons are to share parental responsibility for a child; and

                     (b)  the exercise of that parental responsibility involves making a decision about a major long‑term issue in relation to the child.

             (2)  The order is taken to require the decision to be made jointly by those persons.

Note:          Subject to any court orders, decisions about issues that are not major long‑term issues are made by the person with whom the child is spending time without a need to consult the other person (see section 65DAE).

             (3)  The order is taken to require each of those persons:

                     (a)  to consult the other person in relation to the decision to be made about that issue; and

                     (b)  to make a genuine effort to come to a joint decision about that issue.

             (4)  To avoid doubt, this section does not require any other person to establish, before acting on a decision about the child communicated by one of those persons, that the decision has been made jointly.

##### <a id="65DAE"></a>65DAE  No need to consult on issues that are not major long‑term issues

             (1)  If a child is spending time with a person at a particular time under a parenting order, the order is taken not to require the person to consult a person who:

                     (a)  has parental responsibility for the child; or

                     (b)  shares parental responsibility for the child with another person;

about decisions that are made in relation to the child during that time on issues that are not major‑long term issues.

Note:          This will mean that the person with whom the child is spending time will usually not need to consult on decisions about such things as what the child eats or wears because these are usually not major long‑term issues.

             (2)  Subsection (1) applies subject to any provision to the contrary made by a parenting order.

##### <a id="65DA"></a>65DA  Parenting orders

             (1)  This section applies when a court makes a parenting order.

             (2)  It is the duty of the court to include in the order particulars of:

                     (a)  the obligations that the order creates; and

                     (b)  the consequences that may follow if a person contravenes the order.

             (3)  If any of the persons to whom the order is directed is not represented by a legal practitioner, it is also the duty of the court to explain to the person, or to each of the persons:

                     (a)  the availability of programs to help people to understand their responsibilities under parenting orders; and

                     (b)  the availability and use of location and recovery orders to ensure that parenting orders are complied with.

             (4)  The court may cause to be prepared, and given to persons to whom a parenting order is directed, a document setting out particulars of the matters mentioned in paragraphs (3)(a) and (b).

             (5)  If a person to whom the order is directed is represented by a legal practitioner, the court may request the practitioner:

                     (a)  to assist in explaining to the person the matters mentioned in paragraphs (2)(a) and (b); and

                     (b)  to explain to the person the matters mentioned in paragraphs (3)(a) and (b).

             (6)  If a request is made by the court to a legal practitioner under paragraph (5)(a) or (b), it is the duty of the practitioner to comply with the request.

             (7)  Failure to comply with a requirement of, or with a request made under, this section does not affect the validity of a parenting order.

             (8)  Any matter that is required by this section to be included in a parenting order or any explanation that is required by this section to be given to a person is to be expressed in language that is likely to be readily understood by the person to whom the order is directed or the explanation is given.

##### <a id="65F"></a>65F  General requirements for counselling before parenting order made

             (2)  Subject to subsection (3), a court must not make a parenting order in relation to a child unless:

                     (a)  the parties to the proceedings have attended family counselling to discuss the matter to which the proceedings relate; or

                     (b)  the court is satisfied that there is an urgent need for the parenting order, or there is some other special circumstance (such as family violence), that makes it appropriate to make the order even though the parties to the proceedings have not attended a conference as mentioned in paragraph (a); or

                     (c)  the court is satisfied that it is not practicable to require the parties to the proceedings to attend a conference as mentioned in paragraph (a).

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not apply to the making of a parenting order if:

                     (a)  it is made with the consent of all the parties to the proceedings; or

                     (b)  it is an order until further order.

             (4)  In this section:

                    <a name="proceing-parent-order"></a>**_proceedings for a parenting order_** includes:

                     (a)  proceedings for the enforcement of a parenting order; and

                     (b)  any other proceedings in which a contravention of a parenting order is alleged.

                     (a)  a court proposes to make a parenting order that deals with whom a child is to live with; and

                     (b)  under the order, the child would not live with a parent, grandparent or other relative of the child; and

                     (c)  the court proposes to make that order with the consent of all the parties to the proceedings.

          (1A)  This section also applies if:

                     (a)  a court proposes to make a parenting order that deals with the allocation of parental responsibility for a child; and

                     (b)  under the order, no parent, grandparent or other relative of the child would be allocated parental responsibility for the child; and

                     (c)  the court proposes to make that order with the consent of all the parties to the proceedings.

             (2)  The court must not make the proposed order unless:

                     (a)  the parties to the proceedings have attended a conference with a family consultant to discuss the matter to be determined by the proposed order; or

                     (b)  the court is satisfied that there are circumstances that make it appropriate to make the proposed order even though the conditions in paragraph (a) are not satisfied.

##### <a id="65H"></a>65H  Children who are 18 or over or who have married or entered de facto relationships

             (1)  A parenting order must not be made in relation to a child who:

                     (a)  is 18 or over; or

                     (b)  is or has been married; or

                     (c)  is in a de facto relationship.

             (2)  A parenting order in relation to a child stops being in force if the child turns 18, marries or enters into a de facto relationship.

             (3)  A court having jurisdiction under this Part may make a declaration to the effect that the child is in, or has entered into, a de facto relationship.

             (4)  A declaration under subsection (3) has effect for the purposes of this Act but does not have effect for any other purpose (including, for example, other laws of the Commonwealth or laws of the States and Territories).

             (2)  The parenting order stops being in force on the adoption of the child, unless the adoption is by a prescribed adopting parent and leave was not granted under section 60G for the adoption proceedings to be commenced.

##### <a id="65K"></a>65K  What happens when parenting order that deals with whom a child lives with does not make provision in relation to death of parent with whom child lives

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a parenting order is in force that provides that a child is to live with one of the child’s parents; and

                     (b)  that parent dies; and

                     (c)  the parenting order does not provide for what is to happen on that parent’s death.

             (2)  The surviving parent cannot require the child to live with him or her.

             (3)  The surviving parent, or another person (subject to section 65C), may apply for a parenting order that deals with the person or persons with whom the child is to live.

             (4)  In an application under subsection (3) by a person who does not, at the time of the application, have any parental responsibility for the child, any person who, at that time, has any parental responsibility for the child is entitled to be a party to the proceedings.

##### <a id="65L"></a>65L  Family consultants may be required to supervise or assist compliance with parenting orders

                     (a)  an order requiring compliance with the parenting order, as far as practicable, to be supervised by a family consultant;

                     (b)  an order requiring a family consultant to give any party to the parenting order such assistance as is reasonably requested by that party in relation to compliance with, and the carrying out of, the parenting order.

             (2)  In deciding whether to make a particular order under subsection (1) in relation to a child, a court must regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration.

Note:          Sections 60CB to 60CG deal with how a court determines a child’s best interests.

##### <a id="65LA"></a>65LA  Court may order attendance at a post‑separation parenting program

             (1)  In proceedings for a parenting order, the court may make an order directing a party to the proceedings to attend a post‑separation parenting program.

Note:          Before making an order under this section, the court must consider seeking the advice of a family consultant about the services appropriate to the party’s needs (see section 11E).

##### <a id="66C"></a>66C  Principles—parents have primary duty to maintain

             (1)  The parents of a child have, subject to this Division, the primary duty to maintain the child.

             (2)  Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), the duty of a parent to maintain a child:

                     (a)  is not of lower priority than the duty of the parent to maintain any other child or another person; and

             (2)  Any duty of a step‑parent to maintain a step‑child:

                     (a)  is a secondary duty subject to the primary duty of the parents of the child to maintain the child; and

                     (b)  does not derogate from the primary duty of the parents to maintain the child.

#### Subdivision C—Relationship with Child Support (Assessment) Act

##### <a id="66E"></a>66E  Child maintenance order not to be made etc. if application for administrative assessment of child support could be made

             (1)  A court having jurisdiction under this Part must not, at any time, make, revive or vary a child maintenance order in relation to a child on the application of a person (the **_applicant_**) against, or in favour of, a person (the **_respondent_**) if an application could properly be made, at that time, by the applicant under the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989_ for the respondent to be assessed in respect of the costs of the child, or vice versa.

             (2)  Subsection (1) has effect whether or not an application for administrative assessment of child support for the child has in fact been made (whether by the applicant, the respondent or another person).

             (3)  This section does not apply to proceedings under regulations made for the purposes of section 110 or 111A.

#### Subdivision D—Applying for and making child maintenance orders

                     (a)  the child; or

                     (b)  a parent of the child who has the daily care of the child; or

                              (i)  is not expressed to be an order to which this section applies; or

                             (ii)  is expressed to be an order to which this section applies, but does not comply with paragraph (1)(d);

any payment, transfer or settlement of a kind referred to in paragraph (1)(a), that the order has the effect of requiring, is to be taken not to make provision for the maintenance of a child.

##### <a id="66S"></a>66S  Modification of child maintenance orders

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  there is in force an order (the **_first order_**), for the maintenance of a child (whether or not made under this Act and whether made before or after the commencement of this section):

                              (i)  made by a court; or

                             (ii)  registered in a court; and

                     (b)  a person (being someone who could apply for a child maintenance order in relation to the child) or persons (each of whom could do that) apply to the court for an order under this section in relation to the first order.

          (1A)  With the consent of all the parties to the first order, the court may, subject to section 111AA, make an order:

                     (a)  discharging the first order; or

                     (b)  suspending its operation wholly or in part and either until further order or until a fixed time or the happening of a future event; or

                     (c)  if the operation of the order has been suspended under paragraph (b) or (2)(b)—reviving its operation wholly or in part; or

                     (d)  varying the order:

                              (i)  so as to increase or decrease any amount ordered to be paid by the order; or

                             (ii)  in any other way.

          (1B)  However, the court must not make an order under subsection (1A) that allows any entitlement of a child or another person to an income tested pension, allowance or benefit, to affect the duty of that child’s parents to maintain the child.

Note:          For the duty of a parent to maintain a child, see section 66C.

             (2)  In any other case, the court may, by order:

                     (a)  discharge the first order if there is just cause for so doing; or

                     (b)  suspend its operation wholly or in part and either until further order or until a fixed time or the happening of a future event; or

                     (c)  if the operation of the order has been suspended under paragraph (b) or (1A)(b), revive its operation wholly or in part; or

                     (d)  subject to subsection (3), vary the order:

                              (i)  so as to increase or decrease any amount ordered to be paid by the order; or

                             (ii)  in any other way.

             (3)  The court must not vary the order so as to increase or decrease any amount ordered to be paid by the order unless it is satisfied:

                     (a)  that, since the order was made or last varied:

                              (i)  the circumstances of the child have changed so as to justify the variation; or

                             (ii)  the circumstances of the person liable to make payments under the order have changed so as to justify the variation; or

                            (iii)  the circumstances of the person entitled to receive payments under the order have changed so as to justify the variation; or

                            (iv)  in the case of an order that operates in favour of, or is binding on, a legal personal representative—the circumstances of the estate are such as to justify the variation; or

                     (b)  that, since the order was made or last varied, the cost of living has changed to such an extent as to justify its so doing (this is expanded on in subsections (4) and (5)); or

                     (c)  if the order was made by consent—that the amount ordered to be paid is not proper or adequate (this is expanded on in subsection (6)); or

                     (d)  that material facts were withheld from the court that made the order or from a court that varied the order, or material evidence previously given before such a court was false.

             (4)  In satisfying itself for the purposes of paragraph (3)(b), the court must have regard to any changes that have occurred in the Consumer Price Index published by the Australian Statistician.

             (5)  The court must not, in considering the variation of an order, have regard to a change in the cost of living unless at least 12 months have elapsed since the order was made or last varied having regard to a change in the cost of living.

             (6)  In satisfying itself for the purposes of paragraph (3)(c), the court must have regard to any payments, and any transfer or settlement of property, previously made to the child, or to any other person for the benefit of the child, by the person against whom the order was made.

             (7)  An order decreasing a periodic amount payable under the order, or discharging the order, may be expressed to be retrospective to such day as the court considers appropriate.

             (8)  If an order (the **_subsequent order_**) decreasing a periodic amount payable under the first order is expressed to be retrospective, amounts paid under the first order that are not payable under the first order as varied by the subsequent order may be recovered in a court having jurisdiction under this Part.

             (9)  If an order discharging the first order is expressed to be retrospective to a specified day, amounts paid under the first order since the specified day may be recovered in a court having jurisdiction under this Part.

           (10)  For the purposes of this section, the court must have regard to the provisions of Subdivisions B, C and D (to the extent applicable).

           (11)  The discharge of the first order does not affect the recovery of arrears due under the order when the discharge takes effect.

#### Subdivision EA—Varying the maintenance of certain children

##### <a id="66SA"></a>66SA  Varying the maintenance of certain children

             (1)  This section applies to persons who:

                     (a)  are parties to an agreement (the **_original agreement_**) dealing with the maintenance of a child; or

                     (b)  are entitled to receive, or required to pay, maintenance in respect of a child under a court order;

and cannot properly make an application under the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989_ for the other person to be assessed in respect of the costs of the child.

             (2)  The persons may, by registering a written agreement in a court having jurisdiction under this Part, vary or revoke the original agreement or order to the extent that it deals with maintenance of the child.

             (3)  However, the registered agreement is of no effect to the extent that it allows any entitlement of a child or another person to an income tested pension, allowance or benefit to affect the duty of that child’s parents to maintain the child.

Note:          For the duty of a parent to maintain a child, see section 66C.

             (4)  If the original agreement or order is varied under subsection (2), it:

                     (a)  continues to operate despite the death of a party to the agreement or of a person entitled to receive, or required to pay, maintenance under the order; and

                     (b)  operates in favour of, and is binding on, the legal representative of that party or person;

unless the agreement or order provides otherwise.

             (5)  However, despite anything in the agreement or order, it does not continue to operate, to the extent that it requires the periodic payment of maintenance, after the death of the person entitled to receive those payments.

             (6)  This section applies despite anything in Division 4.

#### Subdivision F—When child maintenance orders stop being in force

##### <a id="66T"></a>66T  Effect of child turning 18

                   As stated in subsection 66L(3), a child maintenance order in relation to a child stops being in force when the child turns 18, unless the order is expressed to continue in force after then.

##### <a id="66U"></a>66U  Effect of death of child, person liable to pay or person entitled to receive

             (1)  A child maintenance order in relation to a child stops being in force on the death of the child.

             (2)  A child maintenance order in relation to a child stops being in force on the death of the person liable to make payments under the order.

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not apply to an order made before the commencement of section 38 of the _Family Law Amendment Act 1983_ if the order was expressed to continue in force throughout the life of the person for whose benefit the order was made or for a period that had not expired at the death of the person liable to make payments under the order and, in that case, the order is binding on the legal personal representative of the deceased person.

             (4)  A child maintenance order in relation to a child stops being in force on the death of the person entitled to receive payments under the order.

             (5)  Subsection (4) does not apply to an order if:

                     (a)  the order is expressed to continue in force after the death of the person first entitled to receive payments under the order; and

                     (b)  the order specifies the person who is to receive the payments after that death.

##### <a id="66V"></a>66V  Effect of adoption, marriage or entering into a de facto relationship

             (1)  A child maintenance order in relation to a child stops being in force if the child is adopted, marries or enters into a de facto relationship.

             (2)  If a child to whom a child maintenance order applies dies, is adopted, marries or enters into a de facto relationship, the person entitled to receive payments under the order must, without delay, inform the person liable to make payments under the order.

             (3)  Any amounts paid under a child maintenance order in relation to a period after the child dies, is adopted, marries or enters into a de facto relationship may be recovered in a court having jurisdiction under this Part.

             (4)  A court having jurisdiction under this Part may make a declaration to the effect that a child is in, or has entered into, a de facto relationship.

             (5)  A declaration under subsection (4) has effect for the purposes of this Act but does not have effect for any other purpose (including, for example, other laws of the Commonwealth or laws of the States and Territories).

##### <a id="66VA"></a>66VA  Children who are 18 or over: change of circumstances

             (1)  A child maintenance order made under section 66L:

                     (a)  to enable the child to complete his or her education; or

                     (b)  because of a mental or physical disability of the child;

stops being in force if the child ceases that education or ceases to have that disability.

             (2)  The person to whom the maintenance is payable must, as soon as practicable, inform the person required to pay it of that change in circumstances.

             (3)  Any amounts of maintenance paid under the child maintenance order after it stops being in force may be recovered in a court having jurisdiction under this Part.

##### <a id="66W"></a>66W  Recovery of arrears

             (1)  Nothing in subsection 66L(3), or in this Subdivision (apart from subsection (2) of this section), affects the recovery of arrears due under a child maintenance order in relation to a child when the order ceases to be in force.

             (2)  If arrears are due under such an order when the order ceases to be in force, the court may, by order, retrospectively:

                     (a)  discharge the order if there is just cause for doing so; or

                     (b)  vary the order so as to increase or decrease the arrears to be paid under the order if the court is satisfied that:

                              (i)  the circumstances of the person liable to pay the arrears are such as to justify the variation; or

                             (ii)  the circumstances of the person entitled to receive the arrears are such as to justify the variation; or

                            (iii)  in the case of an order that operated in favour of, or that was binding on, a legal personal representative—the circumstances of the estate are such as to justify the variation.

#### Subdivision G—Recovery of amounts paid under maintenance orders

##### <a id="66X"></a>66X  Recovery of amounts paid, and property transferred or settled, under maintenance orders

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a court has at any time purported to make an order (the **_purported order_**) of a kind referred to in paragraph 66P(1)(a), (b) or (c) requiring a person (the **_maintenance provider_**) to pay an amount, or to transfer or settle property, by way of maintenance for a child; and

                     (b)  the maintenance provider has:

                              (i)  paid another person an amount or amounts; or

                             (ii)  transferred or settled property;

                            in compliance, or partial compliance, with the purported order; and

                     (c)  a court has determined that the maintenance provider is not a parent or step‑parent of the child.

             (2)  If the maintenance provider applies to a court having jurisdiction under this Part for an order under this subsection, the court must make such order as it considers just and equitable in the circumstances, for:

                     (a)  if the purported order was of a kind referred to in paragraph 66P(1)(a) or (b)—the repayment to the maintenance provider, by the person to whom the amount or amounts referred to in subparagraph (1)(b)(i) of this section were paid, of an amount up to, or equal to, that amount or the sum of those amounts; or

                     (b)  if the purported order was of the kind referred to in paragraph 66P(1)(c)—the return to the maintenance provider of:

                              (i)  the property referred to in subparagraph (1)(b)(ii) of this section; or

                             (ii)  an amount up to, or equal to, the value of that property.

The court may only order the repayment of an amount that is less than the amount, or the sum of the amounts, referred to in subparagraph (1)(b)(i) of this section, or the return of an amount that is less than the value of the property referred to in subparagraph (1)(b)(ii) of this section, in exceptional circumstances.

             (3)  If the purported order was of the kind referred to in paragraph 66P(1)(c) and the court that made the order did so:

                     (a)  in part by way of providing maintenance for the child; and

                     (b)  in part for some other purpose;

the reference in paragraph (2)(b) to the property, or the value of the property, referred to in subparagraph (1)(b)(ii) is taken to be a reference to that property, or the value of that property, only to the extent to which that property was transferred or settled by way of providing maintenance for the child.

             (4)  Without limiting paragraph (2)(b), the orders that the court may make under that paragraph include the following:

                     (a)  an order that a specified payment be made;

                     (b)  an order that a specified transfer or settlement of property be made;

                     (c)  an order that any necessary instrument be executed, and that such documents of title be produced and such other things be done, as are necessary to enable an order to be carried out effectively or to provide security for the due performance of an order.

             (5)  An amount paid to the Commonwealth under section 30 of the _Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988_ is to be taken, for the purposes of this section, to have been paid to the person to whom, apart from that section, the amount would have been payable.

##### <a id="67L"></a>67L  Child’s best interests paramount consideration in making a location order

                   In deciding whether to make a location order in relation to a child, a court must regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration.

##### <a id="67M"></a>67M  Provisions about location orders, other than Commonwealth information orders

             (1)  This section applies to location orders other than Commonwealth information orders.

             (2)  Subject to section 67L, a court having jurisdiction under this Part or section 111CX, or exercising jurisdiction in proceedings arising under regulations made for the purposes of Part XIIIAA, may make a location order if it is satisfied that the person to whom the order applies is likely to have information about the child’s location.

             (3)  If the person to whom a location order applies holds an office or position in, or in relation to, a Department or a Commonwealth instrumentality, the order does not apply to information that the person has or obtains because of holding that office or position.

             (4)  A location order stays in force for 12 months or such longer period as the court considers appropriate.

             (5)  While a location order is in force, the person to whom it applies must provide the information sought by the order as soon as practicable, or as soon as practicable after the person obtains it.

             (2)  Subject to section 67L, a court having jurisdiction under this Part or section 111CX, or exercising jurisdiction in proceedings arising under regulations made for the purposes of Part XIIIAA, may make a Commonwealth information order if it is satisfied that information about the child’s location is likely to be contained in, or to come into, the records of the Department or Commonwealth instrumentality concerned.

             (3)  A court must not make a Commonwealth information order unless:

                     (a)  a copy of the application for the order has been served in accordance with the applicable Rules of Court on the person to whom the order will apply (being the Secretary of the Department concerned or an appropriate authority of the Commonwealth instrumentality concerned); and

                     (b)  if that Department or Commonwealth instrumentality is prescribed for the purposes of this paragraph—either:

                              (i)  the period of 7 days after service of that copy of the application has expired; or

                             (ii)  the court considers that there are special circumstances because of which the order should be made before the end of that period of 7 days.

             (4)  If an application for a Commonwealth information order relates to more than one Department or Commonwealth instrumentality, the court must not make the order in relation to more than one of them unless the court considers it should do so because of exceptional circumstances.

             (5)  A court may state that a Commonwealth information order only applies to records of a particular kind if the court considers that:

                     (a)  the information sought by the order is only likely to be contained in records of that kind; and

                     (b)  to apply the order to all records of the Department or Commonwealth instrumentality concerned would place an unreasonable burden on its resources.

             (6)  A Commonwealth information order stays in force for 12 months.

##### <a id="68N"></a>68N  Purposes of this Division

                   The purposes of this Division are:

                     (a)  to resolve inconsistencies between:

                              (i)  family violence orders; and

                             (ii)  certain orders, injunctions and arrangements made under this Act that provide for a child to spend time with a person or require or authorise a person to spend time with a child; and

                    (aa)  to ensure that orders, injunctions and arrangements of the kind referred to in subparagraph (a)(ii) do not expose people to family violence; and

                     (b)  to achieve the objects and principles in section 60B.

Note:          Other provisions dealing with family violence and family violence orders are section 4 (definitions), paragraphs 60B(1)(b) and 60CC(2)(i) and (j), sections 60CF and 60CG, subsection 60I(9), section 60K, subsection 61DA(2), paragraph 65F(2)(b) and section 65P.

##### <a id="68P"></a>68P  Obligations of court making an order or granting an injunction under this Act that is inconsistent with an existing family violence order

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a court:

                              (i)  makes a parenting order that provides for a child to spend time with a person, or expressly or impliedly requires or authorises a person to spend time with a child; or

                             (ii)  makes a recovery order (as defined in section 67Q) or any other order under this Act that expressly or impliedly requires or authorises a person to spend time with a child; or

                            (iii)  grants an injunction under section 68B or 114 that expressly or impliedly requires or authorises a person to spend time with a child; and

                     (b)  the order made or injunction granted is inconsistent with an existing family violence order.

             (2)  The court must, to the extent to which the order or injunction provides for the child to spend time with a person, or expressly or impliedly requires or authorises a person to spend time with the child:

                     (a)  specify in the order or injunction that it is inconsistent with an existing family violence order; and

                     (b)  give a detailed explanation in the order or injunction of how the contact that it provides for is to take place; and

                     (c)  explain (or arrange for someone else to explain) the order or injunction to:

                              (i)  the applicant and respondent in the proceedings for the order or injunction; and

                             (ii)  the person against whom the family violence order is directed (if that person is not the applicant or respondent); and

                            (iii)  the person protected by the family violence order (if that person is not the applicant or respondent); and

                     (d)  include (or arrange to be included) in the explanation, in language those persons are likely to readily understand:

                              (i)  the purpose of the order or injunction; and

                             (ii)  the obligations created by the order or injunction, including how the contact that it provides for is to take place; and

                            (iii)  the consequences that may follow if a person fails to comply with the order or injunction; and

                            (iv)  the court’s reasons for making an order or granting an injunction that is inconsistent with a family violence order; and

                             (v)  the circumstances in which a person may apply for variation or revocation of the order or injunction.

             (3)  As soon as practicable after making the order or granting the injunction (and no later than 14 days after making or granting it), the court must give a copy to:

                     (a)  the applicant and respondent in the proceedings for the order or injunction; and

                     (b)  the person against whom the family violence order is directed (if that person is not the applicant or respondent); and

                     (c)  the person protected by the family violence order (if that person is not the applicant or respondent); and

                     (d)  the Registrar, Principal Officer or other appropriate officer of the court that last made or varied the family violence order; and

                     (e)  the Commissioner or head (however described) of the police force of the State or Territory in which the person protected by the family violence order resides; and

                      (f)  a child welfare officer in relation to the State or Territory in which the person protected by the family violence order resides.

             (4)  Failure to comply with this section does not affect the validity of the order or injunction.

##### <a id="68Q"></a>68Q  Relationship of order or injunction made under this Act with existing inconsistent family violence order

             (1)  To the extent to which:

                     (a)  an order or injunction mentioned in paragraph 68P(1)(a) is made or granted that provides for a child to spend time with a person, or expressly or impliedly requires or authorises a person to spend time with a child; and

                     (b)  the order or injunction is inconsistent with an existing family violence order;

the family violence order is invalid.

             (2)  An application for a declaration that the order or injunction is inconsistent with the family violence order may be made, to a court that has jurisdiction under this Part, by:

                     (a)  the applicant or respondent in the proceedings for the order or injunction mentioned in paragraph 68P(1)(a); or

                     (b)  the person against whom the family violence order is directed (if that person is not the applicant or respondent); or

                     (c)  the person protected by the family violence order (if that person is not the applicant or respondent).

             (3)  The court must hear and determine the application and make such declarations as it considers appropriate.

##### <a id="68R"></a>68R  Power of court making a family violence order to revive, vary, discharge or suspend an existing order, injunction or arrangement under this Act

Power

             (1)  In proceedings to make or vary a family violence order, a court of a State or Territory that has jurisdiction in relation to this Part may revive, vary, discharge or suspend:

                     (a)  a parenting order, to the extent to which it provides for a child to spend time with a person, or expressly or impliedly requires or authorises a person to spend time with the child; or

                     (b)  a recovery order (as defined in section 67Q) or any other order under this Act, to the extent to which it expressly or impliedly requires or authorises a person to spend time with a child; or

                     (c)  an injunction granted under section 68B or 114, to the extent to which it expressly or impliedly requires or authorises a person to spend time with a child; or

                     (d)  to the extent to which it expressly or impliedly requires or authorises a person to spend time with a child:

                              (i)  an undertaking given to, and accepted by, a court exercising jurisdiction under this Act; or

                             (ii)  a registered parenting plan within the meaning of subsection 63C(6); or

                            (iii)  a recognisance entered into under an order under this Act.

             (2)  The court may do so:

                     (a)  on its own initiative; or

                     (b)  on application by any person.

Limits on power

             (3)  The court must not do so unless:

                     (a)  it also makes or varies a family violence order in the proceedings (whether or not by interim order); and

                     (b)  if the court proposes to revive, vary, discharge or suspend an order or injunction mentioned in paragraph (1)(a), (b) or (c)—the court has before it material that was not before the court that made that order or injunction.

             (4)  The court must not exercise its power under subsection (1) to discharge an order, injunction or arrangement in proceedings to make an interim family violence order or an interim variation of a family violence order.

Relevant considerations

             (5)  In exercising its power under subsection (1), the court must:

                     (a)  have regard to the purposes of this Division (stated in section 68N); and

                     (b)  have regard to whether contact with both parents is in the best interests of the child concerned; and

                     (c)  if varying, discharging or suspending an order or injunction mentioned in paragraph (1)(a), (b) or (c) that, when made or granted, was inconsistent with an existing family violence order—be satisfied that it is appropriate to do so because a person has been exposed, or is likely to be exposed, to family violence as a result of the operation of that order or injunction.

Note:          Sections 60CB to 60CG deal with how a court determines a child’s best interests.

Registration of revival, variation, discharge or suspension of orders and other arrangements

             (6)  The regulations may require a copy of the court’s decision to revive, vary, discharge or suspend an order, injunction or arrangement to be registered in accordance with the regulations. Failure to comply with the requirement does not affect the validity of the court’s decision.

##### <a id="68S"></a>68S  Application of Act and Rules when exercising section 68R power

             (1)  The following provisions do not apply to a court exercising the power under section 68R:

                     (a)  section 65C (who may apply for a parenting order);

                     (b)  subsection 65F(2) (parenting order not to be made unless parties attend family counselling);

                     (c)  section 60CG (court to consider risk of family violence);

                     (d)  section 69N (requirement to transfer certain proceedings);

                     (e)  any provisions (for example, section 60CA) that would otherwise make the best interests of the child the paramount consideration;

Note:       Even though the best interests of the child are not paramount, they must still be taken into account under paragraph 68R(5)(b).

                      (f)  any provisions of this Act or the applicable Rules of Court specified in the regulations.

             (2)  If a court is exercising the power under section 68R in proceedings to make an interim family violence order or an interim variation of a family violence order:

                     (a)  the court has a discretion about whether to apply paragraph 60CC(3)(a) (about taking into account a child’s views etc.); and

                     (b)  any provisions of this Act or the applicable Rules of Court specified in the regulations do not apply.

             (3)  A court exercising the power under section 68R may, as it thinks appropriate, dispense with any otherwise applicable Rules of Court.

##### <a id="68T"></a>68T  Special provisions relating to proceedings to make an interim (or interim variation of) family violence order

             (1)  If, in proceedings to make an interim family violence order or an interim variation of a family violence order, the court revives, varies or suspends an order, injunction or arrangement under section 68R, that revival, variation or suspension ceases to have effect at the earlier of:

                     (a)  the time the interim order stops being in force; and

                     (b)  the end of the period of 21 days starting when the interim order was made.

             (2)  No appeal lies in relation to the revival, variation or suspension.

                     (a)  under the law of the Commonwealth or of a State, Territory or prescribed overseas jurisdiction, a man has executed an instrument acknowledging that he is the father of a specified child; and

                     (b)  the instrument has not been annulled or otherwise set aside;

the man is presumed to be the father of the child.

##### <a id="69VA"></a>69VA  Declarations of parentage

                   As well as deciding, after receiving evidence, the issue of the parentage of a child for the purposes of proceedings, the court may also issue a declaration of parentage that is conclusive evidence of parentage for the purposes of all laws of the Commonwealth.

##### <a id="69W"></a>69W  Orders for carrying out of parentage testing procedures

             (1)  If the parentage of a child is a question in issue in proceedings under this Act, the court may make an order (a **_parentage testing order_**) requiring a parentage testing procedure to be carried out on a person mentioned in subsection (3) for the purpose of obtaining information to assist in determining the parentage of the child.

             (2)  A court may make a parentage testing order:

                     (a)  on its own initiative; or

                     (b)  on the application of:

                     (b)  a person known to be the mother of the child; or

                     (c)  any other person, if the court is of the opinion that, if the parentage testing procedure were to be carried out in relation to the person, the information that could be obtained might assist in determining the parentage of the child.

             (4)  A parentage testing order may be made subject to terms and conditions.

             (5)  This section does not affect the generality of section 69V.

##### <a id="69X"></a>69X  Orders associated with parentage testing orders

             (1)  If a court makes a parentage testing order, it may also make orders under subsection (2) or (4).

             (3)  Some examples of the kinds of orders the court may make under subsection (2) are as follows:

                     (a)  an order requiring a person to submit to a medical procedure;

                     (b)  an order requiring a person to provide a bodily sample;

                     (c)  an order requiring a person to provide information relevant to the person’s medical or family history.

             (4)  The court may make such orders as it considers just in relation to costs incurred in relation to:

             (2)  Despite section 69X, a court must order that the costs of any parentage testing procedure ordered in proceedings mentioned in subsection (1) are payable by a party to those proceedings who:

                     (a)  contested the making of a maintenance assessment or court order for child support on the ground of not being the parent of the child; or

                     (b)  contested the enforcement of an overseas maintenance order, agreement or assessment on the ground of not being the parent of the child.

             (3)  If a parentage testing procedure that is ordered by a court in proceedings mentioned in subsection (1) establishes that a party contesting parentage in those proceedings was not a parent of the child, the court may order that the costs of the procedure are payable by the Secretary.

             (4)  A report in relation to information obtained as a result of a parentage testing procedure, received by the Secretary from an administrative or judicial authority in a reciprocating jurisdiction within the meaning of section 110 or a jurisdiction mentioned in Schedule 4 or 4A to the regulations, may be received in evidence in any proceedings under this Act.

##### <a id="69Y"></a>69Y  Orders directed to persons 18 or over

             (1)  If a person who is 18 or over contravenes a parentage testing order or an order under section 69X, the person is not liable to any penalty in relation to the contravention.

             (2)  The court may draw such inferences from the contravention as appear just in the circumstances.

##### <a id="69Z"></a>69Z  Orders directed to children under 18

             (1)  This section applies if a parentage testing order, or an order under section 69X, requires a medical procedure or other act to be carried out in relation to a child who is under 18.

                     (c)  a person who, under a parenting order, has responsibility for the child’s long‑term or day‑to‑day care, welfare and development.

             (3)  The court may draw such inferences from a failure or refusal to consent as mentioned in subsection (2) as appear just in the circumstances.

##### <a id="69ZA"></a>69ZA  No liability if parent etc. consents

             (1)  A person who carries out, or who assists in the carrying out of, a medical procedure or other act in relation to a child under a parentage testing order is not liable to any civil or criminal action in relation to the proper carrying out of the procedure or act if it is carried out with the consent of:

                     (a)  a parent of the child; or

                     (b)  a guardian of the child; or

                     (c)  a person who, under a parenting order, has responsibility for the child’s long‑term or day‑to‑day care, welfare and development.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not affect any liability of a person for an act done negligently, or negligently omitted to be done, in relation to the carrying out of the medical procedure or act.

             (2)  Despite anything in section 69ZE, if no declaration under subsection (1) is in force in relation to a particular State, this Part, as it extends to that State because of section 69ZE, has effect as if:

                     (a)  subsection 66F(2) were omitted; and

Under those subsections, the amendments of this Act made by the _Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Act 1992_ did not extend to a State unless a Proclamation was in force in relation to the State.

##### <a id="69ZG"></a>69ZG  Application of Part in, and in relation to, Territories

                   This Part applies in and in relation to the Territories.

##### <a id="69ZH"></a>69ZH  Additional application of Part

##### <a id="69ZJ"></a>69ZJ  Additional jurisdiction of courts

                   In addition to the jurisdiction that, apart from this section, is invested in or conferred on a court under this Part, the court is invested with jurisdiction or jurisdiction is conferred on the court, as the case requires, in matters between residents of different States, being matters with respect to:

                     (a)  the maintenance of children and the payment of expenses in relation to children or child bearing; or

                     (b)  parental responsibility in relation to children.

##### <a id="69ZK"></a>69ZK  Child welfare laws not affected

             (1)  A court having jurisdiction under this Act must not make an order under this Act (other than an order under Division 7) in relation to a child who is under the care (however described) of a person under a child welfare law unless:

                     (a)  the order is expressed to come into effect when the child ceases to be under that care; or

                     (b)  the order is made in proceedings relating to the child in respect of the institution or continuation of which the written consent of a child welfare officer of the relevant State or Territory has been obtained.

             (2)  Nothing in this Act, and no decree under this Act, affects:

                     (b)  any such order made or action taken; or

                     (c)  the operation of a child welfare law in relation to a child.

             (3)  If it appears to a court having jurisdiction under this Act that another court or an authority proposes to make an order, or to take any other action, of the kind referred to in paragraph (2)(a) in relation to a child, the first‑mentioned court may adjourn any proceedings before it that relate to the child.

### Division 12A—Principles for conducting child‑related proceedings

#### Subdivision A—Proceedings to which this Division applies

##### <a id="69ZM"></a>69ZM  Proceedings to which this Division applies

             (1)  This Division applies to proceedings that are wholly under this Part.

             (2)  This Division also applies to proceedings that are partly under this Part:

                     (a)  to the extent that they are proceedings under this Part; and

                     (b)  if the parties to the proceedings consent—to the extent that they are not proceedings under this Part.

             (3)  This Division also applies to other proceedings between the parties that involve the court exercising jurisdiction under this Act if:

                     (a)  the proceedings:

                              (i)  arise from the breakdown of the parties’ marital relationship; or

                             (ii)  are a de facto financial cause; and

                     (b)  the parties to the proceedings consent.

             (4)  Proceedings to which this Division applies are **_child‑related proceedings_**.

             (5)  Consent given for the purposes of paragraph (2)(b) or subsection (3) must be:

                     (a)  free from coercion; and

                     (b)  given in the form prescribed by the applicable Rules of Court.

             (6)  A party to proceedings may, with the leave of the court, revoke a consent given for the purposes of paragraph (2)(b) or subsection (3).

#### Subdivision B—Principles for conducting child‑related proceedings

##### <a id="69ZN"></a>69ZN  Principles for conducting child‑related proceedings

Application of the principles

             (1)  The court must give effect to the principles in this section:

                     (a)  in performing duties and exercising powers (whether under this Division or otherwise) in relation to child‑related proceedings; and

                     (b)  in making other decisions about the conduct of child‑related proceedings.

Failure to do so does not invalidate the proceedings or any order made in them.

             (2)  Regard is to be had to the principles in interpreting this Division.

Principle 1

             (3)  The first principle is that the court is to consider the needs of the child concerned and the impact that the conduct of the proceedings may have on the child in determining the conduct of the proceedings.

Principle 2

             (4)  The second principle is that the court is to actively direct, control and manage the conduct of the proceedings.

Principle 3

             (5)  The third principle is that the proceedings are to be conducted in a way that will safeguard:

                     (a)  the child concerned against family violence, child abuse and child neglect; and

                     (b)  the parties to the proceedings against family violence.

Principle 4

             (6)  The fourth principle is that the proceedings are, as far as possible, to be conducted in a way that will promote cooperative and child‑focused parenting by the parties.

Principle 5

             (7)  The fifth principle is that the proceedings are to be conducted without undue delay and with as little formality, and legal technicality and form, as possible.

##### <a id="69ZO"></a>69ZO  This Division also applies to proceedings in Chambers

                   A judge, Judicial Registrar, Registrar, Federal Magistrate or magistrate, who is hearing child‑related proceedings in Chambers, has all of the duties and powers that a court has under this Division.

Note:          An order made in Chambers has the same effect as an order made in open court.

##### <a id="69ZP"></a>69ZP  Powers under this Division may be exercised on court’s own initiative

                   The court may exercise a power under this Division:

                     (a)  on the court’s own initiative; or

                     (b)  at the request of one or more of the parties to the proceedings.

#### Subdivision C—Duties and powers related to giving effect to the principles

##### <a id="69ZQ"></a>69ZQ  General duties

             (1)  In giving effect to the principles in section 69ZN, the court must:

                     (a)  decide which of the issues in the proceedings require full investigation and hearing and which may be disposed of summarily; and

                     (b)  decide the order in which the issues are to be decided; and

                     (c)  give directions or make orders about the timing of steps that are to be taken in the proceedings; and

                     (d)  in deciding whether a particular step is to be taken—consider whether the likely benefits of taking the step justify the costs of taking it; and

                     (e)  make appropriate use of technology; and

                      (f)  if the court considers it appropriate—encourage the parties to use family dispute resolution or family counselling; and

                     (g)  deal with as many aspects of the matter as it can on a single occasion; and

                     (h)  deal with the matter, where appropriate, without requiring the parties’ physical attendance at court.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not limit subsection 69ZN(1).

             (3)  A failure to comply with subsection (1) does not invalidate an order.

##### <a id="69ZR"></a>69ZR  Power to make determinations, findings and orders at any stage of proceedings

             (1)  If, at any time after the commencement of child‑related proceedings and before making final orders, the court considers that it may assist in the determination of the dispute between the parties, the court may do any or all of the following:

                     (a)  make a finding of fact in relation to the proceedings;

                     (b)  determine a matter arising out of the proceedings;

                     (c)  make an order in relation to an issue arising out of the proceedings.

Note:          For example, the court may choose to use this power if the court considers that making a finding of fact at a particular point in the proceedings will help to focus the proceedings.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not prevent the court doing something mentioned in paragraph (1)(a), (b) or (c) at the same time as making final orders.

             (3)  To avoid doubt, a judge, Judicial Registrar, Registrar, Federal Magistrate or magistrate who exercises a power under subsection (1) in relation to proceedings is not, merely because of having exercised the power, required to disqualify himself or herself from a further hearing of the proceedings.

##### <a id="69ZS"></a>69ZS  Use of family consultants

                   At any time during child‑related proceedings, the court may designate a family consultant as the family consultant in relation to the proceedings.

Note 1:       Family consultants have the functions described in section 11A. These include assisting and advising people involved in proceedings, and this assistance and advice may involve helping people to better understand the effect of things on the child concerned. Family consultants can also inform people about other services available to help them.

Note 2:       The court may also order parties to proceedings to attend, or arrange for a child to attend, appointments with a family consultant. See section 11F.

#### Subdivision D—Matters relating to evidence

##### <a id="69ZT"></a>69ZT  Rules of evidence not to apply unless court decides

             (1)  These provisions of the _Evidence Act 1995_ do not apply to child‑related proceedings:

                     (a)  Divisions 3, 4 and 5 of Part 2.1 (which deal with general rules about giving evidence, examination in chief, re‑examination and cross‑examination), other than sections 26, 30, 36 and 41;

Note:       Section 26 is about the court’s control over questioning of witnesses. Section 30 is about interpreters. Section 36 relates to examination of a person without subpoena or other process. Section 41 is about improper questions.

                     (b)  Parts 2.2 and 2.3 (which deal with documents and other evidence including demonstrations, experiments and inspections);

                     (c)  Parts 3.2 to 3.8 (which deal with hearsay, opinion, admissions, evidence of judgments and convictions, tendency and coincidence, credibility and character).

             (2)  The court may give such weight (if any) as it thinks fit to evidence admitted as a consequence of a provision of the _Evidence Act 1995_ not applying because of subsection (1).

             (3)  Despite subsection (1), the court may decide to apply one or more of the provisions of a Division or Part mentioned in that subsection to an issue in the proceedings, if:

                     (a)  the court is satisfied that the circumstances are exceptional; and

                     (b)  the court has taken into account (in addition to any other matters the court thinks relevant):

                              (i)  the importance of the evidence in the proceedings; and

                             (ii)  the nature of the subject matter of the proceedings; and

                            (iii)  the probative value of the evidence; and

                            (iv)  the powers of the court (if any) to adjourn the hearing, to make another order or to give a direction in relation to the evidence.

             (4)  If the court decides to apply a provision of a Division or Part mentioned in subsection (1) to an issue in the proceedings, the court may give such weight (if any) as it thinks fit to evidence admitted as a consequence of the provision applying.

             (5)  Subsection (1) does not revive the operation of:

                     (a)  a rule of common law; or

                     (b)  a law of a State or a Territory;

that, but for subsection (1), would have been prevented from operating because of a provision of a Division or Part mentioned in that subsection.

##### <a id="69ZV"></a>69ZV  Evidence of children

             (1)  This section applies if the court applies the law against hearsay under subsection 69ZT(2) to child‑related proceedings.

             (2)  Evidence of a representation made by a child about a matter that is relevant to the welfare of the child or another child, which would not otherwise be admissible as evidence because of the law against hearsay, is not inadmissible in the proceedings solely because of the law against hearsay.

             (3)  The court may give such weight (if any) as it thinks fit to evidence admitted under subsection (2).

             (4)  This section applies despite any other Act or rule of law.

             (5)  In this section:

                    <a name="child"></a>**_child_** means a person under 18.

                    <a name="represent"></a>**_representation_** includes an express or implied representation, whether oral or in writing, and a representation inferred from conduct.

##### <a id="69ZW"></a>69ZW  Evidence relating to child abuse or family violence

             (1)  The court may make an order in child‑related proceedings requiring a prescribed State or Territory agency to provide the court with the documents or information specified in the order.

             (2)  The documents or information specified in the order must be documents recording, or information about, one or more of these:

                     (a)  any notifications to the agency of suspected abuse of a child to whom the proceedings relate or of suspected family violence affecting the child;

                     (b)  any assessments by the agency of investigations into a notification of that kind or the findings or outcomes of those investigations;

                     (c)  any reports commissioned by the agency in the course of investigating a notification.

             (3)  Nothing in the order is to be taken to require the agency to provide the court with:

                     (a)  documents or information not in the possession or control of the agency; or

                     (b)  documents or information that include the identity of the person who made a notification.

             (4)  A law of a State or Territory has no effect to the extent that it would, apart from this subsection, hinder or prevent an agency complying with the order.

             (5)  The court must admit into evidence any documents or information, provided in response to the order, on which the court intends to rely.

             (6)  Despite subsection (5), the court must not disclose the identity of the person who made a notification, or information that could identify that person, unless:

                     (a)  the person consents to the disclosure; or

                     (b)  the court is satisfied that the identity or information is critically important to the proceedings and that failure to make the disclosure would prejudice the proper administration of justice.

             (7)  Before making a disclosure for the reasons in paragraph (6)(b), the court must ensure that the agency that provided the identity or information:

                     (a)  is notified about the intended disclosure; and

                     (b)  is given an opportunity to respond.

##### <a id="69ZX"></a>69ZX  Court’s general duties and powers relating to evidence

             (1)  In giving effect to the principles in section 69ZN, the court may:

                     (a)  give directions or make orders about the matters in relation to which the parties are to present evidence; and

                     (b)  give directions or make orders about who is to give evidence in relation to each remaining issue; and

                      (f)  that particular evidence is to be given by affidavit; or

                     (g)  that evidence in relation to a particular matter not be presented by a party; or

                      (i)  limiting, or not allowing, cross‑examination of a particular witness; or

                      (j)  limiting the number of witnesses who are to give evidence in the proceedings.

             (3)  The court may, in child‑related proceedings:

                     (a)  receive into evidence the transcript of evidence in any other proceedings before:

                              (i)  the court; or

                             (ii)  another court; or

                            (iii)  a tribunal;

                            and draw any conclusions of fact from that transcript that it thinks proper; and

                     (b)  adopt any recommendation, finding, decision or judgment of any court, person or body of a kind mentioned in any of subparagraphs (a)(i) to (iii).

Note:          This subsection may be particularly relevant for Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander children.

                     (a)  subsection 126H(1) of the _Evidence Act 1995_ does not apply in relation to information that would:

                              (i)  reveal the identity of a journalist’s source; or

                             (ii)  enable that identity to be discovered;

                            if the court considers that it is in the best interests of the child for the information to be disclosed; and

                     (b)  the court must not direct, under a law of a State or Territory relating to professional confidential relationship privilege specified in the regulations, that evidence not be adduced if the court considers that adducing the evidence would be in the best interests of the child.

##### <a id="70J"></a>70J  Effect of registration on exercise of jurisdiction

             (1)  A court in Australia that is aware that an overseas child order is registered under section 70G must not exercise jurisdiction in proceedings for the making of a Subdivision C parenting order in relation to the child concerned unless:

                     (a)  each person:

                              (i)  with whom the child is supposed to live; or

                     (b)  the court is satisfied that there are substantial grounds for believing that the child’s welfare requires that the court exercise jurisdiction in the proceedings.

             (2)  If a court exercises jurisdiction in proceedings for a Subdivision C parenting order in relation to a child who is the subject of an overseas child order, the court must not make a Subdivision C parenting order in relation to the child unless it is satisfied:

                     (a)  that the welfare of the child is likely to be adversely affected if the order is not made; or

                     (b)  that there has been such a change in the circumstances of the child since the making of the overseas child order that the Subdivision C parenting order ought to be made.

##### <a id="70K"></a>70K  Cancellation of registration if Subdivision C parenting order made

                   If a court:

                     (a)  is aware that an overseas child order is registered under section 70G; and

##### <a id="70L"></a>70L  Relationship between Australian orders and registered overseas child orders

             (1)  In this section:

                    <a name="australian-child-order"></a>**_Australian child order_** means:

                     (a)  a Subdivision C parenting order; or

                     (b)  a State child order.

                    <a name="respons-person"></a>**_responsible person_**, in relation to an Australian child order or an overseas child order, means a person:

                     (a)  with whom the child is supposed to live under the order; or

                    (aa)  whom the child is supposed to spend time with under the order; or

                   (ab)  whom the child is supposed to have contact with under the order; or

                     (b)  who is responsible for the child’s day‑to‑day care, welfare and development under the order; or

                     (c)  who has a right to custody of, or access to, the child under the order.

             (2)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  an Australian child order, whether made under this Part or another law, is in force under this Part in relation to a child; and

                     (b)  an overseas child order, other than an excluded order, that relates to the child but that has a different effect from the Australian order has been registered under section 70G (whether before or after the making of the Australian child order) and its registration has not been cancelled.

             (3)  A responsible person under the overseas child order may apply to a court having jurisdiction under this Part for the discharge of the Australian child order.

             (4)  A responsible person under the Australian child order may apply to a court having jurisdiction under this Part for the cancellation of the registration of the overseas child order.

             (5)  If an application is made under subsection (3) or (4), the court must:

                     (b)  in any other case—discharge the Australian child order.

             (6)  For the purposes of paragraph (5)(a), the conditions are:

                     (a)  each responsible person under the overseas child order consents to the cancellation of the registration of the order; or

                     (b)  the court is satisfied that there are substantial grounds for believing that the child’s welfare will be adversely affected if the overseas child order continues to operate in relation to the child; or

                     (c)  the court is satisfied that there has been a change in the circumstances of the child since the overseas child order was made that makes it inappropriate for the order to continue to operate in relation to the child.

#### Subdivision D—Transmission of Australian orders to overseas jurisdictions

##### <a id="70M"></a>70M  Registrar to send documents etc. to overseas jurisdiction

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a court in Australia makes, in relation to a child who is under 18:

                              (i)  a parenting order, other than a child maintenance order; or

                             (ii)  a State child order; and

                     (b)  the order is enforceable in a prescribed overseas jurisdiction under provisions corresponding to Subdivision C.

          (1A)  This section also applies if:

                     (a)  a court in Australia makes, in relation to a child who is under 18, an order under regulations made for the purposes of section 111B; and

                     (b)  a person who has a right to custody of, or of access to, the child under the order.

             (4)  The Registry Manager of the court must comply with a request under subsection (2).

##### <a id="70N"></a>70N  Regulations may deal with sending Australian orders etc. to overseas jurisdiction

             (1)  The regulations may make provision for and in relation to the sending to a prescribed overseas jurisdiction of copies of, and documents relating to:

                     (a)  a parenting order, other than a child maintenance order; or

                     (b)  a State child order;

that relates to a child to whom an overseas child order relates.

             (2)  The regulations may make provision for and in relation to the sending to a convention country (within the meaning of the regulations made for the purposes of section 111B) of copies of, and documents relating to, an order under regulations made for the purposes of that section, that relates to a child to whom an overseas child order relates.

### Division 13A—Consequences of failure to comply with orders, and other obligations, that affect children

#### Subdivision A—Preliminary

##### <a id="70NAA"></a>70NAA  Simplified outline of Division

             (1)  This Division deals with the powers that a court with jurisdiction under this Act has to make orders to enforce compliance with orders under this Act affecting children.

             (2)  The court always has the power to vary the order under Subdivision B. In doing so, the court will have regard to any parenting plan that has been entered into since the order was made (see section 70NBB).

             (3)  The other orders that the court can make depend on whether:

                     (a)  a contravention is alleged to have occurred but is not established (Subdivision C); or

                     (b)  the court finds that a contravention has occurred but there is a reasonable excuse for the contravention (Subdivision D); or

                     (c)  the court finds that there was a contravention and there is no reasonable excuse for the contravention (Subdivision E for less serious contraventions and Subdivision F for more serious contraventions).

##### <a id="70NAB"></a>70NAB  Application of Division

                   Despite anything contained in any other provision of this Division, this Division does not apply in respect of a contravention, committed before this Division commences, of an order under this Act affecting children if a court made an order, in respect of that contravention before this Division commences, under this Act as previously in force.

##### <a id="70NAC"></a>70NAC  Meaning of _contravened_ an order

                   A person is taken for the purposes of this Division to have **_contravened_** an order under this Act affecting children if, and only if:

                     (a)  where the person is bound by the order—he or she has:

                              (i)  intentionally failed to comply with the order; or

                             (ii)  made no reasonable attempt to comply with the order; or

                     (b)  otherwise—he or she has:

                              (i)  intentionally prevented compliance with the order by a person who is bound by it; or

                             (ii)  aided or abetted a contravention of the order by a person who is bound by it.

Note:          Parenting orders may be subject to any subsequent parenting plan (see section 64D). This means that an action that would otherwise contravene a parenting order may not be a contravention, because of a subsequent inconsistent parenting plan. Whether this is the case or not depends on the terms of the parenting order.

##### <a id="70NAD"></a>70NAD  Requirements taken to be included in certain orders

                   For the purposes of this Division:

                     (a)  a parenting order that deals with whom a child is to live with is taken to include a requirement that people act in accordance with section 65M in relation to the order; and

                     (b)  a parenting order that deals with whom a child is to spend time with is taken to include a requirement that people act in accordance with section 65N in relation to the order; and

                     (c)  a parenting order that deals with whom a child is to communicate with is taken to include a requirement that people act in accordance with section 65NA in relation to the order; and

                     (d)  a parenting order to which section 65P applies is taken to include a requirement that people act in accordance with that section in relation to the order.

##### <a id="70NAE"></a>70NAE  Meaning of _reasonable excuse for contravening_ an order

             (1)  The circumstances in which a person may be taken to have had, for the purposes of this Division, a **_reasonable excuse for contravening_** an order under this Act affecting children include, but are not limited to, the circumstances set out in subsections (2), (4), (5), (6) and (7).

             (2)  A person (the **_respondent_**) is taken to have had a **_reasonable excuse for contravening_** an order under this Act affecting children if:

                     (a)  the respondent contravened the order because, or substantially because, he or she did not, at the time of the contravention, understand the obligations imposed by the order on the person who was bound by it; and

                     (b)  the court is satisfied that the respondent ought to be excused in respect of the contravention.

             (3)  If a court decides that a person had a reasonable excuse for contravening an order under this Act for the reason referred to in paragraph (2)(a), it is the duty of the court to explain to the person, in language likely to be readily understood by the person, the obligations imposed on him or her by the order and the consequences that may follow if he or she again contravenes the order.

             (4)  A person (the **_respondent_**) is taken to have had a reasonable excuse for contravening a parenting order to the extent to which it deals with whom a child is to live with in a way that resulted in the child not living with a person in whose favour the order was made if:

                     (a)  the respondent believed on reasonable grounds that the actions constituting the contravention were necessary to protect the health or safety of a person (including the respondent or the child); and

                     (b)  the period during which, because of the contravention, the child did not live with the person in whose favour the order was made was not longer than was necessary to protect the health or safety of the person referred to in paragraph (a).

             (5)  A person (the **_respondent_**) is taken to have had a reasonable excuse for contravening a parenting order to the extent to which it deals with whom a child is to spend time with in a way that resulted in a person and a child not spending time together as provided for in the order if:

                     (a)  the respondent believed on reasonable grounds that not allowing the child and the person to spend time together was necessary to protect the health or safety of a person (including the respondent or the child); and

                     (b)  the period during which, because of the contravention, the child and the person did not spend time together was not longer than was necessary to protect the health or safety of the person referred to in paragraph (a).

             (6)  A person (the **_respondent_**) is taken to have had a reasonable excuse for contravening a parenting order to the extent to which it deals with whom a child is to communicate with in a way that resulted in a person and a child not having the communication provided for under the order if:

                     (a)  the respondent believed on reasonable grounds that not allowing the child and the person to communicate together was necessary to protect the health or safety of a person (including the respondent or the child); and

                     (b)  the period during which, because of the contravention, the child and the person did not communicate was not longer than was necessary to protect the health or safety of the person referred to in paragraph (a).

             (7)  A person (the **_respondent_**) is taken to have had a reasonable excuse for contravening a parenting order to which section 65P applies by acting contrary to section 65P if:

                     (a)  the respondent believed on reasonable grounds that the action constituting the contravention was necessary to protect the health or safety of a person (including the respondent or the child); and

                     (b)  the period during which, because of that action, a person in whose favour the order was made was hindered in or prevented from discharging responsibilities under the order was not for longer than was necessary to protect the health or safety of the person referred to in paragraph (a).

##### <a id="70NAF"></a>70NAF  Standard of proof

             (1)  Subject to subsection (3), the standard of proof to be applied in determining matters in proceedings under this Division is proof on the balance of probabilities.

             (2)  Without limiting subsection (1), that subsection applies to the determination of whether a person who contravened an order under this Act affecting children had a reasonable excuse for the contravention.

             (3)  The court may only make an order under:

                    (aa)  paragraph 70NEB(1)(da); or

                   (ab)  paragraph 70NECA(3)(a); or

                     (a)  paragraph 70NFB(2)(a), (d) or (e); or

                     (b)  paragraph 70NFF(3)(a);

if the court is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the grounds for making the order exist.

#### Subdivision B—Court’s power to vary parenting order

##### <a id="70NBA"></a>70NBA  Variation of parenting order

             (1)  A court having jurisdiction under this Act may make an order varying a primary order if:

                     (a)  proceedings in relation to the primary order are brought before a court having jurisdiction under this Act; and

                     (b)  it is alleged in those proceedings that a person committed a contravention of the primary order and either:

                              (i)  the court does not find that the person committed a contravention of the primary order; or

                             (ii)  the court finds that the person committed a contravention of the primary order.

             (2)  If Subdivision F applies to the contravention, when making an order under subsection (1) varying a primary order, the court, in addition to regarding, under section 60CA, the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration, must, if any of the following considerations is relevant, take that consideration into account:

                     (a)  the person who contravened the primary order did so after having attended, after having refused or failed to attend, or after having been found to be unsuitable to take any further part in, a post‑separation parenting program or a part of such a program;

                     (b)  there was no post‑separation parenting program that the person who contravened the primary order could attend;

                     (c)  because of the behaviour of the person who contravened the primary order, it was not appropriate, in the court’s opinion, for the person to attend a post‑separation parenting program, or a part of such a program;

                     (d)  the primary order was a compensatory parenting order made under paragraph 70NEB(1)(b) or 70NFB(2)(c) after the person had contravened a previous order under this Act affecting children.

             (3)  This section does not limit the circumstances in which a court having jurisdiction under this Act may vary a primary order.

##### <a id="70NBB"></a>70NBB  Effect of parenting plan

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a parenting order has been made in relation to a child (whether before or after the commencement of this section); and

                     (b)  after the parenting order was made, the parents of the child made a parenting plan that dealt with a matter (the **_relevant matter_**) that was dealt with in the parenting order.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  section 70NBA applies to proceedings brought in relation to the parenting order in relation to the relevant matter; and

                     (b)  the parenting plan was in force when the contravention of the parenting order:

                              (i)  is alleged to have been committed; or

                             (ii)  occurred;

the court must, in exercising its powers under section 70NBA:

                     (c)  have regard to the terms of the parenting plan; and

                     (d)  consider whether to exercise its powers under section 70NBA to make an order varying the parenting order to include (with or without modification) some or all of the provisions of the parenting plan.

Note:          An action that would otherwise contravene a parenting order may not be a contravention because of a subsequent inconsistent parenting plan. Whether this is the case or not depends on the terms of the parenting order (see section 64D).

                     (b)  the current contravention resulted in a person not spending time with the child (or the child not living with a person for a particular period);

the court:

                     (c)  may make a further parenting order that compensates the person for time the person did not spend with the child (or the time the child did not live with the person) as a result of the current contravention; and

                     (d)  must consider making that kind of order.

Note:          If the person does not have a reasonable excuse for a contravention, the court has the power to make an order compensating a person for time lost under paragraph 70NEB(1)(b) or 70NFB(2)(c).

                     (b)  the court, in dealing with the current contravention, is satisfied that it is more appropriate for that contravention to be dealt with under this Subdivision.

             (4)  This Subdivision does not apply if, in circumstances mentioned in subsection (2), the court dealing with the current contravention is satisfied that the person who contravened the primary order has behaved in a way that showed a serious disregard for his or her obligations under the primary order.

##### <a id="70NEB"></a>70NEB  Powers of court

             (1)  If this Subdivision applies, the court may do any or all of the following:

                     (e)  if:

                              (i)  the current contravention is a contravention of a parenting order in relation to a child; and

             (2)  The court must not make an order under paragraph (1)(a) directed to a person other than the person who committed the current contravention unless:

                     (a)  the person brought the proceedings before the court in relation to the current contravention or is otherwise a party to those proceedings; and

                     (b)  the court is satisfied that it is appropriate to direct the order to the person because of the connection between the current contravention and the carrying out by the person of his or her parental responsibilities in relation to the child or children to whom the primary order relates.

             (3)  If the court makes an order under paragraph (1)(a), the principal executive officer of the court must ensure that the provider of the program concerned is notified of the making of the order.

                     (b)  on the most recent occasion on which the applicant brought proceedings of the kind referred to in paragraph (a), the court before which the proceedings were brought:

                              (i)  was not satisfied that the respondent had committed a contravention of the primary order or that other primary order; or

                             (ii)  was satisfied that the respondent had committed a contravention of the primary order or that other primary order but did not make an order under section 70NDB, 70NDC, 70NEB, 70NFB or 70NBA in relation to the contravention.

             (1)  If a court has made an order under paragraph 70NEB(1)(d) requiring a person to enter into a bond in accordance with section 70NEC, the following provisions have effect.

             (2)  If the court (whether or not constituted by the judge, Federal Magistrate or magistrate who required the bond to be entered into in accordance with section 70NEC) is satisfied that the person has, without reasonable excuse, failed to comply with the bond, the court may take action under subsection (3).

             (3)  The court may:

                     (a)  without prejudice to the continuance of the bond entered into in accordance with section 70NEC, impose a fine not exceeding 10 penalty units on the person; or

##### <a id="70NFC"></a>70NFC  When court is empowered to make a community service order

             (1)  Subject to this section, if, under the law of a participating State or a participating Territory, a court is empowered (whether generally or in particular cases) to make a community service order in respect of a person convicted of an offence against the law of the State or Territory, a court exercising jurisdiction in the State or Territory may, under paragraph 70NFB(2)(a) make a community service order.

             (2)  A community service order made under paragraph 70NFB(2)(a):

                     (a)  is to be such that the total number of hours during which the order regulates the conduct of the person in respect of whom it is made does not exceed the maximum period in relation to the State or Territory in which the order is made; and

                     (b)  ceases to have effect 2 years after it was made, or after such lesser period as is specified in the order.

             (3)  A community service order may be an order of any of the following kinds:

                     (a)  an order known as:

             (5)  If a court proposes to make a community service order under paragraph 70NFB(2)(a), it must, before doing so, explain to the person in respect of whom it is made, in language likely to be readily understood by the person:

                     (a)  the purpose and effect of the proposed order; and

                     (b)  the consequences that may follow if the person fails to comply with the proposed order or with any requirements made in relation to the order by or under the applied provisions; and

                     (c)  if the proposed order may be revoked or varied under the applied provisions—that the proposed order may be so revoked or varied.

             (6)  In this section:

                    <a name="maximum-period"></a>**_maximum period_**, in relation to a State or Territory, means 500 hours or such lesser period as is prescribed in relation to the State or Territory.

                    <a name="particip-state"></a>**_participating State_** means a State in relation to which an agreement under section 70NFI is in force.

##### <a id="70NFD"></a>70NFD  Variation and discharge of community service orders

                   A community service order made under paragraph 70NFB(2)(a) may be varied or discharged:

                     (a)  if the court that made the order is the Family Court or the Federal Magistrates Court—by either of those Courts; or

                     (b)  otherwise—by the court that made the order or the Family Court.

##### <a id="70NFE"></a>70NFE  Bonds

             (1)  This section provides for bonds that a court may require a person to enter into under paragraph 70NFB(2)(b).

             (2)  A bond is to be for a specified period of up to 2 years.

             (3)  A bond may be:

                     (a)  with or without surety; and

                     (b)  with or without security.

             (4)  The conditions that may be imposed on a person by a bond include (without limitation) conditions that require the person:

                     (b)  to attend family counselling; or

                     (c)  to attend family dispute resolution; or

                     (d)  to be of good behaviour.

Note:          Before imposing a condition under this subsection, the court must consider seeking the advice of a family consultant about the services appropriate to the person’s needs (see section 11E).

             (5)  If a court proposes to require a person to enter into a bond, it must, before making the requirement, explain to the person, in language likely to be readily understood by the person:

                     (a)  the purpose and effect of the proposed requirement; and

                     (b)  the consequences that may follow if the person:

                              (i)  fails to enter into the bond; or

                             (ii)  having entered into the bond—fails to act in accordance with the bond.

##### <a id="70NFF"></a>70NFF  Procedure for enforcing community service orders or bonds

             (1)  If a court makes a community service order under paragraph 70NFB(2)(a) in respect of a person, or an order under paragraph 70NFB(2)(b) requiring a person to enter into a bond in accordance with section 70NFE, the following provisions have effect.

             (2)  If the court (whether or not constituted by the judge, Federal Magistrate or magistrate who made the community service order or required the bond to be entered into in accordance with section 70NFE) is satisfied that the person has, without reasonable excuse, failed to comply with the order or bond, the court may take action under subsection (3).

             (3)  The court may:

                     (a)  without prejudice to the continuance of the community service order or the bond entered into in accordance with section 70NFE, impose a fine not exceeding 10 penalty units on the person; or

                     (b)  revoke the community service order or the bond entered into in accordance with section 70NFE and, subject to subsection (4), deal with the person, for the contravention in respect of which the community service order was made or the bond was entered into, in any manner in which the person could have been dealt with for the contravention if:

                              (i)  the community service order had not been made or the bond had not been entered into; and

                             (ii)  the person was before the court under section 70NFB in respect of the contravention.

             (4)  In dealing with the person as mentioned in paragraph (3)(b), the court must, in addition to any other matters that it considers should be taken into account, take into account:

                     (a)  the fact that the community service order was made or the bond was entered into; and

                     (b)  anything done under the community service order or pursuant to the bond; and

                     (c)  any fine imposed, and any other order made, for or in respect of the contravention.

##### <a id="70NFG"></a>70NFG  Sentences of imprisonment

             (1)  A sentence of imprisonment imposed on a person under paragraph 70NFB(2)(e) is to be expressed to be:

                     (a)  for a specified period of 12 months or less; or

                     (b)  for a period ending when the person:

                              (i)  complies with the order concerned; or

                             (ii)  has been imprisoned under the sentence for 12 months or such lesser period as is specified by the court;

                            whichever happens first.

             (2)  A court must not sentence a person to imprisonment under paragraph 70NFB(2)(e) unless the court is satisfied that, in all the circumstances of the case, it would not be appropriate for the court to deal with the contravention under any of the other paragraphs of subsection 70NFB(2).

             (3)  If a court sentences a person to imprisonment under paragraph 70NFB(2)(e), the court must:

                     (a)  state the reasons why it is satisfied as mentioned in subsection (2); and

                     (b)  cause those reasons to be entered in the records of the court.

             (4)  The failure of a court to comply with subsection (3) does not invalidate a sentence.

             (5)  A court that sentences a person to imprisonment under paragraph 70NFB(2)(e) may:

                     (a)  suspend the sentence upon the terms and conditions determined by the court; and

                     (b)  terminate a suspension made under paragraph (a).

             (6)  A court, when sentencing a person to imprisonment under paragraph 70NFB(2)(e), may, if it considers it appropriate to do so, direct that the person be released upon the person entering into a bond described in subsection (7) after he or she has served a specified part of the term of imprisonment.

             (7)  A bond for the purposes of subsection (6) is a bond (with or without surety or security) that the person will be of good behaviour for a specified period of up to 2 years.

             (8)  A court that has sentenced a person to imprisonment for a period expressed as provided by paragraph (1)(b) may order the release of the person if it is satisfied that the person will, if he or she is released, comply with the order concerned.

             (9)  To avoid doubt, the serving by a person of a period of imprisonment under a sentence imposed on the person under paragraph 70NFB(2)(e) for failure to make a payment under a child maintenance order does not affect the person’s liability to make the payment.

##### <a id="70NFH"></a>70NFH  Relationship between Subdivision and other laws

             (1)  This section applies where an act or omission by a person:

                     (a)  constitutes a contravention of an order under this Act affecting children; and

                     (b)  is also an offence against any law.

             (2)  If the person is prosecuted in respect of the offence, a court in which proceedings have been brought under section 70NFB in respect of the contravention of the order must:

                     (a)  adjourn those proceedings until the prosecution has been completed; or

                     (b)  dismiss those proceedings.

             (3)  The person may be prosecuted for, and convicted of, the offence.

             (4)  Nothing in this section renders the person liable to be punished twice in respect of the same act or omission.

##### <a id="70NFI"></a>70NFI  Arrangements with States and Territories for carrying out of sentences and orders

                   An arrangement made under section 112AN for or in relation to the carrying out of sentences imposed, or orders made, under Division 2 of Part XIIIA is taken to extend to the carrying out of sentences imposed, or orders made, under this Subdivision.

##### <a id="70NFJ"></a>70NFJ  Subdivision does not limit operation of section 105

                   Nothing in this Subdivision is intended to limit the operation of section 105.

### Division 14—Miscellaneous

##### <a id="70P"></a>70P  What this Division does

                   This Division deals with miscellaneous matters relating to children.

##### <a id="70Q"></a>70Q  Certain instruments not liable to duty

             (1)  The following instruments are not subject to any duty or charge under any law of a State or Territory or any law of the Commonwealth that applies only in relation to a Territory:

                     (a)  an instrument executed under, or for the purposes of, an order made under this Part;

                     (b)  an eligible parenting plan that confers a benefit in relation to a child, to the extent to which it confers the benefit;

                     (c)  an instrument executed under, or for the purposes of, an eligible parenting plan and that confers a benefit in relation to a child, to the extent to which it confers the benefit.

             (2)  An **_eligible parenting plan_** is a parenting plan:

                     (a)  that is a registered parenting plan within the meaning of subsection 63C(6); and

                     (b)  that is not a maintenance agreement, or, if it is a maintenance agreement, it relates to a child who is not a child of the marriage to which the maintenance agreement relates; and

                     (c)  that:

                              (i)  is made by the parties to a de facto relationship in connection with the breakdown of that relationship; or

                             (ii)  relates to a child whose parents (being parties to the plan) were neither married to each other, nor living with each other in a de facto relationship, at the time of the child’s conception.

             (3)  In this section, a reference to an instrument that **_confers a benefit in relation to a child_** includes a reference to an instrument that confers an entitlement to property in relation to a child even though the instrument also deprives the child or another person of an entitlement to other property in relation to the child.

## Part VIII—Property, spousal maintenance and maintenance agreements

##### <a id="71"></a>71  Interpretation

##### <a id="77"></a>77  Urgent spousal maintenance cases

                   Where, in proceedings with respect to the maintenance of a party to a marriage, it appears to the court that the party is in immediate need of financial assistance, but it is not practicable in the circumstances to determine immediately what order, if any, should be made, the court may order the payment, pending the disposal of the proceedings, of such periodic sum or other sums as the court considers reasonable.

##### <a id="77A"></a>77A  Specification in orders of payments etc. for spouse maintenance purposes

             (1)  Where:

                     (a)  a court makes an order under this Act (whether or not the order is made in proceedings in relation to the maintenance of a party to a marriage, is made by consent or varies an earlier order), and the order has the effect of requiring:

                              (i)  payment of a lump sum, whether in one amount or by instalments; or

                             (ii)  the transfer or settlement of property; and

the court shall:

                     (c)  express the order to be an order to which this section applies; and

                     (d)  specify the portion of the payment, or the value of the portion of the property, attributable to the provision of maintenance for the party.

             (2)  Where:

                     (a)  a court makes an order of a kind referred to in paragraph (1)(a); and

                     (b)  the order:

                              (i)  is not expressed to be an order to which this section applies; or

                             (ii)  is expressed to be an order to which this section applies, but does not comply with paragraph (1)(d);

any payment, transfer or settlement of a kind referred to in paragraph (1)(a), that the order has the effect of requiring, shall be taken not to make provision for the maintenance of a party to the relevant marriage.

##### <a id="78"></a>78  Declaration of interests in property

including:

                     (c)  an order for a settlement of property in substitution for any interest in the property; and

                     (d)  an order requiring:

                             (ii)  the relevant bankruptcy trustee (if any);

                            to make, for the benefit of either or both of the parties to the marriage or a child of the marriage, such settlement or transfer of property as the court determines.

          (1A)  An order made under subsection (1) in property settlement proceedings may, after the death of a party to the marriage, be enforced on behalf of, or against, as the case may be, the estate of the deceased party.

on such terms and conditions as it considers appropriate, for such period as it considers necessary to enable the parties to the marriage to consider the likely effects (if any) of an order under this section on the marriage or the children of the marriage, but nothing in this subsection shall be taken to limit any other power of the court to adjourn such proceedings.

          (1C)  Where the period for which a court has adjourned property settlement proceedings as provided by subsection (1B) has not expired and:

                     (a)  divorce or validity of marriage proceedings are instituted by one or both of the parties to the marriage; or

                   (ba)  the parties to the marriage have divorced under the law of an overseas country and the divorce is recognised as valid in Australia under section 104; or

                   (bb)  the marriage is annulled under the law of an overseas country and the annulment is recognised as valid in Australia under section 104; or

             (2)  The court shall not make an order under this section unless it is satisfied that, in all the circumstances, it is just and equitable to make the order.

             (4)  In considering what order (if any) should be made under this section in property settlement proceedings, the court shall take into account:

                     (a)  the financial contribution made directly or indirectly by or on behalf of a party to the marriage or a child of the marriage to the acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them, or otherwise in relation to any of that last‑mentioned property, whether or not that last‑mentioned property has, since the making of the contribution, ceased to be the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them; and

                     (b)  the contribution (other than a financial contribution) made directly or indirectly by or on behalf of a party to the marriage or a child of the marriage to the acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them, or otherwise in relation to any of that last‑mentioned property, whether or not that last‑mentioned property has, since the making of the contribution, ceased to be the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them; and

                     (c)  the contribution made by a party to the marriage to the welfare of the family constituted by the parties to the marriage and any children of the marriage, including any contribution made in the capacity of homemaker or parent; and

                     (d)  the effect of any proposed order upon the earning capacity of either party to the marriage; and

                     (e)  the matters referred to in subsection 75(2) so far as they are relevant; and

             (5)  Without limiting the power of any court to grant an adjournment in proceedings under this Act, where, in property settlement proceedings, a court is of the opinion:

                     (a)  that there is likely to be a significant change in the financial circumstances of the parties to the marriage or either of them and that, having regard to the time when that change is likely to take place, it is reasonable to adjourn the proceedings; and

                     (b)  that an order that the court could make with respect to:

                              (i)  the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them; or

                             (ii)  the vested bankruptcy property in relation to a bankrupt party to the marriage;

                            if that significant change in financial circumstances occurs is more likely to do justice as between the parties to the marriage than an order that the court could make immediately with respect to:

                            (iii)  the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them; or

                            (iv)  the vested bankruptcy property in relation to a bankrupt party to the marriage;

the court may, if so requested by either party to the marriage or the relevant bankruptcy trustee (if any), adjourn the proceedings until such time, before the expiration of a period specified by the court, as that party to the marriage or the relevant bankruptcy trustee, as the case may be, applies for the proceedings to be determined, but nothing in this subsection requires the court to adjourn any proceedings in any particular circumstances.

             (6)  Where a court proposes to adjourn proceedings as provided by subsection (5), the court may, before so adjourning the proceedings, make such interim order or orders or such other order or orders (if any) as it considers appropriate with respect to:

                     (a)  any of the property of the parties to the marriage or of either of them; or

                     (b)  any of the vested bankruptcy property in relation to a bankrupt party to the marriage.

             (7)  The court may, in forming an opinion for the purposes of subsection (5) as to whether there is likely to be a significant change in the financial circumstances of either or both of the parties to the marriage, have regard to any change in the financial circumstances of a party to the marriage that may occur by reason that the party to the marriage:

                     (a)  is a contributor to a superannuation fund or scheme, or participates in any scheme or arrangement that is in the nature of a superannuation scheme; or

                     (b)  may become entitled to property as the result of the exercise in his or her favour, by the trustee of a discretionary trust, of a power to distribute trust property;

but nothing in this subsection shall be taken to limit the circumstances in which the court may form the opinion that there is likely to be a significant change in the financial circumstances of a party to the marriage.

             (8)  Where, before property settlement proceedings are completed, a party to the marriage dies:

                     (a)  the proceedings may be continued by or against, as the case may be, the legal personal representative of the deceased party and the applicable Rules of Court may make provision in relation to the substitution of the legal personal representative as a party to the proceedings;

                     (b)  if the court is of the opinion:

                              (i)  that it would have made an order with respect to property if the deceased party had not died; and

                             (ii)  that it is still appropriate to make an order with respect to property;

                            the court may make such order as it considers appropriate with respect to:

                            (iii)  any of the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them; or

                            (iv)  any of the vested bankruptcy property in relation to a bankrupt party to the marriage; and

                     (c)  an order made by the court pursuant to paragraph (b) may be enforced on behalf of, or against, as the case may be, the estate of the deceased party.

             (9)  The Family Court, or a Family Court of a State, shall not make an order under this section in property settlement proceedings (other than an order until further order or an order made with the consent of all the parties to the proceedings) unless:

                     (a)  the parties to the proceedings have attended a conference in relation to the matter to which the proceedings relate with a Registrar or Deputy Registrar of the Family Court, or a Registrar or Deputy Registrar of the Family Court of that State, as the case may be;

                     (b)  the court is satisfied that, having regard to the need to make an order urgently, or to any other special circumstance, it is appropriate to make the order notwithstanding that the parties to the proceedings have not attended a conference as mentioned in paragraph (a); or

                     (c)  the court is satisfied that it is not practicable to require the parties to the proceedings to attend a conference as mentioned in paragraph (a).

             (2)  The making of an order of a kind referred to in paragraph (1)(ba), or of any other order under this Part, in relation to the maintenance of a party to a marriage does not prevent a court from making a subsequent order in relation to the maintenance of the party.

             (3)  The applicable Rules of Court may make provision with respect to the making of orders under this Part in relation to the maintenance of parties to marriages (whether as to their form or otherwise) for the purpose of facilitating their enforcement and the collection of maintenance payable under them.

##### <a id="81"></a>81  Duty of court to end financial relations

                   In proceedings under this Part, other than proceedings under section 78 or proceedings with respect to maintenance payable during the subsistence of a marriage, the court shall, as far as practicable, make such orders as will finally determine the financial relationships between the parties to the marriage and avoid further proceedings between them.

##### <a id="82"></a>82  Cessation of spousal maintenance orders

             (1)  An order with respect to the maintenance of a party to a marriage ceases to have effect upon the death of the party.

             (2)  Subject to subsection (3), an order with respect to the maintenance of a party to a marriage ceases to have effect upon the death of the person liable to make payments under the order.

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not apply in relation to an order made before the date of commencement of section 38 of the _Family Law Amendment Act 1983_ if the order is expressed to continue in force throughout the life of the person for whose benefit the order was made or for a period that had not expired at the time of the death of the person liable to make payments under the order and, in that case, the order is binding upon the legal personal representative of the deceased person.

             (4)  An order with respect to the maintenance of a party to a marriage ceases to have effect upon the re‑marriage of the party unless in special circumstances a court having jurisdiction under this Act otherwise orders.

             (6)  Where a re‑marriage referred to in subsection (4) takes place, it is the duty of the person for whose benefit the order was made to inform without delay the person liable to make payments under the order of the date of the re‑marriage.

             (7)  Any moneys paid in respect of a period after the event referred to in subsection (4) may be recovered in a court having jurisdiction under this Act.

             (8)  Nothing in this section affects the recovery of arrears due under an order at the time when the order ceased to have effect.

##### <a id="83"></a>83  Modification of spousal maintenance orders

             (1)  If there is in force an order (whether made before or after the commencement of this Act) with respect to the maintenance of a party to a marriage:

                     (a)  made by the court; or

                     (b)  made by another court and registered in the first‑mentioned court in accordance with the applicable Rules of Court;

the court may, subject to section 111AA:

                     (c)  discharge the order if there is any just cause for so doing;

                     (d)  suspend its operation wholly or in part and either until further order or until a fixed time or the happening of some future event;

                     (e)  revive wholly or in part an order suspended under paragraph (d); or

                      (f)  subject to subsection (2), vary the order so as to increase or decrease any amount ordered to be paid or in any other manner.

          (1A)  The court’s jurisdiction under subsection (1) may be exercised:

                     (a)  in any case—in proceedings with respect to the maintenance of a party to the marriage; or

                     (b)  if there is a bankrupt party to the marriage—on the application of the bankruptcy trustee; or

                     (c)  if a party to the marriage is a debtor subject to a personal insolvency agreement—on the application of the trustee of the agreement.

             (2)  The court shall not make an order increasing or decreasing an amount ordered to be paid by an order unless it is satisfied:

                     (a)  that, since the order was made or last varied:

                              (i)  the circumstances of a person for whose benefit the order was made have so changed (including the person entering into a stable and continuing de facto relationship);

                             (ii)  the circumstances of the person liable to make payments under the order have so changed; or

                            (iii)  in the case of an order that operates in favour of, or is binding on, a legal personal representative—the circumstances of the estate are such;

                            as to justify its so doing;

                     (b)  that, since the order was made, or last varied, the cost of living has changed to such an extent as to justify its so doing;

                   (ba)  in a case where the order was made by consent—that the amount ordered to be paid is not proper or adequate;

                     (c)  that material facts were withheld from the court that made the order or from a court that varied the order or material evidence previously given before such a court was false.

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not prevent the court from making an order varying an order made before the date of commencement of this Act if the first‑mentioned order is made for the purpose of giving effect to this Part.

             (4)  In satisfying itself for the purposes of paragraph (2)(b), the court shall have regard to any changes that have occurred in the Consumer Price Index published by the Australian Statistician.

             (5)  The court shall not, in considering the variation of an order, have regard to a change in the cost of living unless at least 12 months have elapsed since the order was made or was last varied having regard to a change in the cost of living.

          (5A)  In satisfying itself for the purposes of paragraph (2)(ba), the court shall have regard to any payments, and any transfer or settlement of property, previously made by a party to the marriage, or by the bankruptcy trustee of a party to the marriage, to:

                     (a)  the other party; or

                     (b)  any other person for the benefit of the other party.

             (6)  An order decreasing the amount of a periodic sum payable under an order or discharging an order may be expressed to be retrospective to such date as the court considers appropriate.

          (6A)  Where, as provided by subsection (6), an order decreasing the amount of a periodic sum payable under an order is expressed to be retrospective to a specified date, any moneys paid under the second‑mentioned order since the specified date, being moneys that would not have been required to be paid under the second‑mentioned order as varied by the first‑mentioned order, may be recovered in a court having jurisdiction under this Act.

          (6B)  Where, as provided by subsection (6), an order discharging an order is expressed to be retrospective to a specified date, any moneys paid under the second‑mentioned order since the specified date may be recovered in a court having jurisdiction under this Act.

             (7)  For the purposes of this section, the court shall have regard to the provisions of sections 72 and 75.

             (8)  The discharge of an order does not affect the recovery of arrears due under the order at the time as at which the discharge takes effect.

##### <a id="85A"></a>85A  Ante‑nuptial and post‑nuptial settlements

             (1)  The court may, in proceedings under this Act, make such order as the court considers just and equitable with respect to the application, for the benefit of all or any of the parties to, and the children of, the marriage, of the whole or part of property dealt with by ante‑nuptial or post‑nuptial settlements made in relation to the marriage.

             (2)  In considering what order (if any) should be made under subsection (1), the court shall take into account the matters referred to in subsection 79(4) so far as they are relevant.

             (3)  A court cannot make an order under this section in respect of matters that are included in a financial agreement.

##### <a id="86A"></a>86A  Certain maintenance agreements ineffective

                   A maintenance agreement made after the commencement of this section that is not a financial agreement does not have any effect and is not enforceable in any way.

##### <a id="86"></a>86  Registered maintenance agreements

             (1)  A maintenance agreement other than an agreement to which section 87 applies may be registered, as prescribed by the applicable Rules of Court, in any court having jurisdiction under this Act.

          (1A)  A maintenance agreement made after the commencement of this subsection cannot be registered.

             (2)  Section 66S applies in relation to the variation of a maintenance agreement registered under subsection (1), in so far as the agreement makes provision for the maintenance of a child of the relevant marriage, as if the agreement were an order made by consent under Part VII by the court in which the agreement is registered.

          (2A)  Section 83 applies in relation to the variation of a maintenance agreement registered under subsection (1), in so far as the agreement makes provision for the maintenance of a party to the relevant marriage, as if the agreement were an order made by consent under this Act by the court in which the agreement is registered.

             (3)  The court in which a maintenance agreement is registered under subsection (1) may set aside the agreement if, and only if, the court is satisfied that the concurrence of a party was obtained by fraud or undue influence or that the parties desire the agreement to be set aside.

          (3A)  Where a maintenance agreement has been registered under subsection (1), then:

                     (a)  unless the agreement otherwise provides, the agreement (other than a provision in the agreement providing for the payment by way of maintenance of a periodic sum) continues to operate notwithstanding the death of a party to the agreement and operates in favour of, and is binding on, the legal personal representative of that party; and

                     (b)  if the agreement so provides, a provision in the agreement providing for the payment to a person by way of maintenance of a periodic sum continues to operate notwithstanding the death of any party to the agreement who is liable to make payments pursuant to that provision and is binding on the legal personal representative of that party but, notwithstanding any provision in the agreement, does not continue to operate after the death of the person who is entitled to receive those payments.

          (3B)  Where:

                     (a)  a maintenance agreement is, at any time, registered under subsection (1); and

                     (b)  the maintenance agreement makes provision for the maintenance of a child; and

                     (c)  an application could properly be made, at that time, under the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989_ by one of the parties to the agreement for the other party to the agreement to be assessed in respect of the costs of the child (whether or not such an application has in fact been made by the party or by another person);

the maintenance agreement, so far as it makes provision for the maintenance of the child, has no effect and is not enforceable in any way.

             (4)  Subject to section 89, this section does not apply to overseas maintenance agreements.

##### <a id="87"></a>87  Operation of maintenance agreements entered into in substitution for rights under Act

             (1)  Subject to this section, a maintenance agreement may make provision to the effect that the agreement shall operate, in relation to the financial matters dealt within the agreement, in substitution for any rights of the parties to the agreement under this Part.

          (1A)  Subsection (1) does not apply to a maintenance agreement made after the commencement of this subsection.

             (2)  Where a maintenance agreement makes provision as mentioned in subsection (1), the maintenance agreement has no effect, and is not enforceable in any way, unless it has been approved by the court.

             (3)  In proceedings for the approval of a maintenance agreement, if the court is satisfied that the provisions of the agreement with respect to financial matters are proper, the court shall, by order, approve the agreement, but if the court is not so satisfied, it shall, by order, refuse to approve the agreement.

             (4)  Where a maintenance agreement that makes provision as mentioned in subsection (1) is approved by the court:

                     (a)  any order having effect under this Part or any order made under Part VIII of the repealed Act and continued in effect by virtue of paragraph 3(2)(c) ceases to have effect in so far as it relates to the financial matters dealt with in the agreement and, whether or not the approval of the agreement is revoked, has no further effect; and

                     (b)  subject to subsections (4A) to (4C) (inclusive), no court having jurisdiction under this Act may make an order (other than an order under this section or an order in connection with the enforcement of the agreement) with respect to those financial matters unless the approval of the agreement is revoked.

          (4A)  The approval, after the commencement of this subsection, of a maintenance agreement under this section does not exclude or limit the power of a court having jurisdiction under this Act to make an order in relation to the maintenance of a party to the relevant marriage if the court is satisfied that, at the time the agreement was approved, the circumstances of the party were such that, taking into account the terms and effect of the agreement, the party would have been unable to support himself or herself without an income tested pension, allowance or benefit.

          (4B)  Where subsection (4A) applies in relation to an approved maintenance agreement, section 83 applies in relation to the variation of the agreement, in so far as the agreement makes provision for the maintenance of a party to the marriage, as if the agreement were an order made by consent under this Act by a court in which the agreement is registered or deemed to be registered.

          (4C)  The approval, whether before or after the commencement of this subsection, of a maintenance agreement under this section does not exclude or limit the power of a court having jurisdiction under Part VII to make any order under that Part in relation to a child of the relevant marriage and, where the agreement makes provision for the maintenance of a child of the marriage, section 66S applies in relation to the variation of the agreement, in so far as it makes that provision, as if the agreement were an order made by consent under that Part by a court in which the agreement is registered or deemed to be registered.

          (4D)  Where:

                     (a)  a maintenance agreement that makes provision as mentioned in subsection (1) is, at any time, approved by the court; and

                     (b)  the maintenance agreement makes provision for the maintenance of a child; and

                     (c)  an application could properly be made, at that time, under the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989_ by one of the parties to the agreement for the other party to the agreement to be assessed in respect of the costs of the child (whether or not such an application has in fact been made by the party or by another person);

the maintenance agreement, so far as it makes provision for the maintenance of the child, has no effect and is not enforceable in any way.

             (5)  Notwithstanding any rule of law or equity, an approved maintenance agreement shall not be taken to be void, voidable or unenforceable by reason that it makes provision as mentioned in subsection (1).

             (6)  Where a court has approved a maintenance agreement, the agreement shall be deemed to be registered in that court.

             (7)  An agreement that is by virtue of subsection (6) deemed to be registered in a court may be registered, as prescribed by the applicable Rules of Court, in another court having jurisdiction under this Act.

             (8)  A court may, by order, revoke the approval of a maintenance agreement under this section if, and only if, the agreement is registered or deemed to be registered in that court and the court is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the approval was obtained by fraud;

                     (b)  the parties to the agreement desire the revocation of the approval;

                     (c)  the agreement is void, voidable or unenforceable; or

                     (d)  in the circumstances that have arisen since the agreement was approved it is impracticable for the agreement to be carried out or impracticable for a part of the agreement to be carried out.

             (9)  Where the approval of a maintenance agreement under this section is revoked by a court:

                     (a)  the agreement ceases, for all purposes, to be in force; and

                     (b)  the court may, in proceedings for the revocation of the approval or on application by a party to the agreement or any other interested person, make such order or orders (including an order for the transfer of property) as it considers just and equitable for the purpose of preserving or adjusting the rights of the parties to the agreement and any other interested persons;

and, in exercising its powers under paragraph (b), the court shall have regard to the ground on which it revoked the approval of the agreement.

           (10)  Where a maintenance agreement has been approved by a court as provided by this section, then:

                     (a)  unless the agreement otherwise provides, the agreement (other than a provision in the agreement providing for the payment by way of maintenance of a periodic sum) continues to operate notwithstanding the death of a party to the agreement and operates in favour of, and is binding on, the legal personal representative of that party; and

                     (b)  if the agreement so provides, a provision in the agreement providing for the payment to a person by way of maintenance of a periodic sum continues to operate notwithstanding the death of any party to the agreement who is liable to make payments pursuant to that provision and is binding on the legal personal representative of that party but, notwithstanding any provision in the agreement, does not continue to operate after the death of the person who is entitled to receive those payments.

           (11)  Apart from the provision made by subsections (2), (4A), (4C), (5), (9) and (10), the validity, enforceability and effect of an approved maintenance agreement shall be determined by the court according to the principles of law and equity that are applicable in determining the validity, enforceability and effect of contracts and purported contracts, and, in proceedings of the kind referred to in subparagraph (ea)(iii) of the definition of**_matrimonial cause_** in subsection 4(1), being proceedings instituted in a court in which the approved maintenance agreement is registered or deemed to be registered, the court:

                     (a)  subject to paragraph (b), has the same powers, may grant the same remedies and shall have the same regard to the rights of third parties as the High Court has, may grant and is required to have in proceedings in connection with contracts or purported contracts, being proceedings in which the High Court has original jurisdiction;

                     (b)  has power to make an order for the payment, by a party to the agreement to another party to the agreement, of interest on an amount payable pursuant to the agreement, from the time when the amount became or becomes due and payable, at a rate not exceeding the rate prescribed by the Rules of the Court; and

                     (c)  in addition to, or instead of, making an order or orders pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b), may order that the agreement, or a specified part of the agreement, be enforced as if it were an order of the court.

           (12)  Where the approval of a maintenance agreement under this section has been revoked, a court shall, in considering whether, and if so, how, to exercise any powers under this Part, have regard to:

                     (a)  anything done or omitted to be done by a party to the agreement pursuant to the agreement;

                     (b)  any change in the circumstances of a party to the agreement arising out of the doing of any act by a person, or the failure of a person to do an act, pursuant to the agreement;

                     (c)  any order made by that court or another court exercising jurisdiction under this Act in connection with the agreement while the agreement was in force; and

           (15)  In this section, **_approved maintenance agreement_** means a maintenance agreement that has been approved under this section and the approval of which has not been revoked.

           (16)  Nothing in this Act affects the operation of an agreement sanctioned under paragraph 87(1)(k) of the repealed Act or the rights and obligations of a person under such an agreement.

           (17)  Subject to section 89, this section does not apply to overseas maintenance agreements.

                     (d)  an order directed to a director of a company or to a company to register a transfer of shares from one party to the marriage to the other party.

                     (b)  if the order concerns a debt of a party to the marriage—it is not foreseeable at the time that the order is made that to make the order would result in the debt not being paid in full; and

                     (c)  the third party has been accorded procedural fairness in relation to the making of the order; and

                     (d)  the court is satisfied that, in all the circumstances, it is just and equitable to make the order; and

                     (e)  the court is satisfied that the order takes into account the matters mentioned in subsection (4).

Example: The legal capacity of the third party to comply with the order could be affected by the terms of a trust deed.

             (1)  A court may make an order setting aside a financial agreement or a termination agreement if, and only if, the court is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the agreement was obtained by fraud (including non‑disclosure of a material matter); or

                    (aa)  a party to the agreement entered into the agreement:

                              (i)  for the purpose, or for purposes that included the purpose, of defrauding or defeating a creditor or creditors of the party; or

                             (ii)  with reckless disregard of the interests of a creditor or creditors of the party; or

                   (ab)  a party (the **_agreement party_**) to the agreement entered into the agreement:

                              (i)  for the purpose, or for purposes that included the purpose, of defrauding another person who is a party to a de facto relationship with a spouse party; or

                             (ii)  for the purpose, or for purposes that included the purpose, of defeating the interests of that other person in relation to any possible or pending application for an order under section 90SM, or a declaration under section 90SL, in relation to the de facto relationship; or

                            (iii)  with reckless disregard of those interests of that other person; or

                     (b)  the agreement is void, voidable or unenforceable; or

                     (c)  in the circumstances that have arisen since the agreement was made it is impracticable for the agreement or a part of the agreement to be carried out; or

                     (d)  since the making of the agreement, a material change in circumstances has occurred (being circumstances relating to the care, welfare and development of a child of the marriage) and, as a result of the change, the child or, if the applicant has caring responsibility for the child (as defined in subsection (2)), a party to the agreement will suffer hardship if the court does not set the agreement aside; or

                     (e)  in respect of the making of a financial agreement—a party to the agreement engaged in conduct that was, in all the circumstances, unconscionable; or

                      (f)  a payment flag is operating under Part VIIIB on a superannuation interest covered by the agreement and there is no reasonable likelihood that the operation of the flag will be terminated by a flag lifting agreement under that Part; or

                     (g)  the agreement covers at least one superannuation interest that is an unsplittable interest for the purposes of Part VIIIB.

          (1A)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(aa), **_creditor_**, in relation to a party to the agreement, includes a person who could reasonably have been foreseen by the party as being reasonably likely to become a creditor of the party.

             (2)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(d), a person has **_caring responsibility_** for a child if:

                     (a)  the person is a parent of the child with whom the child lives; or

                     (b)  a parenting order provides that:

                              (i)  the child is to live with the person; or

                             (ii)  the person has parental responsibility for the child.

             (3)  A court may, on an application by a person who was a party to the financial agreement that has been set aside, or by any other interested person, make such order or orders (including an order for the transfer of property) as it considers just and equitable for the purpose of preserving or adjusting the rights of persons who were parties to that financial agreement and any other interested persons.

             (4)  An order under subsection (1) or (3) may, after the death of a party to the proceedings in which the order was made, be enforced on behalf of, or against, as the case may be, the estate of the deceased party.

             (5)  If a party to proceedings under this section dies before the proceedings are completed:

                     (a)  the proceedings may be continued by or against, as the case may be, the legal personal representative of the deceased party and the applicable Rules of Court may make provision in relation to the substitution of the legal personal representative as a party to the proceedings; and

                     (b)  if the court is of the opinion:

                              (i)  that it would have exercised its powers under this section if the deceased party had not died; and

                             (ii)  that it is still appropriate to exercise those powers;

                            the court may make any order that it could have made under subsection (1) or (3); and

                     (c)  an order under paragraph (b) may be enforced on behalf of, or against, as the case may be, the estate of the deceased party.

             (6)  The court must not make an order under this section if the order would:

                     (a)  result in the acquisition of property from a person otherwise than on just terms; and

                     (b)  be invalid because of paragraph 51(xxxi) of the Constitution.

For this purpose, **_acquisition of property_** and **_just terms_** have the same meanings as in paragraph 51(xxxi) of the Constitution.

##### <a id="90KA"></a>90KA  Validity, enforceability and effect of financial agreements and termination agreements

                   The question whether a financial agreement or a termination agreement is valid, enforceable or effective is to be determined by the court according to the principles of law and equity that are applicable in determining the validity, enforceability and effect of contracts and purported contracts, and, in proceedings relating to such an agreement, the court:

                     (a)  subject to paragraph (b), has the same powers, may grant the same remedies and must have the same regard to the rights of third parties as the High Court has, may grant and is required to have in proceedings in connection with contracts or purported contracts, being proceedings in which the High Court has original jurisdiction; and

                     (b)  has power to make an order for the payment, by a party to the agreement to another party to the agreement, of interest on an amount payable under the agreement, from the time when the amount became or becomes due and payable, at a rate not exceeding the rate prescribed by the applicable Rules of Court; and

                     (c)  in addition to, or instead of, making an order or orders under paragraph (a) or (b), may order that the agreement, or a specified part of the agreement, be enforced as if it were an order of the court.

##### <a id="90L"></a>90L  Financial and other agreements etc. not liable to duty

                   None of the following is subject to any duty or charge under any law of a State or Territory or any law of the Commonwealth that applies only in relation to a Territory:

                     (b)  a termination agreement;

                     (c)  a deed or other instrument executed by a person for the purposes of, or in accordance with, an order or financial agreement made under this Part.

##### <a id="90M"></a>90M  Notification of proceeds of crime orders etc.

                              (i)  the property of the parties to a marriage or either or them; or

                             (ii)  the maintenance of a party to a marriage; and

                     (b)  the person knows that the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them is covered by:

the person must:

                     (c)  disclose in the application the proceeds of crime order or forfeiture application; and

                     (d)  give to the court a sealed copy of that order or application.

             (2)  A person who does not comply with subsection (1) commits an offence punishable, on conviction, by a fine not exceeding 50 penalty units.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  a person is a party to property settlement or spousal maintenance proceedings under this Part; and

                     (b)  the person is notified by the DPP that the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them is covered by:

                              (i)  a proceeds of crime order; or

                            (iii)  a forfeiture application;

the person must notify the Registry Manager  in writing of the proceeds of crime order or forfeiture application.

             (4)  A person who does not comply with subsection (3) commits an offence punishable, on conviction, by a fine not exceeding 50 penalty units.

##### <a id="90N"></a>90N  Court to stay property or spousal maintenance proceedings affected by proceeds of crime orders etc.

             (1)  A court in which property settlement or spousal maintenance proceedings are pending must stay those proceedings if notified under section 90M in relation to the proceedings.

          (1A)  The court may, before staying proceedings under subsection (1), invite or require the DPP to make submissions relating to staying the proceedings.

             (2)  A court must, on the application of the DPP, stay property settlement or spousal maintenance proceedings under this Part if the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them is covered by:

                     (a)  a proceeds of crime order; or

                     (b)  a forfeiture application.

             (3)  A court must notify the DPP if the court stays property settlement or spousal maintenance proceedings under subsection (1) or (2).

             (4)  The DPP must notify the Registry Manager  if:

                     (b)  if the application is successful—the resulting forfeiture order comes into force; or

                     (c)  if the application is unsuccessful—the time within which an appeal can be made has expired and any appeals have been finally determined or otherwise disposed of.

##### <a id="90P"></a>90P  Lifting a stay

             (1)  A court that stayed the property settlement or spousal maintenance proceedings under section 90N must wholly or partially lift the stay  if:

## Part VIIIAB—Financial matters relating to de facto relationships

### Division 1—Preliminary

#### Subdivision A—Meaning of key terms

##### <a id="90RA"></a>90RA  Participating jurisdictions

Participating jurisdictions

             (1)  For the purposes of this Act, the following are the **_participating jurisdictions_**:

                     (a)  each referring State;

                     (b)  each Territory.

Referring States

             (2)  A State is a **_referring State_** if:

                     (a)  the Parliament of the State has referred, or refers, to the Parliament of the Commonwealth financial matters relating to the parties to de facto relationships arising out of the breakdown of those de facto relationships; and

                     (b)  the referral of the financial matters is made:

                              (i)  for the purposes of paragraph 51(xxxvii) of the Constitution; and

                             (ii)  to the extent that the financial matters are not otherwise included in the legislative powers of the Parliament of the Commonwealth (otherwise than by a reference under paragraph 51(xxxvii) of the Constitution).

This subsection has effect subject to subsection (5).

             (3)  To avoid doubt, a State is not a **_referring State_** if its Parliament has referred, or refers, to the Parliament of the Commonwealth only a limited class of the matters referred to in paragraph (2)(a).

             (4)  A State is a **_referring State_** even if a law of the State provides that a reference to the Commonwealth Parliament described in subsection (2) is to terminate in particular circumstances.

             (5)  A State ceases to be a **_referring State_** if the State’s reference to the Commonwealth Parliament described in subsection (2) terminates.

##### <a id="90RB"></a>90RB  Meaning of _child of a de facto relationship_

                   For the purposes of this Part, a child is a **_child of a de facto relationship_** if the child is the child of both of the parties to the de facto relationship.

Note:          To determine who is a child of a person see Subdivision D of Division 1 of Part VII.

#### Subdivision B—Relationship with State and Territory laws

##### <a id="90RC"></a>90RC  Relationship with State and Territory laws

De facto financial provisions

             (1)  In this section:

                    <a name="de-facto-financi-provision"></a>**_de facto financial provisions_** means the following provisions:

                     (a)  this Part;

                     (b)  Part VIIIAA (as applied by section 90TA);

                     (c)  Part VIIIB, to the extent to which it relates to a superannuation interest to be allocated between the parties to a de facto relationship;

                     (d)  subsection 114(2A).

State and Territory laws do not apply to financial matters

             (2)  Parliament intends that the de facto financial provisions are to apply to the exclusion of any law of a State or Territory to the extent that the law:

                     (a)  deals with financial matters relating to the parties to de facto relationships arising out of the breakdown of those de facto relationships; and

                     (b)  deals with those matters by referring expressly to de facto relationships (regardless of how the State or Territory law describes those relationships).

Note 1:       If, for example, both this Part and a law of a non‑referring State deal with the distribution of property between the parties to a de facto relationship that has broken down after the commencement of this section, then the parties can only seek to distribute the property under this Part. Subsection (2) has the effect of preventing the parties from seeking to distribute the property under the State law.

Note 2:       For **_de facto relationship_**, see section 4AA.

Exception—insufficient link to a participating jurisdiction or Division 2 not applicable because of section 90SB

             (3)  Despite subsection (2), Parliament does not intend that the de facto financial provisions are to apply to the exclusion of a law of a State or Territory in relation to a financial matter relating to the parties to a de facto relationship arising out of the breakdown of the relationship if:

                     (a)  a court cannot make an order under this Part in relation to that financial matter because of section 90SB, 90SD or 90SK; and

                     (b)  there is no Part VIIIAB financial agreement that is binding on the parties dealing with that financial matter.

Example 1: Abbey and Bob are parties to a de facto relationship that has broken down, and have never been ordinarily resident in a participating jurisdiction. Subsection (3) has the effect that State law will govern financial matters arising out of the breakdown of their relationship.

Example 2: Cleo and Dan are parties to a de facto relationship that has broken down after the commencement of this section. Early in their relationship, they made a financial agreement under the law of a non‑referring State, but later spent most of their relationship in a participating jurisdiction. Cleo and Dan now have a sufficient geographical link with a participating jurisdiction for either of them to apply for an order under this Part in relation to financial matters arising out of the breakdown of their relationship. This means that subsection (3) will not apply and that their financial agreement will not be enforceable under State law because of subsection (2). However, their financial agreement will be enforceable under this Part as a Part VIIIAB financial agreement (see section 90UE).

Exception—laws facilitating this Act

             (4)  Despite subsection (2), Parliament does not intend that the de facto financial provisions are to apply to the exclusion of a law of a State or Territory to the extent that the law facilitates the operation of this Act.

Note:          This Part is not intended to apply to the exclusion of, for example, a State law that deals with superannuation entitlements by acknowledging superannuation splitting under Part VIIIB of this Act.

Exception—prescribed State or Territory laws

             (5)  Despite subsection (2), Parliament does not intend that the de facto financial provisions are to apply to the exclusion of a law of a State or Territory if the law is prescribed in regulations made for the purposes of this subsection.

#### Subdivision C—Declarations about existence of de facto relationships

##### <a id="90RD"></a>90RD  Declarations about existence of de facto relationships

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  an application is made for an order under section 90SE, 90SG or 90SM, or a declaration under section 90SL; and

                     (b)  a claim is made, in support of the application, that a de facto relationship existed between the applicant and another person;

the court may, for the purposes of those proceedings (the **_primary proceedings_**), declare that a de facto relationship existed, or never existed, between those 2 persons.

             (2)  A declaration under subsection (1) of the existence of a de facto relationship may also declare any or all of the following:

                     (a)  the period, or periods, of the de facto relationship for the purposes of paragraph 90SB(a);

                     (b)  whether there is a child of the de facto relationship;

                     (c)  whether one of the parties to the de facto relationship made substantial contributions of a kind mentioned in paragraph 90SM(4)(a), (b) or (c);

                     (d)  when the de facto relationship ended;

                     (e)  where each of the parties to the de facto relationship was ordinarily resident during the de facto relationship.

Note:          For **_child of a de facto relationship_**, see section 90RB.

##### <a id="90RE"></a>90RE  Effect of declarations

             (1)  A section 90RD declaration has effect as a judgment of the court.

             (2)  For the purposes of this Act (other than Part VII), a section 90RD declaration has effect according to its terms.

##### <a id="90RF"></a>90RF  Applying for declarations

                   Any party to the primary proceedings may apply for a section 90RD declaration.

##### <a id="90RG"></a>90RG  Geographical requirement

                   A court may make a section 90RD declaration only if the court is satisfied that a person referred to in paragraph 90RD(1)(b), or both of those persons, were ordinarily resident in a participating jurisdiction when the primary proceedings commenced.

##### <a id="90RH"></a>90RH  Setting aside declarations

             (1)  If, in the primary proceedings, a person (the **_affected person_**) affected by a section 90RD declaration made in those proceedings applies under this subsection, and the court is satisfied that:

                     (a)  a fact or circumstance has arisen that has not previously been disclosed to the court; and

                     (b)  if the affected person was a party to the primary proceedings at the time the application for the declaration was made—the fact or circumstance was not within the affected person’s knowledge at that time;

the court may do any of the following:

                     (c)  vary the declaration;

                     (d)  set the declaration aside;

                     (e)  set the declaration aside and make another section 90RD declaration in substitution for the declaration so set aside.

             (2)  The setting aside of a declaration does not affect anything done in reliance on the declaration while it remained in force.

             (3)  If the court sets aside a section 90RD declaration, the court may, on application by the affected person or any other interested person, make such order or orders (including an order for the transfer of property) as it considers just and equitable for the purpose of placing as far as practicable any person affected by the setting aside of the declaration in the same position as that person would have been in if the declaration had not been made.

### Division 2—Maintenance, declarations of property interests and alterations of property interests

#### Subdivision A—Application of Division

##### <a id="90SA"></a>90SA  This Division does not apply to certain matters covered by binding financial agreements

             (1)  This Division does not apply to any of the following matters to which a Part VIIIAB financial agreement that is binding on the parties to the agreement applies:

                     (a)  the maintenance of one of the spouse parties;

                     (b)  the property of the spouse parties or of either of them;

                     (c)  the financial resources of the spouse parties or of either of them.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to:

                     (a)  proceedings between:

                              (i)  a party to a de facto relationship; and

                             (ii)  the bankruptcy trustee of a bankrupt party to the de facto relationship;

                            with respect to the maintenance of the first‑mentioned party after the breakdown of the de facto relationship; or

                     (b)  proceedings between:

                              (i)  a party to a de facto relationship; and

                             (ii)  the bankruptcy trustee of a bankrupt party to the de facto relationship;

                            with respect to the distribution, after the breakdown of the de facto relationship, of any vested bankruptcy property in relation to the bankrupt party.

             (3)  Despite subsection (1), a party to a de facto relationship is not prevented from bringing property settlement proceedings under this Part if a Part VIIIAB financial agreement is not binding on that party.

Example:    Before Amy and Ben’s de facto relationship breaks down, Ben and Cathy make a Part VIIIAB financial agreement. Ben and Cathy’s Part VIIIAB financial agreement does not prevent Amy from bringing property settlement proceedings against Ben.

##### <a id="90SB"></a>90SB  When this Division applies—length of relationship etc.

                   A court may make an order under section 90SE, 90SG or 90SM, or a declaration under section 90SL, in relation to a de facto relationship only if the court is satisfied:

                     (a)  that the period, or the total of the periods, of the de facto relationship is at least 2 years; or

                     (b)  that there is a child of the de facto relationship; or

                     (c)  that:

                              (i)  the party to the de facto relationship who applies for the order or declaration made substantial contributions of a kind mentioned in paragraph 90SM(4)(a), (b) or (c); and

                             (ii)  a failure to make the order or declaration would result in serious injustice to the applicant; or

                     (d)  that the relationship is or was registered under a prescribed law of a State or Territory.

Note:          For **_child of a de facto relationship_**, see section 90RB.

##### <a id="90SC"></a>90SC  This Division ceases to apply in relation to a de facto relationship if the parties marry each other

             (1)  This Division (other than subsections 90SJ(2) to (5)) ceases to apply in relation to a de facto relationship if the parties to the de facto relationship later marry each other.

             (2)  Despite subsection (1), a declaration, order or injunction:

                     (a)  made in property settlement proceedings under this Division in relation to the de facto relationship; and

                     (b)  in force when the parties marry each other;

may, after the marriage, be enforced, varied or set aside in accordance with this Act.

             (3)  If a declaration, order or injunction is set aside as described in subsection (2), another declaration, order or injunction may be made under this Division in substitution for that declaration, order or injunction.

#### Subdivision B—Maintenance

##### <a id="90SD"></a>90SD  Geographical requirement

             (1)  A court may make an order under section 90SE or 90SG in relation to a de facto relationship only if the court is satisfied:

                     (a)  that either or both of the parties to the de facto relationship were ordinarily resident in a participating jurisdiction when the application for the order was made (the **_application time_**); and

                     (b)  that either:

                              (i)  both parties to the de facto relationship were ordinarily resident during at least a third of the de facto relationship; or

                             (ii)  the applicant for the order made substantial contributions, in relation to the de facto relationship, of a kind mentioned in paragraph 90SM(4)(a), (b) or (c);

                            in one or more States or Territories that are participating jurisdictions at the application time;

or that the alternative condition in subsection (1A) is met.

          (1A)  The alternative condition is that the parties to the de facto relationship were ordinarily resident in a participating jurisdiction when the relationship broke down.

             (2)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), a State need not have been a participating jurisdiction during the de facto relationship.

             (3)  If each State is a referring State, the Governor‑General may, by Proclamation, fix a day as the day on which paragraph (1)(b), and the alternative condition in subsection (1A), cease to apply in relation to new applications.

Note:          Paragraph (1)(b) and subsection (1A) will continue to apply in relation to applications made before the proclaimed day.

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  a Proclamation under subsection (3) is in force; and

                     (b)  a State ceases to be a referring State on a particular day;

the Proclamation is revoked by force of this subsection on and from that day.

             (5)  If, under subsection (4), a Proclamation under subsection (3) is revoked:

                     (a)  this section has effect as if the revoked Proclamation had not been made; but

                     (b)  the effect of the revoked Proclamation on applications made before the specified day is not affected.

##### <a id="90SE"></a>90SE  Power of court in maintenance proceedings

Note 2:       The court must be satisfied of at least one of the matters in section 90SB.

##### <a id="90SF"></a>90SF  Matters to be taken into consideration in relation to maintenance

             (1)  In exercising jurisdiction under section 90SE (after being satisfied of the matters in subsections 44(5) and (6) and sections 90SB and 90SD), the court must apply the principle that a party to a de facto relationship must maintain the other party to the de facto relationship:

                     (a)  only to the extent that the first‑mentioned party is reasonably able to do so; and

                     (b)  only if the second‑mentioned party is unable to support himself or herself adequately whether:

                              (i)  by reason of having the care and control of a child of the de facto relationship who has not attained the age of 18 years; or

                             (ii)  by reason of age or physical or mental incapacity for appropriate gainful employment; or

                            (iii)  for any other adequate reason.

Note:          For **_child of a de facto relationship_**, see section 90RB.

             (2)  In applying this principle, the court must take into account only the matters referred to in subsection (3).

             (3)  The matters to be so taken into account are:

                     (a)  the age and state of health of each of the parties to the de facto relationship (the **_subject de facto relationship_**); and

                     (b)  the income, property and financial resources of each of the parties and the physical and mental capacity of each of them for appropriate gainful employment; and

                     (c)  whether either party has the care or control of a child of the de facto relationship who has not attained the age of 18 years; and

                     (d)  commitments of each of the parties that are necessary to enable the party to support:

                              (i)  himself or herself; and

                             (ii)  a child or another person that the party has a duty to maintain; and

                     (e)  the responsibilities of either party to support any other person; and

                      (f)  subject to subsection (4), the eligibility of either party for a pension, allowance or benefit under:

                              (i)  any law of the Commonwealth, of a State or Territory or of another country; or

                             (ii)  any superannuation fund or scheme, whether the fund or scheme was established, or operates, within or outside Australia;

                            and the rate of any such pension, allowance or benefit being paid to either party; and

                     (g)  a standard of living that in all the circumstances is reasonable; and

                     (h)  the extent to which the payment of maintenance to the party whose maintenance is under consideration would increase the earning capacity of that party by enabling that party to undertake a course of education or training or to establish himself or herself in a business or otherwise to obtain an adequate income; and

                      (i)  the effect of any proposed order on the ability of a creditor of a party to recover the creditor’s debt, so far as that effect is relevant; and

                      (j)  the extent to which the party whose maintenance is under consideration has contributed to the income, earning capacity, property and financial resources of the other party; and

                     (k)  the duration of the de facto relationship and the extent to which it has affected the earning capacity of the party whose maintenance is under consideration; and

                      (l)  the need to protect a party who wishes to continue that party’s role as a parent; and

                    (m)  if either party is cohabiting with another person—the financial circumstances relating to the cohabitation; and

                     (n)  the terms of any order made or proposed to be made under section 90SM in relation to:

                              (i)  the property of the parties; or

                             (ii)  vested bankruptcy property in relation to a bankrupt party; and

                     (o)  the terms of any order or declaration made, or proposed to be made, under this Part in relation to:

                              (i)  a party to the subject de facto relationship (in relation to another de facto relationship); or

                             (ii)  a person who is a party to another de facto relationship with a party to the subject de facto relationship; or

                            (iii)  the property of a person covered by subparagraph (i) and of a person covered by subparagraph (ii), or of either of them; or

                            (iv)  vested bankruptcy property in relation to a person covered by subparagraph (i) or (ii); and

                     (p)  the terms of any order or declaration made, or proposed to be made, under Part VIII in relation to:

                              (i)  a party to the subject de facto relationship; or

                             (ii)  a person who is a party to a marriage with a party to the subject de facto relationship; or

                            (iii)  the property of a person covered by subparagraph (i) and of a person covered by subparagraph (ii), or of either of them; or

                            (iv)  vested bankruptcy property in relation to a person covered by subparagraph (i) or (ii); and

                     (q)  any child support under the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989_ that a party to the subject de facto relationship has provided, is to provide, or might be liable to provide in the future, for a child of the subject de facto relationship; and

                      (r)  any fact or circumstance which, in the opinion of the court, the justice of the case requires to be taken into account; and

                      (s)  the terms of any Part VIIIAB financial agreement that is binding on either or both of the parties to the subject de facto relationship; and

                      (t)  the terms of any financial agreement that is binding on a party to the subject de facto relationship.

             (4)  In exercising its jurisdiction under section 90SE, a court must disregard any entitlement of the party whose maintenance is under consideration to an income tested pension, allowance or benefit.

##### <a id="90SG"></a>90SG  Urgent maintenance cases

                   If, in proceedings with respect to the maintenance of a party to a de facto relationship in accordance with this Division, it appears to the court that:

                     (a)  the party is in immediate need of financial assistance; and

                     (b)  it is not practicable in the circumstances to determine immediately what order, if any, should be made;

the court may order the payment, pending the disposal of the proceedings, of such periodic sum or other sums as the court considers reasonable.

Note 1:       The geographical requirement in section 90SD must be satisfied.

Note 2:       The court must be satisfied of at least one of the matters in section 90SB.

##### <a id="90SH"></a>90SH  Specification in orders of payments etc. for maintenance purposes

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a court makes an order under this Act (whether or not the order is made in proceedings in relation to the maintenance of a party to a de facto relationship in accordance with this Division, is made by consent or varies an earlier order), and the order has the effect of requiring:

                              (i)  payment of a lump sum, whether in one amount or by instalments; or

                             (ii)  the transfer or settlement of property; and

                     (b)  the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the payment, transfer or settlement is to make provision for the maintenance of a party to a de facto relationship in relation to the breakdown of the de facto relationship;

the court must:

                     (c)  express the order to be an order to which this section applies; and

                     (d)  specify the portion of the payment, or the value of the portion of the property, attributable to the maintenance of the party.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  a court makes an order of a kind referred to in paragraph (1)(a); and

                     (b)  the order:

                              (i)  is not expressed to be an order to which this section applies; or

                             (ii)  is expressed to be an order to which this section applies, but does not comply with paragraph (1)(d);

any payment, transfer or settlement of a kind referred to in paragraph (1)(a), that the order has the effect of requiring, must be taken not to make provision for the maintenance of a party to the relevant de facto relationship.

##### <a id="90SI"></a>90SI  Modification of maintenance orders

             (1)  If there is in force an order with respect to the maintenance of a party to a de facto relationship in accordance with this Division:

                     (a)  made by the court; or

                     (b)  made by another court and registered in the first‑mentioned court in accordance with the applicable Rules of Court;

the court may:

                     (c)  discharge the order if there is any just cause for so doing; or

                     (d)  suspend its operation wholly or in part and either until further order or until a fixed time or the happening of some future event; or

                     (e)  revive wholly or in part an order suspended under paragraph (d); or

                      (f)  subject to subsection (3), vary the order so as to increase or decrease any amount ordered to be paid or in any other manner.

             (2)  The court’s jurisdiction under subsection (1) may be exercised:

                     (a)  in any case—in proceedings with respect to the maintenance of a party to the de facto relationship in accordance with this Division; or

                     (b)  if there is a bankrupt party to the de facto relationship—on the application of the bankruptcy trustee; or

                     (c)  if a party to the de facto relationship is a debtor subject to a personal insolvency agreement—on the application of the trustee of the agreement.

             (3)  The court must not make an order increasing or decreasing an amount ordered to be paid by an order unless it is satisfied:

                     (a)  that, since the order was made or last varied:

                              (i)  the circumstances of a person for whose benefit the order was made have so changed (including the person entering into a stable and continuing de facto relationship); or

                             (ii)  the circumstances of the person liable to make payments under the order have so changed; or

                            (iii)  in the case of an order that operates in favour of, or is binding on, a legal personal representative—the circumstances of the estate are such;

                            as to justify its so doing; or

                     (b)  that, since the order was made, or last varied, the cost of living has changed to such an extent as to justify its so doing; or

                     (c)  in a case where the order was made by consent—that the amount ordered to be paid is not proper or adequate; or

                     (d)  that:

                              (i)  material facts were withheld from the court that made the order, or from a court that varied the order; or

                             (ii)  material evidence previously given before such a court was false.

             (4)  In satisfying itself for the purposes of paragraph (3)(b), the court must have regard to any changes that have occurred in the Consumer Price Index published by the Australian Statistician.

             (5)  The court must not, in considering the variation of an order, have regard to a change in the cost of living unless at least 12 months have elapsed since the order was made or was last varied having regard to a change in the cost of living.

             (6)  In satisfying itself for the purposes of paragraph (3)(c), the court must have regard to any payments, and any transfer or settlement of property, previously made by a party to the de facto relationship, or by the bankruptcy trustee of a party to the de facto relationship, to:

                     (a)  the other party; or

                     (b)  any other person for the benefit of the other party.

             (7)  An order decreasing the amount of a periodic sum payable under an order or discharging an order may be expressed to be retrospective to such date as the court considers appropriate.

             (8)  If, as provided by subsection (7), an order decreasing the amount of a periodic sum payable under an order is expressed to be retrospective to a specified date, any money paid under the second‑mentioned order since the specified date, being money that would not have been required to be paid under the second‑mentioned order as varied by the first‑mentioned order, may be recovered in a court having jurisdiction under this Act.

             (9)  If, as provided by subsection (7), an order discharging an order is expressed to be retrospective to a specified date, any money paid under the second‑mentioned order since the specified date may be recovered in a court having jurisdiction under this Act.

           (10)  For the purposes of this section, the court must have regard to the provisions of section 90SF.

           (11)  The discharge of an order does not affect the recovery of arrears due under the order at the time as at which the discharge takes effect.

##### <a id="90SJ"></a>90SJ  Cessation of maintenance orders

             (1)  An order with respect to the maintenance of a party to a de facto relationship in accordance with this Division ceases to have effect upon:

                     (a)  the death of the party; or

                     (b)  the death of the person liable to make payments under the order.

             (2)  An order with respect to the maintenance of a party to a de facto relationship in accordance with this Division ceases to have effect upon the marriage of the party unless in special circumstances a court having jurisdiction under this Act otherwise orders.

             (3)  If a marriagereferred to in subsection (2) takes place, it is the duty of the person for whose benefit the order was made to inform without delay the person liable to make payments under the order of the date of the marriage.

             (4)  Any money paid in respect of a period after the event referred to in subsection (2) may be recovered in a court having jurisdiction under this Act.

             (5)  Nothing in this section affects the recovery of arrears due under an order at the time when the order ceased to have effect.

#### Subdivision C—Declarations and alterations of property interests

##### <a id="90SK"></a>90SK  Geographical requirement

             (1)  A court may make a declaration under section 90SL, or an order under section 90SM, in relation to a de facto relationship only if the court is satisfied:

                     (a)  that either or both of parties to the de facto relationship were ordinarily resident in a participating jurisdiction when the application for the declaration or order was made (the **_application time_**); and

                     (b)  that either:

                              (i)  both parties to the de facto relationship were ordinarily resident during at least a third of the de facto relationship; or

                             (ii)  the applicant for the declaration or order made substantial contributions in relation to the de facto relationship, of a kind mentioned in paragraph 90SM(4)(a), (b) or (c);

                            in one or more States or Territories that are participating jurisdictions at the application time;

or that the alternative condition in subsection (1A) is met.

          (1A)  The alternative condition is that the parties to the de facto relationship were ordinarily resident in a participating jurisdiction when the relationship broke down.

             (2)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), a State need not have been a participating jurisdiction during the de facto relationship.

             (3)  If each State is a referring State, the Governor‑General may, by Proclamation, fix a day as the day on which paragraph (1)(b), and the alternative condition in subsection (1A), cease to apply in relation to new applications.

Note:          Paragraph (1)(b) and subsection (1A) will continue to apply in relation to applications made before the proclaimed day.

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  a Proclamation under subsection (3) is in force; and

                     (b)  a State ceases to be a referring State on a particular day;

the Proclamation is revoked by force of this subsection on and from that day.

             (5)  If, under subsection (4), a Proclamation under subsection (3) is revoked:

                     (a)  this section has effect as if the revoked Proclamation had not been made; but

                     (b)  the effect of the revoked Proclamation on applications made before the specified day is not affected.

##### <a id="90SL"></a>90SL  Declaration of interests in property

             (1)  In proceedings between the parties to a de facto relationship:

                     (a)  after the breakdown of the de facto relationship; and

##### <a id="90SM"></a>90SM  Alteration of property interests

             (1)  In property settlement proceedings after the breakdown of a de facto relationship, the court may make such order as it considers appropriate:

                     (a)  in the case of proceedings with respect to the property of the parties to the de facto relationship or either of them—altering the interests of the parties to the de facto relationship in the property; or

                     (b)  in the case of proceedings with respect to the vested bankruptcy property in relation to a bankrupt party to the de facto relationship—altering the interests of the bankruptcy trustee in the vested bankruptcy property;

including:

                     (c)  an order for a settlement of property in substitution for any interest in the property; and

                     (d)  an order requiring:

                              (i)  either or both of the parties to the de facto relationship; or

                             (ii)  the relevant bankruptcy trustee (if any);

                            to make, for the benefit of either or both of the parties to the de facto relationship or a child of the de facto relationship, such settlement or transfer of property as the court determines.

Note 1:       The geographical requirement in section 90SK must be satisfied.

Note 2:       The court must be satisfied of at least one of the matters in section 90SB.

Note 3:       For **_child of a de facto relationship_**, see section 90RB.

             (2)  If a party to the de facto relationship dies after the breakdown of the de facto relationship, an order made under subsection (1) in property settlement proceedings may be enforced on behalf of, or against, as the case may be, the estate of the deceased party.

             (3)  The court must not make an order under this section unless it is satisfied that, in all the circumstances, it is just and equitable to make the order.

             (4)  In considering what order (if any) should be made under this section in property settlement proceedings, the court must take into account:

                     (a)  the financial contribution made directly or indirectly by or on behalf of a party to the de facto relationship, or a child of the de facto relationship:

                              (i)  to the acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property of the parties to the de facto relationship or either of them; or

                             (ii)  otherwise in relation to any of that last‑mentioned property;

                            whether or not that last‑mentioned property has, since the making of the contribution, ceased to be the property of the parties to the de facto relationship or either of them; and

                     (b)  the contribution (other than a financial contribution) made directly or indirectly by or on behalf of a party to the de facto relationship, or a child of the de facto relationship:

                              (i)  to the acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property of the parties to the de facto relationship or either of them; or

                             (ii)  otherwise in relation to any of that last‑mentioned property;

                            whether or not that last‑mentioned property has, since the making of the contribution, ceased to be the property of the parties to the de facto relationship or either of them; and

                     (c)  the contribution made by a party to the de facto relationship to the welfare of the family constituted by the parties to the de facto relationship and any children of the de facto relationship, including any contribution made in the capacity of homemaker or parent; and

                     (d)  the effect of any proposed order upon the earning capacity of either party to the de facto relationship; and

                     (e)  the matters referred to in subsection 90SF(3) so far as they are relevant; and

                      (f)  any other order made under this Act affecting a party to the de facto relationship or a child of the de facto relationship; and

                     (g)  any child support under the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989_ that a party to the de facto relationship has provided, is to provide, or might be liable to provide in the future, for a child of the de facto relationship.

             (5)  Without limiting the power of any court to grant an adjournment in proceedings under this Act, if, in property settlement proceedings in relation to the parties to a de facto relationship, a court is of the opinion:

                     (a)  that there is likely to be a significant change in the financial circumstances of the parties to the de facto relationship or either of them and that, having regard to the time when that change is likely to take place, it is reasonable to adjourn the proceedings; and

                     (b)  that an order that the court could make with respect to:

                              (i)  the property of the parties to the de facto relationship or either of them; or

                             (ii)  the vested bankruptcy property in relation to a bankrupt de facto party to the de facto relationship;

                            if that significant change in financial circumstances occurs is more likely to do justice as between the parties to the de facto relationship than an order that the court could make immediately with respect to:

                            (iii)  the property of the parties to the de facto relationship or either of them; or

                            (iv)  the vested bankruptcy property in relation to a bankrupt party to the de facto relationship;

the court may, if so requested by either party to the de facto relationship or the relevant bankruptcy trustee (if any), adjourn the proceedings until such time, before the expiration of a period specified by the court, as that party to the de facto relationship or the relevant bankruptcy trustee, as the case may be, applies for the proceedings to be determined, but nothing in this subsection requires the court to adjourn any proceedings in any particular circumstances.

             (6)  If a court proposes to adjourn proceedings as provided by subsection (5), the court may, before so adjourning the proceedings, make such interim order or orders or such other order or orders (if any) as it considers appropriate with respect to:

                     (a)  any of the property of the parties to the de facto relationship or of either of them; or

                     (b)  any of the vested bankruptcy property in relation to a bankrupt party to the de facto relationship.

             (7)  The court may, in forming an opinion for the purposes of subsection (5) as to whether there is likely to be a significant change in the financial circumstances of either or both of the parties to the de facto relationship, have regard to any change in the financial circumstances of a party to the de facto relationship that may occur by reason that the party to the de facto relationship:

                     (a)  is a contributor to a superannuation fund or scheme, or participates in any scheme or arrangement that is in the nature of a superannuation scheme; or

                     (b)  may become entitled to property as the result of the exercise in his or her favour, by the trustee of a discretionary trust, of a power to distribute trust property;

                             (ii)  that it is still appropriate to make an order with respect to property;

                            the court may make such order as it considers appropriate with respect to:

                     (b)  the court is satisfied that, having regard to the need to make an order urgently, or to any other special circumstance, it is appropriate to make the order notwithstanding that the parties to the proceedings have not attended a conference as mentioned in paragraph (a); or

##### <a id="90UE"></a>90UE  Agreements made in non‑referring States that become Part VIIIAB financial agreements

How State agreements can become Part VIIIAB financial agreements

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  2 people (the **_couple_**) have made a written agreement, signed by both of them, with respect to any of the matters (the **_eligible_** **_agreed matters_**) mentioned in subsection (3); and

                     (b)  the agreement was made under a non‑referring State de facto financial law; and

                     (c)  either:

                              (i)  a court could not, because of that law, make an order under that law that is inconsistent with the agreement with respect to any of the eligible agreed matters; or

                             (ii)  a court could not, because of that law, make an order under that law that is with respect to any of the eligible agreed matters to which the agreement applies; and

                     (d)  at the time the agreement was made, the members of the couple were not the spouse parties to any Part VIIIAB financial agreement that is binding on them with respect to any of the eligible agreed matters; and

                     (e)  at a later time (the **_transition time_**), the couple’s circumstances change so that:

                              (i)  if the de facto relationship has not broken down—sections 90SB, 90SD and 90SK would not prevent a court from making an order or declaration under this Part in relation to the eligible agreed matters if the de facto relationship were to break down; or

                             (ii)  if the de facto relationship has broken down—sections 90SB, 90SD and 90SK do not prevent a court from making an order or declaration under this Part in relation to the eligible agreed matters; and

                      (f)  immediately before the transition time:

                              (i)  the agreement was in force under the non‑referring State de facto financial law; and

                             (ii)  the couple were not married to each other.

Paragraph (a) extends to agreements made before the commencement of this section, and to agreements made with one or more other people.

Note 1:       This section extends to agreements made in contemplation of a de facto relationship, during a de facto relationship or after a de facto relationship has broken down.

Note 2:       Part 2 of Schedule 1 to the _Family Law Amendment (De Facto Financial Matters and Other Measures) Act 2008_ deems certain agreements, made under a law of a State that is or becomes a participating jurisdiction, or made under a law of a Territory, to be Part VIIIAB financial agreements.

             (2)  For the purposes of this Act, the agreement is taken, on and after the transition time, to be a **_Part VIIIAB financial agreement_** to the extent that the agreement deals with:

                     (a)  the eligible agreed matters; and

                     (b)  matters incidental or ancillary to the eligible agreed matters.

Note:          This means that, after the transition time, the agreement can only be enforced, varied, terminated or otherwise set aside under this Act.

Eligible agreed matters

             (3)  The matters referred to in paragraph (1)(a) are the following:

                     (a)  how all or any of the:

                              (i)  property; or

                             (ii)  financial resources;

                            of either member, or both members, of the couple at the time when the agreement is made, or at a later time and during a de facto relationship between them, is to be distributed;

                     (b)  the maintenance of either member of the couple;

in the event of the breakdown of a de facto relationship between them, or in relation to a de facto relationship between them that has broken down, as the case requires.

             (4)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(c), disregard whether the non‑referring State de facto financial law permits the court to make such an order if the court varies or sets aside the agreement.

##### <a id="90UF"></a>90UF  Need for separation declaration for certain provisions of financial agreement to take effect

             (1)  A Part VIIIAB financial agreement that is binding on the parties to the agreement, to the extent to which it deals with how, in the event of the breakdown of the de facto relationship, all or any of the property or financial resources of either or both of the spouse parties:

                     (a)  at the time when the agreement is made; or

                     (b)  at a later time and during the de facto relationship;

are to be dealt with, is of no force or effect until a separation declaration is made.

Note:          Before the separation declaration is made, the financial agreement will be of force and effect in relation to the other matters it deals with (except for any matters covered by section 90UG).

             (2)  Subsection (1) ceases to apply if either or both of the spouse parties die.

Note:          This means the financial agreement will be of force and effect in relation to the matters mentioned in subsection (1) from the time of the death(s).

Requirements for a valid separation declaration

             (3)  A separation declaration is a written declaration that complies with subsections (4) and (5), and may be included in the Part VIIIAB financial agreement to which it relates.

             (4)  The declaration must be signed by at least one of the spouse parties to the Part VIIIAB financial agreement.

             (5)  The declaration must state that:

                     (a)  the spouse parties lived in a de facto relationship; and

                     (b)  the spouse parties have separated and are living separately and apart at the declaration time; and

                     (c)  in the opinion of the spouse parties making the declaration, there is no reasonable likelihood of cohabitation being resumed.

Meaning of **declaration time**

             (6)  In this section:

                    <a name="declar-time"></a>**_declaration time_** means the time when the declaration was signed by a spouse party to the Part VIIIAB financial agreement.

##### <a id="90UG"></a>90UG  Whether or when certain other provisions of financial agreements take effect

                   A Part VIIIAB financial agreement that is binding on the parties to the agreement, to the extent to which it provides for matters covered by subsection 90UB(3) or 90UC(3) or paragraph 90UE(2)(b), is of no force or effect unless and until the de facto relationship breaks down.

##### <a id="90UH"></a>90UH  Requirements with respect to provisions in financial agreements relating to the maintenance of a party or a child or children

             (1)  A provision of a Part VIIIAB financial agreement that relates to the maintenance of a spouse party to the agreement or a child or children is void unless the provision specifies:

                     (a)  the party, or the child or children, for whose maintenance provision is made; and

                     (b)  the amount provided for, or the value of the portion of the relevant property attributable to, the maintenance of the party, or of the child or each child, as the case may be.

Note:          While Part VIIIAB financial agreements are not made with respect to child maintenance, provisions about child maintenance could be included in the same document for child support (or other non‑Part VIIIAB) purposes.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to a Part VIIIAB financial agreement covered by section 90UE.

##### <a id="90UI"></a>90UI  Certain provisions in financial agreements

             (1)  No provision of a Part VIIIAB financial agreement excludes or limits the power of a court to make an order under Division 2 in relation to the maintenance of a party to the agreement if subsection (2) applies.

             (2)  This subsection applies if the court is satisfied that, when the agreement came into effect, the circumstances of the party were such that, taking into account the terms and effect of the agreement, the party was unable to support himself or herself without an income tested pension, allowance or benefit.

             (3)  To avoid doubt, a provision in a Part VIIIAB financial agreement:

                     (a)  made as mentioned in subsection 90UB(1), 90UC(1) or 90UD(1); or

                     (b)  covered by section 90UE;

that provides for property or financial resources owned by a spouse party to the agreement to continue in the ownership of that party is taken, for the purposes of that subsection or section, to be a provision with respect to how the property or financial resources are to be distributed.

##### <a id="90UJ"></a>90UJ  When financial agreements are binding

             (1)  Subject to subsection (1A), a Part VIIIAB financial agreement (other than an agreement covered by section 90UE) is binding on the parties to the agreement if, and only if:

                     (a)  the agreement is signed by all parties; and

                     (b)  before signing the agreement, each spouse party was provided with independent legal advice from a legal practitioner about the effect of the agreement on the rights of that party and about the advantages and disadvantages, at the time that the advice was provided, to that party of making the agreement; and

                     (c)  either before or after signing the agreement, each spouse party was provided with a signed statement by the legal practitioner stating that the advice referred to in paragraph (b) was provided to that party (whether or not the statement is annexed to the agreement); and

                    (ca)  a copy of the statement referred to in paragraph (c) that was provided to a spouse party is given to the other spouse party or to a legal practitioner for the other spouse party; and

                     (d)  the agreement has not been terminated and has not been set aside by a court.

Note:          For the manner in which the contents of a financial agreement may be proved, see section 48 of the _Evidence Act 1995_.

          (1A)  A Part VIIIAB financial agreement (other than an agreement covered by section 90UE) is binding on the parties to the agreement if:

                     (a)  the agreement is signed by all parties; and

                     (b)  one or more of paragraphs (1)(b), (c) and (ca) are not satisfied in relation to the agreement; and

                     (c)  a court is satisfied that it would be unjust and inequitable if the agreement were not binding on the spouse parties to the agreement (disregarding any changes in circumstances from the time the agreement was made); and

                     (d)  the court makes an order under subsection (1B) declaring that the agreement is binding on the parties to the agreement; and

                     (e)  the agreement has not been terminated and has not been set aside by a court.

          (1B)  For the purposes of paragraph (1A)(d), a court may make an order declaring that a Part VIIIAB financial agreement is binding on the parties to the agreement, upon application (the **_enforcement application_**) by a spouse party seeking to enforce the agreement.

          (1C)  To avoid doubt, section 90UN applies in relation to the enforcement application.

             (2)  A Part VIIIAB financial agreement covered by section 90UE is binding on the parties to the agreement if, and only if, the agreement has not been terminated and has not been set aside by a court.

             (3)  A Part VIIIAB financial agreement ceases to be binding if, after making the agreement, the parties to the agreement marry each other.

             (4)  A court may make such orders for the enforcement of a Part VIIIAB financial agreement that is binding on the parties to the agreement as it thinks necessary.

##### <a id="90UK"></a>90UK  Effect of death of party to financial agreement

                   A Part VIIIAB financial agreement that is binding on the parties to the agreement continues to operate despite the death of a party to the agreement and operates in favour of, and is binding on, the legal personal representative of that party.

Note:          If the parties are still in the de facto relationship when one of them dies, the de facto relationship is not taken to have broken down for the purposes of enforcing the matters mentioned in the financial agreement (see the definition of **_breakdown_** in subsection 4(1)).

##### <a id="90UL"></a>90UL  Termination of financial agreement

             (1)  The parties to a Part VIIIAB financial agreement may terminate the agreement for the purposes of this Act only by:

                     (a)  including a provision to that effect in another Part VIIIAB financial agreement as mentioned in subsection 90UB(4), 90UC(4) or 90UD(4); or

                     (b)  making a written agreement (a **_Part VIIIAB termination agreement_**) to that effect.

             (2)  Subject to subsection (2A), a Part VIIIAB termination agreement is binding on the parties if, and only if:

                     (a)  the termination agreement is signed by all parties to the Part VIIIAB financial agreement; and

                     (b)  before signing the termination agreement, each spouse party was provided with independent legal advice from a legal practitioner about the effect of the termination agreement on the rights of that party and about the advantages and disadvantages, at the time that the advice was provided, to that party of making the termination agreement; and

                     (c)  either before or after signing the agreement, each spouse party was provided with a signed statement by the legal practitioner stating that the advice referred to in paragraph (b) was provided to that party (whether or not the statement is annexed to the termination agreement); and

                     (d)  the termination agreement has not been set aside by a court.

          (2A)  A Part VIIIAB termination agreement is binding on the parties if:

                     (a)  the termination agreement is signed by all parties to the Part VIIIAB financial agreement; and

                     (b)  one or more of paragraphs (2)(b), (c) and (ca) are not satisfied in relation to the termination agreement; and

                     (c)  a court is satisfied that it would be unjust and inequitable if the termination agreement were not binding on the spouse parties to the agreement (disregarding any changes in circumstances from the time the agreement was made); and

                     (d)  the court makes an order under subsection (2B) declaring that the termination agreement is binding on the parties to the agreement; and

                     (e)  the termination agreement has not been set aside by a court.

          (2B)  For the purposes of paragraph (2A)(d), a court may make an order declaring that a Part VIIIAB termination agreement is binding on the parties to the agreement, upon application (the **_enforcement application_**) by a spouse party seeking to enforce the agreement.

          (2C)  To avoid doubt, section 90UN applies in relation to the enforcement application.

             (3)  A court may, on an application by:

                     (a)  a person who was a party to the Part VIIIAB financial agreement; or

                     (b)  any other interested person;

make such order or orders (including an order for the transfer of property) as it considers just and equitable for the purpose of preserving or adjusting the rights of:

                     (c)  persons who were parties to the Part VIIIAB financial agreement; and

                     (d)  any other interested persons.

Note:          For the manner in which the contents of a Part VIIIAB financial agreement may be proved, see section 48 of the _Evidence Act 1995_.

                     (e)  the agreement is void, voidable or unenforceable; or

                      (f)  in the circumstances that have arisen since the agreement was made it is impracticable for the agreement or a part of the agreement to be carried out; or

                     (g)  since the making of the agreement, a material change in circumstances has occurred (being circumstances relating to the care, welfare and development of a child of the de facto relationship) and, as a result of the change, the child or, if the applicant has caring responsibility for the child (as defined in subsection (4)), a party to the agreement will suffer hardship if the court does not set the agreement aside; or

                     (h)  in respect of the making of a Part VIIIAB financial agreement—a party to the agreement engaged in conduct that was, in all the circumstances, unconscionable; or

                      (i)  a payment flag is operating under Part VIIIB on a superannuation interest covered by the agreement and there is no reasonable likelihood that the operation of the flag will be terminated by a flag lifting agreement under that Part; or

                      (j)  the agreement covers at least one superannuation interest that is an unsplittable interest for the purposes of Part VIIIB; or

                     (a)  the reference in that subparagraph to an order under section 90SM is taken to include a reference to an order (however described) under a corresponding provision (if any) of the non‑referring State de facto financial law concerned; and

                     (b)  if this advice was provided to at least one of the spouse parties to the agreement—that party was not provided with a signed statement by the legal practitioner stating that this advice was given to that party;

and it would be unjust and inequitable, having regard to the eligible agreed matters (within the meaning of section 90UE) for the agreement, if the court does not set the agreement aside.

             (6)  A court may, on an application by a person who was a party to the Part VIIIAB financial agreement that has been set aside, or by any other interested person, make such order or orders (including an order for the transfer of property) as it considers just and equitable for the purpose of preserving or adjusting the rights of persons who were parties to that financial agreement and any other interested persons.

                     (a)  the proceedings may be continued by or against, as the case may be, the legal personal representative of the deceased party and the applicable Rules of Court may make provision in relation to the substitution of the legal personal representative as a party to the proceedings; and

                     (b)  if the court is of the opinion:

                              (i)  that it would have exercised its powers under this section if the deceased party had not died; and

                             (ii)  that it is still appropriate to exercise those powers;

                            the court may make any order that it could have made under subsection (1) or (6); and

                     (c)  an order under paragraph (b) may be enforced on behalf of, or against, as the case may be, the estate of the deceased party.

             (9)  The court must not make an order under this section if the order would:

                     (a)  result in the acquisition of property from a person otherwise than on just terms; and

                     (b)  be invalid because of paragraph 51(xxxi) of the Constitution.

For this purpose, **_acquisition of property_** and **_just terms_** have the same meanings as in paragraph 51(xxxi) of the Constitution.

##### <a id="90UN"></a>90UN  Validity, enforceability and effect of financial agreements and termination agreements

                     (a)  subject to paragraph (b), has the same powers, may grant the same remedies and must have the same regard to the rights of third parties as the High Court has, may grant and is required to have in proceedings in connection with contracts or purported contracts, being proceedings in which the High Court has original jurisdiction; and

                     (b)  has power to make an order for the payment, by a party to the agreement to another party to the agreement, of interest on an amount payable under the agreement, from the time when the amount became or becomes due and payable, at a rate not exceeding the rate prescribed by the applicable Rules of Court; and

                     (c)  in addition to, or instead of, making an order or orders under paragraph (a) or (b), may order that the agreement, or a specified part of the agreement, be enforced as if it were an order of the court.

                   (da)  if the agreement relates to a marriage—the marriage is broken down at the operative time; and

                   (db)  if the agreement relates to a de facto relationship—the de facto relationship is broken down at the operative time; and

                     (e)  the interest is not an unsplittable interest.

Note:          The base amount is used to calculate the entitlement of the non‑member spouse under the regulations.

             (2)  The following provisions begin to apply to the interest at the operative time.

             (3)  Whenever a splittable payment becomes payable in respect of the interest:

                     (a)  the non‑member spouse is entitled to be paid the amount (if any) that is calculated under subsection (4); and

                     (b)  there is a corresponding reduction in the entitlement of the person to whom the splittable payment would have been made but for the payment split.

             (4)  The amount is calculated as follows:

                     (a)  if the agreement specifies a percentage as mentioned in subparagraph (1)(b)(ii) or subparagraph (1)(c)(iii)—the amount is calculated by applying the specified percentage to the splittable payment; or

                     (b)  otherwise—the amount is calculated in accordance with the regulations.

             (5)  Subject to section 90MV, this section continues to apply to the superannuation interest even if the agreement referred to in subsection (1) later ceases to be in force.

#### Subdivision C—Payment flagging

##### <a id="90MK"></a>90MK  Operative time for payment flag

             (1)  The **_operative time_** for a payment flag under a superannuation agreement is:

                     (a)  the service time, if the eligible superannuation plan is a self‑managed superannuation fund; or

                     (b)  otherwise, the beginning of the fourth business day after the day on which the service time occurs.

             (2)  In this section:

                    <a name="self-manag-superannu-fund"></a>**_self‑managed superannuation fund_** has the same meaning as in the SIS Act.

                    <a name="servic-time"></a>**_service time_** means the time when a copy of the agreement is served on the trustee, accompanied by:

                     (a)  if the parties are divorced—a copy of the divorce order that has terminated the marriage; and

                    (aa)  if the parties are not divorced—a separation declaration with a declaration time that is not more than 28 days before the service on the trustee; and

                     (b)  if a form of declaration is prescribed for the purposes of this paragraph—a declaration in that form.

##### <a id="90ML"></a>90ML  Payment flag

             (1)  This section applies to a superannuation interest if:

                     (a)  the interest is identified in a superannuation agreement; and

                     (b)  the agreement provides that the interest is to be subject to a payment flag under this Part; and

                     (c)  the agreement is in force at the operative time; and

                     (d)  the interest is not an unflaggable interest.

             (2)  A payment flag starts to operate on the superannuation interest at the operative time and continues to operate until either:

                     (a)  a court terminates the operation of the payment flag by an order mentioned in section 90MM; or

                     (b)  a flag lifting agreement is served on the trustee as mentioned in section 90MI in respect of the superannuation interest.

             (3)  If a payment flag ceases to operate because of paragraph (2)(b), the cessation is not affected by a later termination of the flag lifting agreement.

             (4)  While a payment flag is operating on a superannuation interest, the trustee must not make any splittable payment to any person in respect of the interest.

                    Penalty:  50 penalty units.

Note:          The penalty for a body corporate is 250 penalty units. See subsection 4B(3) of the _Crimes Act 1914_.

          (4A)  Subsection (4) does not apply if the splittable payment is made in circumstances in which section 90MLA applies.

Note:          A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in subsection (4A) (see subsection 13.3(3) of the _Criminal Code_).

             (5)  If a splittable payment becomes payable in respect of a superannuation interest while a payment flag is operating, the trustee must, within 14 days after it became payable, give written notice to the member spouse and the non‑member spouse.

                    Penalty:  50 penalty units.

Note:          The penalty for a body corporate is 250 penalty units. See subsection 4B(3) of the _Crimes Act 1914_.

             (6)  Subsection (5) does not apply if the trustee has previously given a notice under that subsection, for an earlier splittable payment, in respect of the payment flag.

             (7)  If either spouse dies while a payment flag is operating:

                     (a)  the payment flag nevertheless continues to operate; and

                     (b)  the legal personal representative of the deceased spouse has all the rights the deceased spouse would have had in respect of the payment flag.

Note:          The rights of the legal personal representative under paragraph (b) include the right to enter into a flag lifting agreement under section 90MN.

##### <a id="90MLA"></a>90MLA  Some splittable payments payable if payment flag operating

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a superannuation interest (**_original interest_**) a person has in an eligible superannuation plan (**_old ESP_**) is identified in a superannuation agreement; and

                     (b)  a payment flag under section 90ML is operating on the original interest; and

                     (c)  a splittable payment is made by the trustee of the old ESP to the trustee of another eligible superannuation plan (**_new ESP_**) in respect of the original interest as part of a successor fund transfer.

             (2)  If this section applies, then:

                     (a)  the new interest in the new ESP is taken to be the original interest identified in the superannuation agreement; and

                     (b)  the payment flag operates on the new interest; and

                     (c)  despite section 90MK, the operative time for the payment flag in respect of the new interest is the time that the payment to the trustee of the new ESP is made.

             (3)  In this section:

                    <a name="successor-fund-transfer"></a>**_successor fund transfer_** means the transfer of a person’s superannuation interest in the old ESP in circumstances where:

                     (a)  the new ESP confers on the person, in relation to the new interest, equivalent rights to the rights the person had in relation to the original interest; and

                     (b)  before the transfer, the trustee of the new ESP had agreed with the trustee of the old ESP to the conferral of such rights.

##### <a id="90MM"></a>90MM  Payment flag may be terminated by court

             (1)  If a court makes an order under section 90K setting aside a financial agreement in respect of which a payment flag is operating, the court may also make an order terminating the operation of the flag.

Note:          Under section 90MH, a superannuation agreement must be part of a financial agreement. Therefore, setting aside the financial agreement also has the effect of setting aside the superannuation agreement.

             (2)  If a court makes an order under section 90UM setting aside a Part VIIIAB financial agreement in respect of which a payment flag is operating, the court may also make an order terminating the operation of the flag.

Note:          Under section 90MHA, a superannuation agreement relating to a de facto relationship must be part of a Part VIIIAB financial agreement. Therefore, setting aside the financial agreement also has the effect of setting aside the superannuation agreement.

##### <a id="90MN"></a>90MN  Flag lifting agreement etc.

             (1)  At any time when a payment flag is operating on a superannuation interest, the spouses may make an agreement (a **_flag lifting agreement_**) that either:

                     (a)  provides that the flag is to cease operating without any payment split; or

                     (b)  specifies an amount, method or percentage in accordance with subsection 90MJ(1).

             (2)  If the flag lifting agreement provides for a payment split, the spouses may at any time make an agreement (a **_termination agreement_**) that terminates the flag lifting agreement.

             (3)  A flag lifting agreement or termination agreement has no effect unless it complies with the following requirements:

                     (a)  the agreement must be signed by both spouses;

                     (b)  for each spouse, the agreement must contain a statement that the spouse has been provided with independent legal advice from a legal practitioner as to the legal effect of the agreement;

                     (c)  a certificate must be attached to the agreement, signed by the person who provided the legal advice and stating that the advice was provided;

                     (d)  after the agreement is signed by the spouses, each spouse must be provided with a copy of the agreement.

             (4)  A court may make an order setting aside a flag lifting agreement or termination agreement if, and only if, the court is satisfied as to:

                     (a)  if the spouses are parties to a marriage—any of the grounds set out in subsection 90K(1) (other than paragraph 90K(1)(f)); or

                     (b)  if the spouses are parties to a de facto relationship—any of the grounds set out in subsection 90UM(1) (other than paragraph 90UM(1)(i)).

             (5)  An order setting aside a flag lifting agreement also operates to set aside the related financial agreement or Part VIIIAB financial agreement.

             (6)  An order under section 90K setting aside a financial agreement also operates to set aside the related flag lifting agreement.

             (7)  An order under section 90UM setting aside a Part VIIIAB financial agreement also operates to set aside the related flag lifting agreement.

#### Subdivision D—Miscellaneous

##### <a id="90MO"></a>90MO  Limitation on section 79 or 90SM order

             (1)  A court cannot make an order under section 79 or 90SM with respect to a superannuation interest if:

                     (a)  the superannuation interest is covered by a superannuation agreement that is in force; or

                     (b)  the non‑member spouse has served a waiver notice on the trustee under section 90MZA in respect of the interest; or

                     (c)  a payment flag is operating on the superannuation interest.

Note:          Under section 90MM, the court can terminate the operation of a payment flag in certain circumstances.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not prevent the court taking superannuation interests into account when making an order with respect to other property of the spouses.

##### <a id="90MP"></a>90MP  Separation declaration

             (1)  A **_separation declaration_** is a written declaration that complies with this section, and may be included in the superannuation agreement to which it relates.

             (2)  The declaration must be signed by at least one of the spouses. For this purpose, if a spouse has died the spouse’s legal personal representative may sign the declaration.

                     (b)  the spouses separated and thereafter lived separately and apart for a continuous period of at least 12 months immediately before the declaration time; and

                     (c)  in the opinion of the spouse (or spouses) making the declaration, there is no reasonable likelihood of cohabitation being resumed.

             (4)  If section 90MQ does not apply to the declaration, then the declaration must state that the spouses are married, but are separated, at the declaration time.

          (4A)  If either or both of the spouses have died, then the declaration must state:

                     (a)  if section 90MQ applies to the declaration—that at the most recent time when both spouses were alive:

                              (i)  the spouses were married; but

                             (ii)  the spouses were separated and had lived separately and apart for a continuous period of at least 12 months immediately before that time; or

                     (b)  if section 90MQ does not apply to the declaration—that the spouses were married, but separated, at the most recent time when both spouses were alive.

Subsections (3) and (4) have effect subject to this subsection.

             (5)  For the purposes of subsections (3) to (4A), the question whether spouses lived separately and apart for a continuous period of not less than 12 months before a particular date is to be determined in the same way as it is under section 48.

             (6)  In subsections (3) to (5):

                    <a name="separ"></a>**_separated_** has the same meaning as in section 48 (as affected by sections 49 and 50).

Spouses who are parties to a de facto relationship

             (7)  Subsections (8) to (12) apply if the spouses are parties to a de facto relationship.

                     (b)  the spouses separated and thereafter lived separately and apart for a continuous period of at least 12 months immediately before the declaration time; and

                     (c)  in the opinion of the spouse (or spouses) making the declaration, there is no reasonable likelihood of cohabitation being resumed.

             (9)  If section 90MQ does not apply to the declaration, then the declaration must state that the spouses lived in a de facto relationship, but are separated, at the declaration time.

           (10)  If either or both of the spouses have died, then the declaration must state:

                     (a)  if section 90MQ applies to the declaration—that:

                              (i)  the spouses lived in a de facto relationship; but

                             (ii)  at the most recent time when both spouses were alive, the spouses were separated and had lived separately and apart for a continuous period of at least 12 months immediately before that time; or

                     (b)  if section 90MQ does not apply to the declaration—that the spouses:

                              (i)  lived in a de facto relationship; but

                             (ii)  were separated at the most recent time when both spouses were alive.

Subsections (8) and (9) have effect subject to this subsection.

           (11)  For the purposes of subsection (8) and paragraph (10)(a), the spouses can have separated and be living separately and apart even if:

                     (a)  their cohabitation was brought to an end by the action or conduct of one only of them; or

                     (b)  they have continued to reside in the same residence; or

                     (c)  either of them has rendered some household services to the other.

           (12)  For the purposes of subsection (8) and paragraph (10)(a), if, after the spouses separated, they resumed cohabitation on one occasion but, within a period of 3 months after the resumption of cohabitation, they again separated and thereafter lived separately and apart up to the relevant time referred to in paragraph (8)(b) or (10)(a):

                     (a)  the periods of living separately and apart before and after the period of cohabitation may be aggregated as if they were one continuous period; but

                     (b)  the period of cohabitation shall not be taken to be part of the period of living separately and apart.

##### <a id="90MQ"></a>90MQ  Superannuation interests in excess of low rate cap amount

             (1)  This section applies to a declaration if:

                     (a)  if both spouses are alive at the declaration time—at the declaration time; or

                     (b)  otherwise—at the most recent time when both spouses were alive;

the total withdrawal value for all the superannuation interests of the member spouse is more than the member spouse’s low rate cap amount for the income year in which that time occurs.

             (2)  This section does not apply in the circumstances (if any) prescribed by the regulations.

             (3)  In this section:

                    <a name="low-rate-cap-amount"></a>**_low rate cap amount_** has the meaning given by the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (disregarding subsection 307‑345(2) of that Act and section 307‑345 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_).

                    <a name="total-withdraw-valu"></a>**_total withdrawal value_** means the amount determined in accordance with the regulations.

##### <a id="90MR"></a>90MR  Enforcement by court order

             (1)  A court may make such orders as it thinks necessary for the enforcement of a payment split or payment flag under this Division.

             (2)  The question whether a superannuation agreement or flag lifting agreement is valid, enforceable or effective is to be determined by the court according to the principles of law and equity that are applicable in determining the validity, enforceability and effect of contracts and purported contracts.

             (3)  Without limiting subsection (2), in proceedings relating to a superannuation agreement or flag lifting agreement, the court has the same powers, may grant the same remedies and must have the same regard to the rights of third parties as the High Court has, may grant and is required to have in proceedings in connection with contracts or purported contracts, being proceedings in which the High Court has original jurisdiction.

### Division 3—Payment splitting or flagging by court order

##### <a id="90MS"></a>90MS  Order under section 79 or 90SM may include orders in relation to superannuation interests

             (1)  In proceedings under section 79 or 90SM with respect to the property of spouses, the court may, in accordance with this Division, also make orders in relation to superannuation interests of the spouses.

Note 1:       Although the orders are made in accordance with this Division, they will be made under either section 79 or 90SM. Therefore they will be generally subject to all the same provisions as other orders made under that section.

Note 2:       Sections 71A and 90MO limit the scope of section 79.

Note 3:       Subsections 44(5) and (6) and sections 90SB, 90SK and 90MO limit the scope of section 90SM.

             (2)  A court cannot make an order under section 79 or 90SM in relation to a superannuation interest except in accordance with this Part.

##### <a id="90MT"></a>90MT  Splitting order

             (1)  A court, in accordance with section 90MS, may make the following orders in relation to a superannuation interest (other than an unsplittable interest):

                     (a)  if the interest is not a percentage‑only interest—an order to the effect that, whenever a splittable payment becomes payable in respect of the interest:

                              (i)  the non‑member spouse is entitled to be paid the amount (if any) calculated in accordance with the regulations; and

                             (ii)  there is a corresponding reduction in the entitlement of the person to whom the splittable payment would have been made but for the order;

                     (b)  an order to the effect that, whenever a splittable payment becomes payable in respect of the interest:

                              (i)  the non‑member spouse is entitled to be paid a specified percentage of the splittable payment; and

                             (ii)  there is a corresponding reduction in the entitlement of the person to whom the splittable payment would have been made but for the order;

                     (c)  if the interest is a percentage‑only interest—an order to the effect that, whenever a splittable payment becomes payable in respect of the interest:

                              (i)  the non‑member spouse is entitled to be paid the amount (if any) calculated in accordance with the regulations by reference to the percentage specified in the order;

                             (ii)  there is a corresponding reduction in the entitlement of the person to whom the splittable payment would have been made but for the order;

                     (d)  such other orders as the court thinks necessary for the enforcement of an order under paragraph (a), (b) or (c).

             (2)  Before making an order referred to in subsection (1), the court must make a determination under paragraph (a) or (b) as follows:

                     (a)  if the regulations provide for the determination of an amount in relation to the interest, the court must determine the amount in accordance with the regulations;

                     (b)  otherwise, the court must determine the value of the interest by such method as the court considers appropriate.

          (2A)  The amount determined under paragraph (2)(a) is taken to be the value of the interest.

             (3)  Regulations for the purposes of paragraph (2)(a) may provide for the amount to be determined wholly or partly by reference to methods or factors that are approved in writing by the Minister for the purposes of the regulations.

             (4)  Before making an order referred to in paragraph (1)(a), the court must allocate a base amount to the non‑member spouse, not exceeding the value determined under subsection (2).

Note:          The base amount is used to calculate the entitlement of the non‑member spouse under the regulations.

##### <a id="90MU"></a>90MU  Flagging order

             (1)  A court, in accordance with section 90MS, may make an order in relation to a superannuation interest (other than an unflaggable interest):

                     (a)  directing the trustee not to make any splittable payment in respect of the interest without the leave of the court; and

                     (b)  requiring the trustee to notify the member spouse and the non‑member spouse, within a period specified in the order, of the next occasion when a splittable payment becomes payable in respect of the interest.

             (2)  In deciding whether to make an order in accordance with this section, the court may take into account such matters as it considers relevant and, in particular, may take into account the likelihood that a splittable payment will soon become payable in respect of the superannuation interest.

##### <a id="90MUA"></a>90MUA  Some splittable payments may be made without leave of court

             (1)  A flagging order made under subsection 90MU(1) in relation to a superannuation interest (**_original interest_**) a person has in an eligible superannuation plan (**_old ESP_**) does not apply to a splittable payment if the splittable payment is made by the trustee of the old ESP to the trustee of another eligible superannuation plan (**_new ESP_**) in respect of the original interest as part of a successor fund transfer.

             (2)  If the splittable payment is made, then the flagging order is taken to be made in relation to the new interest from the time that the payment to the trustee of the new ESP is made.

             (3)  In this section:

                    <a name="successor-fund-transfer"></a>**_successor fund transfer_** means the transfer of a person’s superannuation interest in the old ESP in circumstances where:

                     (a)  the new ESP confers on the person, in relation to the new interest, equivalent rights to the rights the person had in relation to the original interest; and

                     (b)  before the transfer, the trustee of the new ESP had agreed with the trustee of the old ESP to the conferral of such rights.

### Division 4—General provisions about payment splitting

##### <a id="90MV"></a>90MV  Court may cancel payment split

             (1)  A court may, under section 79 or 90SM, make an order terminating the operation of a payment split if:

                     (a)  the superannuation agreement in respect of the payment split has ceased to be in force; and

                     (b)  the non‑member spouse has not served a waiver notice on the trustee under section 90MZA in respect of the payment split.

             (2)  The termination has effect for splittable payments that become payable after the date specified in the order.

##### <a id="90MW"></a>90MW  Deductions from splittable payment before calculating payment split

                   Any deduction that the trustee is entitled to make from a splittable payment is to be deducted from the splittable payment before calculating any payment split and before applying section 90MX.

##### <a id="90MX"></a>90MX  Multiple payment splits applying to the same splittable payment

             (1)  This section applies if 2 or more payment splits apply to the same splittable payment.

             (2)  The payments splits are to be calculated in order of their operative times, starting with the earliest time.

             (3)  For the purpose of calculating each of those payment splits (other than the one with the earliest operative time), the amount of the splittable payment is taken to be reduced by the amount to which a person other than the member spouse is entitled under the payment split with the next earlier operative time.

Example 1: W has a superannuation interest that is subject to 3 payment splits in respect of W’s marriages to X, Y and Z (in that order). The operative times of the payment splits are in the same order as the marriages. Assume each payment split provides for a 50% share to the non‑member spouse. W becomes entitled to a splittable payment of $100\. The final payment entitlements are as follows: X gets $50\. Y gets $25\. Z gets $12.50\. W gets the remaining $12.50.

Example 2: W has a superannuation interest that is subject to 3 payment splits in respect of W’s de facto relationship with X, W’s marriage to Y and W’s de facto relationship with Z (in that order). The operative times of the payment splits are in the same order as the relationships. Assume each payment split provides for a 50% share to the non‑member spouse. W becomes entitled to a splittable payment of $100\. The final payment entitlements are as follows: X gets $50\. Y gets $25\. Z gets $12.50\. W gets the remaining $12.50.

##### <a id="90MY"></a>90MY  Fees payable to trustee

             (1)  The regulations may:

                     (a)  allow trustees to charge reasonable fees:

                              (i)  in respect of a payment split; or

                             (ii)  otherwise in respect of the operation of this Part in relation to a superannuation interest; and

                     (b)  prescribe the person or persons liable to pay those fees.

             (2)  If any such fee remains unpaid after the time it is due for payment, then the trustee may recover any unpaid amount by deduction from amounts that would otherwise become payable by the trustee, in respect of the superannuation interest, to the person who is liable to pay the fee.

##### <a id="90MZ"></a>90MZ  Superannuation preservation requirements

             (1)  If the eligible superannuation plan for a payment split is a regulated superannuation fund or approved deposit fund, then the entitlement of the non‑member spouse is subject to any regulations made under the SIS Act that provide for payment of that entitlement to a regulated superannuation fund, approved deposit fund, RSA or exempt public sector superannuation scheme within the meaning of the SIS Act for the benefit of the non‑member spouse.

             (2)  If the eligible superannuation plan for a payment split is an RSA, then the entitlement of the non‑member spouse is subject to any regulations made under the _Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997_ that provide for payment of that entitlement to a regulated superannuation fund, approved deposit fund, RSA or exempt public sector superannuation scheme within the meaning of the SIS Act for the benefit of the non‑member spouse.

             (3)  If the eligible superannuation plan for a payment split is a constitutionally protected fund (within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_) or an exempt public sector superannuation scheme within the meaning of the SIS Act, then the entitlement of the non‑member spouse is subject to any law or other instrument that provides for payment of that entitlement to a regulated superannuation fund, approved deposit fund, RSA or exempt public sector superannuation scheme within the meaning of the SIS Act for the benefit of the non‑member spouse.

##### <a id="90MZA"></a>90MZA  Waiver of rights under payment split

             (1)  If the non‑member spouse serves a waiver notice on the trustee in respect of a payment split, then the following provisions apply for each splittable payment that becomes payable after the date specified in the waiver notice:

                     (a)  the non‑member spouse is not entitled to be paid any amount under the payment split in respect of the splittable payment;

                     (b)  the entitlement of the person to whom the splittable payment would have been made but for the payment split continues to be reduced in the same way as it would have been reduced if the entitlement of the non‑member spouse had not been terminated.

Example:    X has a superannuation interest that is subject to a 50:50 payment split in favour of Y. Y serves a waiver notice on the trustee, in exchange for a lump sum payment made by the trustee to another fund for the benefit of Y. The effect is that X’s payments will continue to be reduced by half, but Y will receive no further payments under the payment split.

             (2)  To be effective for the purposes of this section, a waiver notice must be in the prescribed form and must be accompanied by:

                     (a)  a statement to the effect that the non‑member spouse has been provided with independent financial advice from a prescribed financial adviser as to the financial effect of the waiver notice; and

                     (b)  a certificate signed by the person who provided the financial advice, stating that the advice was provided.

##### <a id="90MZB"></a>90MZB  Trustee to provide information

                             (ii)  to assist the applicant in connection with the operation of this Part in relation to the applicant; and

                     (b)  the fee (if any) payable under regulations made for the purposes of section 90MY.

             (3)  If the trustee receives an application that complies with this section, the trustee must, in accordance with the regulations, provide information about the superannuation interest to the applicant.

                    Penalty:  50 penalty units.

Note:          The penalty for a body corporate is 250 penalty units. See subsection 4B(3) of the _Crimes Act 1914_.

             (4)  Regulations for the purposes of subsection (3) may specify circumstances in which the trustee is not required to provide information.

Example:    The regulations might provide that a secondary government trustee is not required to provide information where there is another trustee of the eligible superannuation plan who is better able to provide the information.

             (5)  The trustee must not, in response to an application under this section by a spouse of the member, provide the spouse with any address of the member. For this purpose, **_address_** includes a postal address.

                    Penalty:  50 penalty units.

Note:          The penalty for a body corporate is 250 penalty units. See subsection 4B(3) of the _Crimes Act 1914_.

                    Penalty:  50 penalty units.

Note:          The penalty for a body corporate is 250 penalty units. See subsection 4B(3) of the _Crimes Act 1914_.

             (7)  The regulations may require the trustee of an eligible superannuation plan, after the operative time for a payment split, to provide information to the non‑member spouse about the superannuation interest concerned. Such regulations may prescribe penalties for contravention, not exceeding 10 penalty units.

             (8)  In this section:

                    <a name="elig-person"></a>**_eligible person_**, in relation to a superannuation interest of a member of an eligible superannuation plan, means:

                     (a)  the member; or

##### <a id="90MZC"></a>90MZC  Death of non‑member spouse

                     (a)  the payment split nevertheless continues to operate; and

                     (b)  the payment split then operates in favour of the legal personal representative of the deceased spouse and is binding on that legal personal representative; and

                     (c)  the legal personal representative has all the rights the deceased spouse would have had in respect of the payment split, including the right to serve a waiver notice under section 90MZA.

             (9)  Where a divorce or the annulment of a marriage is to be recognized as valid in accordance with this section, the capacity of a party to that marriage to re‑marry in accordance with the law of Australia is not affected by the fact that the validity of the divorce or annulment is not recognized under the law of some other jurisdiction.

           (10)  The preceding provisions of this section apply in relation to divorces, annulments and legal separations effected whether by decree, legislation or otherwise, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, and, for the purposes of this section, any decree, legislation or other process by which it is established that a purported marriage was or is to become void shall be deemed to be an annulment of the marriage.

### Division 2—International child abduction

##### <a id="111B"></a>111B  Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction

             (1)  The regulations may make such provision as is necessary or convenient to enable the performance of the obligations of Australia, or to obtain for Australia any advantage or benefit, under the Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction signed at The Hague on 25 October 1980 (the **_Convention_**) but any such regulations shall not come into operation until the day on which that Convention enters into force for Australia.

          (1A)  In relation to proceedings under regulations made for the purposes of subsection (1), the regulations may make provision:

                     (a)  relating to the onus of establishing that a child should not be returned under the Convention; and

                     (b)  establishing rebuttable presumptions in favour of returning a child under the Convention; and

                     (c)  relating to a Central Authority within the meaning of the regulations applying on behalf of another person for a parenting order that deals with the person or persons with whom a child is to spend time or communicate if the outcome of the proceedings is that the child is not to be returned under the Convention.

          (1B)  The regulations made for the purposes of this section must not allow an objection by a child to return under the Convention to be taken into account in proceedings unless the objection imports a strength of feeling beyond the mere expression of a preference or of ordinary wishes.

          (1C)  A Central Authority within the meaning of the regulations may arrange to place a child, who has been returned to Australia under the Convention, with an appropriate person, institution or other body to secure the child’s welfare until a court exercising jurisdiction under this Act makes an order (including an interim order) for the child’s care, welfare or development.

          (1D)  A Central Authority may do so despite any orders made by a court before the child’s return to Australia.

          (1E)  Any regulations made for the purposes of this section to give effect to Article 21 (rights of access) of the Convention may have effect regardless of:

                     (a)  whether an order or determination (however described) has been made under a law in force in another Convention country (within the meaning of the regulations made for the purposes of this section), with respect to rights of access to the child concerned; or

                     (b)  if the child was removed to Australia—when that happened; or

                     (c)  whether the child has been wrongfully removed to, or retained in, Australia.

             (2)  Because of amendments of this Act made by the _Family Law Reform Act 1995_:

                     (a)  a parent or guardian of a child is no longer expressly stated to have custody of the child; and

                     (b)  a court can no longer make an order under this Act expressed in terms of granting a person custody of, or access to, a child.

             (3)  The purpose of subsection (4) is to resolve doubts about the implications of these changes for the Convention. That is the only purpose of the subsection.

             (4)  For the purposes of the Convention:

                     (a)  each of the parents of a child should be regarded as having rights of custody in respect of the child unless the parent has no parental responsibility for the child because of any order of a court for the time being in force; and

                     (b)  subject to any order of a court for the time being in force, a person:

                              (i)  with whom a child is to live under a parenting order; or

                             (ii)  who has parental responsibility for a child under a parenting order;

                            should be regarded as having rights of custody in respect of the child; and

                     (c)  subject to any order of a court for the time being in force, a person who has parental responsibility for a child because of the operation of this Act or another Australian law and is responsible for the day‑to‑day or long‑term care, welfare and development of the child should be regarded as having rights of custody in respect of the child; and

                     (d)  subject to any order of a court for the time being in force, a person:

                              (i)  with whom a child is to spend time under a parenting order; or

                             (ii)  with whom a child is to communicate under a parenting order;

                            should be regarded as having a right of access to the child.

Note:          The references in paragraphs (b) and (d) to parenting orders also cover provisions of parenting agreements registered under section 63E (see section 63F, in particular subsection (3)).

             (5)  Subsection (4) is not intended to be a complete statement of the circumstances in which, under the laws of the Commonwealth, the States and the Territories, a person has, for the purposes of the Convention, custody of, or access to, a child, or a right or rights of custody or access in relation to a child.

          (5A)  Subsections (1A) and (2) to (5) do not, by implication, limit subsection (1).

             (6)  Expressions used in this section have the same meaning as they have in Part VII.

##### <a id="111C"></a>111C  International agreements about adoption etc.

             (2)  The regulations do not come into force until the day on which the Convention enters into force for Australia.

             (3)  The regulations may make such provision as is necessary or convenient to give effect to any bilateral agreement or arrangement on the adoption of children made between:

                     (a)  Australia, or a State or Territory of Australia; and

                     (b)  a prescribed overseas jurisdiction.

             (4)  Regulations made for the purposes of subsection (3) may, in particular:

                     (a)  provide for the recognition of adoptions made under a law of the prescribed overseas jurisdiction; and

                     (b)  provide that the regulations do not affect the operation of laws of a State or Territory that relate to adoptions; and

                     (c)  if a State or Territory has made such a bilateral agreement or arrangement on behalf of other States or Territories—give effect to the agreement or arrangement so far as it relates to all of those States or Territories, or to such of them as the regulations specify.

             (5)  Regulations made for the purposes of this section may:

                     (a)  confer jurisdiction on a federal court (other than the High Court) or a court of a Territory; or

                     (b)  invest a court of a State with federal jurisdiction.

Such jurisdiction is in addition to any other jurisdiction provided for under this Act.

             (6)  Regulations made for the purposes of subsection (5) may make different provision in respect of matters arising in relation to different States or Territories. (This subsection does not, by implication, limit subsection 33(3A) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.)

             (7)  Subsections (4), (5) and (6) of this section do not, by implication, limit subsections (1) and (3) of this section.

          (7A)  The power of the Judges, or a majority of them, under section 123 to make Rules of Court extends to making Rules of Court for or in relation to the making of adoption orders.

             (8)  In this section, despite subsection 4(1), **_Territory_** includes each external Territory.

             (2)  The circumstances in which parental responsibility for a child is attributed to a person, or extinguished, by operation of law (without the intervention of a court or appropriate authority) are governed by the law that applies in the country of the child’s habitual residence.

             (3)  The circumstances in which parental responsibility for a child is attributed to a person, or extinguished, by an agreement or a unilateral act (without the intervention of a court or appropriate authority) are governed by the law that applies in the country of the child’s habitual residence when the agreement or act takes effect.

             (4)  The exercise of parental responsibility for a child is governed by the law applying in the country of the child’s habitual residence.

             (5)  If a child’s country of habitual residence changes to another country:

                     (a)  parental responsibility for the child that exists under the law applying in the country in which the child was habitually resident continues to exist; and

                     (b)  the circumstances in which parental responsibility for the child is attributed by operation of law to a person who does not already have such responsibility are governed by the law applying in the country of the new habitual residence; and

             (6)  Despite subsections (2) to (5), if:

                     (c)  the other non‑Convention country would apply its own law;

the law of that other non‑Convention country applies instead.

             (7)  The parental responsibility referred to in subsection (2), (3), (4) or (5) may be ended, or the conditions of its exercise changed, by a measure taken in accordance with section 111CD or 111CK.

             (8)  A court need not apply a principle set out in subsection (2), (3), (4) or (5) if, on the application of an interested person, the court considers that doing so would be manifestly contrary to public policy having regard to the best interests of the child concerned.

          (1A)  The power given to the court under subsection (1) in respect of a contravention of a maintenance order applies even if the order has been complied with before the matter of the contravention comes before the court.

                     (a)  to require the person to enter into a bond in accordance with section 112AF; or

                              (i)  complies with the order concerned; or

                             (ii)  has been imprisoned pursuant to the sentence for 12 months or such lesser period as is specified by the court;

                            whichever happens first.

             (2)  A court shall not sentence a person to imprisonment pursuant to paragraph 112AD(2)(d) unless the court is satisfied that, in all the circumstances of the case, it would not be appropriate for the court to deal with the contravention pursuant to any of the other paragraphs of subsection 112AD(2).

             (3)  If a court sentences a person to imprisonment pursuant to paragraph 112AD(2)(d), the court shall:

                     (a)  suspend the sentence upon the terms and conditions determined by the court; and

             (8)  To avoid doubt, the serving by a person of a period of imprisonment under a sentence imposed on the person under paragraph 112AD(2)(d) for a failure to make a payment under a maintenance order does not affect the person’s liability to make the payment.

##### <a id="112AF"></a>112AF  Bonds

                     (a)  adjourn those proceedings until the prosecution has been completed; or

## Part XIIIB—Contempt of court

##### <a id="112AP"></a>112AP  Contempt

             (1)  Subject to subsection (1A), this section applies to a contempt of a court that:

                     (a)  does not constitute a contravention of an order under this Act; or

                     (b)  constitutes a contravention of an order under this Act and involves a flagrant challenge to the authority of the court.

          (1A)  This section does not apply to a contempt that constitutes a contravention of a maintenance order if the order has been complied with before the matter of the contravention comes before the court.

             (2)  In spite of any other law, a court having jurisdiction under this Act may punish a person for contempt of that court.

             (8)  To avoid doubt, the serving by a person of a period of imprisonment as a result of a contempt of a court arising out of a failure by the person to make a payment in respect of the maintenance of another person does not affect the first‑mentioned person’s liability to make the payment.

             (9)  In this section:

                     (e)  whether any party to the proceedings has been wholly unsuccessful in the proceedings;

             (3)  To avoid doubt, in proceedings in which an independent children’s lawyer for a child has been appointed, the court may make an order under subsection (2) as to costs or security for costs, whether by way of interlocutory order or otherwise, to the effect that each party to the proceedings bears, in such proportion as the court considers just, the costs of the independent children’s lawyer in respect of the proceedings.

             (4)  However, in proceedings in which an independent children’s lawyer for a child has been appointed, if:

                     (a)  a party to the proceedings has received legal aid in respect of the proceedings; or

                     (b)  the court considers that a party to the proceedings would suffer financial hardship if the party had to bear a proportion of the costs of the independent children’s lawyer;

the court must not make an order under subsection (2) against that party in relation to the costs of the independent children’s lawyer.

             (5)  In considering what order (if any) should be made under subsection (2) in proceedings in which an independent children’s lawyer has been appointed, the court must disregard the fact that the independent children’s lawyer is funded under a legal aid scheme or service established under a Commonwealth, State or Territory law or approved by the Attorney‑General.

                     (b)  against a person or body who holds or held an office or appointment under those regulations and is a party to the proceedings in that capacity.

Note:          For another case where the court can also make an order as to costs, see subsection (3).

             (2)  However, the order can only be made in respect of a part of the proceedings if, during that part, the party against whom the order is to be made asserted a meaning or operation of this Act or those regulations that the court considers:

                     (a)  is not reasonable given the terms of the Act or regulations; or

                     (b)  is not convenient to give effect to Australia’s obligations under the Convention concerned, or to obtain for Australia the benefits of that Convention.

             (3)  In proceedings under regulations made for the purposes of section 111B, the court can also make an order as to costs that is:

                     (a)  against a party who has wrongfully removed or retained a child, or wrongfully prevented the exercise of rights of access (within the meaning of the Convention referred to in that section) to a child; and

                     (b)  in respect of the necessary expenses incurred by the person who made the application, under that Convention, concerning the child.

                              (i)  a child is to live with a person; or

                             (ii)  a child is to spend time with a person; or

                      (f)  on the application of any other person—order the first‑mentioned person to make reparation to that other person, by way of money payment or otherwise, in respect of any loss suffered, or expense incurred, by that other person in recovering the child and, if applicable, returning the child to a person.

             (2)  Nothing in subsection (1) empowers a court to order a person to make reparation to the Commonwealth, to a Commonwealth instrumentality or to another person in respect of any loss suffered, or any expense incurred, where a court has, under section 21B of the _Crimes Act 1914_, ordered the first‑mentioned person to make reparation to the Commonwealth, to the Commonwealth instrumentality or to that other person, as the case may be, in respect of the same loss suffered or expense incurred.

                     (a)  that interest is payable at a rate specified in the order, being a rate other than the rate prescribed by the applicable Rules of Court; or

                     (b)  that interest is payable from a date specified in the order, being a date other than the date from which the interest would be payable under subsection (1).

# Schedule 1—Child Protection Convention

_Note:       This is the copy of the Child Protection Convention referred to in the definition of Child Protection Convention in subsection 111CA(1)._

The undersigned, Delegates of the Governments of Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Egypt, Finland, The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Monaco, Morocco, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, the Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the United States of America and Venezuela, Member States, as well as the Representatives of the Governments of Burkina Faso, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Georgia, the Holy See, the Republic of Korea, Mauritius, New Zealand, Paraguay, Peru, the Philippines, the Russian Federation, South Africa and Sri Lanka, participating as Observers, convened at The Hague on 30 September 1996, at the invitation of the Government of the Netherlands, in the Eighteenth Session of the Hague Conference on Private International Law.

Following the deliberations laid down in the records of the meetings, have decided to submit to their Governments—

**CONVENTION ON JURISDICTION, APPLICABLE LAW, RECOGNITION, ENFORCEMENT AND CO‑OPERATION IN RESPECT OF PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY AND MEASURES FOR THE PROTECTION OF CHILDREN**

The States signatory to the present Convention,

Considering the need to improve the protection of children in international situations,

Wishing to avoid conflicts between their legal systems in respect of jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition and enforcement of measures for the protection of children,

Recalling the importance of international co‑operation for the protection of children,

Confirming that the best interests of the child are to be a primary consideration,

Noting that the _Convention of 5 October 1961 concerning the powers of authorities and the law applicable in respect of the protection of minors_ is in need of revision,

Desiring to establish common provisions to this effect, taking into account the _United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child_ of 20 November 1989,

Have agreed on the following provisions—

CHAPTER I—SCOPE OF THE CONVENTION

_Article 1_

1          The objects of the present Convention are—

_b_          to determine which law is to be applied by such authorities in exercising their jurisdiction;

_c_          to determine the law applicable to parental responsibility;

_d_          to provide for the recognition and enforcement of such measures of protection in all Contracting States;

_e_          to establish such co‑operation between the authorities of the Contracting States as may be necessary in order to achieve the purposes of this Convention.

2          For the purposes of this Convention, the term ‘parental responsibility’ includes parental authority, or any analogous relationship of authority determining the rights, powers and responsibilities of parents, guardians or other legal representatives in relation to the person or the property of the child.

_Article 2_

The Convention applies to children from the moment of their birth until they reach the age of 18 years.

_Article 3_

The measures referred to in Article 1 may deal in particular with—

_a_          the attribution, exercise, termination or restriction of parental responsibility, as well as its delegation;

_b_          rights of custody, including rights relating to the care of the person of the child and, in particular, the right to determine the child’s place of residence, as well as rights of access including the right to take a child for a limited period of time to a place other than the child’s habitual residence;

_c_          guardianship, curatorship and analogous institutions;

_d_          the designation and functions of any person or body having charge of the child’s person or property, representing or assisting the child;

_e_          the placement of the child in a foster family or in institutional care, or the provision of care by _kafala_ or an analogous institution;

_f_           the supervision by a public authority of the care of a child by any person having charge of the child;

_g_          the administration, conservation or disposal of the child’s property.

_Article 4_

The Convention does not apply to—

_a_          the establishment or contesting of a parent‑child relationship;

CHAPTER II—JURISDICTION

_Article 5_

1          The judicial or administrative authorities of the   Contracting State of the habitual residence of the child have jurisdiction to take measures directed to the protection of the child’s person or property.

2          Subject to Article 7, in case of a change of the child’s habitual residence to another Contracting State, the authorities of the State of the new habitual residence have jurisdiction.

_Article 6_

1          For refugee children and children who, due to disturbances occurring in their country, are internationally displaced, the authorities of the Contracting State on the territory of which these children are present as a result of their displacement have the jurisdiction provided for in paragraph 1 of Article 5.

2          The provisions of the preceding paragraph also apply to children whose habitual residence cannot be established.

_Article 7_

1          In case of wrongful removal or retention of the child, the authorities of the Contracting State in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention keep their jurisdiction until the child has acquired a habitual residence in another State, and

_a_          each person, institution or other body having rights of custody has acquiesced in the removal or retention; or

_b_          the child has resided in that other State for a period of at least one year after the person, institution or other body having rights of custody has or should have had knowledge of the whereabouts of the child, no request for return lodged within that period is still pending, and the child is settled in his or her new environment.

2          The removal or the retention of a child is to be considered wrongful where—

_a_          it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person, an institution or any other body, either jointly or alone, under the law of the State in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention; and

_b_          at the time of removal or retention those rights were actually exercised, either jointly or alone, or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention.

The rights of custody mentioned in sub‑paragraph _a_ above, may arise in particular by operation of law or by reason of a judicial or administrative decision, or by reason of an agreement having legal effect under the law of that State.

3          So long as the authorities first mentioned in paragraph 1 keep their jurisdiction, the authorities of the Contracting   State to which the child has been removed or in which he or she has been retained can take only such urgent measures under Article 11 as are necessary for the protection of the person or property of the child.

_Article 8_

1          By way of exception, the authority of a Contracting State having jurisdiction under Article 5 or 6, if it considers that the authority of another Contracting State would be better placed in the particular case to assess the best interests of the child, may either

—        request that other authority, directly or with the assistance of the Central Authority of its State, to assume jurisdiction to take such measures of protection as it considers to be necessary, or

—        suspend consideration of the case and invite the parties to introduce such a request before the authority of that other State.

2          The Contracting States whose authorities may be addressed as provided in the preceding paragraph are

_a_          a State of which the child is a national,

_b_          a State in which property of the child is located,

_c_          a State whose authorities are seised of an application for divorce or legal separation of the child’s parents, or for annulment of their marriage,

_d_          a State with which the child has a substantial connection.

3          The authorities concerned may proceed to an exchange of views.

4          The authority addressed as provided in paragraph 1 may assume jurisdiction, in place of the authority having jurisdiction under Article 5 or 6, if it considers that this is in the child’s best interests.

_Article 9_

1          If the authorities of a Contracting State referred to in Article 8, paragraph 2, consider that they are better placed in the particular case to assess the child’s best interests, they may either

—        request the competent authority of the Contracting   State of the habitual residence of the child, directly or with the assistance of the Central Authority of that State, that they be authorised to exercise jurisdiction to take the measures of protection which they consider to be necessary, or

—        invite the parties to introduce such a request before the authority of the Contracting State of the habitual residence of the child.

2          The authorities concerned may proceed to an exchange of views.

3          The authority initiating the request may exercise jurisdiction in place of the authority of the Contracting State of the habitual residence of the child only if the latter authority has accepted the request.

_Article 10_

1          Without prejudice to Articles 5 to 9, the authorities of a Contracting State exercising jurisdiction to decide upon an application for divorce or legal separation of the parents of a child habitually resident in another Contracting State, or for annulment of their marriage, may, if the law of their State so provides, take measures directed to the protection of the person or property of such child if

_a_          at the time of commencement of the proceedings, one of his or her parents habitually resides in that State and one of them has parental responsibility in relation to the child, and

_b_          the jurisdiction of these authorities to take such measures has been accepted by the parents, as well as by any other person who has parental responsibility in relation to the child, and is in the best interests of the child.

2          The jurisdiction provided for by paragraph 1 to take measures for the protection of the child ceases as soon as the decision allowing or refusing the application for divorce, legal separation or annulment of the marriage has become final, or the proceedings have come to an end for another reason.

_Article 11_

1          In all cases of urgency, the authorities of any Contracting State in whose territory the child or property belonging to the child is present have jurisdiction to take any necessary measures of protection.

2          The measures taken under the preceding paragraph with regard to a child habitually resident in a Contracting State shall lapse as soon as the authorities which have jurisdiction under Articles 5 to 10 have taken the measures required by the situation.

3          The measures taken under paragraph 1 with regard to a child who is habitually resident in a non‑Contracting State shall lapse in each Contracting State as soon as measures required by the situation and taken by the authorities of another State are recognised in the Contracting   State in question.

_Article 12_

1          Subject to Article 7, the authorities of a Contracting State in whose territory the child or property belonging to the child is present have jurisdiction to take measures of a provisional character for the protection of the person or property of the child which have a territorial effect limited to the State in question, in so far as such measures are not incompatible with measures already taken by authorities which have jurisdiction under Articles 5 to 10.

2          The measures taken under the preceding paragraph with regard to a child habitually resident in a Contracting State shall lapse as soon as the authorities which have jurisdiction under Articles 5 to 10 have taken a decision in respect of the measures of protection which may be required by the situation.

3          The measures taken under paragraph 1 with regard to a child who is habitually resident in a non‑Contracting State shall lapse in the Contracting State where the measures were taken as soon as measures required by the situation and taken by the authorities of another State are recognised in the Contracting State in question.

_Article 13_

1          The authorities of a Contracting State which have jurisdiction under Articles 5 to 10 to take measures for the protection of the person or property of the child must abstain from exercising this jurisdiction if, at the time of the commencement of the proceedings, corresponding measures have been requested from the authorities of another Contracting State having jurisdiction under Articles 5 to 10 at the time of the request and are still under consideration.

2          The provisions of the preceding paragraph shall not apply if the authorities before whom the request for measures was initially introduced have declined jurisdiction.

_Article 14_

The measures taken in application of Articles 5 to 10 remain in force according to their terms, even if a change of circumstances has eliminated the basis upon which jurisdiction was founded, so long as the authorities which have jurisdiction under the Convention have not modified, replaced or terminated such measures.

CHAPTER III—APPLICABLE LAW

_Article 15_

1          In exercising their jurisdiction under the provisions of Chapter II, the authorities of the Contracting States shall apply their own law.

2          However, in so far as the protection of the person or the property of the child requires, they may exceptionally apply or take into consideration the law of another State with which the situation has a substantial connection.

3          If the child’s habitual residence changes to another Contracting State, the law of that other State governs, from the time of the change, the conditions of application of the measures taken in the State of the former habitual residence.

_Article 16_

1          The attribution or extinction of parental responsibility by operation of law, without the intervention of a judicial or administrative authority, is governed by the law of the State of the habitual residence of the child.

2          The attribution or extinction of parental responsibility by an agreement or a unilateral act, without intervention of a judicial or administrative authority, is governed by the law of the State of the child’s habitual residence at the time when the agreement or unilateral act takes effect.

3          Parental responsibility which exists under the law of the State of the child’s habitual residence subsists after a change of that habitual residence to another State.

4          If the child’s habitual residence changes, the attribution of parental responsibility by operation of law to a person who does not already have such responsibility is governed by the law of the State of the new habitual residence.

_Article 17_

The exercise of parental responsibility is governed by the law of the State of the child’s habitual residence. If the child’s habitual residence changes, it is governed by the law of the State of the new habitual residence.

_Article 18_

The parental responsibility referred to in Article 16 may be terminated, or the conditions of its exercise modified, by measures taken under this Convention.

_Article 19_

1          The validity of a transaction entered into between a third party and another person who would be entitled to act as the child’s legal representative under the law of the State where the transaction was concluded cannot be contested, and the third party cannot be held liable, on the sole ground that the other person was not entitled to act as the child’s legal representative under the law designated by the provisions of this Chapter, unless the third party knew or should have known that the parental responsibility was governed by the latter law.

2          The preceding paragraph applies only if the transaction was entered into between persons present on the territory of the same State.

_Article 20_

The provisions of this Chapter apply even if the law designated by them is the law of a non‑Contracting State.

_Article 21_

1          In this Chapter the term “law” means the law in force in a State other than its choice of law rules.

2          However, if the law applicable according to Article 16 is that of a non‑Contracting State and if the choice of law rules of that State designate the law of another non‑Contracting State which would apply its own law, the law of the latter State applies. If that other non‑Contracting State would not apply its own law, the applicable law is that designated by Article 16.

_Article 22_

The application of the law designated by the provisions of this Chapter can be refused only if this application would be manifestly contrary to public policy, taking into account the best interests of the child.

CHAPTER IV—RECOGNITION AND ENFORCEMENT

_Article 23_

1          The measures taken by the authorities of a Contracting   State shall be recognised by operation of law in all other Contracting States.

2          Recognition may however be refused—

_a_          if the measure was taken by an authority whose jurisdiction was not based on one of the grounds provided for in Chapter II;

_b_          if the measure was taken, except in a case of urgency, in the context of a judicial or administrative proceeding, without the child having been provided the opportunity to be heard, in violation of fundamental principles of procedure of the requested State;

_c_          on the request of any person claiming that the measure infringes his or her parental responsibility, if such measure was taken, except in a case of urgency, without such person having been given an opportunity to be heard;

_d_          if such recognition is manifestly contrary to public policy of the requested State, taking into account the best interests of the child;

_e_          if the measure is incompatible with a later measure taken in the non‑Contracting State of the habitual residence of the child, where this later measure fulfils the requirements for recognition in the requested State;

_f_           if the procedure provided in Article 33 has not been complied with.

_Article 24_

Without prejudice to Article 23, paragraph 1, any interested person may request from the competent authorities of a Contracting State that they decide on the recognition or non‑recognition of a measure taken in another Contracting   State. The procedure is governed by the law of the requested State.

_Article 25_

The authority of the requested State is bound by the findings of fact on which the authority of the State where the measure was taken based its jurisdiction.

_Article 26_

1          If measures taken in one Contracting State and enforceable there require enforcement in another Contracting State, they shall, upon request by an interested party, be declared enforceable or registered for the purpose of enforcement in that other State according to the procedure provided in the law of the latter State.

2          Each Contracting State shall apply to the declaration of enforceability or registration a simple and rapid procedure.

3          The declaration of enforceability or registration may be refused only for one of the reasons set out in Article 23, paragraph 2.

_Article 27_

Without prejudice to such review as is necessary in the application of the preceding Articles, there shall be no review of the merits of the measure taken.

_Article 28_

Measures taken in one Contracting   State and declared enforceable, or registered for the purpose of enforcement, in another Contracting State shall be enforced in the latter State as if they had been taken by the authorities of that State. Enforcement takes place in accordance with the law of the requested State to the extent provided by such law, taking into consideration the best interests of the child.

CHAPTER V—CO‑OPERATION

_Article 29_

1          A Contracting State shall designate a Central Authority to discharge the duties which are imposed by the Convention on such authorities.

2          Federal States, States with more than one system of law or States having autonomous territorial units shall be free to appoint more than one Central Authority and to specify the territorial or personal extent of their functions. Where a State has appointed more than one Central Authority, it shall designate the Central Authority to which any communication may be addressed for transmission to the appropriate Central Authority within that State.

_Article 30_

1          Central Authorities shall co‑operate with each other and promote co‑operation amongst the competent authorities in their States to achieve the purposes of the Convention.

2          They shall, in connection with the application of the Convention, take appropriate steps to provide information as to the laws of, and services available in, their States relating to the protection of children.

_Article 31_

The Central Authority of a Contracting   State, either directly or through public authorities or other bodies, shall take all appropriate steps to—

_a_          facilitate the communications and offer the assistance provided for in Articles 8 and 9 and in this Chapter;

_b_          facilitate, by mediation, conciliation or similar means, agreed solutions for the protection of the person or property of the child in situations to which the Convention applies;

_c_          provide, on the request of a competent authority of another Contracting State, assistance in discovering the whereabouts of a child where it appears that the child may be present and in need of protection within the territory of the requested State.

_Article 32_

On a request made with supporting reasons by the Central Authority or other competent authority of any Contracting State with which the child has a substantial connection, the Central Authority of the Contracting State in which the child is habitually resident and present may, directly or through public authorities or other bodies,

_a_          provide a report on the situation of the child;

_b_          request the competent authority of its State to consider the need to take measures for the protection of the person or property of the child.

_Article 33_

1          If an authority having jurisdiction under Articles 5 to 10 contemplates the placement of the child in a foster family or institutional care, or the provision of care by _kafala_ or an analogous institution, and if such placement or such provision of care is to take place in another Contracting State, it shall first consult with the Central Authority or other competent authority of the latter State. To that effect it shall transmit a report on the child together with the reasons for the proposed placement or provision of care.

2          The decision on the placement or provision of care may be made in the requesting State only if the Central Authority or other competent authority of the requested State has consented to the placement or provision of care, taking into account the child’s best interests.

_Article 34_

1          Where a measure of protection is contemplated, the competent authorities under the Convention, if the situation of the child so requires, may request any authority of another Contracting State which has information relevant to the protection of the child to communicate such information.

2          A Contracting State may declare that requests under paragraph 1 shall be communicated to its authorities only through its Central Authority.

_Article 35_

1          The competent authorities of a Contracting State may request the authorities of another Contracting State to assist in the implementation of measures of protection taken under this Convention, especially in securing the effective exercise of rights of access as well as of the right to maintain direct contacts on a regular basis.

2          The authorities of a Contracting State in which the child does not habitually reside may, on the request of a parent residing in that State who is seeking to obtain or to maintain access to the child, gather information or evidence and may make a finding on the suitability of that parent to exercise access and on the conditions under which access is to be exercised. An authority exercising jurisdiction under Articles 5 to 10 to determine an application concerning access to the child, shall admit and consider such information, evidence and finding before reaching its decision.

3          An authority having jurisdiction under Articles 5 to 10 to decide on access may adjourn a proceeding pending the outcome of a request made under paragraph 2, in particular, when it is considering an application to restrict or terminate access rights granted in the State of the child’s former habitual residence.

4          Nothing in this Article shall prevent an authority having jurisdiction under Articles 5 to 10 from taking provisional measures pending the outcome of the request made under paragraph 2.

_Article 36_

In any case where the child is exposed to a serious danger, the competent authorities of the Contracting State where measures for the protection of the child have been taken or are under consideration, if they are informed that the child’s residence has changed to, or that the child is present in another State, shall inform the authorities of that other State about the danger involved and the measures taken or under consideration.

_Article 37_

An authority shall not request or transmit any information under this Chapter if to do so would, in its opinion, be likely to place the child’s person or property in danger, or constitute a serious threat to the liberty or life of a member of the child’s family.

_Article 38_

1          Without prejudice to the possibility of imposing reasonable charges for the provision of services, Central Authorities and other public authorities of Contracting States shall bear their own costs in applying the provisions of this Chapter.

2          Any Contracting State may enter into agreements with one or more other Contracting States concerning the allocation of charges.

_Article 39_

Any Contracting State may enter into agreements with one or more other Contracting States with a view to improving the application of this Chapter in their mutual relations. The States which have concluded such an agreement shall transmit a copy to the depositary of the Convention.

CHAPTER VI—GENERAL PROVISIONS

_Article 40_

2          The declaration referred to in Article 34, paragraph 2, shall be made to the depositary of the Convention.

_Article 46_

A Contracting State in which different systems of law or sets of rules of law apply to the protection of the child and his or her property shall not be bound to apply the rules of the Convention to conflicts solely between such different systems or sets of rules of law.

_Article 47_

In relation to a State in which two or more systems of law or sets of rules of law with regard to any matter dealt with in this Convention apply in different territorial units—

1          any reference to habitual residence in that State shall be construed as referring to habitual residence in a territorial unit;

2          any reference to the presence of the child in that State shall be construed as referring to presence in a territorial unit;

3          any reference to the location of property of the child in that State shall be construed as referring to location of property of the child in a territorial unit;

4          any reference to the State of which the child is a national shall be construed as referring to the territorial unit designated by the law of that State or, in the absence of relevant rules, to the territorial unit with which the child has the closest connection;

5          any reference to the State whose authorities are seised of an application for divorce or legal separation of the child’s parents, or for annulment of their marriage, shall be construed as referring to the territorial unit whose authorities are seised of such application;

9          any reference to the law or procedure or authority of the State in which a measure has been taken shall be construed as referring to the law or procedure or authority of the territorial unit in which such measure was taken;

10        any reference to the law or procedure or authority of the requested State shall be construed as referring to the law or procedure or authority of the territorial unit in which recognition or enforcement is sought.

_Article 48_

For the purpose of identifying the applicable law under Chapter III, in relation to a State which comprises two or more territorial units each of which has its own system of law or set of rules of law in respect of matters covered by this Convention, the following rules apply—

_a_          if there are rules in force in such a State identifying which territorial unit’s law is applicable, the law of that unit applies;

_b_          in the absence of such rules, the law of the relevant territorial unit as defined in Article 47 applies.

_Article 49_

For the purpose of identifying the applicable law under Chapter III, in relation to a State which has two or more systems of law or sets of rules of law applicable to different categories of persons in respect of matters covered by this Convention, the following rules apply—

_a_          if there are rules in force in such a State identifying which among such laws applies, that law applies;

_b_          in the absence of such rules, the law of the system or the set of rules of law with which the child has the closest connection applies.

_Article 50_

This Convention shall not affect the application of the _Convention of 25 October 1980 on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction_, as between Parties to both Conventions. Nothing, however, precludes provisions of this Convention from being invoked for the purposes of obtaining the return of a child who has been wrongfully removed or retained or of organising access rights.

_Article 51_

In relations between the Contracting States this Convention replaces the _Convention of 5 October 1961 concerning the powers of authorities and the law applicable in respect of the protection of minors, and the Convention governing the guardianship of minors_, signed at The Hague 12 June 1902, without prejudice to the recognition of measures taken under the Convention of 5 October 1961 mentioned above.

_Article 52_

1          This Convention does not affect any international instrument to which Contracting States are Parties and which contains provisions on matters governed by the Convention, unless a contrary declaration is made by the States Parties to such instrument.

2          This Convention does not affect the possibility for one or more Contracting States to conclude agreements which contain, in respect of children habitually resident in any of the States Parties to such agreements, provisions on matters governed by this Convention.

3          Agreements to be concluded by one or more Contracting States on matters within the scope of this Convention do not affect, in the relationship of such States with other Contracting States, the application of the provisions of this Convention.

4          The preceding paragraphs also apply to uniform laws based on special ties of a regional or other nature between the States concerned.

_Article 53_

1          The Convention shall apply to measures only if they are taken in a State after the Convention has entered into force for that State.

2          The Convention shall apply to the recognition and enforcement of measures taken after its entry into force as between the State where the measures have been taken and the requested State.

_Article 54_

1          Any communication sent to the Central Authority or to another authority of a Contracting State shall be in the original language, and shall be accompanied by a translation into the official language or one of the official languages of the other State or, where that is not feasible, a translation into French or English.

2          However, a Contracting State may, by making a reservation in accordance with Article 60, object to the use of either French or English, but not both.

_Article 55_

1          A Contracting State may, in accordance with Article 60,

_a_          reserve the jurisdiction of its authorities to take measures directed to the protection of property of a child situated on its territory;

_b_          reserve the right not to recognise any parental responsibility or measure in so far as it is incompatible with any measure taken by its authorities in relation to that property.

2          The reservation may be restricted to certain categories of property.

_Article 56_

The Secretary General of the Hague Conference on Private International Law shall at regular intervals convoke a Special Commission in order to review the practical operation of the Convention.
