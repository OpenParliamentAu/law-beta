                     (a)  a divorce order in relation to a marriage; or

                     (b)  a decree of nullity of marriage;

          (1B)  An application for a divorce order in relation to a marriage shall not, without the leave of the court granted under subsection (1C), be filed within the period of 2 years after the date of the marriage unless there is filed with the application a certificate:

                     (a)  stating that the parties to the marriage have considered a reconciliation with the assistance of a specified person, who is:

                              (i)  a family counsellor; or

                             (ii)  if the court is the Family Court, the Federal Magistrates Court or the Family Court of a State—an individual or an organisation nominated for the parties by a family consultant; or

                            (iii)  if the court is not the Family Court, the Federal Magistrates Court or the Family Court of a State—an individual or an organisation nominated for the parties by an appropriately qualified officer of the court; and

                     (b)  signed by that person or on behalf of that organisation, as the case may be.

          (1C)  Notwithstanding subsection (1B), if the court is satisfied that there are special circumstances by reason of which the hearing of an application for a divorce order in relation to a marriage should proceed notwithstanding that the parties have not considered a reconciliation with assistance of the kind referred to in subsection (1B), the court may:

                     (a)  if the application has not been filed—give leave for the application to be filed; or

                     (b)  if the application has been filed—at any time before or during the hearing of the application, declare that it is so satisfied;

and, where the court makes a declaration under paragraph (b), the application shall be deemed to have been duly filed and everything done pursuant to that application shall be as valid and effectual as if the court had, before the application was filed, given leave under paragraph (a) for the application to be filed.

             (2)  Notwithstanding subsections (3) and (3A), a respondent may, in an answer to an application, include an application for any decree or declaration under this Act.

                     (a)  a divorce order has taken effect; or

proceedings of a kind referred to in paragraph (c), (caa), (ca) or (cb) of the definition of **_matrimonial cause_** in subsection 4(1) (not being proceedings under section 78 or 79A or proceedings seeking the discharge, suspension, revival or variation of an order previously made in proceedings with respect to the maintenance of a party) shall not be instituted, except by leave of the court in which the proceedings are to be instituted or with the consent of both of the parties to the marriage, after the expiration of 12 months after:

                     (c)  in a case referred to in paragraph (a)—the date on which the divorce order took effect; or

                     (d)  in a case referred to in paragraph (b)—the date of the making of the decree.

The court may grant such leave at any time, even if the proceedings have already been instituted.

       (3AA)  However, if such proceedings are instituted with the consent of both of the parties to the marriage, the court may dismiss the proceedings if it is satisfied that, because the consent was obtained by fraud, duress or unconscionable conduct, allowing the proceedings to continue would amount to a miscarriage of justice.

          (3A)  Notwithstanding subsection (3), where, whether before or after the commencement of section 21 of the _Family Law Amendment Act 1983_:

                     (a)  a divorce order has taken effect or a decree of nullity of marriage has been made; and

                     (b)  the approval under section 87 of a maintenance agreement between the parties to the marriage has been revoked;

                     (c)  within the period of 12 months after:

                              (i)  the date on which the divorce order took effect or the date of the making of the decree of nullity, as the case may be; or

                             (ii)  the date on which the approval of the maintenance agreement was revoked;

                            whichever is the later; or

          (1C)  If the court subsequently gives leave to a party to object to the proceedings being so heard and determined, the court must transfer the proceedings to:

                     (a)  the Family Court; or

                     (b)  the Supreme Court of a State or Territory; or

             (5)  Without prejudice to the duty of a court of summary jurisdiction to comply with this section, failure by such a court so to comply does not invalidate any order of the court in the proceedings.

##### <a id="50"></a>50  Effect of resumption of cohabitation

             (1)  For the purposes of proceedings for a divorce order, where, after the parties to the marriage separated, they resumed cohabitation on one occasion but, within a period of 3 months after the resumption of cohabitation, they again separated and thereafter lived separately and apart up to the date of the filing of the application, the periods of living separately and apart before and after the period of cohabitation may be aggregated as if they were one continuous period, but the period of cohabitation shall not be deemed to be part of the period of living separately and apart.

             (2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), a period of cohabitation shall be deemed to have continued during any interruption of the cohabitation that, in the opinion of the court, was not substantial.

             (3)  For the purposes of this section, a child (including an ex‑nuptial child of either the husband or the wife, a child adopted by either of them or a child who is not a child of either of them) is a child of the marriage if the child was treated by the husband and wife as a child of their family at the relevant time.

#### Subdivision BA—Best interests of the child

##### <a id="60CA"></a>60CA  Child’s best interests paramount consideration in making a parenting order

                   In deciding whether to make a particular parenting order in relation to a child, a court must regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration.

##### <a id="60CB"></a>60CB  Proceedings to which Subdivision applies

             (1)  This Subdivision applies to any proceedings under this Part in which the best interests of a child are the paramount consideration.

Note:          Division 10 also allows a court to make an order for a child’s interests to be independently represented by a lawyer in proceedings under this Part in which the best interests of a child are the paramount consideration.

             (2)  This Subdivision also applies to proceedings, in relation to a child, to which subsection 60G(2), 63F(2) or 63F(6) or section 68R applies.

##### <a id="60CC"></a>60CC  How a court determines what is in a child’s best interests

Determining child’s best interests

             (1)  Subject to subsection (5), in determining what is in the child’s best interests, the court must consider the matters set out in subsections (2) and (3).

Primary considerations

             (2)  The primary considerations are:

                     (a)  the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents; and

                     (b)  the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.

Note:          Making these considerations the primary ones is consistent with the objects of this Part set out in paragraphs 60B(1)(a) and (b).

Additional considerations

             (3)  Additional considerations are:

                     (a)  any views expressed by the child and any factors (such as the child’s maturity or level of understanding) that the court thinks are relevant to the weight it should give to the child’s views;

                     (b)  the nature of the relationship of the child with:

                              (i)  each of the child’s parents; and

                             (ii)  other persons (including any grandparent or other relative of the child);

                     (c)  the willingness and ability of each of the child’s parents to facilitate, and encourage, a close and continuing relationship between the child and the other parent;

                     (d)  the likely effect of any changes in the child’s circumstances, including the likely effect on the child of any separation from:

                              (i)  either of his or her parents; or

                             (ii)  any other child, or other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child), with whom he or she has been living;

                     (e)  the practical difficulty and expense of a child spending time with and communicating with a parent and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect the child’s right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis;

                      (f)  the capacity of:

                              (i)  each of the child’s parents; and

                             (ii)  any other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child);

                            to provide for the needs of the child, including emotional and intellectual needs;

                     (g)  the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of the child and of either of the child’s parents, and any other characteristics of the child that the court thinks are relevant;

                     (h)  if the child is an Aboriginal child or a Torres Strait Islander child:

                              (i)  the child’s right to enjoy his or her Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander culture (including the right to enjoy that culture with other people who share that culture); and

                             (ii)  the likely impact any proposed parenting order under this Part will have on that right;

                      (i)  the attitude to the child, and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of the child’s parents;

                      (j)  any family violence involving the child or a member of the child’s family;

                     (k)  any family violence order that applies to the child or a member of the child’s family, if:

                              (i)  the order is a final order; or

                             (ii)  the making of the order was contested by a person;

                      (l)  whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to the child;

                    (m)  any other fact or circumstance that the court thinks is relevant.

             (4)  Without limiting paragraphs (3)(c) and (i), the court must consider the extent to which each of the child’s parents has fulfilled, or failed to fulfil, his or her responsibilities as a parent and, in particular, the extent to which each of the child’s parents:

                     (a)  has taken, or failed to take, the opportunity:

                              (i)  to participate in making decisions about major long‑term issues in relation to the child; and

                             (ii)  to spend time with the child; and

                            (iii)  to communicate with the child; and

                     (b)  has facilitated, or failed to facilitate, the other parent:

                              (i)  participating in making decisions about major long‑term issues in relation to the child; and

                             (ii)  spending time with the child; and

                            (iii)  communicating with the child; and

                     (c)  has fulfilled, or failed to fulfil, the parent’s obligation to maintain the child.

          (4A)  If the child’s parents have separated, the court must, in applying subsection (4), have regard, in particular, to events that have happened, and circumstances that have existed, since the separation occurred.

Consent orders

             (5)  If the court is considering whether to make an order with the consent of all the parties to the proceedings, the court may, but is not required to, have regard to all or any of the matters set out in subsection (2) or (3).

Right to enjoy Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander culture

             (6)  For the purposes of paragraph (3)(h), an Aboriginal child’s or a Torres Strait Islander child’s right to enjoy his or her Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander culture includes the right:

                     (a)  to maintain a connection with that culture; and

                     (b)  to have the support, opportunity and encouragement necessary:

                              (i)  to explore the full extent of that culture, consistent with the child’s age and developmental level and the child’s views; and

                             (ii)  to develop a positive appreciation of that culture.

##### <a id="60CD"></a>60CD  How the views of a child are expressed

             (1)  Paragraph 60CC(3)(a) requires the court to consider any views expressed by a child in deciding whether to make a particular parenting order in relation to the child. This section deals with how the court informs itself of views expressed by a child.

             (2)  The court may inform itself of views expressed by a child:

                     (a)  by having regard to anything contained in a report given to the court under subsection 62G(2); or

                     (b)  by making an order under section 68L for the child’s interests in the proceedings to be independently represented by a lawyer; or

                     (c)  subject to the applicable Rules of Court, by such other means as the court thinks appropriate.

Note 1:       Paragraph (a)—subsection 62G(3A) generally requires the person giving the report to ascertain the child’s views and include those views in the report.

Note 2:       Paragraph (b)—paragraph 68LA(5)(b) requires the independent children’s lawyer for the child to ensure that the child’s views are fully put before the court.

##### <a id="60CE"></a>60CE  Children not required to express views

                   Nothing in this Part permits the court or any person to require the child to express his or her views in relation to any matter.

##### <a id="60CF"></a>60CF  Informing court of relevant family violence orders

             (1)  If a party to the proceedings is aware that a family violence order applies to the child, or a member of the child’s family, that party must inform the court of the family violence order.

             (2)  If a person who is not a party to the proceedings is aware that a family violence order applies to the child, or a member of the child’s family, that person may inform the court of the family violence order.

             (3)  Failure to inform the court of the family violence order does not affect the validity of any order made by the court.

##### <a id="60CG"></a>60CG  Court to consider risk of family violence

             (1)  In considering what order to make, the court must, to the extent that it is possible to do so consistently with the child’s best interests being the paramount consideration, ensure that the order:

                     (a)  is consistent with any family violence order; and

                     (b)  does not expose a person to an unacceptable risk of family violence.

             (2)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), the court may include in the order any safeguards that it considers necessary for the safety of those affected by the order.

#### Subdivision C—Interpretation and application of Part

##### <a id="60E"></a>60E  Application of Part to void marriages

                   This Part applies in relation to a purported marriage that is void as if:

                     (a)  the purported marriage were a marriage; and

                     (b)  the parties to the purported marriage were husband and wife.

#### Subdivision D—Interpretation—how this Act applies to certain children

##### <a id="60EA"></a>60EA  Definition of _de facto partner_

                   For the purposes of this Subdivision, a person is the **_de facto partner_** of another person if:

                     (a)  a relationship between the person and the other person (whether of the same sex or a different sex) is registered under a law of a State or Territory prescribed for the purposes of section 2E of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ as a kind of relationship prescribed for the purposes of that section; or

                     (b)  the person is in a de facto relationship with the other person.

##### <a id="60F"></a>60F  Certain children are children of marriage etc.

             (1)  A reference in this Act to a child of a marriage includes, subject to subsection (3), a reference to each of the following children:

                     (a)  a child adopted since the marriage by the husband and wife or by either of them with the consent of the other;

                     (b)  a child of the husband and wife born before the marriage;

                     (c)  a child who is, under subsection 60H(1) or section 60HB, the child of the husband and wife.

             (2)  A reference in this Act to a child of a marriage includes a reference to a child of:

                     (a)  a marriage that has been terminated by divorce or annulled (in Australia or elsewhere); or

                     (b)  a marriage that has been terminated by the death of one party to the marriage.

             (3)  A child of a marriage who is adopted by a person who, before the adoption, is not a prescribed adopting parent ceases to be a child of that marriage for the purposes of this Act.

             (4)  The following provisions apply in relation to a child of a marriage who is adopted by a prescribed adopting parent:

                     (a)  if a court granted leave under section 60G for the adoption proceedings to be commenced—the child ceases to be a child of the marriage for the purposes of this Act;

                     (b)  in any other case—the child continues to be a child of the marriage for the purposes of this Act.

          (4A)  To avoid doubt, for the purposes of this Act, a child of a marriage is a child of the husband and of the wife in the marriage.

             (5)  In this section:

                    <a name="act"></a>**_this Act_** includes:

                     (a)  the standard Rules of Court; and

                     (b)  the related Federal Magistrates Rules.

##### <a id="60G"></a>60G  Family Court may grant leave for adoption proceedings by prescribed adopting parent

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), the Family Court, the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory or the Family Court of a State may grant leave for proceedings to be commenced for the adoption of a child by a prescribed adopting parent.

             (2)  In proceedings for leave under subsection (1), the court must consider whether granting leave would be in the child’s best interests, having regard to the effect of paragraph 60F(4)(a), or paragraph 60HA(3)(a), and of sections 61E and 65J.

Note:          Sections 60CB to 60CG deal with how a court determines a child’s best interests.

##### <a id="60H"></a>60H  Children born as a result of artificial conception procedures

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a child is born to a woman as a result of the carrying out of an artificial conception procedure while the woman was married to, or a de facto partner of, another person (the **_other intended parent_**); and

                     (b)  either:

                              (i)  the woman and the other intended parent consented to the carrying out of the procedure, and any other person who provided genetic material used in the procedure consented to the use of the material in an artificial conception procedure; or

                             (ii)  under a prescribed law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory, the child is a child of the woman and of the other intended parent;

then, whether or not the child is biologically a child of the woman and of the other intended parent, for the purposes of this Act:

                     (c)  the child is the child of the woman and of the other intended parent; and

                     (d)  if a person other than the woman and the other intended parent provided genetic material—the child is not the child of that person.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  a child is born to a woman as a result of the carrying out of an artificial conception procedure; and

                     (b)  under a prescribed law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory, the child is a child of the woman;

then, whether or not the child is biologically a child of the woman, the child is her child for the purposes of this Act.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  a child is born to a woman as a result of the carrying out of an artificial conception procedure; and

                     (b)  under a prescribed law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory, the child is a child of a man;

then, whether or not the child is biologically a child of the man, the child is his child for the purposes of this Act.

             (5)  For the purposes of subsection (1), a person is to be presumed to have consented to an artificial conception procedure being carried out unless it is proved, on the balance of probabilities, that the person did not consent.

                     (b)  the child is adopted by the person and the person’s de facto partner or by either of them with the consent of the other; or

                     (c)  the child is, under subsection 60H(1) or section 60HB, a child of the person and the person’s de facto partner.

This subsection has effect subject to subsection (2).

             (2)  A child of current or former de facto partners ceases to be a child of those partners for the purposes of this Act if the child is adopted by a person who, before the adoption, is not a prescribed adopting parent.

             (3)  The following provisions apply in relation to a child of current or former de facto partners who is adopted by a prescribed adopting parent:

                     (a)  if a court granted leave under section 60G for the adoption proceedings to be commenced—the child ceases to be a child of those partners for the purposes of this Act;

                     (b)  in any other case—the child continues to be a child of those partners for the purposes of this Act.

#### Subdivision E—Family dispute resolution

##### <a id="60I"></a>60I  Attending family dispute resolution before applying for Part VII order

Object of this section

             (1)  The object of this section is to ensure that all persons who have a dispute about matters that may be dealt with by an order under this Part (a **_Part VII order_**) make a genuine effort to resolve that dispute by family dispute resolution before the Part VII order is applied for.

Phase 1 (from commencement to 30 June 2007)

             (2)  The dispute resolution provisions of the _Family Law Rules 2004_ impose the requirements for dispute resolution that must be complied with before an application is made to the Family Court of Australia for a parenting order.

             (3)  By force of this subsection, the dispute resolution provisions of the _Family Law Rules 2004_ also apply to an application to a court (other than the Family Court of Australia) for a parenting order. Those provisions apply to the application with such modifications as are necessary.

             (4)  Subsection (3) applies to an application for a parenting order if the application is made:

                     (a)  on or after the commencement of this section; and

                     (b)  before 1 July 2007.

Phase 2 (from 1 July 2007 to 30 June 2008)

             (5)  Subsections (7) to (12) apply to an application for a Part VII order in relation to a child if:

                     (a)  the application is made on or after 1 July 2007 and before 1 July 2008; and

                     (b)  none of the parties to the proceedings on the application has applied, before 1 July 2007, for a Part VII order in relation to the child.

Phase 3 (from 1 July 2008)

             (6)  Subsections (7) to (12) apply to all applications for a Part VII order in relation to a child that are made on or after 1 July 2008.

Requirement to attempt to resolve dispute by family dispute resolution before applying for a parenting order

             (7)  Subject to subsection (9), a court exercising jurisdiction under this Act must not hear an application for a Part VII order in relation to a child unless the applicant files in the court a certificate given to the applicant by a family dispute resolution practitioner under subsection (8). The certificate must be filed with the application for the Part VII order.

Certificate by family dispute resolution practitioner

             (8)  A family dispute resolution practitioner may give one of these kinds of certificates to a person:

                     (a)  a certificate to the effect that the person did not attend family dispute resolution with the practitioner and the other party or parties to the proceedings in relation to the issue or issues that the order would deal with, but the person’s failure to do so was due to the refusal, or the failure, of the other party or parties to the proceedings to attend;

                    (aa)  a certificate to the effect that the person did not attend family dispute resolution with the practitioner and the other party or parties to the proceedings in relation to the issue or issues that the order would deal with, because the practitioner considers, having regard to the matters prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph, that it would not be appropriate to conduct the proposed family dispute resolution;

                     (b)  a certificate to the effect that the person attended family dispute resolution with the practitioner and the other party or parties to the proceedings in relation to the issue or issues that the order would deal with, and that all attendees made a genuine effort to resolve the issue or issues;

                     (c)  a certificate to the effect that the person attended family dispute resolution with the practitioner and the other party or parties to the proceedings in relation to the issue or issues that the order would deal with, but that the person, the other party or another of the parties did not make a genuine effort to resolve the issue or issues;

                     (d)  a certificate to the effect that the person began attending family dispute resolution with the practitioner and the other party or parties to the proceedings in relation to the issue or issues that the order would deal with, but that the practitioner considers, having regard to the matters prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph, that it would not be appropriate to continue the family dispute resolution.

Note:          When an applicant files one of these certificates under subsection (7), the court may take the kind of certificate into account in considering whether to make an order referring to parties to family dispute resolution (see section 13C) and in determining whether to award costs against a party (see section 117).

Exception

             (9)  Subsection (7) does not apply to an application for a Part VII order in relation to a child if:

                     (a)  the applicant is applying for the order:

                              (i)  to be made with the consent of all the parties to the proceedings; or

                             (ii)  in response to an application that another party to the proceedings has made for a Part VII order; or

                     (b)  the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that:

                              (i)  there has been abuse of the child by one of the parties to the proceedings; or

                             (ii)  there would be a risk of abuse of the child if there were to be a delay in applying for the order; or

                            (iii)  there has been family violence by one of the parties to the proceedings; or

                            (iv)  there is a risk of family violence by one of the parties to the proceedings; or

                     (c)  all the following conditions are satisfied:

                              (i)  the application is made in relation to a particular issue;

                             (ii)  a Part VII order has been made in relation to that issue within the period of 12 months before the application is made;

                            (iii)  the application is made in relation to a contravention of the order by a person;

                            (iv)  the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person has behaved in a way that shows a serious disregard for his or her obligations under the order; or

                     (d)  the application is made in circumstances of urgency; or

                     (e)  one or more of the parties to the proceedings is unable to participate effectively in family dispute resolution (whether because of an incapacity of some kind, physical remoteness from dispute resolution services or for some other reason); or

                      (f)  other circumstances specified in the regulations are satisfied.

Referral to family dispute resolution when exception applies

           (10)  If:

                     (a)  a person applies for a Part VII order; and

                     (b)  the person does not, before applying for the order, attend family dispute resolution with a family dispute resolution practitioner and the other party or parties to the proceedings in relation to the issue or issues that the order would deal with; and

                     (c)  subsection (7) does not apply to the application because of subsection (9);

the court must consider making an order that the person attend family dispute resolution with a family dispute resolution practitioner and the other party or parties to the proceedings in relation to that issue or those issues.

           (11)  The validity of:

                     (a)  proceedings on an application for a Part VII order; or

                     (b)  any order made in those proceedings;

is not affected by a failure to comply with subsection (7) in relation to those proceedings.

           (12)  In this section:

                    <a name="disput-resolut-provision"></a>**_dispute resolution provisions_** of the _Family Law Rules 2004_ means:

                     (a)  Rule 1.05 of those Rules; and

                     (b)  Part 2 of Schedule 1 to those Rules;

to the extent to which they deal with dispute resolution.

##### <a id="60J"></a>60J  Family dispute resolution not attended because of child abuse or family violence

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  subsections 60I(7) to (12) apply to an application for a Part VII order (see subsections 60I(5) and (6)); and

                     (b)  subsection 60I(7) does not apply to the application because the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that:

                              (i)  there has been abuse of the child by one of the parties to the proceedings; or

                             (ii)  there has been family violence by one of the parties to the proceedings;

a court must not hear the application unless the applicant has indicated in writing that the applicant has received information from a family counsellor or family dispute resolution practitioner about the services and options (including alternatives to court action) available in circumstances of abuse or violence.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply if the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that:

                     (a)  there would be a risk of abuse of the child if there were to be a delay in applying for the order; or

                     (b)  there is a risk of family violence by one of the parties to the proceedings.

             (3)  The validity of:

                     (a)  proceedings on an application for a Part VII order; or

                     (b)  any order made in those proceedings;

is not affected by a failure to comply with subsection (1) in relation to those proceedings.

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  the applicant indicates in writing that the applicant has not received information about the services and options (including alternatives to court action) available in circumstances of abuse or violence; and

                     (b)  subsection (2) does not apply;

the principal executive officer of the court concerned must ensure that the applicant is referred to a family counsellor or family dispute resolution practitioner in order to obtain information about those matters.

##### <a id="60K"></a>60K    Court to take prompt action in relation to allegations of child abuse or family violence

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  an application is made to a court for a Part VII order in relation to a child; and

                     (b)  a document is filed in the court, on or after the commencement of this section, in relation to the proceedings for the order; and

                     (c)  the document alleges, as a consideration that is relevant to whether the court should grant or refuse the application, that:

                              (i)  there has been abuse of the child by one of the parties to the proceedings; or

                             (ii)  there would be a risk of abuse of the child if there were to be a delay in applying for the order; or

                            (iii)  there has been family violence by one of the parties to the proceedings; or

                            (iv)  there is a risk of family violence by one of the parties to the proceedings; and

                     (d)  the document is a document of the kind prescribed by the applicable Rules of Court for the purposes of this paragraph.

             (2)  The court must:

                     (a)  consider what interim or procedural orders (if any) should be made:

                              (i)  to enable appropriate evidence about the allegation to be obtained as expeditiously as possible; and

                             (ii)  to protect the child or any of the parties to the proceedings; and

                     (b)  make such orders of that kind as the court considers appropriate; and

                     (c)  deal with the issues raised by the allegation as expeditiously as possible.

          (2A)  The court must take the action required by paragraphs (2)(a) and (b):

                     (a)  as soon as practicable after the document is filed; and

                     (b)  if it is appropriate having regard to the circumstances of the case—within 8 weeks after the document is filed.

             (3)  Without limiting subparagraph (2)(a)(i), the court must consider whether orders should be made under section 69ZW to obtain reports from State and Territory agencies in relation to the allegations.

             (4)  Without limiting paragraph (2)(a)(ii), the court must consider whether orders should be made, or an injunction granted, under section 68B.

             (5)  A failure to comply with a provision of this section in relation to an application does not affect the validity of any order made in the proceedings in relation to the application.

### Division 2—Parental responsibility

##### <a id="61A"></a>61A  What this Division does

                   This Division deals with the concept of parental responsibility including, in particular:

                     (a)  what parental responsibility is; and

                     (b)  who has parental responsibility.

##### <a id="61B"></a>61B  Meaning of _parental responsibility_

                   In this Part, **_parental responsibility_**, in relation to a child, means all the duties, powers, responsibilities and authority which, by law, parents have in relation to children.

##### <a id="61C"></a>61C  Each parent has parental responsibility (subject to court orders)

             (1)  Each of the parents of a child who is not 18 has parental responsibility for the child.

Note 1:       This section states the legal position that prevails in relation to parental responsibility to the extent to which it is not displaced by a parenting order made by the court. See subsection (3) of this section and subsection 61D(2) for the effect of a parenting order.

Note 2:       This section does not establish a presumption to be applied by the court when making a parenting order. See section 61DA for the presumption that the court does apply when making a parenting order.

Note 3:       Under section 63C, the parents of a child may make a parenting plan that deals with the allocation of parental responsibility for the child.

             (2)  Subsection (1) has effect despite any changes in the nature of the relationships of the child’s parents. It is not affected, for example, by the parents becoming separated or by either or both of them marrying or re‑marrying.

             (3)  Subsection (1) has effect subject to any order of a court for the time being in force (whether or not made under this Act and whether made before or after the commencement of this section).

Note:          Section 111CS may affect the attribution of parental responsibility for a child.

##### <a id="61D"></a>61D  Parenting orders and parental responsibility

             (1)  A parenting order confers parental responsibility for a child on a person, but only to the extent to which the order confers on the person duties, powers, responsibilities or authority in relation to the child.

             (2)  A parenting order in relation to a child does not take away or diminish any aspect of the parental responsibility of any person for the child except to the extent (if any):

                     (a)  expressly provided for in the order; or

                     (b)  necessary to give effect to the order.

##### <a id="61DA"></a>61DA  Presumption of equal shared parental responsibility when making parenting orders

             (1)  When making a parenting order in relation to a child, the court must apply a presumption that it is in the best interests of the child for the child’s parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child.

Note:          The presumption provided for in this subsection is a presumption that relates solely to the allocation of parental responsibility for a child as defined in section 61B. It does not provide for a presumption about the amount of time the child spends with each of the parents (this issue is dealt with in section 65DAA).

             (2)  The presumption does not apply if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a parent of the child (or a person who lives with a parent of the child) has engaged in:

                     (a)  abuse of the child or another child who, at the time, was a member of the parent’s family (or that other person’s family); or

                     (b)  family violence.

             (3)  When the court is making an interim order, the presumption applies unless the court considers that it would not be appropriate in the circumstances for the presumption to be applied when making that order.

             (4)  The presumption may be rebutted by evidence that satisfies the court that it would not be in the best interests of the child for the child’s parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child.

##### <a id="61DB"></a>61DB  Application of presumption of equal shared parental responsibility after interim parenting order made

                   If there is an interim parenting order in relation to a child, the court must, in making a final parenting order in relation to the child, disregard the allocation of parental responsibility made in the interim order.

##### <a id="61E"></a>61E  Effect of adoption on parental responsibility

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a child is adopted; and

                     (b)  immediately before the adoption, a person had parental responsibility for the child, whether in full or to a limited extent and whether because of section 61C or because of a parenting order.

             (2)  The person’s parental responsibility for the child ends on the adoption of the child, unless the adoption is by a prescribed adopting parent and leave was not granted under section 60G for the adoption proceedings to be commenced.

##### <a id="61F"></a>61F  Application to Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander children

                   In:

                     (a)  applying this Part to the circumstances of an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander child; or

                     (b)  identifying a person or persons who have exercised, or who may exercise, parental responsibility for such a child;

the court must have regard to any kinship obligations, and child‑rearing practices, of the child’s Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander culture.

### Division 3—Reports relating to children under 18

##### <a id="62A"></a>62A  What this Division does

                   This Division deals with the preparation of reports for use in proceedings relating to children who are under 18.

##### <a id="62B"></a>62B  Court’s obligation to inform people to whom Part VII orders apply about family counselling, family dispute resolution and other family services

                   If a court makes an order in proceedings under this Part, the court must inform the parties to the proceedings about the family counselling services, family dispute resolution services and other courses, programs and services available to help the parties adjust to the consequences of that order.

Note:          Before informing the parties, the court must consider seeking the advice of a family consultant about the services appropriate to the parties’ needs (see section 11E).

##### <a id="62G"></a>62G  Reports by family consultants

             (1)  This section applies if, in proceedings under this Act, the care, welfare and development of a child who is under 18 is relevant.

             (2)  The court may direct a family consultant to give the court a report on such matters relevant to the proceedings as the court thinks desirable.

             (3)  If the court makes a direction under subsection (2), it may, if it thinks it necessary, adjourn the proceedings until the report has been given to the court.

          (3A)  A family consultant who is directed to give the court a report on a matter under subsection (2) must:

                     (a)  ascertain the views of the child in relation to that matter; and

                     (b)  include the views of the child on that matter in the report.

Note:          A person cannot require a child to express his or her views in relation to any matter (see section 60CE).

          (3B)  Subsection (3A) does not apply if complying with that subsection would be inappropriate because of:

                     (a)  the child’s age or maturity; or

                     (b)  some other special circumstance.

             (4)  The family consultant may include in the report, in addition to the matters required to be included in it, any other matters that relate to the care, welfare or development of the child.

             (5)  For the purposes of the preparation of the report, the court may make any other orders, or give any other directions, that the court considers appropriate (including orders or directions that one or more parties to the proceedings attend, or arrange for the child to attend, an appointment or a series of appointments with a family consultant).

Note:          Before making orders under this section, the court must consider seeking the advice of a family consultant about the services appropriate to the parties’ needs (see section 11E).

             (6)  If:

                     (a)  a person fails to comply with an order or direction under subsection (5); or

                     (b)  a child fails to attend an appointment with a family consultant as arranged in compliance with an order or direction under subsection (5);

the family consultant must report the failure to the court.

             (7)  On receiving a report under subsection (6), the court may give such further directions in relation to the preparation of the report as it considers appropriate.

             (8)  A report given to the court pursuant to a direction under subsection (2) may be received in evidence in any proceedings under this Act.

### Division 4—Parenting plans

##### <a id="63A"></a>63A  What this Division does

                   This Division explains what parenting plans are.

##### <a id="63B"></a>63B  Parents encouraged to reach agreement

                   The parents of a child are encouraged:

                     (a)  to agree about matters concerning the child; and

                     (b)  to take responsibility for their parenting arrangements and for resolving parental conflict; and

                     (c)  to use the legal system as a last resort rather than a first resort; and

                     (d)  to minimise the possibility of present and future conflict by using or reaching an agreement; and

                     (e)  in reaching their agreement, to regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration.

Note:          Parents are encouraged to reach an informal agreement between themselves about matters concerning their children by entering into a parenting plan. Parents who seek enforceable arrangements require court orders. These can be obtained by consent.

##### <a id="63C"></a>63C  Meaning of _parenting plan_ and related terms

             (1)  A **_parenting plan_** is an agreement that:

                     (a)  is in writing; and

                     (b)  is or was made between the parents of a child; and

                   (ba)  is signed by the parents of the child; and

                   (bb)  is dated; and

                     (c)  deals with a matter or matters mentioned in subsection (2).

          (1A)  An agreement is not a **_parenting plan_** for the purposes of this Act unless it is made free from any threat, duress or coercion.

             (2)  A parenting plan may deal with one or more of the following:

                     (a)  the person or persons with whom a child is to live;

                     (b)  the time a child is to spend with another person or other persons;

                     (c)  the allocation of parental responsibility for a child;

                     (d)  if 2 or more persons are to share parental responsibility for a child—the form of consultations those persons are to have with one another about decisions to be made in the exercise of that responsibility;

                     (e)  the communication a child is to have with another person or other persons;

                      (f)  maintenance of a child;

                     (g)  the process to be used for resolving disputes about the terms or operation of the plan;

                     (h)  the process to be used for changing the plan to take account of the changing needs or circumstances of the child or the parties to the plan;

                      (i)  any aspect of the care, welfare or development of the child or any other aspect of parental responsibility for a child.

Note:          Paragraph (f)—if the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989_ applies, provisions in a parenting plan dealing with the maintenance of a child (as distinct from child support under that Act) are unenforceable and of no effect unless the provisions in the plan are a child support agreement (see section 63CAA and subsection 63G(5) of this Act).

          (2A)  The person referred to in subsection (2) may be, or the persons referred to in that subsection may include, either a parent of the child or a person other than the parent of the child (including a grandparent or other relative of the child).

          (2B)  Without limiting paragraph (2)(c), the plan may deal with the allocation of responsibility for making decisions about major long‑term issues in relation to the child.

          (2C)  The communication referred to in paragraph (2)(e) includes (but is not limited to) communication by:

                     (a)  letter; and

                     (b)  telephone, email or any other electronic means.

             (3)  An agreement may be a parenting plan:

                     (a)  whether made before or after the commencement of this section; and

                     (b)  whether made inside or outside Australia; and

                     (c)  whether other persons as well as a child’s parents are also parties; and

                     (d)  whether it deals with other matters as well as matters mentioned in subsection (2).

Note:          One of the other matters with which a parenting plan may deal is child support (see section 63CAA).

             (4)  Provisions of a parenting plan that deal with matters other than the maintenance of a child are **_child welfare provisions_**.

             (5)  Provisions of a parenting plan that deal with the matter mentioned in paragraph (2)(f) are **_child maintenance provisions_**.

             (6)  A **_registered parenting plan_** is a parenting plan:

                     (a)  that was registered in a court under section 63E as in force at any time before the commencement of the _Family Law Amendment Act 2003_; and

                     (b)  that continued to be registered immediately before the commencement of the _Family Law Amendment Act 2003_.

##### <a id="63CAA"></a>63CAA  Parenting plans may include child support provisions

             (1)  If a parenting plan includes provisions of a kind referred to in subsection 84(1) of the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989_, the provisions do not have effect for the purposes of this Act.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not affect the operation of the provisions for any other purpose.

             (3)  Nothing in this Division is to be taken to prevent the same agreement being both a parenting plan under this Part and a child support agreement under Part 6 of the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989_.

##### <a id="63D"></a>63D  Parenting plan may be varied or revoked by further written agreement

                   A parenting plan, other than a plan to which section 63DB applies, may be varied or revoked by agreement in writing between the parties to the plan.

##### <a id="63DA"></a>63DA  Obligations of advisers

             (1)  If an adviser gives advice or assistance to people in relation to parental responsibility for a child following the breakdown of the relationship between those people, the adviser must:

                     (a)  inform them that they could consider entering into a parenting plan in relation to the child; and

                     (b)  inform them about where they can get further assistance to develop a parenting plan and the content of the plan.

             (2)  If an adviser gives advice to people in connection with the making by those people of a parenting plan in relation to a child, the adviser must:

                     (a)  inform them that, if the child spending equal time with each of them is:

                              (i)  reasonably practicable; and

                             (ii)  in the best interests of the child;

                            they could consider the option of an arrangement of that kind; and

                     (b)  inform them that, if the child spending equal time with each of them is not reasonably practicable or is not in the best interests of the child but the child spending substantial and significant time with each of them is:

                              (i)  reasonably practicable; and

                             (ii)  in the best interests of the child;

                            they could consider the option of an arrangement of that kind; and

                     (c)  inform them that decisions made in developing parenting plans should be made in the best interests of the child; and

                     (d)  inform them of the matters that may be dealt with in a parenting plan in accordance with subsection 63C(2); and

                     (e)  inform them that, if there is a parenting order in force in relation to the child, the order may (because of section 64D) include a provision that the order is subject to a parenting plan they enter into; and

                      (f)  inform them about the desirability of including in the plan:

                              (i)  if they are to share parental responsibility for the child under the plan—provisions of the kind referred to in paragraph 63C(2)(d) (which deals with the form of consultations between the parties to the plan) as a way of avoiding future conflicts over, or misunderstandings about, the matters covered by that paragraph; and

                             (ii)  provisions of the kind referred to in paragraph 63C(2)(g) (which deals with the process for resolving disputes between the parties to the plan); and

                            (iii)  provisions of the kind referred to in paragraph 63C(2)(h) (which deals with the process for changing the plan to take account of the changing needs or circumstances of the child or the parties to the plan); and

                     (g)  explain to them, in language they are likely to readily understand, the availability of programs to help people who experience difficulties in complying with a parenting plan; and

                     (h)  inform them that section 65DAB requires the court to have regard to the terms of the most recent parenting plan in relation to the child when making a parenting order in relation to the child if it is in the best interests of the child to do so.

Note:          Paragraphs (a) and (b) only require the adviser to inform the people that they could consider the option of the child spending equal time, or substantial and significant time, with each of them. The adviser may, but is not obliged to, advise them as to whether that option would be appropriate in their particular circumstances.

             (3)  For the purposes of paragraph (2)(b), a child will be taken to spend **_substantial and significant time_** with a parent only if:

                     (a)  the time the child spends with the parent includes both:

                              (i)  days that fall on weekends and holidays; and

                             (ii)  days that do not fall on weekends or holidays; and

                     (b)  the time the child spends with the parent allows the parent to be involved in:

                              (i)  the child’s daily routine; and

                             (ii)  occasions and events that are of particular significance to the child; and

                     (c)  the time the child spends with the parent allows the child to be involved in occasions and events that are of special significance to the parent.

             (4)  Subsection (3) does not limit the other matters to which regard may be had in determining whether the time a child spends with a parent would be substantial and significant.

                     (a)  a legal practitioner; or

                     (a)  must have regard to the information accompanying the application for registration; and

                     (b)  may, but is not required to, have regard to all or any of the matters set out in subsections 60CC(2) and (3).

##### <a id="63F"></a>63F  Child welfare provisions of registered parenting plans

Application of section

             (1)  This section applies to a registered parenting plan that contains child welfare provisions.

             (2)  The court may, by order, vary the child welfare provisions in the plan if it considers the variation is required in the best interests of a child.

             (3)  The child welfare provisions have effect, subject to subsections (5) and (6), as if they were provisions of a parenting order.

Note:          Provisions of this Act relevant to the child welfare provisions having effect as provided in this subsection include:

(a)           Subdivisions C, D and E of Division 6 of this Part (dealing with obligations created by parenting orders (other than child maintenance orders)); and

(b)           Division 13A of this Part and Part XIII (dealing generally with enforcement of orders and sanctions for contravening orders); and

(c)           subsection 65D(2) (providing for discharge, variation, suspension and revival of parenting orders other than child maintenance orders); and

             (4)  If provisions of the plan have effect under subsection (3) as a court order, a person who is a party to the plan is taken (for example, for the purposes of section 65Y) to be a party to the proceedings in which the order was made.

             (5)  Subsection (3) does not apply to the plan (whenever registered) to the extent (if at all) that the plan purports to determine that the child concerned is to live with a person who is not a parent of the child.

             (6)  Even though the plan is registered, the court, or another court having jurisdiction under this Part, must not enforce the child welfare provisions if it considers that to do so would be contrary to the best interests of a child.

Note:          Sections 60CB to 60CG deal with how a court determines a child’s best interests.

##### <a id="63G"></a>63G  Child maintenance provisions of registered parenting plans—where not enforceable as maintenance agreements

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a registered parenting plan contains child maintenance provisions; and

                     (b)  the plan is not a maintenance agreement or, if it is a maintenance agreement, the child concerned is not a child of the relevant marriage.

             (2)  The child maintenance provisions have effect, subject to subsections (3), (4) and (5), as if they were a child maintenance order made by the court.

Note:          Provisions of this Act relevant to the child maintenance provisions having effect as a child maintenance order include: 

(a)           Parts XIII and XIIIA (dealing generally with enforcement of orders and sanctions for contravening orders); and

(b)           section 66S (providing for discharge, variation, suspension and revival of child maintenance orders); and

(c)           other provisions of this Act that refer to parenting orders, or to child maintenance orders.

             (3)  Unless the plan provides otherwise, the child maintenance provisions (other than provisions for the periodic payment of maintenance) continue to operate in spite of the death of a party to the plan and operate in favour of, and are binding on, the legal personal representative of that party.

             (4)  If the child maintenance provisions include provisions (the **_periodic provisions_**) for the periodic payment of maintenance:

                     (a)  the periodic provisions continue to operate, if the plan so provides, in spite of the death of a party to the plan who is liable to make the periodic payments, and are binding on the legal personal representative of that party; but

                     (b)  the periodic provisions do not continue to operate, in spite of anything in the plan, after the death of the person entitled to receive the periodic payments.

             (5)  The child maintenance provisions have no effect, and are not enforceable in any way, at any time when an application could properly be made under the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989_ by one of the parties to the plan for administrative assessment of child support (within the meaning of that Act) for the child concerned.

Note:          This subsection does not affect the operation of provisions of a parenting plan referred to in section 63CAA (child support matters).

             (6)  Subsection (5) has effect whether or not an application for administrative assessment of child support for the child has in fact been made by a party to the plan.

##### <a id="63H"></a>63H    Court’s powers to set aside, discharge, vary, suspend or revive registered parenting plans

          (1A)  This section applies to a registered parenting plan.

             (1)  The court in which the plan was registered may set aside the plan, and its registration, if the court is satisfied:

                     (a)  that the concurrence of a party was obtained by fraud, duress or undue influence; or

                     (b)  that the parties want the plan set aside; or

                     (c)  that it is in the best interests of a child to set aside the plan.

             (2)  In proceedings under subsection (1), to the extent that they are proceedings on the ground mentioned in paragraph (1)(c), the best interests of the child concerned are the paramount consideration.

Note:          Sections 60CB to 60CG deal with how a court determines a child’s best interests.

             (3)  Other provisions of this Act under which provisions of the parenting plan may be set aside or otherwise affected are:

                     (b)  subsection 65D(2)—under that subsection a court may make a parenting order that discharges, varies, suspends or revives provisions of the plan that have effect as if they were a parenting order (other than a child maintenance order); and

                     (c)  section 66S—under that section a court may discharge, vary, suspend or revive provisions of the plan that have effect as if they were a child maintenance order.

             (4)  Except as permitted by subsection (1) or by a provision mentioned in subsection (3), a court must not set aside, discharge, vary, suspend or revive the whole or a part of the parenting plan.

### Division 5—Parenting orders—what they are

##### <a id="64A"></a>64A  What this Division does

                   This Division explains what parenting orders are.

##### <a id="64B"></a>64B  Meaning of _parenting order_ and related terms

             (1)  A **_parenting order_** is:

                     (a)  an order under this Part (including an order until further order) dealing with a matter mentioned in subsection (2); or

                     (b)  an order under this Part discharging, varying, suspending or reviving an order, or part of an order, described in paragraph (a).

However, a declaration or order under Subdivision E of Division 12 is not a **_parenting order_**.

             (2)  A parenting order may deal with one or more of the following:

                     (a)  the person or persons with whom a child is to live;

                     (b)  the time a child is to spend with another person or other persons;

                     (c)  the allocation of parental responsibility for a child;

                     (d)  if 2 or more persons are to share parental responsibility for a child—the form of consultations those persons are to have with one another about decisions to be made in the exercise of that responsibility;

                     (e)  the communication a child is to have with another person or other persons;

                      (f)  maintenance of a child;

                     (g)  the steps to be taken before an application is made to a court for a variation of the order to take account of the changing needs or circumstances of:

                             (ii)  the parties to the proceedings in which the order is made;

                     (h)  the process to be used for resolving disputes about the terms or operation of the order;

                      (i)  any aspect of the care, welfare or development of the child or any other aspect of parental responsibility for a child.

The person referred to in this subsection may be, or the persons referred to in this subsection may include, either a parent of the child or a person other than the parent of the child (including a grandparent or other relative of the child).

Note:          Paragraph (f)—a parenting order cannot deal with the maintenance of a child if the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989_ applies.

             (3)  Without limiting paragraph (2)(c), the order may deal with the allocation of responsibility for making decisions about major long‑term issues in relation to the child.

             (4)  The communication referred to in paragraph (2)(e) includes (but is not limited to) communication by:

                     (a)  letter; and

                     (b)  telephone, email or any other electronic means.

          (4A)  Without limiting paragraphs (2)(g) and (h), the parenting order may provide that the parties to the proceedings must consult with a family dispute resolution practitioner to assist with:

                     (a)  resolving any dispute about the terms or operation of the order; or

                     (b)  reaching agreement about changes to be made to the order.

             (5)  To the extent (if at all) that a parenting order deals with the matter mentioned in paragraph (2)(f), the order is a **_child maintenance order_**.

             (6)  For the purposes of this Act:

                     (a)  a parenting order that provides that a child is to live with a person is **_made in favour_** of  that person; and

                     (b)  a parenting order that provides that a child is to spend time with a person is **_made in favour_** of that person; and

                     (c)  a parenting order that provides that a child is to have communication with a person is **_made_** **_in favour_** of that person; and

                     (d)  a parenting order that:

                              (i)  allocates parental responsibility for a child to a person; or

                             (ii)  provides that a person is to share parental responsibility for a child with another person;

                            is **_made_** **_in favour_** of that person.

             (9)  In this section:

                    <a name="act"></a>**_this Act_** includes:

                     (a)  the standard Rules of Court; and

                     (b)  the related Federal Magistrates Rules.

##### <a id="64C"></a>64C  Parenting orders may be made in favour of parents or other persons

                   A parenting order in relation to a child may be made in favour of a parent of the child or some other person.

##### <a id="64D"></a>64D  Parenting orders subject to later parenting plans

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), a parenting order in relation to a child is taken to include a provision that the order is subject to a parenting plan that is:

                     (a)  entered into subsequently by the child’s parents; and

                     (b)  agreed to, in writing, by any other person (other than the child) to whom the parenting order applies.

             (2)  The court may, in exceptional circumstances, include in a parenting order a provision that the parenting order, or a specified provision of the parenting order, may only be varied by a subsequent order of the court (and not by a parenting plan).

             (3)  Without limiting subsection (2), exceptional circumstances for the purposes of that subsection include the following:

                     (a)  circumstances that give rise to a need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence;

                     (b)  the existence of substantial evidence that one of the child’s parents is likely to seek to use coercion or duress to gain the agreement of the other parent to a parenting plan.

### Division 6—Parenting orders other than child maintenance orders

#### Subdivision A—Introductory

##### <a id="65A"></a>65A  What this Division does

             (1)  This Division deals with:

                     (a)  applying for and making parenting orders, other than child maintenance orders (Subdivision B); and

                     (b)  the general obligations created by parenting orders, other than child maintenance orders (Subdivision C); and

                     (c)  dealing with people who have been arrested (Subdivision D); and

                     (d)  the obligations under parenting orders, other than child maintenance orders, relating to taking or sending children from Australia (Subdivision E).

Note:          Paragraph (a)—section 60I provides that people with disputes about matters that may be dealt with in a Part VII order (which includes a parenting order) should generally make use of family dispute resolution before applying for the order.

             (2)  Measures designed to improve communication between separated parents and to educate parents about their respective responsibilities in relation to their children are contained in this Division (see section 65DA).

Note:          Division 13A provides for the compliance regime for dealing with contraventions, and alleged contraventions, of parenting orders.

##### <a id="65AA"></a>65AA  Child’s best interests paramount consideration in making a parenting order

                   Section 60CA provides that in deciding whether to make a particular parenting order in relation to a child, a court must regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration.

##### <a id="65B"></a>65B  Division does not apply to child maintenance orders

                   This Division does not apply to parenting orders to the extent that they consist of child maintenance orders. Child maintenance orders are dealt with in Division 7.

#### Subdivision B—Applying for and making parenting orders

##### <a id="65C"></a>65C  Who may apply for a parenting order

                   A parenting order in relation to a child may be applied for by:

                     (a)  either or both of the child’s parents; or

                     (b)  the child; or

                   (ba)  a grandparent of the child; or

                     (c)  any other person concerned with the care, welfare or development of the child.

##### <a id="65D"></a>65D    Court’s power to make parenting order

             (1)  In proceedings for a parenting order, the court may, subject to sections 61DA (presumption of equal shared parental responsibility when making parenting orders) and 65DAB (parenting plans) and this Division, make such parenting order as it thinks proper.

Note:          Division 4 of Part XIIIAA (International protection of children) may affect the jurisdiction of a court to make a parenting order.

             (2)  Without limiting the generality of subsection (1) and subject to section 61DA (presumption of equal shared parental responsibility when making parenting orders) and 65DAB (parenting plans) and this Division, a court may make a parenting order that discharges, varies, suspends or revives some or all of an earlier parenting order.

             (3)  If the application for the parenting order was made as a result of the adjournment under paragraph 70NEB(1)(c) of proceedings under Subdivision E of Division 13A of Part VII:

                     (a)  the court must hear and determine the application as soon as practicable; and

                     (b)  if the court makes a parenting order on the application, the court may, if it thinks it is appropriate to do so, dismiss the proceedings under that Subdivision.

Note:          The applicant may apply to the Family Court or to the Federal Magistrates Court for the application for the parenting order or for the proceedings under Subdivision E of Division 13A of Part VII, or both, to be transferred to the Federal Magistrates Court or to the Family Court, as the case requires (see section 33B of this Act and section 39 of the _Federal Magistrates Act 1999_).

##### <a id="65DAA"></a>65DAA  Court to consider child spending equal time or substantial and significant time with each parent in certain circumstances

Equal time

             (1)  Subject to subsection (6), if a parenting order provides (or is to provide) that a child’s parents are to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child, the court must:

                     (a)  consider whether the child spending equal time with each of the parents would be in the best interests of the child; and

                     (b)  consider whether the child spending equal time with each of the parents is reasonably practicable; and

                     (c)  if it is, consider making an order to provide (or including a provision in the order) for the child to spend equal time with each of the parents.

Note 1:       The effect of section 60CA is that in deciding whether to go on to make a parenting order for the child to spend equal time with each of the parents, the court will regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration.

Note 2:       See subsection (5) for the factors the court takes into account in determining what is reasonably practicable.

Substantial and significant time

             (2)  Subject to subsection (6), if:

                     (a)  a parenting order provides (or is to provide) that a child’s parents are to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child; and

                     (b)  the court does not make an order (or include a provision in the order) for the child to spend equal time with each of the parents; and

the court must:

                     (c)  consider whether the child spending substantial and significant time with each of the parents would be in the best interests of the child; and

                     (d)  consider whether the child spending substantial and significant time with each of the parents is reasonably practicable; and

                     (e)  if it is, consider making an order to provide (or including a provision in the order) for the child to spend substantial and significant time with each of the parents.

Note 1:       The effect of section 60CA is that in deciding whether to go on to make a parenting order for the child to spend substantial time with each of the parents, the court will regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration.

Note 2:       See subsection (5) for the factors the court takes into account in determining what is reasonably practicable.

             (3)  For the purposes of subsection (2), a child will be taken to spend **_substantial and significant time_** with a parent only if:

                     (a)  the time the child spends with the parent includes both:

                              (i)  days that fall on weekends and holidays; and

                             (ii)  days that do not fall on weekends or holidays; and

                     (b)  the time the child spends with the parent allows the parent to be involved in:

                              (i)  the child’s daily routine; and

                             (ii)  occasions and events that are of particular significance to the child; and

                     (c)  the time the child spends with the parent allows the child to be involved in occasions and events that are of special significance to the parent.

             (4)  Subsection (3) does not limit the other matters to which a court can have regard in determining whether the time a child spends with a parent would be substantial and significant.

Reasonable practicality

             (5)  In determining for the purposes of subsections (1) and (2) whether it is reasonably practicable for a child to spend equal time, or substantial and significant time, with each of the child’s parents, the court must have regard to:

                     (a)  how far apart the parents live from each other; and

                     (b)  the parents’ current and future capacity to implement an arrangement for the child spending equal time, or substantial and significant time, with each of the parents; and

                     (c)  the parents’ current and future capacity to communicate with each other and resolve difficulties that might arise in implementing an arrangement of that kind; and

                     (d)  the impact that an arrangement of that kind would have on the child; and

                     (e)  such other matters as the court considers relevant.

Note 1:       Behaviour of a parent that is relevant for paragraph (c) may also be taken into account in determining what parenting order the court should make in the best interests of the child. Subsection 60CC(3) provides for considerations that are taken into account in determining what is in the best interests of the child. These include:

(a)           the willingness and ability of each of the child’s parents to facilitate, and encourage, a close and continuing relationship between the child and the other parent (paragraph 60CC(3)(c));

(b)           the attitude to the child, and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of the child’s parents (paragraph 60CC(3)(i)).

Note 2:       Paragraph (c) reference to future capacity—the court has power under section 13C to make orders for parties to attend family counselling or family dispute resolution or participate in courses, programs or services.

Consent orders

             (6)  If:

                     (a)  the court is considering whether to make a parenting order with the consent of all the parties to the proceedings; and

                     (b)  the order provides (or is to provide) that a child’s parents are to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child;

the court may, but is not required to, consider the matters referred to in paragraphs (1)(a) to (c) or (if applicable) the matters referred to in paragraphs (2)(c) to (e).

             (7)  To avoid doubt, subsection (6) does not affect the application of section 60CA in relation to a parenting order.

Note:          Section 60CA requires the best interests of the child to be the paramount consideration in a decision whether to make a particular parenting order.

##### <a id="65DAB"></a>65DAB  Court to have regard to parenting plans

                   When making a parenting order in relation to a child, the court is to have regard to the terms of the most recent parenting plan (if any) that has been entered into between the child’s parents (to the extent to which that plan relates to the child) if doing so would be in the best interests of the child.

##### <a id="65DAC"></a>65DAC  Effect of parenting order that provides for shared parental responsibility

             (1)  This section applies if, under a parenting order:

                     (a)  2 or more persons are to share parental responsibility for a child; and

                     (b)  the exercise of that parental responsibility involves making a decision about a major long‑term issue in relation to the child.

             (2)  The order is taken to require the decision to be made jointly by those persons.

Note:          Subject to any court orders, decisions about issues that are not major long‑term issues are made by the person with whom the child is spending time without a need to consult the other person (see section 65DAE).

             (3)  The order is taken to require each of those persons:

                     (a)  to consult the other person in relation to the decision to be made about that issue; and

                     (b)  to make a genuine effort to come to a joint decision about that issue.

             (4)  To avoid doubt, this section does not require any other person to establish, before acting on a decision about the child communicated by one of those persons, that the decision has been made jointly.

##### <a id="65DAE"></a>65DAE  No need to consult on issues that are not major long‑term issues

             (1)  If a child is spending time with a person at a particular time under a parenting order, the order is taken not to require the person to consult a person who:

                     (a)  has parental responsibility for the child; or

                     (b)  shares parental responsibility for the child with another person;

about decisions that are made in relation to the child during that time on issues that are not major‑long term issues.

Note:          This will mean that the person with whom the child is spending time will usually not need to consult on decisions about such things as what the child eats or wears because these are usually not major long‑term issues.

             (2)  Subsection (1) applies subject to any provision to the contrary made by a parenting order.

##### <a id="65DA"></a>65DA  Parenting orders

             (1)  This section applies when a court makes a parenting order.

             (2)  It is the duty of the court to include in the order particulars of:

                     (a)  the obligations that the order creates; and

                     (b)  the consequences that may follow if a person contravenes the order.

             (3)  If any of the persons to whom the order is directed is not represented by a legal practitioner, it is also the duty of the court to explain to the person, or to each of the persons:

                     (a)  the availability of programs to help people to understand their responsibilities under parenting orders; and

                     (b)  the availability and use of location and recovery orders to ensure that parenting orders are complied with.

             (4)  The court may cause to be prepared, and given to persons to whom a parenting order is directed, a document setting out particulars of the matters mentioned in paragraphs (3)(a) and (b).

             (5)  If a person to whom the order is directed is represented by a legal practitioner, the court may request the practitioner:

                     (a)  to assist in explaining to the person the matters mentioned in paragraphs (2)(a) and (b); and

                     (b)  to explain to the person the matters mentioned in paragraphs (3)(a) and (b).

             (6)  If a request is made by the court to a legal practitioner under paragraph (5)(a) or (b), it is the duty of the practitioner to comply with the request.

             (7)  Failure to comply with a requirement of, or with a request made under, this section does not affect the validity of a parenting order.

             (8)  Any matter that is required by this section to be included in a parenting order or any explanation that is required by this section to be given to a person is to be expressed in language that is likely to be readily understood by the person to whom the order is directed or the explanation is given.

##### <a id="65F"></a>65F  General requirements for counselling before parenting order made

             (2)  Subject to subsection (3), a court must not make a parenting order in relation to a child unless:

                     (a)  the parties to the proceedings have attended family counselling to discuss the matter to which the proceedings relate; or

                     (b)  the court is satisfied that there is an urgent need for the parenting order, or there is some other special circumstance (such as family violence), that makes it appropriate to make the order even though the parties to the proceedings have not attended a conference as mentioned in paragraph (a); or

                     (c)  the court is satisfied that it is not practicable to require the parties to the proceedings to attend a conference as mentioned in paragraph (a).

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not apply to the making of a parenting order if:

                     (a)  it is made with the consent of all the parties to the proceedings; or

                     (b)  it is an order until further order.

             (4)  In this section:

                    <a name="proceing-parent-order"></a>**_proceedings for a parenting order_** includes:

                     (a)  proceedings for the enforcement of a parenting order; and

                     (b)  any other proceedings in which a contravention of a parenting order is alleged.

##### <a id="65G"></a>65G  Special conditions for making parenting order about whom a child lives with or the allocation of parental responsibility by consent in favour of non‑parent

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a court proposes to make a parenting order that deals with whom a child is to live with; and

                     (b)  under the order, the child would not live with a parent, grandparent or other relative of the child; and

                     (c)  the court proposes to make that order with the consent of all the parties to the proceedings.

          (1A)  This section also applies if:

                     (a)  a court proposes to make a parenting order that deals with the allocation of parental responsibility for a child; and

                     (b)  under the order, no parent, grandparent or other relative of the child would be allocated parental responsibility for the child; and

                     (c)  the court proposes to make that order with the consent of all the parties to the proceedings.

             (2)  The court must not make the proposed order unless:

                     (a)  the parties to the proceedings have attended a conference with a family consultant to discuss the matter to be determined by the proposed order; or

                     (b)  the court is satisfied that there are circumstances that make it appropriate to make the proposed order even though the conditions in paragraph (a) are not satisfied.

##### <a id="65H"></a>65H  Children who are 18 or over or who have married or entered de facto relationships

             (1)  A parenting order must not be made in relation to a child who:

                     (a)  is 18 or over; or

                     (b)  is or has been married; or

                     (c)  is in a de facto relationship.

             (2)  A parenting order in relation to a child stops being in force if the child turns 18, marries or enters into a de facto relationship.

             (3)  A court having jurisdiction under this Part may make a declaration to the effect that the child is in, or has entered into, a de facto relationship.

             (4)  A declaration under subsection (3) has effect for the purposes of this Act but does not have effect for any other purpose (including, for example, other laws of the Commonwealth or laws of the States and Territories).

             (2)  The parenting order stops being in force on the adoption of the child, unless the adoption is by a prescribed adopting parent and leave was not granted under section 60G for the adoption proceedings to be commenced.

##### <a id="65K"></a>65K  What happens when parenting order that deals with whom a child lives with does not make provision in relation to death of parent with whom child lives

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a parenting order is in force that provides that a child is to live with one of the child’s parents; and

                     (b)  that parent dies; and

                     (c)  the parenting order does not provide for what is to happen on that parent’s death.

             (2)  The surviving parent cannot require the child to live with him or her.

             (3)  The surviving parent, or another person (subject to section 65C), may apply for a parenting order that deals with the person or persons with whom the child is to live.

             (4)  In an application under subsection (3) by a person who does not, at the time of the application, have any parental responsibility for the child, any person who, at that time, has any parental responsibility for the child is entitled to be a party to the proceedings.

##### <a id="65L"></a>65L  Family consultants may be required to supervise or assist compliance with parenting orders

                     (a)  an order requiring compliance with the parenting order, as far as practicable, to be supervised by a family consultant;

                     (b)  an order requiring a family consultant to give any party to the parenting order such assistance as is reasonably requested by that party in relation to compliance with, and the carrying out of, the parenting order.

             (2)  In deciding whether to make a particular order under subsection (1) in relation to a child, a court must regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration.

Note:          Sections 60CB to 60CG deal with how a court determines a child’s best interests.

##### <a id="65LA"></a>65LA  Court may order attendance at a post‑separation parenting program

             (1)  In proceedings for a parenting order, the court may make an order directing a party to the proceedings to attend a post‑separation parenting program.

Note:          Before making an order under this section, the court must consider seeking the advice of a family consultant about the services appropriate to the party’s needs (see section 11E).

                     (b)  there is a recipient organisation in relation to the organisation (see subsection (3)).

             (2)  An organisation is a recipient organisation for the purposes of paragraph (1)(a) if it receives, or has been approved to receive, funding under a program or a part of a program designated by the Minister under subsection (4) in order to provide services that include post‑separation parenting programs.

##### <a id="66C"></a>66C  Principles—parents have primary duty to maintain

             (1)  The parents of a child have, subject to this Division, the primary duty to maintain the child.

             (2)  Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), the duty of a parent to maintain a child:

                     (a)  is not of lower priority than the duty of the parent to maintain any other child or another person; and

             (2)  Any duty of a step‑parent to maintain a step‑child:

                     (a)  is a secondary duty subject to the primary duty of the parents of the child to maintain the child; and

                     (b)  does not derogate from the primary duty of the parents to maintain the child.

#### Subdivision C—Relationship with Child Support (Assessment) Act

##### <a id="66E"></a>66E  Child maintenance order not to be made etc. if application for administrative assessment of child support could be made

             (1)  A court having jurisdiction under this Part must not, at any time, make, revive or vary a child maintenance order in relation to a child on the application of a person (the **_applicant_**) against, or in favour of, a person (the **_respondent_**) if an application could properly be made, at that time, by the applicant under the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989_ for the respondent to be assessed in respect of the costs of the child, or vice versa.

             (2)  Subsection (1) has effect whether or not an application for administrative assessment of child support for the child has in fact been made (whether by the applicant, the respondent or another person).

             (3)  This section does not apply to proceedings under regulations made for the purposes of section 110 or 111A.

#### Subdivision D—Applying for and making child maintenance orders

                     (a)  the child; or

                     (b)  a parent of the child who has the daily care of the child; or

                              (i)  is not expressed to be an order to which this section applies; or

                             (ii)  is expressed to be an order to which this section applies, but does not comply with paragraph (1)(d);

any payment, transfer or settlement of a kind referred to in paragraph (1)(a), that the order has the effect of requiring, is to be taken not to make provision for the maintenance of a child.

##### <a id="66S"></a>66S  Modification of child maintenance orders

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  there is in force an order (the **_first order_**), for the maintenance of a child (whether or not made under this Act and whether made before or after the commencement of this section):

                              (i)  made by a court; or

                             (ii)  registered in a court; and

                     (b)  a person (being someone who could apply for a child maintenance order in relation to the child) or persons (each of whom could do that) apply to the court for an order under this section in relation to the first order.

          (1A)  With the consent of all the parties to the first order, the court may, subject to section 111AA, make an order:

                     (a)  discharging the first order; or

                     (b)  suspending its operation wholly or in part and either until further order or until a fixed time or the happening of a future event; or

                     (c)  if the operation of the order has been suspended under paragraph (b) or (2)(b)—reviving its operation wholly or in part; or

                     (d)  varying the order:

                              (i)  so as to increase or decrease any amount ordered to be paid by the order; or

                             (ii)  in any other way.

          (1B)  However, the court must not make an order under subsection (1A) that allows any entitlement of a child or another person to an income tested pension, allowance or benefit, to affect the duty of that child’s parents to maintain the child.

Note:          For the duty of a parent to maintain a child, see section 66C.

             (2)  In any other case, the court may, by order:

                     (a)  discharge the first order if there is just cause for so doing; or

                     (b)  suspend its operation wholly or in part and either until further order or until a fixed time or the happening of a future event; or

                     (c)  if the operation of the order has been suspended under paragraph (b) or (1A)(b), revive its operation wholly or in part; or

                     (d)  subject to subsection (3), vary the order:

                              (i)  so as to increase or decrease any amount ordered to be paid by the order; or

                             (ii)  in any other way.

             (3)  The court must not vary the order so as to increase or decrease any amount ordered to be paid by the order unless it is satisfied:

                     (a)  that, since the order was made or last varied:

                              (i)  the circumstances of the child have changed so as to justify the variation; or

                             (ii)  the circumstances of the person liable to make payments under the order have changed so as to justify the variation; or

                            (iii)  the circumstances of the person entitled to receive payments under the order have changed so as to justify the variation; or

                            (iv)  in the case of an order that operates in favour of, or is binding on, a legal personal representative—the circumstances of the estate are such as to justify the variation; or

                     (b)  that, since the order was made or last varied, the cost of living has changed to such an extent as to justify its so doing (this is expanded on in subsections (4) and (5)); or

                     (c)  if the order was made by consent—that the amount ordered to be paid is not proper or adequate (this is expanded on in subsection (6)); or

                     (d)  that material facts were withheld from the court that made the order or from a court that varied the order, or material evidence previously given before such a court was false.

             (4)  In satisfying itself for the purposes of paragraph (3)(b), the court must have regard to any changes that have occurred in the Consumer Price Index published by the Australian Statistician.

             (5)  The court must not, in considering the variation of an order, have regard to a change in the cost of living unless at least 12 months have elapsed since the order was made or last varied having regard to a change in the cost of living.

             (6)  In satisfying itself for the purposes of paragraph (3)(c), the court must have regard to any payments, and any transfer or settlement of property, previously made to the child, or to any other person for the benefit of the child, by the person against whom the order was made.

             (7)  An order decreasing a periodic amount payable under the order, or discharging the order, may be expressed to be retrospective to such day as the court considers appropriate.

             (8)  If an order (the **_subsequent order_**) decreasing a periodic amount payable under the first order is expressed to be retrospective, amounts paid under the first order that are not payable under the first order as varied by the subsequent order may be recovered in a court having jurisdiction under this Part.

             (9)  If an order discharging the first order is expressed to be retrospective to a specified day, amounts paid under the first order since the specified day may be recovered in a court having jurisdiction under this Part.

           (10)  For the purposes of this section, the court must have regard to the provisions of Subdivisions B, C and D (to the extent applicable).

           (11)  The discharge of the first order does not affect the recovery of arrears due under the order when the discharge takes effect.

#### Subdivision EA—Varying the maintenance of certain children

##### <a id="66SA"></a>66SA  Varying the maintenance of certain children

             (1)  This section applies to persons who:

                     (a)  are parties to an agreement (the **_original agreement_**) dealing with the maintenance of a child; or

                     (b)  are entitled to receive, or required to pay, maintenance in respect of a child under a court order;

and cannot properly make an application under the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989_ for the other person to be assessed in respect of the costs of the child.

             (2)  The persons may, by registering a written agreement in a court having jurisdiction under this Part, vary or revoke the original agreement or order to the extent that it deals with maintenance of the child.

             (3)  However, the registered agreement is of no effect to the extent that it allows any entitlement of a child or another person to an income tested pension, allowance or benefit to affect the duty of that child’s parents to maintain the child.

Note:          For the duty of a parent to maintain a child, see section 66C.

             (4)  If the original agreement or order is varied under subsection (2), it:

                     (a)  continues to operate despite the death of a party to the agreement or of a person entitled to receive, or required to pay, maintenance under the order; and

                     (b)  operates in favour of, and is binding on, the legal representative of that party or person;

unless the agreement or order provides otherwise.

             (5)  However, despite anything in the agreement or order, it does not continue to operate, to the extent that it requires the periodic payment of maintenance, after the death of the person entitled to receive those payments.

             (6)  This section applies despite anything in Division 4.

#### Subdivision F—When child maintenance orders stop being in force

##### <a id="66T"></a>66T  Effect of child turning 18

                   As stated in subsection 66L(3), a child maintenance order in relation to a child stops being in force when the child turns 18, unless the order is expressed to continue in force after then.

##### <a id="66U"></a>66U  Effect of death of child, person liable to pay or person entitled to receive

             (1)  A child maintenance order in relation to a child stops being in force on the death of the child.

             (2)  A child maintenance order in relation to a child stops being in force on the death of the person liable to make payments under the order.

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not apply to an order made before the commencement of section 38 of the _Family Law Amendment Act 1983_ if the order was expressed to continue in force throughout the life of the person for whose benefit the order was made or for a period that had not expired at the death of the person liable to make payments under the order and, in that case, the order is binding on the legal personal representative of the deceased person.

             (4)  A child maintenance order in relation to a child stops being in force on the death of the person entitled to receive payments under the order.

             (5)  Subsection (4) does not apply to an order if:

                     (a)  the order is expressed to continue in force after the death of the person first entitled to receive payments under the order; and

                     (b)  the order specifies the person who is to receive the payments after that death.

##### <a id="66V"></a>66V  Effect of adoption, marriage or entering into a de facto relationship

             (1)  A child maintenance order in relation to a child stops being in force if the child is adopted, marries or enters into a de facto relationship.

             (2)  If a child to whom a child maintenance order applies dies, is adopted, marries or enters into a de facto relationship, the person entitled to receive payments under the order must, without delay, inform the person liable to make payments under the order.

             (3)  Any amounts paid under a child maintenance order in relation to a period after the child dies, is adopted, marries or enters into a de facto relationship may be recovered in a court having jurisdiction under this Part.

             (4)  A court having jurisdiction under this Part may make a declaration to the effect that a child is in, or has entered into, a de facto relationship.

             (5)  A declaration under subsection (4) has effect for the purposes of this Act but does not have effect for any other purpose (including, for example, other laws of the Commonwealth or laws of the States and Territories).

##### <a id="66VA"></a>66VA  Children who are 18 or over: change of circumstances

             (1)  A child maintenance order made under section 66L:

                     (a)  to enable the child to complete his or her education; or

                     (b)  because of a mental or physical disability of the child;

stops being in force if the child ceases that education or ceases to have that disability.

             (2)  The person to whom the maintenance is payable must, as soon as practicable, inform the person required to pay it of that change in circumstances.

             (3)  Any amounts of maintenance paid under the child maintenance order after it stops being in force may be recovered in a court having jurisdiction under this Part.

##### <a id="66W"></a>66W  Recovery of arrears

             (1)  Nothing in subsection 66L(3), or in this Subdivision (apart from subsection (2) of this section), affects the recovery of arrears due under a child maintenance order in relation to a child when the order ceases to be in force.

             (2)  If arrears are due under such an order when the order ceases to be in force, the court may, by order, retrospectively:

                     (a)  discharge the order if there is just cause for doing so; or

                     (b)  vary the order so as to increase or decrease the arrears to be paid under the order if the court is satisfied that:

                              (i)  the circumstances of the person liable to pay the arrears are such as to justify the variation; or

                             (ii)  the circumstances of the person entitled to receive the arrears are such as to justify the variation; or

                            (iii)  in the case of an order that operated in favour of, or that was binding on, a legal personal representative—the circumstances of the estate are such as to justify the variation.

#### Subdivision G—Recovery of amounts paid under maintenance orders

##### <a id="66X"></a>66X  Recovery of amounts paid, and property transferred or settled, under maintenance orders

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a court has at any time purported to make an order (the **_purported order_**) of a kind referred to in paragraph 66P(1)(a), (b) or (c) requiring a person (the **_maintenance provider_**) to pay an amount, or to transfer or settle property, by way of maintenance for a child; and

                     (b)  the maintenance provider has:

                              (i)  paid another person an amount or amounts; or

                             (ii)  transferred or settled property;

                            in compliance, or partial compliance, with the purported order; and

                     (c)  a court has determined that the maintenance provider is not a parent or step‑parent of the child.

             (2)  If the maintenance provider applies to a court having jurisdiction under this Part for an order under this subsection, the court must make such order as it considers just and equitable in the circumstances, for:

                     (a)  if the purported order was of a kind referred to in paragraph 66P(1)(a) or (b)—the repayment to the maintenance provider, by the person to whom the amount or amounts referred to in subparagraph (1)(b)(i) of this section were paid, of an amount up to, or equal to, that amount or the sum of those amounts; or

                     (b)  if the purported order was of the kind referred to in paragraph 66P(1)(c)—the return to the maintenance provider of:

                              (i)  the property referred to in subparagraph (1)(b)(ii) of this section; or

                             (ii)  an amount up to, or equal to, the value of that property.

The court may only order the repayment of an amount that is less than the amount, or the sum of the amounts, referred to in subparagraph (1)(b)(i) of this section, or the return of an amount that is less than the value of the property referred to in subparagraph (1)(b)(ii) of this section, in exceptional circumstances.

             (3)  If the purported order was of the kind referred to in paragraph 66P(1)(c) and the court that made the order did so:

                     (a)  in part by way of providing maintenance for the child; and

                     (b)  in part for some other purpose;

the reference in paragraph (2)(b) to the property, or the value of the property, referred to in subparagraph (1)(b)(ii) is taken to be a reference to that property, or the value of that property, only to the extent to which that property was transferred or settled by way of providing maintenance for the child.

             (4)  Without limiting paragraph (2)(b), the orders that the court may make under that paragraph include the following:

                     (a)  an order that a specified payment be made;

                     (b)  an order that a specified transfer or settlement of property be made;

                     (c)  an order that any necessary instrument be executed, and that such documents of title be produced and such other things be done, as are necessary to enable an order to be carried out effectively or to provide security for the due performance of an order.

             (5)  An amount paid to the Commonwealth under section 30 of the _Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988_ is to be taken, for the purposes of this section, to have been paid to the person to whom, apart from that section, the amount would have been payable.

##### <a id="67L"></a>67L  Child’s best interests paramount consideration in making a location order

                   In deciding whether to make a location order in relation to a child, a court must regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration.

##### <a id="67M"></a>67M  Provisions about location orders, other than Commonwealth information orders

             (1)  This section applies to location orders other than Commonwealth information orders.

             (2)  Subject to section 67L, a court having jurisdiction under this Part or section 111CX, or exercising jurisdiction in proceedings arising under regulations made for the purposes of Part XIIIAA, may make a location order if it is satisfied that the person to whom the order applies is likely to have information about the child’s location.

             (3)  If the person to whom a location order applies holds an office or position in, or in relation to, a Department or a Commonwealth instrumentality, the order does not apply to information that the person has or obtains because of holding that office or position.

             (4)  A location order stays in force for 12 months or such longer period as the court considers appropriate.

             (5)  While a location order is in force, the person to whom it applies must provide the information sought by the order as soon as practicable, or as soon as practicable after the person obtains it.

             (2)  Subject to section 67L, a court having jurisdiction under this Part or section 111CX, or exercising jurisdiction in proceedings arising under regulations made for the purposes of Part XIIIAA, may make a Commonwealth information order if it is satisfied that information about the child’s location is likely to be contained in, or to come into, the records of the Department or Commonwealth instrumentality concerned.

             (3)  A court must not make a Commonwealth information order unless:

                     (a)  a copy of the application for the order has been served in accordance with the applicable Rules of Court on the person to whom the order will apply (being the Secretary of the Department concerned or an appropriate authority of the Commonwealth instrumentality concerned); and

                     (b)  if that Department or Commonwealth instrumentality is prescribed for the purposes of this paragraph—either:

                              (i)  the period of 7 days after service of that copy of the application has expired; or

                             (ii)  the court considers that there are special circumstances because of which the order should be made before the end of that period of 7 days.

             (4)  If an application for a Commonwealth information order relates to more than one Department or Commonwealth instrumentality, the court must not make the order in relation to more than one of them unless the court considers it should do so because of exceptional circumstances.

             (5)  A court may state that a Commonwealth information order only applies to records of a particular kind if the court considers that:

                     (a)  the information sought by the order is only likely to be contained in records of that kind; and

                     (b)  to apply the order to all records of the Department or Commonwealth instrumentality concerned would place an unreasonable burden on its resources.

             (6)  A Commonwealth information order stays in force for 12 months.

##### <a id="68N"></a>68N  Purposes of this Division

                   The purposes of this Division are:

                     (a)  to resolve inconsistencies between:

                              (i)  family violence orders; and

                             (ii)  certain orders, injunctions and arrangements made under this Act that provide for a child to spend time with a person or require or authorise a person to spend time with a child; and

                    (aa)  to ensure that orders, injunctions and arrangements of the kind referred to in subparagraph (a)(ii) do not expose people to family violence; and

                     (b)  to achieve the objects and principles in section 60B.

Note:          Other provisions dealing with family violence and family violence orders are section 4 (definitions), paragraphs 60B(1)(b) and 60CC(2)(i) and (j), sections 60CF and 60CG, subsection 60I(9), section 60K, subsection 61DA(2), paragraph 65F(2)(b) and section 65P.

##### <a id="68P"></a>68P  Obligations of court making an order or granting an injunction under this Act that is inconsistent with an existing family violence order

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a court:

                              (i)  makes a parenting order that provides for a child to spend time with a person, or expressly or impliedly requires or authorises a person to spend time with a child; or

                             (ii)  makes a recovery order (as defined in section 67Q) or any other order under this Act that expressly or impliedly requires or authorises a person to spend time with a child; or

                            (iii)  grants an injunction under section 68B or 114 that expressly or impliedly requires or authorises a person to spend time with a child; and

                     (b)  the order made or injunction granted is inconsistent with an existing family violence order.

             (2)  The court must, to the extent to which the order or injunction provides for the child to spend time with a person, or expressly or impliedly requires or authorises a person to spend time with the child:

                     (a)  specify in the order or injunction that it is inconsistent with an existing family violence order; and

                     (b)  give a detailed explanation in the order or injunction of how the contact that it provides for is to take place; and

                     (c)  explain (or arrange for someone else to explain) the order or injunction to:

                              (i)  the applicant and respondent in the proceedings for the order or injunction; and

                             (ii)  the person against whom the family violence order is directed (if that person is not the applicant or respondent); and

                            (iii)  the person protected by the family violence order (if that person is not the applicant or respondent); and

                     (d)  include (or arrange to be included) in the explanation, in language those persons are likely to readily understand:

                              (i)  the purpose of the order or injunction; and

                             (ii)  the obligations created by the order or injunction, including how the contact that it provides for is to take place; and

                            (iii)  the consequences that may follow if a person fails to comply with the order or injunction; and

                            (iv)  the court’s reasons for making an order or granting an injunction that is inconsistent with a family violence order; and

                             (v)  the circumstances in which a person may apply for variation or revocation of the order or injunction.

             (3)  As soon as practicable after making the order or granting the injunction (and no later than 14 days after making or granting it), the court must give a copy to:

                     (a)  the applicant and respondent in the proceedings for the order or injunction; and

                     (b)  the person against whom the family violence order is directed (if that person is not the applicant or respondent); and

                     (c)  the person protected by the family violence order (if that person is not the applicant or respondent); and

                     (d)  the Registrar, Principal Officer or other appropriate officer of the court that last made or varied the family violence order; and

                     (e)  the Commissioner or head (however described) of the police force of the State or Territory in which the person protected by the family violence order resides; and

                      (f)  a child welfare officer in relation to the State or Territory in which the person protected by the family violence order resides.

             (4)  Failure to comply with this section does not affect the validity of the order or injunction.

##### <a id="68Q"></a>68Q  Relationship of order or injunction made under this Act with existing inconsistent family violence order

             (1)  To the extent to which:

                     (a)  an order or injunction mentioned in paragraph 68P(1)(a) is made or granted that provides for a child to spend time with a person, or expressly or impliedly requires or authorises a person to spend time with a child; and

                     (b)  the order or injunction is inconsistent with an existing family violence order;

the family violence order is invalid.

             (2)  An application for a declaration that the order or injunction is inconsistent with the family violence order may be made, to a court that has jurisdiction under this Part, by:

                     (a)  the applicant or respondent in the proceedings for the order or injunction mentioned in paragraph 68P(1)(a); or

                     (b)  the person against whom the family violence order is directed (if that person is not the applicant or respondent); or

                     (c)  the person protected by the family violence order (if that person is not the applicant or respondent).

             (3)  The court must hear and determine the application and make such declarations as it considers appropriate.

##### <a id="68R"></a>68R  Power of court making a family violence order to revive, vary, discharge or suspend an existing order, injunction or arrangement under this Act

Power

             (1)  In proceedings to make or vary a family violence order, a court of a State or Territory that has jurisdiction in relation to this Part may revive, vary, discharge or suspend:

                     (a)  a parenting order, to the extent to which it provides for a child to spend time with a person, or expressly or impliedly requires or authorises a person to spend time with the child; or

                     (b)  a recovery order (as defined in section 67Q) or any other order under this Act, to the extent to which it expressly or impliedly requires or authorises a person to spend time with a child; or

                     (c)  an injunction granted under section 68B or 114, to the extent to which it expressly or impliedly requires or authorises a person to spend time with a child; or

                     (d)  to the extent to which it expressly or impliedly requires or authorises a person to spend time with a child:

                              (i)  an undertaking given to, and accepted by, a court exercising jurisdiction under this Act; or

                             (ii)  a registered parenting plan within the meaning of subsection 63C(6); or

                            (iii)  a recognisance entered into under an order under this Act.

             (2)  The court may do so:

                     (a)  on its own initiative; or

                     (b)  on application by any person.

Limits on power

             (3)  The court must not do so unless:

                     (a)  it also makes or varies a family violence order in the proceedings (whether or not by interim order); and

                     (b)  if the court proposes to revive, vary, discharge or suspend an order or injunction mentioned in paragraph (1)(a), (b) or (c)—the court has before it material that was not before the court that made that order or injunction.

             (4)  The court must not exercise its power under subsection (1) to discharge an order, injunction or arrangement in proceedings to make an interim family violence order or an interim variation of a family violence order.

Relevant considerations

             (5)  In exercising its power under subsection (1), the court must:

                     (a)  have regard to the purposes of this Division (stated in section 68N); and

                     (b)  have regard to whether contact with both parents is in the best interests of the child concerned; and

                     (c)  if varying, discharging or suspending an order or injunction mentioned in paragraph (1)(a), (b) or (c) that, when made or granted, was inconsistent with an existing family violence order—be satisfied that it is appropriate to do so because a person has been exposed, or is likely to be exposed, to family violence as a result of the operation of that order or injunction.

Note:          Sections 60CB to 60CG deal with how a court determines a child’s best interests.

Registration of revival, variation, discharge or suspension of orders and other arrangements

             (6)  The regulations may require a copy of the court’s decision to revive, vary, discharge or suspend an order, injunction or arrangement to be registered in accordance with the regulations. Failure to comply with the requirement does not affect the validity of the court’s decision.

##### <a id="68S"></a>68S  Application of Act and Rules when exercising section 68R power

             (1)  The following provisions do not apply to a court exercising the power under section 68R:

                     (a)  section 65C (who may apply for a parenting order);

                     (b)  subsection 65F(2) (parenting order not to be made unless parties attend family counselling);

                     (c)  section 60CG (court to consider risk of family violence);

                     (d)  section 69N (requirement to transfer certain proceedings);

                     (e)  any provisions (for example, section 60CA) that would otherwise make the best interests of the child the paramount consideration;

Note:       Even though the best interests of the child are not paramount, they must still be taken into account under paragraph 68R(5)(b).

                      (f)  any provisions of this Act or the applicable Rules of Court specified in the regulations.

             (2)  If a court is exercising the power under section 68R in proceedings to make an interim family violence order or an interim variation of a family violence order:

                     (a)  the court has a discretion about whether to apply paragraph 60CC(3)(a) (about taking into account a child’s views etc.); and

                     (b)  any provisions of this Act or the applicable Rules of Court specified in the regulations do not apply.

             (3)  A court exercising the power under section 68R may, as it thinks appropriate, dispense with any otherwise applicable Rules of Court.

##### <a id="68T"></a>68T  Special provisions relating to proceedings to make an interim (or interim variation of) family violence order

             (1)  If, in proceedings to make an interim family violence order or an interim variation of a family violence order, the court revives, varies or suspends an order, injunction or arrangement under section 68R, that revival, variation or suspension ceases to have effect at the earlier of:

                     (a)  the time the interim order stops being in force; and

                     (b)  the end of the period of 21 days starting when the interim order was made.

             (2)  No appeal lies in relation to the revival, variation or suspension.

                     (a)  under the law of the Commonwealth or of a State, Territory or prescribed overseas jurisdiction, a man has executed an instrument acknowledging that he is the father of a specified child; and

                     (b)  the instrument has not been annulled or otherwise set aside;

##### <a id="69W"></a>69W  Orders for carrying out of parentage testing procedures

             (1)  If the parentage of a child is a question in issue in proceedings under this Act, the court may make an order (a **_parentage testing order_**) requiring a parentage testing procedure to be carried out on a person mentioned in subsection (3) for the purpose of obtaining information to assist in determining the parentage of the child.

             (2)  A court may make a parentage testing order:

                     (a)  on its own initiative; or

                     (b)  on the application of:

                     (b)  a person known to be the mother of the child; or

                     (c)  any other person, if the court is of the opinion that, if the parentage testing procedure were to be carried out in relation to the person, the information that could be obtained might assist in determining the parentage of the child.

             (4)  A parentage testing order may be made subject to terms and conditions.

             (5)  This section does not affect the generality of section 69V.

##### <a id="69X"></a>69X  Orders associated with parentage testing orders

                     (a)  an order requiring a person to submit to a medical procedure;

                     (b)  an order requiring a person to provide a bodily sample;

                     (c)  an order requiring a person to provide information relevant to the person’s medical or family history.

             (4)  The court may make such orders as it considers just in relation to costs incurred in relation to:

                     (a)  contested the making of a maintenance assessment or court order for child support on the ground of not being the parent of the child; or

                     (b)  contested the enforcement of an overseas maintenance order, agreement or assessment on the ground of not being the parent of the child.

             (3)  If a parentage testing procedure that is ordered by a court in proceedings mentioned in subsection (1) establishes that a party contesting parentage in those proceedings was not a parent of the child, the court may order that the costs of the procedure are payable by the Secretary.

             (4)  A report in relation to information obtained as a result of a parentage testing procedure, received by the Secretary from an administrative or judicial authority in a reciprocating jurisdiction within the meaning of section 110 or a jurisdiction mentioned in Schedule 4 or 4A to the regulations, may be received in evidence in any proceedings under this Act.

##### <a id="69Y"></a>69Y  Orders directed to persons 18 or over

             (1)  If a person who is 18 or over contravenes a parentage testing order or an order under section 69X, the person is not liable to any penalty in relation to the contravention.

             (2)  The court may draw such inferences from the contravention as appear just in the circumstances.

##### <a id="69Z"></a>69Z  Orders directed to children under 18

                     (c)  a person who, under a parenting order, has responsibility for the child’s long‑term or day‑to‑day care, welfare and development.

             (3)  The court may draw such inferences from a failure or refusal to consent as mentioned in subsection (2) as appear just in the circumstances.

##### <a id="69ZA"></a>69ZA  No liability if parent etc. consents

             (1)  A person who carries out, or who assists in the carrying out of, a medical procedure or other act in relation to a child under a parentage testing order is not liable to any civil or criminal action in relation to the proper carrying out of the procedure or act if it is carried out with the consent of:

                     (a)  a parent of the child; or

                     (b)  a guardian of the child; or

                     (c)  a person who, under a parenting order, has responsibility for the child’s long‑term or day‑to‑day care, welfare and development.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not affect any liability of a person for an act done negligently, or negligently omitted to be done, in relation to the carrying out of the medical procedure or act.

Under those subsections, the amendments of this Act made by the _Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Act 1992_ did not extend to a State unless a Proclamation was in force in relation to the State.

##### <a id="69ZG"></a>69ZG  Application of Part in, and in relation to, Territories

##### <a id="69ZH"></a>69ZH  Additional application of Part

                     (b)  parental responsibility in relation to children.

##### <a id="69ZK"></a>69ZK  Child welfare laws not affected

             (1)  A court having jurisdiction under this Act must not make an order under this Act (other than an order under Division 7) in relation to a child who is under the care (however described) of a person under a child welfare law unless:

### Division 12A—Principles for conducting child‑related proceedings

#### Subdivision A—Proceedings to which this Division applies

##### <a id="69ZM"></a>69ZM  Proceedings to which this Division applies

             (1)  This Division applies to proceedings that are wholly under this Part.

             (2)  This Division also applies to proceedings that are partly under this Part:

                     (a)  to the extent that they are proceedings under this Part; and

                     (b)  if the parties to the proceedings consent—to the extent that they are not proceedings under this Part.

             (3)  This Division also applies to other proceedings between the parties that involve the court exercising jurisdiction under this Act if:

                     (a)  the proceedings:

                              (i)  arise from the breakdown of the parties’ marital relationship; or

                             (ii)  are a de facto financial cause; and

                     (b)  the parties to the proceedings consent.

             (4)  Proceedings to which this Division applies are **_child‑related proceedings_**.

             (5)  Consent given for the purposes of paragraph (2)(b) or subsection (3) must be:

                     (a)  free from coercion; and

                     (b)  given in the form prescribed by the applicable Rules of Court.

             (6)  A party to proceedings may, with the leave of the court, revoke a consent given for the purposes of paragraph (2)(b) or subsection (3).

#### Subdivision B—Principles for conducting child‑related proceedings

##### <a id="69ZN"></a>69ZN  Principles for conducting child‑related proceedings

Application of the principles

             (1)  The court must give effect to the principles in this section:

                     (a)  in performing duties and exercising powers (whether under this Division or otherwise) in relation to child‑related proceedings; and

                     (b)  in making other decisions about the conduct of child‑related proceedings.

Failure to do so does not invalidate the proceedings or any order made in them.

             (2)  Regard is to be had to the principles in interpreting this Division.

Principle 1

             (3)  The first principle is that the court is to consider the needs of the child concerned and the impact that the conduct of the proceedings may have on the child in determining the conduct of the proceedings.

Principle 2

             (4)  The second principle is that the court is to actively direct, control and manage the conduct of the proceedings.

Principle 3

             (5)  The third principle is that the proceedings are to be conducted in a way that will safeguard:

                     (a)  the child concerned against family violence, child abuse and child neglect; and

                     (b)  the parties to the proceedings against family violence.

Principle 4

             (6)  The fourth principle is that the proceedings are, as far as possible, to be conducted in a way that will promote cooperative and child‑focused parenting by the parties.

Principle 5

             (7)  The fifth principle is that the proceedings are to be conducted without undue delay and with as little formality, and legal technicality and form, as possible.

##### <a id="69ZO"></a>69ZO  This Division also applies to proceedings in Chambers

                   A judge, Judicial Registrar, Registrar, Federal Magistrate or magistrate, who is hearing child‑related proceedings in Chambers, has all of the duties and powers that a court has under this Division.

Note:          An order made in Chambers has the same effect as an order made in open court.

##### <a id="69ZP"></a>69ZP  Powers under this Division may be exercised on court’s own initiative

                   The court may exercise a power under this Division:

                     (a)  on the court’s own initiative; or

                     (b)  at the request of one or more of the parties to the proceedings.

#### Subdivision C—Duties and powers related to giving effect to the principles

##### <a id="69ZQ"></a>69ZQ  General duties

             (1)  In giving effect to the principles in section 69ZN, the court must:

                     (a)  decide which of the issues in the proceedings require full investigation and hearing and which may be disposed of summarily; and

                     (b)  decide the order in which the issues are to be decided; and

                     (c)  give directions or make orders about the timing of steps that are to be taken in the proceedings; and

                     (d)  in deciding whether a particular step is to be taken—consider whether the likely benefits of taking the step justify the costs of taking it; and

                     (e)  make appropriate use of technology; and

                      (f)  if the court considers it appropriate—encourage the parties to use family dispute resolution or family counselling; and

                     (g)  deal with as many aspects of the matter as it can on a single occasion; and

                     (h)  deal with the matter, where appropriate, without requiring the parties’ physical attendance at court.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not limit subsection 69ZN(1).

             (3)  A failure to comply with subsection (1) does not invalidate an order.

##### <a id="69ZR"></a>69ZR  Power to make determinations, findings and orders at any stage of proceedings

             (1)  If, at any time after the commencement of child‑related proceedings and before making final orders, the court considers that it may assist in the determination of the dispute between the parties, the court may do any or all of the following:

                     (a)  make a finding of fact in relation to the proceedings;

                     (b)  determine a matter arising out of the proceedings;

                     (c)  make an order in relation to an issue arising out of the proceedings.

Note:          For example, the court may choose to use this power if the court considers that making a finding of fact at a particular point in the proceedings will help to focus the proceedings.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not prevent the court doing something mentioned in paragraph (1)(a), (b) or (c) at the same time as making final orders.

             (3)  To avoid doubt, a judge, Judicial Registrar, Registrar, Federal Magistrate or magistrate who exercises a power under subsection (1) in relation to proceedings is not, merely because of having exercised the power, required to disqualify himself or herself from a further hearing of the proceedings.

##### <a id="69ZS"></a>69ZS  Use of family consultants

                   At any time during child‑related proceedings, the court may designate a family consultant as the family consultant in relation to the proceedings.

Note 1:       Family consultants have the functions described in section 11A. These include assisting and advising people involved in proceedings, and this assistance and advice may involve helping people to better understand the effect of things on the child concerned. Family consultants can also inform people about other services available to help them.

Note 2:       The court may also order parties to proceedings to attend, or arrange for a child to attend, appointments with a family consultant. See section 11F.

#### Subdivision D—Matters relating to evidence

##### <a id="69ZT"></a>69ZT  Rules of evidence not to apply unless court decides

             (1)  These provisions of the _Evidence Act 1995_ do not apply to child‑related proceedings:
