###  FINANCIAL CORPORATIONS (TRANSFER OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES) ACT 1993- SECT 14A  Modified operation of this Part in relation to transfers from subsidiary members of consolidated groups etc. 
**

_Object_

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>The object of this section is to modify the operation of other provisions

of this Part in relation to a transfer of an asset or liability from a

subsidiary member of a consolidated group or MEC group to a receiving

corporation so that, where appropriate:

</dd> </dl></dl>

	(a)	relevant provisions affect the income tax position of the head company of the group in relation to the transfer; and
 	(b)	the effect of the relevant provisions on the income tax position of the receiving corporation is worked out by reference to income tax attributes of the head company, including ones it has because of the following provisions of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_:
 	(i)	section&#160;701-1 (the _single entity rule_);
 	(ii)	section&#160;701-5 (the _entry history rule_);
 	(iii)	section&#160;701-10 (the _head company tax cost setting rule_).

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note 1:	The single entity rule has the effect that a subsidiary

member of a consolidated group or MEC group is taken to be part of the head

company. Note 2:	The entry history rule treats things that happened in relation to an entity before it became a subsidiary member of a consolidated group or MEC group as having happened in relation to the head company. Note 3:	The head company tax cost setting rule sets the amount taken to be the cost to the head company of assets that became assets of the head company because of the single entity rule when an entity became a subsidiary member of the consolidated group or MEC group.  </dl></dl>

_Circumstances in which this section has effect_

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(2)</dt><dd>This section modifies the way in which a provision of this Part (except

this Division) operates in relation to a transfer of an asset or liability from

a financial corporation that (ignoring the single entity rule) is a subsidiary

member of a consolidated group or MEC group to the receiving corporation.

</dd> </dl></dl>

_Modified operation of the provision_

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(3)</dt><dd>If the head company of the group is not a financial corporation, the

provision operates in relation to the head company in the way in which it would

operate in relation to the transferring corporation apart from this subsection.

</dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note:	This ensures that, even though the head company is not the

transferring corporation (because it is not a financial corporation), the

provision operates as though it were. On this basis, the provision may affect

the head company and/or the receiving corporation.

 </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(4)</dt><dd>So far as the provision affects the receiving corporation, it does so on

the basis that the single entity rule, the entry history rule and the head

company tax cost setting rule affect the head company of the group.

</dd> </dl></dl>

<center>Back to Top</center>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note 1:	This subsection ensures that, where the effect of the

provision on the receiving corporation depends on the transferring corporation,

the results of those rules in relation to the head company are taken into

account in determining the effect of the provision on the receiving

corporation. Some examples of this are as follows:

 </dl></dl>

(a)	the head company tax cost setting rule affects subsection 15(3) and section&#160;18 by setting the head company's cost base for assets an entity brought into the group when the entity became a subsidiary member of the group;
 (b)	the entry history rule affects paragraph 16(3)(d) by treating the head company as having been paid, for assuming a liability that was brought into the group by an entity becoming a subsidiary member, the amount paid to the entity for assuming the liability;
 (c)	the entry history rule affects subsections 17(1) and 22(4) and table item&#160;1 in subsection 22(1) by treating the head company as having included in its assessable income amounts included in the assessable income of an entity that later became a subsidiary member of the group;
 (d)	the entry history rule affects subsections 17(1) and (2) and 22(4) by treating deductions allowable to an entity before becoming a subsidiary member of the group as having been allowable to the head company.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note 2:	This subsection also ensures that, if the head company is

a financial corporation, the receiving corporation is affected by the provision

operating in relation to the head company of the group as the transferring

corporation (because the single entity rule operates to treat the subsidiary

member of the group as part of the head company, so the transfer is treated as

being from that company).

 </dl></dl>

_Provisions whose operation is not modified_

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(5)</dt><dd>To avoid doubt, this section does not affect the operation of the

following provisions:

</dd> </dl></dl>

	(a)	section&#160;20;
 	(b)	section&#160;23;
 	(c)	Division&#160;8.

 Guide to Subdivision&#160;170-A

170-1  What this Subdivision is about

A transferring corporation (within the meaning of the _Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993_) can transfer a tax loss to a receiving corporation (within the meaning of that Act) so that the receiving corporation can deduct it. The corporations must be related in such a way that that Act would apply to a transfer of assets from the transferring corporation to the receiving corporation.

Effect of transferring a tax loss 
 170-10  When a corporation can transfer a tax loss

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>A transferring corporation within the meaning of the _Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993_ (the _loss company_) can transfer an amount of its <sup>*</sup>tax loss for an

income year of the loss company (the _loss year_) to a receiving

corporation within the meaning of that Act (the _income company_)

if the conditions in this Subdivision are met.</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>The amount transferred can be the whole or part of the <sup>*</sup>tax loss. </dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note:	A PDF cannot transfer a tax loss, except one for a period

before it became a PDF: see section&#160;195-10.

 </dl></dl>

<center>Back to Top</center>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(3)</dt><dd>However, the <sup>*</sup>loss company cannot transfer so much of the

<sup>*</sup>tax loss as the loss company has deducted, or can deduct, for an

income year before the one in which the amount is transferred.

</dd> </dl></dl>

170-15  Income company is taken to have incurred transferred loss

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>If an amount of a <sup>*</sup>tax loss is transferred, the

<sup>*</sup>amount is taken to be a tax loss incurred by the <sup>*</sup>income

company in the <sup>*</sup>loss year.</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>However, if the <sup>*</sup>loss year is the same as the income year of the <sup>*</sup>income company for which the amount is transferred (the _transfer year_), the <sup>*</sup>income company is taken to have incurred the <sup>*</sup>tax loss in the income year before the loss year. </dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note:	This rule is needed because Division&#160;36 allows a tax

loss to be deducted only if it was incurred in an _earlier_ income year.

 </dl></dl>

170-20  Who can deduct transferred loss

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>If an amount of a <sup>*</sup>tax loss is transferred, the

<sup>*</sup>income company can deduct the amount in accordance with

section&#160;36-15 (which is about how to deduct a tax loss), but only if

Subdivision&#160;165-A (as modified by section&#160;170-23) and

Subdivision&#160;175-A do not prevent it from doing so.

</dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note:	Subdivision&#160;165-A is about the conditions that a

company needs to satisfy before it can deduct a tax loss from an earlier income

year. 	Subdivision&#160;175-A is about the Commissioner preventing a company from getting certain tax benefits through its unused tax losses.  </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(2)</dt><dd>The <sup>*</sup>loss company can no longer deduct the transferred amount

and is taken not to have incurred the <sup>*</sup>tax loss to the extent of

that amount.

</dd> </dl></dl>

170-23  When income company must maintain same owners and control

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>Ordinarily, Subdivision&#160;165-A prevents a company from deducting for

an income year (the _deduction year_) a tax loss if there has been

a change in the ownership or control of the company between the _loss year_ and the deduction year.

</dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note:	Subdivision&#160;165-A is about the conditions that a

company needs to satisfy before it can deduct a tax loss from an earlier income

year.

 </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(2)</dt><dd>However, subsection&#160;(3) modifies that Subdivision so that the

<sup>*</sup>income company is prevented from deducting for the deduction year a

transferred amount of a <sup>*</sup>tax loss only if there has been a change in

ownership or control in the income company between the _transfer year_ and

the deduction year.</dd> <dt>(3)</dt><dd>That Subdivision applies to the transferred amount as if all references to "<sup>*</sup>loss year" in that Subdivision were references to "<sup>*</sup>transfer year". </dd> </dl></dl>

170-25  Tax treatment of consideration for transferred tax loss

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>If the loss company receives any consideration from the income company for

the amount of the tax loss:

</dd> </dl></dl>

	(a)	that consideration is neither assessable income nor exempt income of the loss company; and
 	(b)	the loss company does not make a capital gain because of the receipt of the consideration.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note:	However, the consideration may affect how

section&#160;170-210 modifies the cost base of direct and indirect interests in

the loss company.

 </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(2)</dt><dd>If the income company gives any consideration to the loss company for the

amount of the tax loss:

</dd> </dl></dl>

	(a)	the income company cannot deduct the amount or value of the consideration; and
 	(b)	the income company does not make a capital loss because of the giving of the consideration.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note:	However, the consideration may affect how

section&#160;170-215 modifies the cost base of direct and indirect interests in

the income company.

 </dl></dl>

Conditions for transfer 
 170-28  _Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993_ must apply to asset transfer from loss company to income company

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

		If it were assumed that:

 </dl></dl>

	(a)	an asset (within the meaning of the _Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993_) had been transferred by the <sup>*</sup>loss company to the <sup>*</sup>income company on the last day of a particular income year of the <sup>*</sup>loss company (the _notional transfer year_); and 
 	(b)	the requirements of paragraphs 7(6)(a) and (b) of that Act were satisfied in relation to that transfer;

then it must be the case that that Act would have applied to that transfer.

170-32  The loss year

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

		The <sup>*</sup>loss year must be either:

 </dl></dl>

	(a)	the income year in which the _Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993_ commenced; or
 	(b)	an earlier income year. 
 170-33  The transfer year

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>The <sup>*</sup>transfer year must either:

</dd> </dl></dl>

	(a)	end at the end of the <sup>*</sup>notional transfer year; or
 	(b)	correspond to the income year of the <sup>*</sup>loss company that next follows the <sup>*</sup>notional transfer year.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(2)</dt><dd>Also, the <sup>*</sup>transfer year must be one of the 10 income years

after the income year in which the _Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993_ commenced.

</dd> </dl></dl>

170-35  The loss company

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

		If the <sup>*</sup>loss year and the <sup>*</sup>transfer year are the same,

it must be the case that the <sup>*</sup>loss company was _not_ required

to calculate the <sup>*</sup>tax loss under section&#160;165-70 or 175-35.

 </dl></dl>

170-50  Transfer by written agreement

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>The transfer must be made by a written agreement

between the <sup>*</sup>loss company and the <sup>*</sup>income company.</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>The agreement must: </dd> </dl></dl>

	(a)	specify the <sup>*</sup>transfer year (which may be earlier than the income year in which the agreement is made); and

<center>Back to Top</center>
 	(b)	specify the amount of the <sup>*</sup>tax loss being transferred; and
 	(c)	be signed by the public officer of each company; and
 	(d)	be made on or before the day of lodgment of the <sup>*</sup>income company's <sup>*</sup>income tax return for the <sup>*</sup>transfer year, or within such further time as the Commissioner allows.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note:	The agreement will usually be made in the next income year

_after_ the one in which the tax loss is transferred.

 </dl></dl>

170-55  Losses must be transferred in order they are incurred

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>If the <sup>*</sup>loss company has 2 or more <sup>*</sup>tax losses

(other than <sup>*</sup>film losses) that it can transfer in the

<sup>*</sup>transfer year, it can transfer them only in the order in which it

incurred them.</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>If the <sup>*</sup>loss company has 2 or more <sup>*</sup>film losses that it can transfer in the <sup>*</sup>transfer year, it can transfer them only in the order in which it incurred them. </dd> </dl></dl>

170-60  Income company cannot transfer transferred tax loss

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

		The <sup>*</sup>income company cannot transfer an amount of a <sup>*</sup>tax

loss transferred to it, or any part of the amount.

 </dl></dl>

Effect of agreement to transfer more than can be transferred 
 170-65  Agreement transfers as much as can be transferred

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>If the amount specified in an agreement exceeds the maximum amount that

the <sup>*</sup>loss company can transfer to the <sup>*</sup>income company in

the <sup>*</sup>transfer year, only that maximum amount is taken to have been

transferred.</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>One reason why an agreement might specify more than can be transferred is that an assessment has been amended since the agreement. </dd> </dl></dl>

170-70  Amendment of assessments

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

		The Commissioner may amend an assessment to disallow a deduction for a

transferred amount of a <sup>*</sup>tax loss:

 </dl></dl>

	(a)	if the agreement to transfer the tax loss is ineffective because the <sup>*</sup>loss company did not actually incur the loss; or
 	(b)	to the extent that section&#160;170-65 reduces the transferred amount of a tax loss because the loss company did not actually incur some of it.

The Commissioner may do so despite section&#160;170 (Amendment of assessments) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.
