## Part 3—Income tax relief for transfers

### Division 1—Preliminary

##### <a id="13"></a>13  Object of Part

                   The object of this Part is to provide income tax relief for transfers by modifying the effect of certain provisions of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ and the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

##### <a id="14"></a>14  Part to be treated as if it were a provision of the income tax law

             (1)  An expression used in this Part and in the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ has the same meaning in this Part as it has in that Act.

             (2)  For the purposes of the application of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ to a taxpayer, the provisions of this Part are to be treated as if they were provisions of that Act.

##### <a id="14A"></a>14A  Modified operation of this Part in relation to transfers from subsidiary members of consolidated groups etc.

Object

             (1)  The object of this section is to modify the operation of other provisions of this Part in relation to a transfer of an asset or liability from a subsidiary member of a consolidated group or MEC group to a receiving corporation so that, where appropriate:

                     (a)  relevant provisions affect the income tax position of the head company of the group in relation to the transfer; and

                     (b)  the effect of the relevant provisions on the income tax position of the receiving corporation is worked out by reference to income tax attributes of the head company, including ones it has because of the following provisions of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_:

                              (i)  section 701‑1 (the **_single entity rule_**);

                             (ii)  section 701‑5 (the **_entry history rule_**);

                            (iii)  section 701‑10 (the **_head company tax cost setting rule_**).

Note 1:       The single entity rule has the effect that a subsidiary member of a consolidated group or MEC group is taken to be part of the head company.

Note 2:       The entry history rule treats things that happened in relation to an entity before it became a subsidiary member of a consolidated group or MEC group as having happened in relation to the head company.

Note 3:       The head company tax cost setting rule sets the amount taken to be the cost to the head company of assets that became assets of the head company because of the single entity rule when an entity became a subsidiary member of the consolidated group or MEC group.

Circumstances in which this section has effect

             (2)  This section modifies the way in which a provision of this Part (except this Division) operates in relation to a transfer of an asset or liability from a financial corporation that (ignoring the single entity rule) is a subsidiary member of a consolidated group or MEC group to the receiving corporation.

Modified operation of the provision

             (3)  If the head company of the group is not a financial corporation, the provision operates in relation to the head company in the way in which it would operate in relation to the transferring corporation apart from this subsection.

Note:          This ensures that, even though the head company is not the transferring corporation (because it is not a financial corporation), the provision operates as though it were. On this basis, the provision may affect the head company and/or the receiving corporation.

             (4)  So far as the provision affects the receiving corporation, it does so on the basis that the single entity rule, the entry history rule and the head company tax cost setting rule affect the head company of the group.

Note 1:       This subsection ensures that, where the effect of the provision on the receiving corporation depends on the transferring corporation, the results of those rules in relation to the head company are taken into account in determining the effect of the provision on the receiving corporation. Some examples of this are as follows:

(a)           the head company tax cost setting rule affects subsection 15(3) and section 18 by setting the head company’s cost base for assets an entity brought into the group when the entity became a subsidiary member of the group;

(b)           the entry history rule affects paragraph 16(3)(d) by treating the head company as having been paid, for assuming a liability that was brought into the group by an entity becoming a subsidiary member, the amount paid to the entity for assuming the liability;

(c)           the entry history rule affects subsections 17(1) and 22(4) and table item 1 in subsection 22(1) by treating the head company as having included in its assessable income amounts included in the assessable income of an entity that later became a subsidiary member of the group;

(d)           the entry history rule affects subsections 17(1) and (2) and 22(4) by treating deductions allowable to an entity before becoming a subsidiary member of the group as having been allowable to the head company.

Note 2:       This subsection also ensures that, if the head company is a financial corporation, the receiving corporation is affected by the provision operating in relation to the head company of the group as the transferring corporation (because the single entity rule operates to treat the subsidiary member of the group as part of the head company, so the transfer is treated as being from that company).

Provisions whose operation is not modified

             (5)  To avoid doubt, this section does not affect the operation of the following provisions:

                     (b)  section 23;

                     (c)  Division 8.

### Division 2—General relief

##### <a id="15"></a>15  Asset transfers—general

Tax treatment of transferring corporation

             (1)  In determining:

                     (a)  whether an amount is included in the assessable income of the transferring corporation under section 25A, 26BB, 26C or 159GS of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ or section 6‑5, 15‑15 or 775‑15 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; or

             (2)  A deduction is not allowable to the receiving corporation under section 8‑1 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ in respect of expenditure incurred in the acquisition of an asset as the result of a transfer.

Receiving corporation to inherit transferring corporation’s cost base

             (3)  If an asset is transferred, then, in determining:

                     (a)  whether an amount is included in the assessable income of the receiving corporation under section 25A, 26BB, 26C or Division 16E of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ or section 6‑5, 15‑15 or 775‑15 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; or

                     (b)  whether an amount is allowable as a deduction to the receiving corporation under section 52, 70B or Division 16E of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ or section 8‑1 or 775‑30 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_;

in respect of the holding, or any subsequent disposal, of the asset, the receiving corporation is to be treated as if it had acquired the asset for an amount equal to what would have been the asset’s cost base to the transferring corporation for the purposes of working out under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ whether the transferring corporation made a capital gain from the transfer.

Note:          For transitional provisions about former sections 82Y and 82Z of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, see Part 2 of Schedule 4 to the _New Business Tax System (Taxation of Financial Arrangements) Act (No. 1) 2003_.

##### <a id="16"></a>16  Liability transfers—general

                     (b)  whether an amount is allowable as a deduction to the transferring corporation under section 8‑1 or 775‑30 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_;

in respect of a transfer of a liability, the transferring corporation is to be treated as if the transfer had not occurred.

Receiving corporation not assessable in respect of assumption of liability

             (2)  An amount is not to be included in the assessable income of the receiving corporation under section 6‑5 or 775‑15 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ in respect of the assumption of the liability as a result of the transfer.

                     (b)  whether an amount is allowable as a deduction to the receiving corporation under Division 16E of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ or section 8‑1 or 775‑30 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_;

in respect of the subsistence, or any subsequent transfer, of the liability, the receiving corporation is to be treated as if:

                     (c)  it had been paid or given consideration for the original transfer; and

                     (d)  the amount of the consideration were equal to the amount (if any) of the consideration paid or given to the transferring corporation in respect of the assumption by the transferring corporation of the liability.

Note:          For transitional provisions about former sections 82Y and 82Z of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, see Part 2 of Schedule 4 to the _New Business Tax System (Taxation of Financial Arrangements) Act (No. 1) 2003_.

### Division 3—Securities

##### <a id="17"></a>17  Securities—adjustment of cost base 

Adjustment where security is transferred

             (1)  If:

                              (i)  one or more amounts (other than periodic interest) are or were included in the transferring corporation’s assessable income under former section 25, or under Division 16E of Part III, of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ or under section 6‑5 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ in respect of the security; or

                             (ii)  one or more amounts (other than periodic interest) are or were allowable as deductions to the transferring corporation under former section 51, or under Division 16E of Part III, of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ or under section 8‑1 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ in respect of the security;

                     (b)  one or more amounts (other than periodic interest) are or were allowable as deductions to the transferring corporation under former section 51, or under Division 16E of Part III, of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ or under section 8‑1 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ in respect of the security;

those Acts have effect as if the amount that, apart from this subsection, would have been the consideration paid or given to the receiving corporation in respect of the assumption of the liability as the result of the transfer were increased by the amount, or the sum of the amounts, covered by paragraph (b).

Definitions

             (3)  In this section:

                    <a name="period-interest"></a>**_periodic interest_** has the same meaning as in Division 16E of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

                    <a name="secur"></a>**_security_** has the same meaning as in Division 16E of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

### Division 4—Capital gains and capital losses

##### <a id="18"></a>18  Additional roll‑over relief

                   There is a roll‑over under Subdivision 126‑B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (which normally applies only to certain transfers between companies in the same wholly‑owned group) if:

                     (a)  the trigger event is a transfer to which this Act applies; and

                     (b)  the requirements of that Subdivision are met, disregarding:

                              (i)  subsections 126‑50(1), (5), (6), (7), (8) and (9) of that Act; and

                             (ii)  section 126‑55 of that Act.

This is in addition to that Subdivision’s effect apart from this section.

##### <a id="19"></a>19  For the receiving corporation, asset is taxable Australian property

                   Parts 3‑1 and 3‑3 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ apply to an asset acquired by the receiving corporation as a result of a transfer as if the asset is, while it is an asset of the receiving corporation, taxable Australian property.

### Division 5—Trading stock

##### <a id="21"></a>21  Transfers of trading stock 

Trading stock on hand at beginning of year of income

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a transfer of trading stock occurred during a year of income of the transferring corporation; and

                     (b)  the trading stock was on hand at the beginning of that year of income;

then:

                     (c)  section 70‑35 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ has effect as if the trading stock were not on hand at the beginning of the year of income; and

                     (d)  section 8‑1 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ has effect as if:

                              (i)  the receiving corporation had incurred expenditure in the acquisition of the trading stock; and

                             (ii)  the amount of that expenditure were equal to the value of the trading stock as at the end of the immediately preceding year of income of the transferring corporation (being the value that applies for the purposes of section 70‑45 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_); and

                            (iii)  that expenditure had been so incurred immediately after the transfer; and

                     (e)  sections 70‑90 and 70‑95 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ do not apply in relation to the transfer of the trading stock.

Trading stock not on hand at beginning of year of income

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  a transfer of trading stock occurred during a year of income of the transferring corporation; and

                     (b)  the trading stock was not on hand at the beginning of that year of income;

then:

                     (c)  a deduction is not allowable under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ to the transferring corporation in respect of expenditure incurred in the acquisition of the trading stock; and

                     (d)  section 8‑1 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ has effect as if:

                              (i)  the receiving corporation had incurred expenditure in the acquisition of the trading stock; and

                             (ii)  the amount of that expenditure were equal to the amount of the expenditure mentioned in paragraph (c); and

                            (iii)  that expenditure had been so incurred immediately after the transfer; and

                     (e)  sections 70‑90 and 70‑95 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ do not apply in relation to the transfer of the trading stock.

### Division 6—Bad debts

##### <a id="22"></a>22  Deductions for bad debts

             (1)  In relation to a transfer of a debt, these rules about deductions for bad debts have effect as shown in the table:

                     (a)  section 25‑35 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_;

                     (b)  subsection 63(1A) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

Modification of tests for receiving corporation to deduct bad debt

             (2)  In relation to a transfer of a debt, Subdivisions 165‑C, 166‑C, 175‑C, 709‑D and 719‑I of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ have effect as if the debt had been incurred at the time of the transfer.

Note:          Those Subdivisions are about companies deducting bad debts.

Easing of restrictions on transferring corporation

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  this Act applies to one or more transfers of assets by the transferring corporation to the receiving corporation; and

                     (b)  an entity incurs a debt to the transferring corporation in a year of income (the **_debt year_**); and

                     (c)  the debt year is the income year in which this section (as originally enacted) commenced or an earlier income year; and

                     (d)  any one or more of Subdivisions 165‑C, 175‑C, 709‑D and 719‑I of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ prevent the transferring corporation from deducting an amount for the debt for an income year (the **_deduction year_**); and

                     (e)  the transferring corporation did not, at any time in the deduction year, derive income from:

                              (i)  a business of a kind that it did not carry on; or

                             (ii)  a transaction of a kind that it had not entered into in the course of its business operations;

                            before the transfer, or the earliest of the transfers, occurred;

none of those Subdivisions prevents the transferring corporation from deducting that amount.

Note:          Subdivision 165‑C of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ is about the conditions that a company needs to satisfy before it can deduct a bad debt.

                   Subdivision 175‑C of that Act is about the Commissioner preventing a company from getting certain tax benefits through its unused bad debts.

                   Subdivision 709‑D of that Act is about the conditions that must be met for an entity to deduct a bad debt that has for a period been owed to a member of a consolidated group and has for another period been owed to an entity that was not a member of that group for the period.

                   Subdivision 719‑I of that Act is about the conditions that must be met for an entity to deduct a bad debt that has for a period been owed to a member of a MEC group.

Limit on deductions for partly written‑off debt

             (4)  If this Act applies to the transfer of a debt that has been partly written off, the maximum that the receiving corporation can deduct for the debt for one or more years of income under section 8‑1 or 25‑35 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ is worked out using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2006C00745/Html/75fbfc94-e5dc-46ef-96a2-4185211ae534_files/image002.gif)

where:

                    <a name="unrecouped-duction"></a>**_unrecouped deductions_** means the total of the amounts that the transferring corporation has deducted or can deduct for any year of income under:

                     (a)  section 8‑1 or 25‑35 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; or

                     (b)  section 63 or former section 51 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_;

reduced by the total of any amounts included in its assessable income in respect of the debt under:

                     (c)  Subdivision 20‑A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; or

                     (d)  former subsection 63(3) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

### Division 7—Interest withholding tax

##### <a id="23"></a>23  Exemption from interest withholding tax

             (1)  In addition to its effect apart from this section, section 128F of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ also has the effect it would have if the change set out in subsection (2) of this section were made.

             (2)  The change is that paragraphs (1)(a) and (b) of section 128F of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (being that section in the form that applies under item 16 of Schedule 5 to the _Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No. 2) 1997_) are to be replaced by the following paragraphs:

                    “(a)  the liability to pay the interest was transferred to the company by another company (the **_transferor_**);

                     (b)  the _Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993_ applies to the transfer;

                     (c)  before the transfer, this section applied to interest paid by the transferor in discharge of the liability;

                    (ca)  the transferor issued the debentures or debt interests;”.

### Division 8—Tax losses

#### Subdivision B—Tax losses and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997

##### <a id="26A"></a>26A  Application of this Subdivision

                   This Subdivision applies to assessments for the 1997‑98 income year or a later income year.

##### <a id="26C"></a>26C  Deduction for tax loss—easing of restrictions on transferring corporation

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  this Act applies to one or more transfers by the transferring corporation to the receiving corporation; and

                     (b)  the transferring corporation is taken (otherwise than because of a transfer of a tax loss under former section 80G of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ or under Subdivision 170‑A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_) to have incurred a tax loss for a year of income (the **_loss year_**); and

                     (c)  the loss year is the income year in which former section 26 of this Act commenced or an earlier income year; and

                     (d)  Subdivision 165‑A or 175‑A, or both, of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ prevent the transferring corporation from deducting an amount of that tax loss for an income year (the **_deduction year_**); and

                     (e)  the transferring corporation did not, at any time in the deduction year, derive income from:

                              (i)  a business of a kind that it did not carry on; or

                             (ii)  a transaction of a kind that it had not entered into in the course of its business operations;

                            before the transfer, or the earliest of the transfers, occurred;

neither Subdivision 165‑A nor 175‑A of that Act prevents the transferring corporation from deducting that amount.

Note:          Subdivision 165‑A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ is about the conditions that a company needs to satisfy before it can deduct a tax loss from an earlier income year.

                   Subdivision 175‑A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ is about the Commissioner preventing a company from getting certain tax benefits through its unused tax losses.

             (2)  Subsection (1) operates on the basis described in subsection (3) if:

                     (a)  the head company of a consolidated group or MEC group incurred a tax loss because of Subdivision 707‑A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

                     (b)  the company (the **_real loss‑maker_**) that incurred the tax loss apart from that Subdivision is a member of the group in the deduction year; and

                     (c)  disregarding section 701‑1 (the single entity rule) of that Act, this Act applies to one or more transfers by the real loss‑maker to the receiving corporation.

Note:          In certain cases, Subdivision 707‑A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ treats the head company of a consolidated group or MEC as incurring a tax loss actually incurred by an entity that becomes a member of the group.

             (3)  Subsection (1) operates as if:

                     (a)  the head company were the transferring corporation in relation to each transfer described in paragraph (1)(a) and this Act applied to each of those transfers; and

                     (b)  the head company incurred the tax loss for the income year for which the real loss‑maker incurred it (apart from Subdivision 707‑A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_); and

                     (c)  each reference in that subsection to Subdivision 165‑A of that Act were a reference to that Subdivision as its operation is affected by Subdivision 707‑B of that Act, and by Subdivision 719‑F of that Act (if relevant).

Note 1:       Subdivision 707‑B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ affects the operation of Subdivision 165‑A of that Act in relation to the deduction of a tax loss incurred by the head company of a consolidated group or MEC group because of Subdivision 707‑A of that Act.

Note 2:       Subdivision 719‑F of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ affects the operation of Subdivision 165‑A of that Act in relation to the deduction of a tax loss incurred by the head company of a MEC group because of Subdivision 707‑A of that Act.

             (4)  An expression used in this section and in the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ has the same meaning in this section as it has in that Act. This subsection does not apply to the expressions **_deduction year_**, **_loss year_**, **_this Act_** and **_transfer_**.

### Division 9—Continuity of partnerships

##### <a id="27"></a>27  Transfer of an interest in a partnership does not affect continuity of partnership

             (1)  This section applies if an interest in a partnership is transferred.

             (2)  For the purposes of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, the transfer does not affect the continuity of the partnership.

_Note:       These people cease to hold office on the commencement of the amendments because of the repeal of the provisions under which they were appointed._

## 3  Continued protection from liability

Section 58 of the old Act continues to apply in relation to conduct, before the commencement of the amendments, of APRA’s Board, a member of APRA’s Board or an agent of a member of APRA’s Board.

_Note:       The reference to a member of APRA’s Board covers APRA’s Chief Executive Officer._

## 4  Continued effect of certain delegations

(1)       A delegation in force, immediately before the commencement of the amendments, under subsection 15(1) or (2) of the old Act continues to have effect after that commencement as if it were a delegation under APRA’s seal under that subsection of the amended Act. If the delegation was to one or more members of APRA’s Board, it continues to have effect as if it were a delegation to any APRA member.

(2)       A direction in force, immediately before the commencement of the amendments, under subsection 15(3) of the old Act continues to have effect after that commencement, in relation to a delegation to which subitem (1) applies, as if it were a direction given by APRA under that subsection of the amended Act.

(3)       A delegation to one or more members of APRA’s Board in force, immediately before the commencement of the amendments, under a provision amended by Schedule 2 continues to have effect after that commencement as if it were a delegation under the amended provision to any APRA member.

_Note:       Delegations in favour of APRA, or APRA staff members, are not affected by the Schedule 2 amendments._

## 5  Continued effect of determinations of terms and conditions for staff and consultants

A determination of terms and conditions in force, immediately before the commencement of the amendments, under subsection 45(2) or 47(2) of the old Act continues to have effect after that commencement as if it were a determination by APRA under that subsection of the amended Act.

## 6  Continued effect of approvals under paragraph 56(5)(b)

An approval in force, immediately before the commencement of the amendments, under paragraph 56(5)(b) of the old Act continues to have effect after that commencement as if it were an approval by APRA under that paragraph of the amended Act.

## 7  Continued or extended effect of certain regulations

(1)       Regulations in force, immediately before the commencement of the amendments, under paragraph (k) of the definition of **_Act covered by this section_** in subsection 56(1) of the old Act continue to have effect after that commencement as if they were made under paragraph (o) of the definition of **_prudential regulation framework law_** in subsection 3(1) of the amended Act, but only as that paragraph applies for the purposes of section 56 of the amended Act.

(2)       Regulations in force, immediately before the commencement of the amendments, under paragraph 56(5)(a) of the old Act have effect after that commencement (in addition to the effect they continue to have for that paragraph of the amended Act) as if they were also made under subsection 10A(1) of the amended Act.

## 8  Delegations by ASIC to APRA staff members

(1)       Subsection 102(2A) of the _Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001_ has effect after the commencement of the amendments as if the reference in that subsection to the Chief Executive Officer of APRA were instead a reference to APRA.

(2)       For the purposes of that subsection as it continues to have effect, an agreement to a delegation, in force under that subsection immediately before the commencement of the amendments, continues to have effect after that commencement as if it were given by APRA.

 (No. 101, 2006)_

## Schedule 6

## 1  Application of Schedule 1 and 2 amendments

Except as mentioned in items 2 and 3, the repeals and amendments made by Schedules 1 and 2 apply:

                     (a)  so far as they affect assessments—to assessments for the 2006‑07 income year and all later income years; and

                     (b)  otherwise—to acts done or omitted to be done, or states of affairs existing, after the commencement of the repeals and amendments.

## 6  Object

The object of this Part is to ensure that, despite the repeals and amendments made by this Act, the full legal and administrative consequences of:

                     (a)  any act done or omitted to be done; or

                     (b)  any state of affairs existing; or

                     (c)  any period ending;

before such a repeal or amendment applies, can continue to arise and be carried out, directly or indirectly through an indefinite number of steps, even if some or all of those steps are taken after the repeal or amendment applies.

## 7  Making and amending assessments, and doing other things, in relation to past matters

Even though an Act is repealed or amended by this Act, the repeal or amendment is disregarded for the purpose of doing any of the following under any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_):

                     (a)  making or amending an assessment (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

                     (b)  exercising any right or power, performing any obligation or duty or doing any other thing (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

Example 1: On 31 July 1999, Greg Ltd lodged its annual return under former section 160ARE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The return stated that the company had a credit on its franking account and that no franking deficit tax was payable for the 1998‑99 franking year. Under former section 160ARH of that Act, the Commissioner was taken to have made an assessment consistent with the return.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of Part IIIAA of that Act, the Commissioner concludes that Greg Ltd fraudulently overfranked dividends it paid during the 1998‑99 franking year, and had a franking account deficit for that franking year. As a result, the Commissioner considers that franking deficit tax and a penalty by way of additional tax are payable.

                   The Commissioner can amend the assessment under former section 160ARN of that Act, because item 7 of this Schedule disregards the repeal of that section for the purposes of making an assessment in relation to the 1998‑99 franking year. Item 7 will also disregard the repeal of Division 11 of former Part IIIAA to the extent necessary for the Commissioner to assess Greg Ltd’s liability to a penalty by way of additional tax.

                   Despite the repeal of sections 160ARU and 160ARV, item 9 will ensure that the general interest charge will accrue on the unpaid franking deficit tax and penalty until they are paid.

                   Item 7 will also preserve Greg Ltd’s right, under former section 160ART of that Act, to object against the Commissioner’s amended assessment (including the penalty), since the objection is the exercise of a right in relation to a franking year that ended before the repeal of Part IIIAA.

Example 2: During the 1997‑98 income year, Duffy Property Ltd withheld amounts from its employees’ wages as required by former Divisions 1AAA and 2 of Part VI of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The company failed to notify the Commissioner of those amounts, and failed to remit them to the Commissioner.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of those Divisions, the Commissioner discovers that the withheld amounts have not been remitted. The company’s records are incomplete and the Commissioner is unable to completely ascertain the extent of its liability for the withheld amounts. Under section 222AGA of that Act, the Commissioner makes an estimate of the liability.

                   Item 7 will disregard the repeal of section 220AAZA of that Act (which empowered the Commissioner to recover the amount of the estimate). Even though the estimate is made after the repeal, it relates to amounts withheld before the repeal.

## 8  Saving of provisions about effect of assessments

If a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act deals with the effect of an assessment, the repeal or amendment is disregarded in relation to assessments made, before or after the repeal or amendment applies, in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

## 9  Saving of provisions about general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty

If:

                     (a)  a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act provides for the payment of:

                              (i)  general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty (all within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_); or

                             (ii)  interest under the _Taxation (Interest on Overpayments and Early Payments) Act 1983_; and

                     (b)  in a particular case, the period in respect of which the charge, penalty or interest is payable (whether under the provision or under the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_) has not begun, or has begun but not ended, when the provision is repealed or amended;

then, despite the repeal or amendment, the provision or part continues to apply in the particular case until the end of the period.

## 10  Repeals disregarded for the purposes of dependent provisions

If the operation of a provision (the **_subject provision_**) of any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_) made under any Act depends to any extent on an Act, or a provision of an Act, that is repealed by this Act, the repeal is disregarded so far as it affects the operation of the subject provision.

## 11  Schedule does not limit operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_

This Schedule does not limit the operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.
