	(ii)	the requirements of paragraphs 7(6)(a) and (b) of that Act were satisfied in relation to that transfer;
		that Act would have applied to that transfer; and
	(b)	the loss company incurred in respect of a year of income (the loss year) a net capital loss that, apart from this section, would be taken into account in ascertaining whether a net capital gain accrued to the loss company, or the loss company incurred a net capital loss, in respect of the next succeeding year of income; and
	(ba)	the loss year is:
	(i)	the year of income in which that Act commenced; or
	(ii)	an earlier year of income; and
	(bb)	both the following conditions are satisfied in relation to a year of income (the gain year) of the gain company:
	(i)	either:
	(A)	the gain year ends at the end of the notional transfer year; or
	(B)	the gain year corresponds to the year of income of the loss company next following the notional transfer year;
	(ii)	the gain year is:
	(A)	the year of income in which that Act commenced; or
	(B)	one of the 10 following years of income; and”.

	(iii)	that expenditure had been so incurred immediately after the transfer; and

	(b)	an entity incurs a debt to the transferring corporation in a year of income (the debt year); and
	(c)	the debt year is the income year in which this section (as originally enacted) commenced or an earlier income year; and
	(d)	Subdivision 165‑C or 175‑C, or both, of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 prevent the transferring corporation from deducting an amount for the debt for an income year (the deduction year); and
	(e)	the transferring corporation did not, at any time in the deduction year, derive income from:
	(i)	a business of a kind that it did not carry on; or
	(ii)	a transaction of a kind that it had not entered into in the course of its business operations;
		before the transfer, or the earliest of the transfers, occurred;
neither Subdivision 165‑C nor 175‑C of that Act prevents the transferring corporation from deducting that amount.
Note:	Subdivision 165‑C of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 is about the conditions that a company needs to satisfy before it can deduct a bad debt.
	Subdivision 175‑C of that Act is about the Commissioner preventing a company from getting certain tax benefits through its unused bad debts.
Limit on deductions for partly written‑off debt
	(4)	If this Act applies to the transfer of a debt that has been partly written off, the maximum that the receiving corporation can deduct for the debt for one or more years of income under section 8‑1 or 25‑35 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 is worked out using the formula:

where:
unrecouped deductions means the total of the amounts that the transferring corporation has deducted or can deduct for any year of income under:
	(a)	section 8‑1 or 25‑35 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997; or
	(b)	section 51 or 63 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936;
reduced by the total of any amounts included in its assessable income in respect of the debt under:
	(c)	Subdivision 20‑A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997; or
	(d)	subsection 63(3) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936.

Division 7—Interest withholding tax
23  Exemption from interest withholding tax
	(1)	In addition to its effect apart from this section, section 128F of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 also has the effect it would have if the change set out in subsection (2) of this section were made.
	(2)	The change is that paragraphs (1)(a) and (b) of section 128F of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (being that section in the form that applies under item 16 of Schedule 5 to the Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No. 2) 1997) are to be replaced by the following paragraphs:
	“(a)	the liability to pay the interest was transferred to the company by another company (the transferor);
	(b)	the Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993 applies to the transfer;
	(c)	before the transfer, this section applied to interest paid by the transferor in discharge of the liability;
	(ca)	the transferor issued the debentures;
	(cb)	the debentures were issued on or before 18 June 1993;
	(cc)	the interest was not paid in respect of a debenture resulting from a ‘roll‑over’, after 18 June 1993, of the whole or a part of a previous debenture;
	(cd)	the interest was not paid in respect of the period of extension of the period of a debenture, being an extension occurring after 18 June 1993;”.

Division 8—Tax losses
Subdivision A—Tax losses and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936
24  Transfer of tax loss from transferring corporation to receiving corporation 
	(1A)	This section does not enable a right to a deduction for an amount of a loss to be transferred in the 1997‑98 year of income or a later year of income.
	(1)	In addition to its effect apart from this section, section 80G of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 also has the effect it would have if all of the changes set out in subsections (2), (3) and (4) of this section were made.
	(2)	The first change is that paragraphs 80G(6)(a), (b) and (ba) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 are to be replaced by the following paragraphs:
	“(a)	assuming that:
	(i)	an asset (within the meaning of the Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993) had been transferred by a transferring corporation within the meaning of that Act (the loss company) to a receiving corporation within the meaning of that Act (the income company) on the last day of a particular year of income of the loss company (the notional transfer year); and
	(ii)	the requirements of paragraphs 7(6)(a) and (b) of that Act were satisfied in relation to that transfer;
		that Act would have applied to that transfer; and
	(b)	the loss company is taken to have incurred a loss for the purposes of section 79E or 80 in a year of income (the loss year); and
	(ba)	the loss year is:
	(i)	the year of income in which that Act commenced; or
	(ii)	an earlier year of income; and
	(bb)	both the following conditions are satisfied in relation to a year of income (the income year) of the income company:
	(i)	either:
	(A)	the income year ends at the end of the notional transfer year; or
	(B)	the income year corresponds to the year of income of the loss company next following the notional transfer year;
	(ii)	the income year is:
	(A)	the year of income in which that Act commenced; or
	(B)	one of the 10 following years of income; and”.
	(3)	The second change is that paragraphs 80G(6)(d) and (e) and subsections 80G(7), (8), (10) and (14) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 are to be omitted.
	(4)	The third change is that paragraphs 80G(6)(f) and (g) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 are to be replaced by the following paragraphs:
	“(f)	if the loss year is the same year of income as the income year—the year of income immediately preceding the loss year; or
	(g)	if the income year is a year of income later than the loss year—the loss year.”.
25  Transfer of tax loss—modification of substantial continuity of ownership test
	(1)	This section applies if, under subsection 80G(6) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (as that subsection has effect because of this Division), a loss, or a part of a loss, is taken to have been incurred by the income company in a particular year of income (the normal year).
	(2)	For the purposes of the application of section 80A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to the income company, the loss, or the part of the loss, as the case may be, is to be treated as if it had been incurred in the income year instead of in the normal year.
	(3)	In this section:
income company has the same meaning as in section 80G of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (as that section has effect because of this Division).
income year has the same meaning as in section 80G of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (as that section has effect because of this Division).
26  Deduction for tax loss—modification of substantial continuity of ownership test etc. 
	(1)	If:
	(a)	this Act applies to one or more transfers by the transferring corporation to the receiving corporation; and
	(b)	the transferring corporation is taken (otherwise than because of section 80G of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936) to have incurred a loss in a year of income (the loss year) for the purposes of section 79E, 79F, 80, 80AAA or 80AA of that Act; and
	(c)	the loss year is the year of income in which this section commenced or an earlier year of income; and
	(d)	section 80A or 80DA, or both, of that Act prevent a deduction from being allowable under that Act to the transferring corporation for a year of income (the deduction year) in respect of that loss; and
	(e)	the transferring corporation did not, at any time in the deduction year, derive income from:
	(i)	a business of a kind that it did not carry on; or
	(ii)	a transaction of a kind that it had not entered into in the course of its business operations;
		before the transfer, or the earliest of the transfers, occurred;
sections 80A and 80DA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 do not prevent a deduction from being allowable to the transferring corporation in respect of that loss.
	(2)	This section does not apply to assessments for the 1997‑98 year of income and later years of income.
Subdivision B—Tax losses and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997
26A  Application of this Subdivision
		This Subdivision applies to assessments for the 1997‑98 income year or a later income year.
26B  Transfer of tax loss from transferring corporation to receiving corporation
		In addition to its effect apart from this section, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 also has the effect it would have if Subdivision 170‑A (which is about transferring tax losses within wholly‑owned company groups) of that Act were replaced by Subdivision 170‑A (which is a modified version of the rules in that Subdivision) in Schedule 1 to this Act.
26C  Deduction for tax loss—easing of restrictions on transferring corporation
		If:
	(a)	this Act applies to one or more transfers by the transferring corporation to the receiving corporation; and
	(b)	the transferring corporation is taken (otherwise than because of a transfer of a tax loss under section 80G of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 or Subdivision 170‑A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997) to have incurred a tax loss for a year of income (the loss year); and
	(c)	the loss year is the income year in which section 26 of this Act commenced or an earlier income year; and
	(d)	Subdivision 165‑A or 175‑A, or both, of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 prevent the transferring corporation from deducting an amount of that tax loss for an income year (the deduction year); and
	(e)	the transferring corporation did not, at any time in the deduction year, derive income from:
	(i)	a business of a kind that it did not carry on; or
	(ii)	a transaction of a kind that it had not entered into in the course of its business operations;
		before the transfer, or the earliest of the transfers, occurred;
neither Subdivision 165‑A nor 175‑A of that Act prevents the transferring corporation from deducting that amount.
Note:	Subdivision 165‑A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 is about the conditions that a company needs to satisfy before it can deduct a tax loss from an earlier income year.
	Subdivision 175‑A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 is about the Commissioner preventing a company from getting certain tax benefits through its unused tax losses.

Division 9—Continuity of partnerships
27  Transfer of an interest in a partnership does not affect continuity of partnership
	(1)	This section applies if an interest in a partnership is transferred.
	(2)	For the purposes of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, the transfer does not affect the continuity of the partnership.

170‑5  Basic principles for transferring tax losses
	(1)	A transferring corporation (within the meaning of the Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993) can transfer a tax loss to a receiving corporation (within the meaning of that Act) so that the receiving corporation can deduct it.
	(2)	The corporations must be related in such a way that that Act would apply to a transfer of assets from the transferring corporation to the receiving corporation.
	(3)	The receiving corporation need not have enough assessable income to offset the transferred tax loss.
	(4)	The tax loss is transferred by an agreement between the 2 corporations. 
Effect of transferring a tax loss
170‑10  When a corporation can transfer a tax loss
	(1)	A transferring corporation within the meaning of the Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993 (the loss company) can transfer an amount of its *tax loss for an income year of the loss company (the loss year) to a receiving corporation within the meaning of that Act (the income company) if the conditions in this Subdivision are met.
	(2)	The amount transferred can be the whole or part of the *tax loss.
Note:	A PDF cannot transfer a tax loss, except one for a period before it became a PDF: see section 195‑10.
	(3)	However, the *loss company cannot transfer so much of the *tax loss as the loss company has deducted, or can deduct, for an income year before the one in which the amount is transferred.
170‑15  Income company is taken to have incurred transferred loss
	(1)	If an amount of a *tax loss is transferred, the *amount is taken to be a tax loss incurred by the *income company in the *loss year.
	(2)	However, if the *loss year is the same as the income year of the *income company for which the amount is transferred (the transfer year), the *income company is taken to have incurred the *tax loss in the income year before the loss year.
Note:	This rule is needed because Division 36 allows a tax loss to be deducted only if it was incurred in an earlier income year.
170‑20  Who can deduct transferred loss
	(1)	If an amount of a *tax loss is transferred, the *income company can deduct the amount in accordance with section 36‑15 (which is about how to deduct a tax loss), but only if Subdivision 165‑A (as modified by section 170‑23) and Subdivision 175‑A do not prevent it from doing so.
Note:	Subdivision 165‑A is about the conditions that a company needs to satisfy before it can deduct a tax loss from an earlier income year.
	Subdivision 175‑A is about the Commissioner preventing a company from getting certain tax benefits through its unused tax losses.
	(2)	The *loss company can no longer deduct the transferred amount and is taken not to have incurred the *tax loss to the extent of that amount.
170‑23  When income company must maintain same owners and control
	(1)	Ordinarily, Subdivision 165‑A prevents a company from deducting for an income year (the deduction year) a tax loss if there has been a change in the ownership or control of the company between the loss year and the deduction year.
Note:	Subdivision 165‑A is about the conditions that a company needs to satisfy before it can deduct a tax loss from an earlier income year.
	(2)	However, subsection (3) modifies that Subdivision so that the *income company is prevented from deducting for the deduction year a transferred amount of a *tax loss only if there has been a change in ownership or control in the income company between the transfer year and the deduction year.
	(3)	That Subdivision applies to the transferred amount as if all references to “*loss year” in that Subdivision were references to “*transfer year”.
170‑25  Tax treatment of consideration for transferred tax loss
	(1)	If the loss company receives any consideration from the income company for the amount of the tax loss:
	(a)	that consideration is neither assessable income nor exempt income of the loss company; and
	(b)	the loss company does not make a capital gain because of the receipt of the consideration.
Note:	However, the consideration may affect how section 170‑210 modifies the cost base of direct and indirect interests in the loss company.
	(2)	If the income company gives any consideration to the loss company for the amount of the tax loss:
	(a)	the income company cannot deduct the amount or value of the consideration; and
	(b)	the income company does not make a capital loss because of the giving of the consideration.
Note:	However, the consideration may affect how section 170‑215 modifies the cost base of direct and indirect interests in the income company.
Conditions for transfer
170‑28  Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993 must apply to asset transfer from loss company to income company
		If it were assumed that:
	(a)	an asset (within the meaning of the Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993) had been transferred by the *loss company to the *income company on the last day of a particular income year of the *loss company (the notional transfer year); and 
	(b)	the requirements of paragraphs 7(6)(a) and (b) of that Act were satisfied in relation to that transfer;
then it must be the case that that Act would have applied to that transfer.

170‑32  The loss year
		The *loss year must be either:
	(a)	the income year in which the Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993 commenced; or
	(b)	an earlier income year.
170‑33  The transfer year
	(1)	The *transfer year must either:
	(a)	end at the end of the *notional transfer year; or
	(b)	correspond to the income year of the *loss company that next follows the *notional transfer year.
	(2)	Also, the *transfer year must be one of the 10 income years after the income year in which the Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993 commenced.
170‑35  The loss company
		If the *loss year and the *transfer year are the same, it must be the case that the *loss company was not required to calculate the *tax loss under section 165‑70 or 175‑35.
170‑50  Transfer by written agreement
	(1)	The transfer must be made by a written agreement between the *loss company and the *income company.
	(2)	The agreement must:
	(a)	specify the *transfer year (which may be earlier than the income year in which the agreement is made); and
	(b)	specify the amount of the *tax loss being transferred; and
	(c)	be signed by the public officer of each company; and
	(d)	be made on or before the day of lodgment of the *income company’s *income tax return for the *transfer year, or within such further time as the Commissioner allows.
Note:	The agreement will usually be made in the next income year after the one in which the tax loss is transferred.
170‑55  Losses must be transferred in order they are incurred
	(1)	If the *loss company has 2 or more *tax losses (other than *film losses) that it can transfer in the *transfer year, it can transfer them only in the order in which it incurred them.
	(2)	If the *loss company has 2 or more *film losses that it can transfer in the *transfer year, it can transfer them only in the order in which it incurred them.
170‑60  Income company cannot transfer transferred tax loss
		The *income company cannot transfer an amount of a *tax loss transferred to it, or any part of the amount.
Effect of agreement to transfer more than can be transferred
170‑65  Agreement transfers as much as can be transferred
	(1)	If the amount specified in an agreement exceeds the maximum amount that the *loss company can transfer to the *income company in the *transfer year, only that maximum amount is taken to have been transferred.
	(2)	One reason why an agreement might specify more than can be transferred is that an assessment has been amended since the agreement.
170‑70  Amendment of assessments
		The Commissioner may amend an assessment to disallow a deduction for a transferred amount of a *tax loss:
	(a)	if the agreement to transfer the tax loss is ineffective because the *loss company did not actually incur the loss; or
	(b)	to the extent that section 170‑65 reduces the transferred amount of a tax loss because the loss company did not actually incur some of it.
The Commissioner may do so despite section 170 (Amendment of assessments) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936.
Schedule 2—Net capital losses and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997
Effect of transferring a net capital loss
170‑110  When a corporation can transfer a net capital loss
	(1)	A transferring corporation within the meaning of the Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993 (the loss company) can transfer an amount of its *net capital loss for an income year of the loss company (the capital loss year) to a receiving corporation within the meaning of that Act (the gain company) if the conditions in this Subdivision are met.
	(2)	The amount transferred can be the whole or part of the *net capital loss.
Note:	A PDF cannot transfer a net capital loss, except one for a period before it became a PDF: see section 195‑30 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997.
	(3)	However, the *loss company cannot transfer so much of the *net capital loss as the loss company has applied, or can apply, in working out its *net capital gain or *net capital loss for an income year before the one in which the amount is transferred.
170‑115  Who can apply transferred loss
	(1)	If an amount of a *net capital loss is transferred, the gain company can apply the amount in working out its *net capital gain for the income year of the gain company for which the amount is transferred or for a later income year. The income year for which the gain company applies the amount is called the application year.
Note:	A company’s net capital gain or net capital loss for an income year is usually worked out under section 102‑5.
	(2)	The loss company can no longer apply the transferred amount and is taken not to have made the *net capital loss to the extent of that amount.
170‑120  Gain company is taken to have made transferred loss
	(1)	If an amount of a *net capital loss is transferred, the amount is taken to be a *net capital loss of the gain company for the capital loss year.
	(2)	However, if the capital loss year is the same as the application year, the amount is taken to be a *capital loss of the gain company for the application year.
170‑125  Tax treatment of consideration for transferred net capital loss
	(1)	If the loss company receives consideration from the gain company for the transferred amount:
	(a)	the consideration is neither assessable income nor exempt income of the loss company; and
	(b)	the loss company does not make a *capital gain because of receiving the consideration.
Note:	However, the consideration may affect how section 170‑220 modifies the cost base of direct and indirect interests in the loss company.
	(2)	If the gain company gives consideration to the loss company for the transferred amount:
	(a)	the gain company cannot deduct the consideration; and
	(b)	the gain company does not make a *capital loss because of giving the consideration.
Note:	However, the consideration may affect how section 170‑225 modifies the cost base of direct and indirect interests in the gain company.
Conditions for transfer
170‑128  Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993 must apply to asset transfer from loss company to gain company
		If it were assumed that:
	(a)	an asset (within the meaning of the Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993) had been transferred by the loss company to the gain company on the last day of a particular income year of the loss company (the notional transfer year); and 
	(b)	the requirements of paragraphs 7(6)(a) and (b) of that Act were satisfied in relation to that transfer;
then it must be the case that that Act would have applied to that transfer.
170‑132  The loss year
		The *loss year must be either:
	(a)	the income year in which the Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993 commenced; or
	(b)	an earlier income year.
170‑133  The transfer year
	(1)	The *transfer year must either:
	(a)	end at the end of the *notional transfer year; or
	(b)	correspond to the income year of the *loss company that next follows the *notional transfer year.
	(2)	Also, the *transfer year must be one of the 10 income years after the income year in which the Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993 commenced.
170‑135  The loss company
	(1)	It must be the case that the loss company was not required to calculate the *net capital loss:
	(a)	under section 165‑114 (because of a change in ownership or control); or 
	(b)	under section 175‑75 (because of an injected capital gain or loss).
	(2)	Also, it must be the case that neither Subdivision 165‑CA nor Subdivision 175‑CA would have prevented the loss company from applying the *net capital loss in working out its *net capital gain for the application year if it had made enough capital gains in that year.
Note 1:	Subdivision 165‑CA deals with the consequences of changing ownership or control of a company. Subdivision 175‑CA deals with using a company’s net capital losses to avoid income tax.
Note 2:	A company’s net capital gain or net capital loss for an income year is usually worked out under section 102‑5.
170‑140  The gain company
	(1)	If the capital loss year and the application year are not the same, the gain company must not be prevented by Subdivision 165‑CA or 175‑CA from applying the transferred amount in working out its *net capital gain for the application year. 
Note 1:	Subdivision 165‑CA deals with the consequences of changing ownership or control of a company. Subdivision 175‑CA deals with using a company’s net capital losses to avoid income tax.
Note 2:	A company’s net capital gain or net capital loss for an income year is usually worked out under section 102‑5.
	(2)	If the capital loss year and the application year are the same, it must be the case that the gain company was not required to calculate its own *net capital gain or *net capital loss for the application year:
	(a)	under Subdivision 165‑CB (because of a change in ownership or control); or 
	(b)	under section 175‑75 (because of an injected capital gain or loss).
Note:	In deciding whether paragraph (b) applies, remember that the transferred amount is taken to be a capital loss of the gain company for the application year (because of subsection 170‑120(2)).
170‑145  Maximum amount that can be transferred
Loss company can only transfer what it cannot use itself
	(1)	The amount transferred cannot exceed the amount of the loss company’s *net capital loss that, apart from the transfer, the loss company would carry forward to the next income year after the application year.
Note:	If the capital loss year and the application year are the same, the loss company would carry forward the whole of the net capital loss, because section 102‑5 does not allow a net capital loss to be applied in the income year in which it was made.
Example:	In the application year the loss company has:
a net capital loss from an earlier income year of $25,000; and
other capital losses totalling $10,000; and
capital gains totalling $20,000;
	Of the $25,000 loss, the loss company can transfer to the gain company no more than:
