## Part 3—Income tax relief for transfers

### Division 1—Preliminary

##### <a id="13"></a>13  Object of Part

                   The object of this Part is to provide income tax relief for transfers by modifying the effect of certain provisions of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ and the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

##### <a id="14"></a>14  Part to be treated as if it were a provision of the income tax law

             (1)  An expression used in this Part and in the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ has the same meaning in this Part as it has in that Act.

             (2)  For the purposes of the application of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ to a taxpayer, the provisions of this Part are to be treated as if they were provisions of that Act.

##### <a id="14A"></a>14A  Modified operation of this Part in relation to transfers from subsidiary members of consolidated groups etc.

Object

             (1)  The object of this section is to modify the operation of other provisions of this Part in relation to a transfer of an asset or liability from a subsidiary member of a consolidated group or MEC group to a receiving corporation so that, where appropriate:

                     (a)  relevant provisions affect the income tax position of the head company of the group in relation to the transfer; and

                     (b)  the effect of the relevant provisions on the income tax position of the receiving corporation is worked out by reference to income tax attributes of the head company, including ones it has because of the following provisions of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_:

                              (i)  section 701-1 (the **_single entity rule_**);

                             (ii)  section 701-5 (the **_entry history rule_**);

                            (iii)  section 701-10 (the **_head company tax cost setting rule_**).

Note 1:       The single entity rule has the effect that a subsidiary member of a consolidated group or MEC group is taken to be part of the head company.

Note 2:       The entry history rule treats things that happened in relation to an entity before it became a subsidiary member of a consolidated group or MEC group as having happened in relation to the head company.

Note 3:       The head company tax cost setting rule sets the amount taken to be the cost to the head company of assets that became assets of the head company because of the single entity rule when an entity became a subsidiary member of the consolidated group or MEC group.

Circumstances in which this section has effect

             (2)  This section modifies the way in which a provision of this Part (except this Division) operates in relation to a transfer of an asset or liability from a financial corporation that (ignoring the single entity rule) is a subsidiary member of a consolidated group or MEC group to the receiving corporation.

Modified operation of the provision

             (3)  If the head company of the group is not a financial corporation, the provision operates in relation to the head company in the way in which it would operate in relation to the transferring corporation apart from this subsection.

Note:          This ensures that, even though the head company is not the transferring corporation (because it is not a financial corporation), the provision operates as though it were. On this basis, the provision may affect the head company and/or the receiving corporation.

             (4)  So far as the provision affects the receiving corporation, it does so on the basis that the single entity rule, the entry history rule and the head company tax cost setting rule affect the head company of the group.

Note 1:       This subsection ensures that, where the effect of the provision on the receiving corporation depends on the transferring corporation, the results of those rules in relation to the head company are taken into account in determining the effect of the provision on the receiving corporation. Some examples of this are as follows:

(a)           the head company tax cost setting rule affects subsection 15(3) and section 18 by setting the head company’s cost base for assets an entity brought into the group when the entity became a subsidiary member of the group;

(b)           the entry history rule affects paragraph 16(3)(d) by treating the head company as having been paid, for assuming a liability that was brought into the group by an entity becoming a subsidiary member, the amount paid to the entity for assuming the liability;

(c)           the entry history rule affects subsections 17(1) and 22(4) and table item 1 in subsection 22(1) by treating the head company as having included in its assessable income amounts included in the assessable income of an entity that later became a subsidiary member of the group;

(d)           the entry history rule affects subsections 17(1) and (2) and 22(4) by treating deductions allowable to an entity before becoming a subsidiary member of the group as having been allowable to the head company.

Note 2:       This subsection also ensures that, if the head company is a financial corporation, the receiving corporation is affected by the provision operating in relation to the head company of the group as the transferring corporation (because the single entity rule operates to treat the subsidiary member of the group as part of the head company, so the transfer is treated as being from that company).

Provisions whose operation is not modified

             (5)  To avoid doubt, this section does not affect the operation of the following provisions:

                     (a)  section 20;

                     (b)  section 23;

                     (c)  Division 8.

### Division 2—General relief

##### <a id="15"></a>15  Asset transfers—general

Tax treatment of transferring corporation

             (1)  In determining:

                     (a)  whether an amount is included in the assessable income of the transferring corporation under section 25, 25A, 26BB, 26C or 159GS of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ or section 6-5, 15-15 or 775-15 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; or

                     (b)  whether an amount is allowable as a deduction to the transferring corporation under section 51, 52, 70B or 159GS of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ or section 8-1 or 775-30 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_;

in respect of a transfer of an asset, the transferring corporation is to be treated as if the transfer had not occurred.

Receiving corporation not entitled to a deduction for expenditure incurred in acquiring asset

             (2)  A deduction is not allowable to the receiving corporation under section 51 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ or section 8-1 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ in respect of expenditure incurred in the acquisition of an asset as the result of a transfer. However, this subsection does not apply to the acquisition of trading stock.

Receiving corporation to inherit transferring corporation’s cost base

             (3)  If an asset is transferred, then, in determining:

                     (a)  whether an amount is included in the assessable income of the receiving corporation under section 25, 25A, 26BB, 26C or Division 16E of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ or section 6-5, 15-15 or 775-15 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; or

                     (b)  whether an amount is allowable as a deduction to the receiving corporation under section 51, 52, 70B or Division 16E of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ or section 8-1 or 775-30 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_;

in respect of the holding, or any subsequent disposal, of the asset, the receiving corporation is to be treated as if it had acquired the asset for an amount equal to what would have been the asset’s cost base to the transferring corporation for the purposes of working out under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ whether the transferring corporation made a capital gain from the transfer.

in respect of the subsistence, or any subsequent transfer, of the liability, the receiving corporation is to be treated as if:

                     (c)  it had been paid or given consideration for the original transfer; and

                     (d)  the amount of the consideration were equal to the amount (if any) of the consideration paid or given to the transferring corporation in respect of the assumption by the transferring corporation of the liability.

##### <a id="20"></a>20  Transfer of net capital loss 

          (1A)  In addition to its effect apart from this section, the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ also has the effect it would have if sections 170-110 to 170-145 (which are about transferring net capital losses within wholly-owned company groups) of that Act were replaced by the provisions in Part 1 of Schedule 2 to this Act (which are a modified version of the rules in those sections) and the provisions in Part 2 of that Schedule were added at the end of Subdivision 170-B of that Act.

          (1B)  Subsection (1) does not enable a net capital loss to be transferred in the 1998-99 year of income or a later year of income.

             (1)  In addition to its effect apart from this section, section 160ZP of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ also has the effect it would have if both of the changes set out in subsections (2) and (3) of this section were made.

                             (ii)  the requirements of paragraphs 7(6)(a) and (b) of that Act were satisfied in relation to that transfer;

                            that Act would have applied to that transfer; and

                     (b)  the loss company incurred in respect of a year of income (the **_loss year_**) a net capital loss that, apart from this section, would be taken into account in ascertaining whether a net capital gain accrued to the loss company, or the loss company incurred a net capital loss, in respect of the next succeeding year of income; and

                    (ba)  the loss year is:

                              (i)  the year of income in which that Act commenced; or

                             (ii)  an earlier year of income; and

                    (bb)  both the following conditions are satisfied in relation to a year of income (the **_gain year_**) of the gain company:

                              (i)  either:

                             (ii)  the gain year is:

                                        (A)  the year of income in which that Act commenced; or

                                        (B)  one of the 10 following years of income; and”.

                     (a)  a transfer of trading stock occurred during a year of income of the transferring corporation; and

                     (b)  the trading stock was on hand at the beginning of that year of income;

then:

                     (c)  section 28 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ or section 70-35 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ has effect as if the trading stock were not on hand at the beginning of the year of income; and

                     (d)  section 51 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ or section 8-1 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ has effect as if:

Modification of tests for receiving corporation to deduct bad debt

             (2)  In relation to a transfer of a debt, Subdivisions 165-C, 166-C, 175-C, 709-D and 719-I of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ have effect as if the debt had been incurred at the time of the transfer.

Note:          Those Subdivisions are about companies deducting bad debts.

Easing of restrictions on transferring corporation

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  this Act applies to one or more transfers of assets by the transferring corporation to the receiving corporation; and

                     (b)  an entity incurs a debt to the transferring corporation in a year of income (the **_debt year_**); and

                     (c)  the debt year is the income year in which this section (as originally enacted) commenced or an earlier income year; and

                     (d)  any one or more of Subdivisions 165-C, 175-C, 709-D and 719-I of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ prevent the transferring corporation from deducting an amount for the debt for an income year (the **_deduction year_**); and

                     (e)  the transferring corporation did not, at any time in the deduction year, derive income from:

                              (i)  a business of a kind that it did not carry on; or

                             (ii)  a transaction of a kind that it had not entered into in the course of its business operations;

                            before the transfer, or the earliest of the transfers, occurred;

none of those Subdivisions prevents the transferring corporation from deducting that amount.

Note:          Subdivision 165-C of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ is about the conditions that a company needs to satisfy before it can deduct a bad debt.

                   Subdivision 175-C of that Act is about the Commissioner preventing a company from getting certain tax benefits through its unused bad debts.

                   Subdivision 709-D of that Act is about the conditions that must be met for an entity to deduct a bad debt that has for a period been owed to a member of a consolidated group and has for another period been owed to an entity that was not a member of that group for the period.

                   Subdivision 719-I of that Act is about the conditions that must be met for an entity to deduct a bad debt that has for a period been owed to a member of a MEC group.

Limit on deductions for partly written-off debt

             (4)  If this Act applies to the transfer of a debt that has been partly written off, the maximum that the receiving corporation can deduct for the debt for one or more years of income under section 8-1 or 25-35 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ is worked out using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2006C00002/Html/image002.gif)

where:

                    <a name="unrecouped-duction"></a>**_unrecouped deductions_** means the total of the amounts that the transferring corporation has deducted or can deduct for any year of income under:

                     (a)  section 8-1 or 25-35 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; or

                     (b)  section 51 or 63 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_;

reduced by the total of any amounts included in its assessable income in respect of the debt under:

                     (c)  Subdivision 20-A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; or

                     (d)  subsection 63(3) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

### Division 7—Interest withholding tax

##### <a id="23"></a>23  Exemption from interest withholding tax

             (1)  In addition to its effect apart from this section, section 128F of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ also has the effect it would have if the change set out in subsection (2) of this section were made.

             (2)  The change is that paragraphs (1)(a) and (b) of section 128F of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (being that section in the form that applies under item 16 of Schedule 5 to the _Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No. 2) 1997_) are to be replaced by the following paragraphs:

                    “(a)  the liability to pay the interest was transferred to the company by another company (the **_transferor_**);

                     (b)  the _Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993_ applies to the transfer;

                     (c)  before the transfer, this section applied to interest paid by the transferor in discharge of the liability;

                    (ca)  the transferor issued the debentures or debt interests;”.

### Division 8—Tax losses

#### Subdivision A—Tax losses and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936

##### <a id="24"></a>24  Transfer of tax loss from transferring corporation to receiving corporation

             (2)  The first change is that paragraphs 80G(6)(a), (b) and (ba) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ are to be replaced by the following paragraphs:

                             (ii)  the requirements of paragraphs 7(6)(a) and (b) of that Act were satisfied in relation to that transfer;

                            that Act would have applied to that transfer; and

                     (b)  the loss company is taken to have incurred a loss for the purposes of section 79E or 80 in a year of income (the **_loss year_**); and

                    (ba)  the loss year is:

                              (i)  the year of income in which that Act commenced; or

                             (ii)  an earlier year of income; and

                    (bb)  both the following conditions are satisfied in relation to a year of income (the **_income year_**) of the income company:

                              (i)  either:

                                        (A)  the income year ends at the end of the notional transfer year; or

                             (ii)  the income year is:

                                        (A)  the year of income in which that Act commenced; or

                                        (B)  one of the 10 following years of income; and”.

             (3)  The second change is that paragraphs 80G(6)(d) and (e) and subsections 80G(7), (8), (10) and (14) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ are to be omitted.

             (4)  The third change is that paragraphs 80G(6)(f) and (g) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ are to be replaced by the following paragraphs:

                    “(f)  if the loss year is the same year of income as the income year—the year of income immediately preceding the loss year; or

                     (g)  if the income year is a year of income later than the loss year—the loss year.”.

##### <a id="25"></a>25  Transfer of tax loss—modification of _substantial continuity of ownership_ test

             (1)  This section applies if, under subsection 80G(6) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_(as that subsection has effect because of this Division), a loss, or a part of a loss, is taken to have been incurred by the income company in a particular year of income (the **_normal year_**).

             (2)  For the purposes of the application of section 80A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ to the income company, the loss, or the part of the loss, as the case may be, is to be treated as if it had been incurred in the income year instead of in the normal year.

             (3)  In this section:

                    <a name="incom-compani"></a>**_income company_** has the same meaning as in section 80G of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_(as that section has effect because of this Division).

                     (c)  the loss year is the year of income in which this section commenced or an earlier year of income; and

                     (d)  section 80A or 80DA, or both, of that Act prevent a deduction from being allowable under that Act to the transferring corporation for a year of income (the **_deduction year_**) in respect of that loss; and

                     (e)  the transferring corporation did not, at any time in the deduction year, derive income from:

                              (i)  a business of a kind that it did not carry on; or

                            before the transfer, or the earliest of the transfers, occurred;

##### <a id="26B"></a>26B  Transfer of tax loss from transferring corporation to receiving corporation

                   In addition to its effect apart from this section, the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ also has the effect it would have if Subdivision 170-A (which is about transferring tax losses within wholly-owned company groups) of that Act were replaced by Subdivision 170-A (which is a modified version of the rules in that Subdivision) in Schedule 1 to this Act.

##### <a id="26C"></a>26C  Deduction for tax loss—easing of restrictions on transferring corporation

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  this Act applies to one or more transfers by the transferring corporation to the receiving corporation; and

                     (b)  the transferring corporation is taken (otherwise than because of a transfer of a tax loss under section 80G of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ or Subdivision 170-A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_) to have incurred a tax loss for a year of income (the **_loss year_**); and

                     (c)  the loss year is the income year in which section 26 of this Act commenced or an earlier income year; and

                     (d)  Subdivision 165-A or 175-A, or both, of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ prevent the transferring corporation from deducting an amount of that tax loss for an income year (the **_deduction year_**); and

                     (e)  the transferring corporation did not, at any time in the deduction year, derive income from:

                              (i)  a business of a kind that it did not carry on; or

                             (ii)  a transaction of a kind that it had not entered into in the course of its business operations;

                            before the transfer, or the earliest of the transfers, occurred;

neither Subdivision 165-A nor 175-A of that Act prevents the transferring corporation from deducting that amount.

Note:          Subdivision 165-A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ is about the conditions that a company needs to satisfy before it can deduct a tax loss from an earlier income year.

                   Subdivision 175-A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ is about the Commissioner preventing a company from getting certain tax benefits through its unused tax losses.

             (2)  Subsection (1) operates on the basis described in subsection (3) if:

                     (a)  the head company of a consolidated group or MEC group incurred a tax loss because of Subdivision 707-A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

                     (b)  the company (the **_real loss-maker_**) that incurred the tax loss apart from that Subdivision is a member of the group in the deduction year; and

                     (c)  disregarding section 701-1 (the single entity rule) of that Act, this Act applies to one or more transfers by the real loss-maker to the receiving corporation.

Note:          In certain cases, Subdivision 707-A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ treats the head company of a consolidated group or MEC as incurring a tax loss actually incurred by an entity that becomes a member of the group.

             (3)  Subsection (1) operates as if:

                     (a)  the head company were the transferring corporation in relation to each transfer described in paragraph (1)(a) and this Act applied to each of those transfers; and

                     (b)  the head company incurred the tax loss for the income year for which the real loss-maker incurred it (apart from Subdivision 707-A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_); and

                     (c)  each reference in that subsection to Subdivision 165-A of that Act were a reference to that Subdivision as its operation is affected by Subdivision 707-B of that Act, and by Subdivision 719-F of that Act (if relevant).

Note 1:       Subdivision 707-B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ affects the operation of Subdivision 165-A of that Act in relation to the deduction of a tax loss incurred by the head company of a consolidated group or MEC group because of Subdivision 707-A of that Act.

Note 2:       Subdivision 719-F of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ affects the operation of Subdivision 165-A of that Act in relation to the deduction of a tax loss incurred by the head company of a MEC group because of Subdivision 707-A of that Act.

             (4)  An expression used in this section and in the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ has the same meaning in this section as it has in that Act. This subsection does not apply to the expressions **_deduction year_**, **_loss year_**, **_this Act_** and **_transfer_**.

### Division 9—Continuity of partnerships

##### <a id="27"></a>27  Transfer of an interest in a partnership does not affect continuity of partnership

             (1)  This section applies if an interest in a partnership is transferred.

             (2)  For the purposes of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, the transfer does not affect the continuity of the partnership.

* * *

A transferring corporation (within the meaning of the _Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993_) can transfer a tax loss to a receiving corporation (within the meaning of that Act) so that the receiving corporation can deduct it. The corporations must be related in such a way that that Act would apply to a transfer of assets from the transferring corporation to the receiving corporation.

##### <a id="170-5"></a>170-5  Basic principles for transferring tax losses

             (1)  A transferring corporation (within the meaning of the _Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993_) can transfer a tax loss to a receiving corporation (within the meaning of that Act) so that the receiving corporation can deduct it.

             (2)  The corporations must be related in such a way that that Act would apply to a transfer of assets from the transferring corporation to the receiving corporation.

             (3)  The receiving corporation need not have enough assessable income to offset the transferred tax loss.

             (4)  The tax loss is transferred by an agreement between the 2 corporations. 

             (5)  Special rules extend the scope of this Subdivision to let the head company of a consolidated group or MEC group transfer in some cases a tax loss the company incurred because of Subdivision 707-A. The rules do this by modifying the basis on which other provisions of this Subdivision operate.

#### Effect of transferring a tax loss

##### <a id="170-10"></a>170-10  When a corporation can transfer a tax loss

               (1)  A transferring corporation within the meaning of the _Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993_ (the **_loss company_**) can transfer an amount of its * tax loss for an income year of the loss company (the **_loss year_**) to a receiving corporation within the meaning of that Act (the **_income company_**) if the conditions in this Subdivision are met.

             (2)  The amount transferred can be the whole or part of the * tax loss.

Note:          A PDF cannot transfer a tax loss, except one for a period before it became a PDF: see section 195-10.

             (3)  However, the * loss company cannot transfer so much of the * tax loss as the loss company has deducted, or can deduct, for an income year before the one in which the amount is transferred.

##### <a id="170-15"></a>170-15  Income company is taken to have incurred transferred loss

             (1)  If an amount of a * tax loss is transferred, the * amount is taken to be a tax loss incurred by the * income company in the * loss year.

             (2)  However, if the * loss year is the same as the income year of the * income company for which the amount is transferred (the **_transfer year_**), the * income company is taken to have incurred the * tax loss in the income year before the loss year.

Note:          This rule is needed because Division 36 allows a tax loss to be deducted only if it was incurred in an _earlier_ income year.

##### <a id="170-20"></a>170-20  Who can deduct transferred loss

             (1)  If an amount of a * tax loss is transferred, the * income company can deduct the amount in accordance with section 36-15 (which is about how to deduct a tax loss), but only if Subdivision 165-A (as modified by section 170-23) and Subdivision 175-A do not prevent it from doing so.

Note:          Subdivision 165-A is about the conditions that a company needs to satisfy before it can deduct a tax loss from an earlier income year.

                   Subdivision 175-A is about the Commissioner preventing a company from getting certain tax benefits through its unused tax losses.

             (2)  The * loss company can no longer deduct the transferred amount and is taken not to have incurred the * tax loss to the extent of that amount.

##### <a id="170-23"></a>170-23  When income company must maintain same owners and control

             (1)  Ordinarily, Subdivision 165-A prevents a company from deducting for an income year (the **_deduction year_**) a tax loss if there has been a change in the ownership or control of the company between the _loss year_ and the deduction year.

Note:          Subdivision 165-A is about the conditions that a company needs to satisfy before it can deduct a tax loss from an earlier income year.

             (2)  However, subsection (3) modifies that Subdivision so that the * income company is prevented from deducting for the deduction year a transferred amount of a * tax loss only if there has been a change in ownership or control in the income company between the _transfer year_ and the deduction year.

             (3)  That Subdivision applies to the transferred amount as if all references to “* loss year” in that Subdivision were references to “* transfer year”.

##### <a id="170-25"></a>170-25  Tax treatment of consideration for transferred tax loss

             (1)  If the loss company receives any consideration from the income company for the amount of the tax loss:

                     (a)  that consideration is neither assessable income nor exempt income of the loss company; and

                     (b)  the loss company does not make a capital gain because of the receipt of the consideration.

Note:          However, the consideration may affect how section 170-210 modifies the cost base of direct and indirect interests in the loss company.

             (2)  If the income company gives any consideration to the loss company for the amount of the tax loss:

                     (a)  the income company cannot deduct the amount or value of the consideration; and

                     (b)  the income company does not make a capital loss because of the giving of the consideration.

Note:          However, the consideration may affect how section 170-215 modifies the cost base of direct and indirect interests in the income company.

#### Conditions for transfer

##### <a id="170-28"></a>170-28  _Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993_ must apply to asset transfer from loss company to income company

                   If it were assumed that:

                     (a)  an asset (within the meaning of the _Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993_) had been transferred by the * loss company to the * income company on the last day of a particular income year of the * loss company (the **_notional transfer year_**); and 

                     (b)  the requirements of paragraphs 7(6)(a) and (b) of that Act were satisfied in relation to that transfer;

then it must be the case that that Act would have applied to that transfer.

##### <a id="170-32"></a>170-32  The loss year

                   The * loss year must be either:

                     (a)  the income year in which the _Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993_ commenced; or

                     (b)  an earlier income year.

##### <a id="170-33"></a>170-33  The transfer year

             (1)  The * transfer year must either:

                     (a)  end at the end of the * notional transfer year; or

                     (b)  correspond to the income year of the * loss company that next follows the * notional transfer year.

             (2)  Also, the * transfer year must be one of the 10 income years after the income year in which the _Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993_ commenced.

##### <a id="170-35"></a>170-35  The loss company

                   If the * loss year and the * transfer year are the same, it must be the case that the * loss company was _not_ required to calculate the * tax loss under section 165-70 or 175-35.

##### <a id="170-50"></a>170-50  Transfer by written agreement

(1)The transfer must be made by a written agreementbetween the * loss company and the * income company.

             (2)The agreement must:

                     (a)  specify the * transfer year (which may be earlier than the income year in which the agreement is made); and

                     (b)  specify the amount of the * tax loss being transferred; and

                     (c)  be signed by the public officer of each company; and

                     (d)  be made on or before the day of lodgment of the * income company’s * income tax return for the * transfer year, or within such further time as the Commissioner allows.

Note:          The agreement will usually be made in the next income year _after_ the one in which the tax loss is transferred.

##### <a id="170-55"></a>170-55  Losses must be transferred in order they are incurred

             (1)  If the * loss company has 2 or more * tax losses (other than * film losses) that it can transfer in the * transfer year, it can transfer them only in the order in which it incurred them.

             (2)  If the * loss company has 2 or more * film losses that it can transfer in the * transfer year, it can transfer them only in the order in which it incurred them.

##### <a id="170-60"></a>170-60  Income company cannot transfer transferred tax loss

                   The * income company cannot transfer an amount of a * tax loss transferred to it, or any part of the amount.

#### Effect of agreement to transfer more than can be transferred

##### <a id="170-65"></a>170-65  Agreement transfers as much as can be transferred

             (1)  If the amount specified in an agreement exceeds the maximum amount that the * loss company can transfer to the * income company in the * transfer year, only that maximum amount is taken to have been transferred.

             (2)  One reason why an agreement might specify more than can be transferred is that an assessment has been amended since the agreement.

##### <a id="170-70"></a>170-70  Amendment of assessments

                   The Commissioner may amend an assessment to disallow a deduction for a transferred amount of a * tax loss:

                     (a)  if the agreement to transfer the tax loss is ineffective because the * loss company did not actually incur the loss; or

                     (b)  to the extent that section 170-65 reduces the transferred amount of a tax loss because the loss company did not actually incur some of it.

The Commissioner may do so despite section 170 (Amendment of assessments) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

#### Special rules for transfer from head company of consolidated group or MEC group

##### <a id="170-75"></a>170-75  Transfer of a tax loss incurred by the head company because of Subdivision 707-A

             (1)  The other sections of this Subdivision operate in relation to the actual or proposed transfer of a * tax loss on the basis described in this section if:

                     (a)  the * head company of a * consolidated group or * MEC group incurred the tax loss because of Subdivision 707-A; and

                     (b)  the company (the **_real loss-maker_**) that incurred the tax loss apart from Subdivision 707-A is a * member of the group at the end of the income year for which it is proposed to transfer the loss under this Subdivision.

             (2)  The other sections of this Subdivision, except section 170-28, operate as if:

                     (a)  the * head company were a transferring corporation within the meaning of the _Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993_; and

                     (b)  the head company had incurred the * tax loss for the income year for which the real loss-maker incurred the tax loss (apart from Subdivision 707-A).

Note:          This has the effect that (because of subsection 170-10(1)) those sections operate as if the head company were the loss company and the loss year were the income year for which the real loss-maker incurred the loss.

             (3)  Section 170-28 operates as if:

                     (a)  the real loss-maker were the * loss company; and

                     (b)  section 701-1 (the single entity rule) could not affect whether the _Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993_ would have applied to the transfer described in section 170-28.

# Schedule 2—Net capital losses and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997

## Part 1—Replacement of sections 170-110 to 170-145

#### <span style="font-size:8.0pt"> </span><span style="font-size:8.0pt"> </span>

#### Effect of transferring a net capital loss

##### <a id="170-110"></a>170-110  When a corporation can transfer a net capital loss

             (1)  A transferring corporation within the meaning of the _Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993_ (the _loss company_) can transfer an amount of its * net capital loss for an income year of the loss company (the **_capital loss year_**) to a receiving corporation within the meaning of that Act (the **_gain company_**) if the conditions in this Subdivision are met.

             (2)  The amount transferred can be the whole or part of the * net capital loss.

Note:          A PDF cannot transfer a net capital loss, except one for a period before it became a PDF: see section 195-30 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

             (3)  However, the * loss company cannot transfer so much of the * net capital loss as the loss company has applied, or can apply, in working out its * net capital gain or * net capital loss for an income year before the one in which the amount is transferred.

##### <a id="170-115"></a>170-115  Who can apply transferred loss

             (1)  If an amount of a * net capital loss is transferred, the gain company can apply the amount in working out its * net capital gain for the income year of the gain company for which the amount is transferred or for a later income year. The income year for which the gain company applies the amount is called the **_application year_**.

Note:          A company’s net capital gain or net capital loss for an income year is usually worked out under section 102-5.

             (2)  The loss company can no longer apply the transferred amount and is taken not to have made the * net capital loss to the extent of that amount.

##### <a id="170-120"></a>170-120  Gain company is taken to have made transferred loss

             (1)  If an amount of a * net capital loss is transferred, the amount is taken to be a * net capital loss of the gain company for the capital loss year.

             (2)  However, if the capital loss year is the same as the application year, the amount is taken to be a * capital loss of the gain company for the application year.

##### <a id="170-125"></a>170-125  Tax treatment of consideration for transferred net capital loss

             (1)  If the loss company receives consideration from the gain company for the transferred amount:

                     (a)  the consideration is neither assessable income nor exempt income of the loss company; and

                     (b)  the loss company does not make a * capital gain because of receiving the consideration.

Note:          However, the consideration may affect how section 170-220 modifies the cost base of direct and indirect interests in the loss company.

             (2)  If the gain company gives consideration to the loss company for the transferred amount:

                     (a)  the gain company cannot deduct the consideration; and

                     (b)  the gain company does not make a * capital loss because of giving the consideration.

Note:          However, the consideration may affect how section 170-225 modifies the cost base of direct and indirect interests in the gain company.

#### Conditions for transfer

##### <a id="170-128"></a>170-128 _Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993_ must apply to asset transfer from loss company to gain company

                   If it were assumed that:

                     (a)  an asset (within the meaning of the _Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993_) had been transferred by the loss company to the gain company on the last day of a particular income year of the loss company (the **_notional transfer year)_**; and 

                     (b)  the requirements of paragraphs 7(6)(a) and (b) of that Act were satisfied in relation to that transfer;

then it must be the case that that Act would have applied to that transfer.

##### <a id="170-132"></a>170-132  The loss year

                   The * loss year must be either:

                     (a)  the income year in which the _Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993_ commenced; or

                     (b)  an earlier income year.

##### <a id="170-133"></a>170-133  The transfer year

             (1)  The * transfer year must either:

                     (a)  end at the end of the * notional transfer year; or

                     (b)  correspond to the income year of the * loss company that next follows the * notional transfer year.

             (2)  Also, the * transfer year must be one of the 10 income years after the income year in which the _Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993_ commenced.

##### <a id="170-135"></a>170-135  The loss company

             (1)  It must be the case that the loss company was _not_ required to calculate the * net capital loss:

                     (a)  under section 165-114 (because of a change in ownership or control); or 

                     (b)  under section 175-75 (because of an injected capital gain or loss).

             (2)  Also, it must be the case that neither Subdivision 165-CA nor Subdivision 175-CA would have prevented the loss company from applying the * net capital loss in working out its * net capital gain for the application year if it had made enough capital gains in that year.

Note 1:       Subdivision 165-CA deals with the consequences of changing ownership or control of a company. Subdivision 175-CA deals with using a company’s net capital losses to avoid income tax.

Note 2:       A company’s net capital gain or net capital loss for an income year is usually worked out under section 102-5.

##### <a id="170-140"></a>170-140  The gain company

             (1)  If the capital loss year and the application year are _not_ the same, the gain company must not be prevented by Subdivision 165-CA or 175-CA from applying the transferred amount in working out its * net capital gain for the application year. 

Note 1:       Subdivision 165-CA deals with the consequences of changing ownership or control of a company. Subdivision 175-CA deals with using a company’s net capital losses to avoid income tax.

Note 2:       A company’s net capital gain or net capital loss for an income year is usually worked out under section 102-5.

             (2)  If the capital loss year and the application year _are_ the same, it must be the case that the gain company was _not_ required to calculate its own * net capital gain or * net capital loss for the application year:

                     (a)  under Subdivision 165-CB (because of a change in ownership or control); or 

                     (b)  under section 175-75 (because of an injected capital gain or loss).

Note:          In deciding whether paragraph (b) applies, remember that the transferred amount is taken to be a capital loss of the gain company for the application year (because of subsection 170-120(2)).

##### <a id="170-145"></a>170-145  Maximum amount that can be transferred

Loss company can only transfer what it cannot use itself

             (1)  The amount transferred cannot exceed the amount of the loss company’s * net capital loss that, apart from the transfer, the loss company would carry forward to the next income year after the application year.

Note:          If the capital loss year and the application year are the same, the loss company would carry forward the whole of the net capital loss, because section 102-5 does not allow a net capital loss to be applied in the income year in which it was made.

Example:    In the application year the loss company has:

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">    </span>a net capital loss from an earlier income year of $25,000; and

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">    </span>other capital losses totalling $10,000; and

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">    </span>capital gains totalling $20,000;

                   Of the $25,000 loss, the loss company can transfer to the gain company no more than:

## Part 2—Addition of provisions at the end of Subdivision 170-B

#### Special rules for transfer from head company of consolidated group or MEC group

##### <a id="170-175"></a>170-175  Transfer of a net capital loss made by the head company because of Subdivision 707-A

             (1)  The other sections of this Subdivision operate in relation to the actual or proposed transfer of a * net capital loss on the basis described in this section if:

                     (a)  the * head company of a * consolidated group or * MEC group made the net capital loss because of Subdivision 707-A; and

                     (b)  the company (the **_real loss-maker_**) that made the net capital loss apart from Subdivision 707-A is a * member of the group at the end of the income year for which it is proposed to transfer the loss under this Subdivision.

             (2)  The other sections of this Subdivision, except section 170-128, operate as if:

                     (a)  the * head company were a transferring corporation within the meaning of the _Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993_; and

                     (b)  the head company had made the * net capital loss for the income year for which the real loss-maker made the net capital loss (apart from Subdivision 707-A).

Note:          This has the effect that (because of subsection 170-110(1)) those sections operate as if the head company were the loss company and the capital loss year were the income year for which the real loss-maker made the loss.

             (3)  Section 170-128 operates as if:

                     (a)  the real loss-maker were the * loss company; and

                     (b)  section 701-1 (the single entity rule) could not affect whether the _Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993_ would have applied to the transfer described in section 170-28.

             (4)  Subsection 170-135(2) operates as if the reference in it to Subdivision 165-CA were a reference to that Subdivision as it operates given the effect of Subdivision 707-B, and Subdivision 719-F if relevant, on the operation of Subdivision 165-A.

Note:          Subdivision 165-CA determines whether a net capital loss can be applied by reference to whether Subdivision 165-A would permit the deduction of a tax loss for the same income year as the net capital loss. Subdivisions 707-B and 719-F affect the operation of Subdivision 165-A in relation to losses made by a company because of Subdivision 707-A.

## 3  No retrospective criminal liability

Nothing in this Part or the Validation Acts is taken to make a person criminally liable in respect of acts or omissions of the person before the day on which this Part commences, if the person would not have been so liable had this Part and the Validation Acts not been enacted.
