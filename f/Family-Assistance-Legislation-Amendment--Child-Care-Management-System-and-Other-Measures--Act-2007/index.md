Repeal the section, substitute:

##### <a id="48"></a>48  Overview of process if individual is conditionally eligible for child care benefit by fee reduction

             (1)  An approved child care service is obliged to notify the Secretary if an individual enrols a child for care by the service.

             (2)  Once that enrolment is confirmed by the Secretary, the service is obliged to give weekly reports to the Secretary about the care provided to the child.

             (3)  If a report is given, and a determination of conditional eligibility under section 50F is in force in respect of an individual and a child with the effect that the individual is conditionally eligible for child care benefit by fee reduction for care provided by the approved child care service to the child in a week, the Secretary will calculate the amount by which the fees charged by the service for the care are to be reduced.

             (4)  The amount by which the fees are to be reduced is referable to the amount of child care benefit that would be paid in respect of the sessions if entitlement to an amount of child care benefit was determined under section 51B in respect of the income year in which the week falls. The amount of fee reduction is calculated by the Secretary using the provisions of the Family Assistance Act.

             (5)  The service must pass on to the individual the amount of the fee reduction calculated by the Secretary. If the service has already reduced the amount of fees charged to the individual for care provided to the child in anticipation of the calculation by the Secretary, the service is taken to have passed on a fee reduction equal to the amount by which the fees have already been reduced.

             (6)  When the determination of entitlement is made, if the amount of the entitlement is greater than the amount of the fee reductions already received by the individual in respect of the sessions in the income year, the amount of the entitlement consists of the amount of the difference together with the amount of fee reductions received by the individual.

             (7)  When the determination of entitlement is made, if the amount of the entitlement is less than the amount of the fee reductions already received by the individual in respect of the sessions in the income year, the amount of the entitlement is the amount of the fee reductions less the amount of the difference.

             (8)  Payments in respect of fee reduction are made to the service by the Secretary to enable the service to pass on to the individual the amount of fee reductions as calculated (see Division 2 of Part 8A).

## 12  Subsection 50L(8)

Omit “, and the approved child care service providing care to the child who was the subject of the claim,”.

## 13  At the end of section 50L

Add:

           (10)  The Secretary may make notice of the cessation of the determination under subsection (7) available to the approved child care service providing care to the child who was the subject of the claim, including by making notice available to the service using an electronic interface.

## 14  Subsection 50M(1)

Omit all the words after “to the claimant”.

## 15  At the end of section 50M

Add:

             (4)  The Secretary may make notice of the determinations made in respect of the claimant under sections 50F, 50H, 50J and 50K available to the approved child care service, or services, that are, or will be, providing care to the child, including by making the notice available to the service using an electronic interface.

## 16  Subsection 50V(1)

Repeal the subsection, substitute:

             (1)  The Secretary must give notice of a determination under subsection 50T(1) that the claimant is eligible for the special grandparent rate for a child to the claimant.

## 17  At the end of section 50V

Add:

             (4)  The Secretary may make notice of a determination under subsection 50T(1) available to the approved child care service, or services, that are, or will be, providing care to the child, including by making the notice available to the service using an electronic interface.

             (2)  Subject to subsection (3), the Secretary must notify the approved child care service of the recalculated rate and amount.

             (3)  The Secretary need not notify the approved child care service of the recalculated rate and amount if the rate or amount is reduced, and the recalculation is for a reason other than the substitution or withdrawal by the service of a report given under section 219N.
