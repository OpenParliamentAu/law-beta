### Division 1A—Search warrants

##### <a id="43C"></a>43C  When search warrants can be issued

             (1)  A magistrate may, upon application by an officer, issue a warrant to search premises if the magistrate is satisfied by information on oath or affirmation that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that there is, or there will be within the next 72 hours, any evidential material at the premises.

             (2)  If a magistrate issues a warrant, the magistrate is to set out in the warrant:

                     (a)  the offence to which the warrant relates; and

                     (b)  a description of the premises to which the warrant relates; and

                     (c)  the kinds of evidential material that are to be searched for under the warrant; and

                     (e)  the period for which the warrant remains in force, which must not be more than 7 days; and

                      (f)  whether the warrant may be executed at any time or only during particular hours.

             (3)  The magistrate is also to state that the warrant authorises the seizure of a thing (other than evidential material of the kind referred to in paragraph (2)(c)) found at the premises in the course of the search that the executing officer or a person helping believes on reasonable grounds to be:

                     (a)  evidential material in relation to an offence to which the warrant relates; or

                     (b)  a thing relevant to another offence against this Act or the regulations that is an indictable offence;

if the executing officer or a person helping believes on reasonable grounds that seizure of the thing is necessary to prevent its concealment, loss or destruction or its use in committing an offence against this Act or the regulations.

             (4)  Paragraph (2)(e) does not prevent the issue of successive warrants in relation to the same premises.

             (5)  If the application for the warrant is made under section 43P, this section applies as if:

                     (a)  subsection (1) referred to 48 hours rather than 72 hours; and

                     (a)  to enter the warrant premises and, if the premises are a vehicle or an aircraft, to enter the vehicle or aircraft, wherever it is; and

                     (b)  to search for and record fingerprints found at the premises and to take samples of things found at the premises for forensic purposes; and

                     (c)  to search the premises for the kinds of evidential material specified in the warrant, and to seize things of that kind found at the premises; and

                     (d)  to seize other things found at the premises in the course of the search that the executing officer or a person helping believes on reasonable grounds to be:

                              (i)  evidential material in relation to an offence to which the warrant relates; or

                             (ii)  evidential material in relation to another offence against this Act or the regulations that is an indictable offence;

if the executing officer or a person helping believes on reasonable grounds that seizure of the things is necessary to prevent their concealment, loss or destruction or their use in committing an offence against this Act or the regulations.

             (2)  If the warrant states that it may be executed only during particular hours, the warrant must not be executed outside those hours.

             (3)  If things are seized under a warrant, the warrant authorises the executing officer to make the things available to officers of other agencies if it is necessary to do so for the purpose of investigating or prosecuting an offence to which the things relate.

as is necessary and reasonable in the circumstances.

##### <a id="43F"></a>43F  Copy of warrant to be given to occupier etc.

             (1)  If a warrant is being executed and the occupier of the premises or another person who apparently represents the occupier is present at the premises, the executing officer or a person helping must make available to that person a copy of the warrant.

             (1)  In executing a warrant, the executing officer or a person helping may:

                     (a)  for a purpose incidental to the execution of the warrant; or

                     (b)  if the occupier of the premises consents in writing;

take photographs (including video recordings) of the premises or of things at the premises.

             (2)  If a warrant is being executed, the executing officer or a person helping may, if the warrant is still in force, complete the execution of the warrant after the officer and all persons helping temporarily cease its execution and leave the premises:

##### <a id="43H"></a>43H  Use of equipment to examine or process things

             (1)  The executing officer or a person helping may bring to the warrant premises any equipment reasonably necessary for the examination or processing of things found at the premises in order to determine whether they are things that may be seized under the warrant.

                     (b)  the occupier of the premises consents in writing;

the things may be moved to another place so that the examination or processing can be carried out in order to determine whether they are things that may be seized under the warrant.

                     (a)  inform the occupier of the address of the place, and the time, at which the examination or processing will be carried out; and

                     (b)  allow the occupier or his or her representative to be present during the examination or processing.

             (4)  The executing officer or a person helping may operate equipment already at the warrant premises to carry out the examination or processing of a thing found at the premises in order to determine whether it is a thing that may be seized under the warrant if the executing officer or person believes on reasonable grounds that:

                     (a)  the equipment is suitable for the examination or processing; and

                     (b)  the examination or processing can be carried out without damage to the equipment or the thing.

##### <a id="43J"></a>43J  Use of electronic equipment at premises

             (1)  The executing officer or a person helping may operate electronic equipment at the premises to see whether evidential material is accessible by doing so if he or she believes on reasonable grounds that the operation of the equipment can be carried out without damage to the equipment.

             (2)  If the executing officer or a person helping, after operating the equipment, finds that evidential material is accessible by doing so, he or she may:

                     (a)  seize the equipment and any disk, tape or other associated device; or

                     (b)  if the material can, by using facilities at the premises, be put in documentary form—operate the facilities to put the material in that form and seize the documentation so produced; or

                     (c)  if the material can be transferred to a disk, tape or other storage device that:

                              (i)  is brought to the premises; or

                             (ii)  is at the premises and the use of which for the purpose has been agreed to in writing by the occupier of the premises;

operate the equipment or other facilities to copy the material to the storage device and take the storage device from the premises.

             (3)  A person may seize equipment under paragraph (2)(a) only if:

                     (a)  it is not practicable to put the material in documentary form as mentioned in paragraph (2)(b) or to copy the material as mentioned in paragraph (2)(c); or

                     (b)  possession by the occupier of the equipment could constitute an offence against this Act or the regulations.

             (6)  The equipment may be secured until:

                     (a)  the end of a period of not more than 24 hours; or

                     (b)  the equipment has been operated by the expert;

whichever happens first.

             (7)  If the executing officer or a person helping believes on reasonable grounds that the expert assistance will not be available within 24 hours, he or she may apply to the magistrate for an extension of that period.

             (8)  The executing officer or a person helping must give notice to the occupier of the premises of his or her intention to apply for an extension, and the occupier is entitled to be heard in relation to the application.

             (3)  However, if the owner or user and the Commonwealth fail to agree, the owner or user may institute proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia for such reasonable amount of compensation as the Court determines.

             (4)  In determining the amount of compensation payable, regard is to be had to whether the occupier of the premises, or the occupier’s employees or agents, if they were available at the time, provided any appropriate warning or guidance on the operation of the equipment.

             (5)  Compensation is payable out of money appropriated by the Parliament.

             (6)  For the purposes of subsection (1):

                     (a)  in an urgent case; or

             (2)  The magistrate may require communication by voice to the extent that is practicable in the circumstances.

             (3)  An application under this section must include all information required to be provided in an ordinary application for a warrant, but the application may, if necessary, be made before the information is sworn.

             (4)  If an application is made to a magistrate under this section and the magistrate, after considering the information and having received and considered such further information (if any) as the magistrate required, is satisfied that:

                     (a)  a warrant in the terms of the application should be issued urgently; or

                     (b)  the delay that would occur if an application were made in person would frustrate the effective execution of the warrant;

the magistrate may complete and sign the same form of warrant as would be issued under section 43C.

             (5)  If the magistrate decides to issue the warrant, the magistrate is to tell the applicant, by telephone, telex, fax or other electronic means, of the terms of the warrant and the day on which and the time at which it was signed.

             (6)  The applicant must then complete a form of warrant in terms substantially corresponding to those given to the magistrate, stating on the form the magistrate’s name and the day on which and the time at which the warrant was signed.

             (7)  The applicant must, not later than the day after the day of expiry of the warrant or the day after the day on which the warrant was executed, whichever is the earlier, give or send to the magistrate the form of warrant completed by the applicant and, if the information referred to in subsection (3) was not sworn, that information duly sworn.

             (8)  The magistrate is to attach to the documents provided under subsection (7) the form of warrant completed by the magistrate.

             (9)  If:

                     (b)  the form of warrant signed by the magistrate is not produced in evidence;

the court is to assume, unless the contrary is proved, that the exercise of the power was not duly authorised.
