Indexed rate substituted for the previous rate

             (2)  If a rate is to be indexed under this section on an indexation day, this Act has effect as if the indexed rate were substituted for that rate on that day.

How to work out the indexed rate

             (3)  This is how to work out the indexed rate for a rate that is to be indexed under this section on an indexation day:

<div style="BORDER-RIGHT: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-RIGHT: 5pt; BORDER-TOP: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-LEFT: 5pt; PADDING-BOTTOM: 5pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 2cm; BORDER-LEFT: windowtext 1pt solid; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0cm; PADDING-TOP: 5pt; BORDER-BOTTOM: windowtext 1pt solid">

_Method statement_

_Step 1._ Use subsections (4), (5) and (6) to work out the indexation factor for the rate on the indexation day.

_Step 2._ Work out the current figure for the rate immediately before the indexation day.

_Step 3._ Multiply the current figure by the indexation factor: the result is the **_provisional indexed rate_**.

_Step 4._ Use subsections (7), (8) and (9) to round off the provisional indexed rate: the result is the **_indexed rate_**.</div>

Note:          For **_current figure_** see subsection (12).

Indexation factor

             (4)  Subject to subsections (5) and (6), the indexation factor for a rate that is to be indexed under this section on an indexation day is:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2006C00614/Html/A8AE0A4852354CA4CA25720600238A74/$FILE/FamComSerVetAffLegAm04EleCom2004_WD02_image002.gif)

worked out to 3 decimal places.

Note 1:       For **_index number_** see subsection (12).

Note 2:       For **_reference quarter_** and **_base quarter_** see the table in subsection (1).

             (5)  If an indexation factor worked out under subsection (4) would, if it were worked out to 4 decimal places, end in a number that is greater than 4, the indexation factor is to be increased by 0.001.

             (6)  If an indexation factor worked out under subsections (4) and (5) would be less than 1, the indexation factor is to be increased to 1.

Rounding

             (7)  If a provisional indexed rate is a multiple of the rounding base, the provisional indexed rate becomes the indexed rate.

Note:          For **_provisional indexed rate_** see step 3 in subsection (3).

             (8)  Subject to subsection (9), if a provisional indexed rate is not a multiple of the rounding base, the indexed rate is the provisional indexed rate rounded up or down to the nearest multiple of the rounding base.

             (9)  If a provisional indexed rate is not a multiple of the rounding base but is a multiple of half the rounding base, the indexed rate is the provisional indexed rate rounded up to the nearest multiple of the rounding base.

When first indexation is to take place

           (10)  The first indexation of the rates specified in items 1, 2 and 3 of the table in subsection (1) is to take place on 20 September 2005.

           (11)  Subsections 198D(2) and (3) also apply for the purposes of this section.

Definitions

           (12)  In this section:

                    <a name="current-figur"></a>**_current figure_**, as at a particular time and in relation to a rate that is to be indexed under this section, means:

                     (a)  if the rate has not yet been indexed under this section before that time—the rate; and

                     (b)  if the rate has been indexed under this section before that time—the rate most recently substituted for the rate under this section before that time.

                    <a name="highest-group-quarter"></a>**_highest of a group of quarters_**, in relation to a group of quarters, means the quarter in that group that has the highest index number.

                    <a name="index-number"></a>**_index number_**, in relation to a quarter, means the All Groups Consumer Price Index number that is the weighted average of the 8 capital cities and is published by the Australian Statistician in respect of that quarter.
