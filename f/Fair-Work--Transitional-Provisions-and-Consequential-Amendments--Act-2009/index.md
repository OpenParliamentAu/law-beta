## 3  Meaning of _WR Act_ and _FW Act_

Meaning of **WR Act**

(1)        **_WR Act_** means the _Workplace Relations Act 1996_ and, unless the contrary intention appears, means that Act as in force immediately before the WR Act repeal day.

(2)        Unless a contrary intention appears, a reference to the WR Act, or to a provision or provisions of the WR Act, includes a reference to regulations made for the purposes of the WR Act, or for the purposes of the provision or provisions of the WR Act.

(3)        If an item of the transitional Schedules provides for the WR Act, or a provision or provisions of the WR Act, to continue to apply on and after the WR Act repeal day (or during the bridging period), the WR Act, or the provision or provisions, continue to so apply despite the WR Act repeal.

Meaning of **FW Act**

(4)        **_FW Act_** means the _Fair Work Act 2009_.

(5)        Unless a contrary intention appears, a reference to the FW Act, or to a provision or provisions of the FW Act, includes a reference to regulations made for the purposes of the FW Act, or for the purposes of the provision or provisions of the FW Act.

## 4  Expressions defined in the WR Act or the FW Act

(1)        Unless a contrary intention appears:

                     (a)  expressions used in a transitional Schedule  that were defined in the WR Act (other than Schedule 1 to that Act) have the same meanings in that transitional Schedule as they had in that Act; and

                     (b)  expressions used in a transitional Schedule that are defined in the FW Act have the same meanings in that transitional Schedule as they have in that Act.

(2)        If:

                     (a)  a provision of a transitional Schedule  uses an expression defined in both the WR Act and the FW Act; and

                     (b)  it is clear from the context of the provision which of those meanings is intended to apply in that provision;

the expression has that meaning.

(3)        The regulations may define, or clarify the meaning of, an expression used in a transitional Schedule.

(4)        This item does not apply to expressions defined in item 2.

## 5  Provisions that apply repealed provisions of the WR Act

(1)        If a provision of a transitional Schedule provides for provisions (the **_applied WR Act provisions_**) of the WR Act to apply on and after the WR Act repeal day, any other provisions of the WR Act, and any regulations or other instruments made under that Act, that are necessary for the effectual operation of the applied WR Act provisions also apply on and after that day.

(2)        This item has effect:

                     (a)  subject to a contrary intention in a provision of a transitional Schedule; and

                     (b)  subject to the regulations.

## 6  Effect of Part 21 of the WR Act to be taken into account

(1)        To avoid doubt, in interpreting provisions of the transitional Schedules, the effect on the WR Act of Part 21 of that Act (which deals with matters referred by Victoria) before the WR Act repeal day is to be taken into account.

_Note:       For example, a reference in Schedule 3 to a workplace agreement includes a reference to a workplace agreement made under Part 8 of the WR Act, as that Part had effect because of Part 21._

(2)        If a provision of the transitional Schedules provides for the application or continued application of provisions of the WR Act on and after the WR Act repeal day, those provisions also have the effect they would have if Part 21 of that Act were still in force.

_Note:       For example, item 2 of Schedule 4 provides for the continued application during the bridging period of Divisions 3, 4, 5 and 6 of Part 7 of the WR Act. The continued application of those Divisions also includes the extended effect those Divisions would have if Part 21 were still in force._

(3)        This item has effect:

                     (a)  subject to a contrary intention; and

                     (b)  subject to the regulations.

                     (b)  the amendments and repeals made by the Schedules to this Act.

(2)        Without limiting subitem (1), regulations made for the purpose of that subitem may do any of the following:

                     (b)  make other provision relating to the application of the provisions.

(3)        If a provision of a transitional Schedule provides for provisions of the FW Act to apply in relation to matters to which they would otherwise not apply, the regulations may:

(3)        This item has effect despite items 7 and 8.

## 10  Other general provisions about regulations

(1)        This item applies to regulations made for the purpose of any of the provisions of the transitional Schedules (including this Part).

(2)        Despite subsection 12(2) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ and subject to subitem (3), regulations may be expressed to take effect from a date before the regulations are  registered under that Act.

(3)        If:

                     (a)  regulations are expressed to take effect from a date (the **_registration date_**) before the regulations are registered under the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_; and

                     (b)  a person engaged in conduct before the registration date; and

                     (c)  but for the retrospective effect of the regulations, the conduct would not have contravened a provision of:

                              (i)  the WR Act (as it continues to apply because of this Act); or

                             (ii)  this Act; or

                            (iii)  the FW Act;

then a court must not convict the person of an offence, or order the person to pay a pecuniary penalty, in relation to the conduct on the grounds that it contravened a provision of any of those Acts.

(4)        The provisions of the transitional Schedules (including this Part) that provide for regulations to deal with matters do not limit each other.

                            (iv)  pre-reform certified agreements;

                             (v)  old IR agreements;

                            (vi)  section 170MX awards;

                     (d)  agreement-based transitional instruments of the following kinds are **_individual agreement-based transitional instruments_**:

                              (i)  ITEAs;

                             (ii)  preserved individual State agreements;

                            (iii)  AWAs;

                            (iv)  pre-reform AWAs.

## 2A  Meanings of _State reference transitional award_ and _State reference common rule_

(1)        A **_State reference transitional award_** is a transitional award that covers:

                     (a)  one or more specified State reference employers; and

                     (b)  specified State reference employees of those employers.

_Note:       A transitional award includes a transitional Victorian reference award._

(2)        A **_State reference common rule_** is a common rule that covers:

                     (a)  specified State reference employers; and

                     (b)  specified State reference employees of those employers.

(3)        A **_State reference employee_** is an employee who is a national system employee only because of section 30C of the FW Act.

(4)        A **_State reference employer_** is an employer that is a national system employer only because of section 30D of the FW Act.

(5)        If:

                     (a)  a transitional award (the **_current award_**) covers one or more State reference employers, and State reference employees of those employers; and

                     (b)  the current award also covers:

                              (i)  other employees of those employers; or

                             (ii)  other employers, and employees of those other employers;

then, for the purposes of this Act, the current award is taken instead to constitute 2 separate transitional awards as follows:

                     (c)  a State reference transitional award covering:

                              (i)  the employers, and the employees of those employers, referred to in paragraph (a); and

                             (ii)  if the current award covers an organisation, in relation to certain employers or employees referred to in paragraph (a)—that organisation in relation to those employers or employees; and

                     (d)  a transitional award covering:

                              (i)  the employers, and the employees of those employers, referred to in paragraph (b); and

                             (ii)  if the current award covers an organisation, in relation to certain employers or employees referred to in paragraph (b)—that organisation in relation to those employers or employees.

## 3  The employees, employers etc. who are _covered_ by a transitional instrument and to whom it _applies_

(1)        A transitional instrument **_covers_** the same employees, employers and any other persons that it would have covered (however described in the instrument or WR Act) if the WR Act had continued in operation.

_Note 1:    The expression covers is used to indicate the range of employees, employers etc. to whom the instrument potentially applies (see subitem (2)). The employees, employers etc. who are within this range will depend on terms of the instrument, and on any relevant provisions of the WR Act._

_Note 2:    Depending on the terms of a transitional instrument and any relevant provisions of the WR Act, the instrument’s coverage may extend to people who become employees after the instrument becomes a transitional instrument._

(2)        A transitional instrument **_applies_** to the same employees, employers and any other persons the instrument covers as would, if the WR Act had continued in operation, have been:

                     (a)  required by the WR Act to comply with terms of the instrument; or

                     (b)  entitled under the WR Act to enforce terms of the instrument.

_Note:       The expression applies is used to indicate the range of employees, employers etc. who are required to comply with, or can enforce, the terms of a transitional instrument._

(3)        However, an award-based transitional instrument does not apply to an employee (or to an employer, or an employee organisation, in relation to the employee) at a time when the employee is a high income employee (see section 329 of the FW Act).

_Note:       Item 35 deals with the application of section 329 of the FW Act to award-based transitional instruments._

(4)        This item has effect subject to:

                     (a)  the instrument interaction rules (see item 5); and

                     (b)  the variation or termination of transitional instruments as referred to in item 9;

                     (c)  Division 2 of Part 5 (which deals with interaction between transitional instruments and FW Act modern awards, workplace determinations and enterprise agreements); and

                     (d)  Schedule 11 (which deals with transfer of business); and

                     (e)  Part 3 of Schedule 2 (which deals with conduct before the WR Act repeal day).

## 4  Transitional instruments continue to be subject to the same instrument content rules

(1)        The same instrument content rules that applied in relation to WR Act instruments of a particular kind immediately before the WR Act repeal day continue to apply in relation to instruments of that kind that become transitional instruments.

_Note:       Certain instrument content rules relating to the standing down of employees do not continue to apply in relation to WR Act instruments that become transitional instruments (see item 3 of Schedule 15)._

(2)        **_Instrument content rules_** are provisions of a law of the Commonwealth, as in force immediately before the WR Act repeal day, of any of the following kinds:

                     (a)  provisions about what may, must or must not be included in an instrument;

                     (b)  provisions to the effect that a particular term of an instrument is of no effect (however described):

                              (i)  either completely or to a limited extent; and

                             (ii)  either permanently or for a limited period;

                     (c)  provisions to the effect that a particular term is taken to be included in an instrument.

_Note:       Most of the instrument content rules were in the WR Act._

## 5  Transitional instruments continue to be subject to the same instrument interaction rules

(1)        The same instrument interaction rules that applied in relation to WR Act instruments of a particular kind immediately before the WR Act repeal day continue to apply in relation to instruments of that kind that become transitional instruments.

(2)        **_Instrument interaction rules_** are provisions of a law of the Commonwealth, as in force immediately before the WR Act repeal day, the effect of which is that:

                     (a)  one instrument has priority over, or excludes, another instrument:

                              (i)  either completely or to a particular extent; and

                             (ii)  either permanently or for a particular period; or

                     (b)  one instrument ceases to operate because of another instrument:

                              (i)  either completely or to a particular extent; and

                             (ii)  either permanently or for a particular period.

_Note:       Most of the instrument interaction rules were in the WR Act._

## 5A  Transitional instruments continue to be subject to the same State and Territory interaction rules

(1)        The same State and Territory interaction rules that applied in relation to WR Act instruments of a particular kind immediately before the WR Act repeal day continue to apply in relation to instruments of that kind that become transitional instruments.

(2)        **_State and Territory interaction rules_** are provisions of a law of the Commonwealth, as in force immediately before the WR Act repeal day, the effect of which is that:

                     (a)  an instrument prevails over, or excludes, a law of a State or Territory; or

                     (b)  an instrument has effect subject to a law of a State or Territory.

_Note:       Most of the State and Territory interaction rules were in the WR Act._

## 6  References in transitional instruments to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission etc.

(1)        If a provision of a transitional instrument confers a power or function on the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, that provision has effect on and after the WR Act repeal day as if references in it to the Commission were instead references to FWA.

(2)        If a provision of a transitional instrument confers a power or function on the Industrial Registrar or a Deputy Industrial Registrar, that provision has effect on and after the WR Act repeal day as if references in it to the Industrial Registrar or a Deputy Industrial Registrar were instead references to the General Manager of FWA.

(3)        This item has effect subject to:

                     (a)  a contrary intention in this Act; and

                     (b)  the regulations.

## 7  No loss of accrued rights or liabilities when transitional instrument terminates or ceases to apply

(1)        If a transitional instrument terminates, or ceases to apply in relation to a person, that does not affect:

                     (a)  any right or liability that a person acquired, accrued or incurred before the transitional instrument terminated or ceased to apply; or

                     (b)  any investigation, legal proceeding or remedy in respect of any such right or liability.

(2)        Any such investigation, legal proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or enforced as if the transitional instrument had not terminated or ceased to apply.

(3)        This item has effect subject to a contrary intention in this Act or in the FW Act.

## 8  Certain transitional instruments displace certain Commonwealth laws

(1)        To the extent of any inconsistency, the following transitional instruments displace prescribed conditions of employment specified in a Commonwealth law that is prescribed by the regulations:

                     (a)  a workplace agreement;

                     (b)  a pre-reform certified agreement;

                     (c)  an AWA;

                     (d)  a pre-reform AWA.

(2)        In subitem (1):

            **_Commonwealth law_** means an Act or any regulations or other instrument made under an Act.

            **_prescribed conditions_** means conditions that are identified by the regulations.

(3)        If, immediately before the WR Act repeal day, regulations made under section 350 of the WR Act, or that continued to apply under subclause 2(2) or 17(2) of Schedule 7 to the WR Act:

                     (a)  identified a condition as a prescribed condition in relation to an instrument referred to in paragraph (1)(a), (b), (c) or (d); or

                     (b)  prescribed an Act or any regulations or other instrument made under an Act as a Commonwealth law in relation to such an instrument;

those regulations continue to have effect on and after that day as if made for the purposes of this item.

(4)        Subitem (3) has effect subject to any regulations made for the purposes of subitem (1) or (2).

## 8A  Continuing application of provisions of the WR Act about common rules

(1)        Subject to this item, clauses 82 to 87 of Schedule 6 to the WR Act continue to apply on and after the WR Act repeal day in relation to State reference common rules.

(2)        Clauses 82 to 87 continue to apply as if:

                     (a)  references in the clauses to the transitional period (including references to the end of the transitional period) were omitted; and

                     (b)  a reference in the clauses to the Commission were instead a reference to FWA; and

                     (c)  a reference in the clauses to a Registrar were instead a reference to the General Manager of FWA; and

                     (d)  a reference in the clauses to the Rules of the Commission were instead a reference to the procedural rules of FWA.

(3)        Subitem (2) has effect unless the context otherwise requires and subject to the regulations.

_Note:       For example, paragraph (2)(a) does not apply if the reference is to something that the Commission did before the WR Act repeal day (or before the reform commencement)._

<h7 class="ActHead7">Part 3—Variation and termination of transitional instruments</h7>

## 9  Transitional instruments can only be varied or terminated in limited circumstances

(1)        A transitional instrument cannot be varied except under:

                     (a)  a provision of this Part or the regulations; or

                     (b)  Part 2 of Schedule 5; or

                     (c)  Division 2 of Part _2_ of Schedule 6; or

                      (f)  Part 3 of Schedule 2.

_Note:       The references in paragraphs (1)(a) and (2)(a) to a provision of this Part or the regulations includes a reference to a provision of the WR Act or the FW Act as it applies because of a provision of this Part._

## 10  All kinds of transitional instrument: variation to remove ambiguities etc.

(1)        On application by a person covered by a transitional instrument, FWA may make a determination varying the instrument:

                     (a)  to remove an ambiguity or uncertainty in the instrument; or

                     (b)  to resolve an uncertainty or difficulty relating to the interaction between the instrument and a modern award; or

                     (c)  to remove terms that are inconsistent with Part 3-1 of the FW Act (which deals with general protections), or to vary terms to make them consistent with that Part.

_Note:       For variation of a transitional instrument to resolve an uncertainty or difficulty relating to the interaction between the instrument and the National Employment Standards, see item 26._

(2)        A variation of a transitional instrument operates from the day specified in the determination, which may be a day before the determination is made.

## 11  All kinds of transitional instrument: variation on referral by HREOC

(1)        This item applies if a transitional instrument is referred to FWA under section 46PW of the _Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986_ (which deals with discriminatory industrial instruments).

(2)        If the instrument is an award-based transitional instrument, section 161 of the FW Act applies in relation to the referral of the instrument as if the instrument were a modern award.

(3)        If the transitional instrument is an agreement-based transitional instrument, section 218 of the FW Act applies in relation to the referral of the instrument as if the instrument were an enterprise agreement.

## 12  Awards: continued application of WR Act provisions about variation and revocation

(1)        Subject to this item, Divisions 5 (other than subsections 554(1) to (4)) and 6 of Part 10 of the WR Act continue to apply on and after the WR Act repeal day in relation to transitional instruments that are awards as if references to the Commission were instead references to FWA.

_Note:       Items 10 and 11 apply instead of subsections 554(1) to (4) of the WR Act._

(2)        FWA must perform its powers and functions under Divisions 5 and 6 in a way that furthers the objects of Part 10 of the WR Act.

(3)        An award cannot be varied or revoked under Division 5 or 6 after the end of the bridging period, except as follows:

                     (a)  an award can be varied after the end of the bridging period under section 553 of the WR Act;

                     (b)  an award can be varied or revoked after the end of the bridging period as a result of FWA continuing to deal with a matter that it was dealing with before the end of the bridging period.

## 12A  State reference transitional awards: variation and revocation

General provisions

(1)        Subject to this item, Divisions 5 (other than subsections 554(1) to (4)) and 6 of Part 10 of the WR Act apply on and after the WR Act repeal day in relation to transitional instruments that are State reference transitional awards as if:

                     (a)  references to the Commission were instead references to FWA; and

                     (b)  references to an award included references to a State reference transitional award.

_Note 1:    Items 10 and 11 apply instead of subsections 554(1) to (4) of the WR Act._

_Note 2:    For variation of State reference common rules, see the provisions continued in effect by item 8A._

(2)        To avoid doubt, for the purpose of sections 552 and 553 of the WR Act, as applied by subitem (1) in relation to State reference transitional awards, “minimum safety net entitlements” includes minimum safety net entitlements relating to wages.

_Note:       For variation of terms relating to wages after the end of the bridging period, see subitems (4) to (6)._

(3)        FWA must perform its powers and functions under Divisions 5 and 6 in a way that furthers the objects of Part 10 of the WR Act.

(5)        In an annual wage review, FWA may make a determination varying terms of a State reference transitional award relating to wages.

(6)        For the purpose of subitem (5), Division 3 of Part 2-6 of the FW Act (other than section 292) applies to terms of a State reference transitional award relating to wages in the same way as it applies to a modern award.

## 13  Pre-reform certified agreements: continued application of WR Act provisions about variation

(1)        Subject to this item, clause 2A of Schedule 7 to the WR Act continues to apply on and after the WR Act repeal day in relation to transitional instruments that are pre-reform certified agreements as if references to the Commission were instead references to FWA.

(2)        An application under clause 16A cannot be made after the end of the bridging period.

## 15  Collective agreement-based transitional instruments: termination by agreement

Subdivision C of Division 7 of Part 2-4 of the FW Act (which deals with termination of enterprise agreements by employers and employees) applies in relation to a collective agreement-based transitional instrument as if a reference to an enterprise agreement included a reference to a collective agreement-based transitional instrument.

## 16  Collective agreement-based transitional instruments: termination by FWA

(1)        Subdivision D of Division 7 of Part 2-4 of the FW Act (which deals with termination of enterprise agreements after their nominal expiry date) applies in relation to a collective agreement-based transitional instrument as if a reference to an enterprise agreement included a reference to a collective agreement-based transitional instrument.

(2)        For the purpose of the application of Subdivision D to an old IR agreement, the agreement’s nominal expiry date is taken to be the end of the period of the agreement.

## 17  Individual agreement-based transitional instruments: termination by agreement

(1)        The employee and employer covered by an individual agreement-based transitional instrument may make a written agreement (a **_termination agreement_**) to terminate the agreement in accordance with the following requirements:

                     (a)  the termination agreement must be signed by the employee and the employer;

                     (b)  if the employee is under 18, it must also be signed by a parent or guardian of the employee;

                     (c)  the signatures must be witnessed.

(2)        The termination has no effect unless it has been approved by FWA.

(3)        The employer or employee may apply to FWA for approval of the termination agreement. The application must be made:

                     (a)  within 14 days after the termination agreement was made; or

                     (b)  if in all the circumstances FWA considers it fair to extend that period—within such further period as FWA allows.

(4)        If an application for FWA to approve the termination agreement is made under subitem (3), FWA must approve the termination of the instrument if:

                     (a)  FWA is satisfied that the requirements of subitem (1) have been complied with; and

                     (b)  FWA is satisfied that there are no other reasonable grounds for believing that the employee has not agreed to the termination.

(5)        If the termination is approved under subitem (4), the termination operates from the day specified in the decision to approve the termination.

## 18  Individual agreement-based transitional instruments: termination conditional on enterprise agreement

(1)        This item provides for the making of an instrument (a **_conditional termination_**) that will have the effect of terminating an individual agreement-based transitional instrument if:

                     (a)  an enterprise agreement (the **_proposed enterprise agreement_**) is made that covers the employee and the employer; and

                     (b)  the proposed enterprise agreement comes into operation.

(2)        If the transitional instrument has not passed its nominal expiry date, the conditional termination must be a written agreement signed by the employer and the employee. The signatures must be witnessed.

(3)        If the transitional instrument has passed its nominal expiry date, the conditional termination must be in writing and signed either by the employee or the employer. The signature must be witnessed.

(4)        If the conditional termination is signed by the employee, and the employee is under 18, it must also be signed by a parent or guardian of the employee.

(5)        Any other requirements of the regulations relating to the form, content or making of the conditional termination must also be complied with.

(6)        The employer must give the employee a copy of the conditional termination if:

                     (b)  the conditional termination is signed by the employer in the circumstances covered by subitem (3).

_Note 1:    For compliance with this obligation, see subitem 3(1) of Schedule 16._

_Note 2:    Failure to comply with this obligation does not affect the operation of subitem (8)._

(7)        The conditional termination must accompany any application to FWA for approval of the proposed enterprise agreement under section 185 of the FW Act.

_Note 1:    For compliance with this obligation, see subitem 3(2) of Schedule 16._

_Note 2:    Failure to comply with this obligation does not affect the operation of subitem (8), or the validity of an approval by FWA of the proposed enterprise agreement._

(8)        If the requirements of subitems (2) to (5) have been complied with in relation to the conditional termination, the transitional instrument terminates when the proposed enterprise agreement comes into operation.

## 19  Individual agreement-based transitional instruments: unilateral termination with FWA’s approval

(1)        This item applies to an employer or employee:

                     (a)  to whom an individual agreement-based transitional instrument that has passed its nominal expiry date applies; and

(2)        The employer or employee may:

                     (a)  make a written declaration that identifies the transitional instrument and that states that the employer or employee wants to terminate the transitional instrument; and

                     (b)  apply to FWA for the approval of the termination.

                     (b)  the notice must state that the employer or employee intends to apply to FWA for approval of the termination of the instrument;

                     (c)  the notice must state that, if FWA approves the termination, the transitional instrument will terminate on the 90th day after the day on which FWA makes the approval decision;

                     (d)  if the notice is given by the employer:

                              (i)  the notice must state whether, if the instrument terminates during the bridging period, one or more redundancy provisions in the instrument will continue to apply to the employee as provided for by item 38; and

                             (ii)  if one or more redundancy provisions in the instrument will so continue to apply to the employee—the notice must include or be accompanied by a copy of the provision or provisions;

                     (e)  the notice must comply with any other requirements of the regulations.

(4)        FWA must approve the termination if FWA is satisfied that:

                     (b)  the requirements of subitems (2) and (3) have been complied with.

(5)        If FWA approves the termination, the transitional instrument terminates on the 90th day after the day on which FWA makes the approval decision.

## 20  Sunsetting rules for various transitional instruments

                     (a)  the employer in relation to a section 170MX award is not a national system employer; and

                     (b)  the section 170MX award:

                              (i)  was in force just before 27 March 2006; or

                             (ii)  was made on or after that day because of Part 8 of Schedule 7 to the WR Act;

the award terminates on the earlier of the following:

                     (c)  27 March 2011;

                     (d)  when it has been replaced by a State employment agreement.

(7)        However, if the employer becomes a national system employer before 27 March 2011, subitem (6) does not apply after that time.

## 21  Effect of termination

If a transitional instrument terminates, it ceases to cover (and can never again cover) any employees, employers or other persons.

<h7 class="ActHead7">Part 4—Transitional instruments and the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard</h7>

## 22  Same AFPCS interaction rules continue to apply

(1)        Subject to this item, the same AFPCS interaction rules that applied in relation to WR Act instruments of a particular kind immediately before the WR Act repeal day continue to apply in relation to instruments of that kind that become transitional instruments.

_Note 1:    Schedule 4 provides for the continued application of the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard (other than minimum wages provisions) during the bridging period._

_Note 2:    Schedule 9 provides for the continued application of the minimum wages provisions of the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard on and after the WR Act repeal day._

(2)        AFPCS interaction rules of the kind referred to in paragraph (4)(b) do not continue to apply after the end of the bridging period.

_Note:       This may result in an employee becoming entitled to a rate of pay under a transitional APCS that is higher than was required to be paid to the employee under a transitional instrument during the bridging period. If that occurs, the employer may apply to FWA for a determination to phase-in the effect of the increase (see item 14 of Schedule 9)._

(3)        If, immediately before the end of the bridging period, an AFPCS interaction rule of the kind referred to in paragraph (4)(b) produced the result that an employee to whom a transitional instrument applied was not covered by the obligation in subsection 182(1) or (2) of the WR Act in relation to a transitional APCS, the employee becomes covered by that obligation in relation to that transitional APCS from the end of the bridging period.

(4)        **_AFPCS interaction rules_** are provisions of a law of the Commonwealth, as in force immediately before the WR Act repeal day, the effect of which is that:

                     (a)  the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard prevails over an instrument (or an instrument is of no effect because of the Standard) either completely or to a particular extent; or

                     (b)  an instrument prevails over the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard (or the Standard does not apply because of the instrument) either completely or to a particular extent.

_Note:       Most of the AFPCS interaction rules were in the WR Act._

<h7 class="ActHead7">Part 5—Transitional instruments and the FW Act</h7>

<h8 class="ActHead8">Division 1—Interaction between transitional instruments and the National Employment Standards</h8>

## 23  The no detriment rule

(1)        To the extent that a term of a transitional instrument is detrimental to an employee, in any respect, when compared to an entitlement of the employee under the National Employment Standards, the term of the transitional instrument is of no effect.

_Note 1:    A term of a transitional instrument that provides an entitlement that is at least as beneficial to an employee as a corresponding entitlement of the employee under the National Employment Standards will continue to have effect._

_Note 2:    Division 3 (which contains other general provisions about how the FW Act applies in relation to transitional instruments) is also relevant to how the National Employment Standards apply in relation to employees to whom transitional instruments apply._

_Note 3:    References to the National Employment Standards include a reference to the extended parental leave provisions and the extended notice of termination provisions (see sections 746 and 761 of the FW Act)._

(1A)     If there is a dispute about the application of this item which must be resolved by FWA in accordance with item 26, FWA may compare the entitlements which are in dispute:

                     (a)  on a ‘line-by-line’ basis, comparing individual terms; or

                     (b)  on a ‘like-by-like’ basis, comparing entitlements according to particular subject areas; or

                     (c)  using any combination of the above approaches FWA sees fit.

(2)        Subitem (1) does not affect a term of a transitional instrument that is permitted by a provision of the National Employment Standards as it has effect under item 24.

(3)        The regulations may make provisions that apply to determining, for the purpose of this item, whether terms of a transitional instrument are, or are not, detrimental in any respect when compared to entitlements under the National Employment Standards.

## 24  Provisions of the NES that allow instruments to contain particular kinds of terms

(1)        The following provisions of the National Employment Standards have effect, on and after the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day, as if a reference to a modern award or an enterprise agreement included a reference to a transitional instrument:

                     (a)  section 63 (which allows terms dealing with averaging of hours of work);

                     (b)  section 93 (which allows terms dealing with cashing out and taking paid annual leave);

                     (c)  section 101 (which allows terms dealing with cashing out paid personal/carer’s leave);

                     (d)  subsection 107(5) (which allows terms dealing with evidence requirements for paid personal/carer’s leave etc.);

                     (e)  subsection 115(3) (which allows terms dealing with substitution of public holidays);

                      (f)  section 118 (which allows terms dealing with an employee giving notice to terminate his or her employment);

                     (g)  subsections 121(2) and (3) (which allow terms specifying situations in which the redundancy pay entitlement under section 119 does not apply);

                     (h)  section 126 (which allows terms providing for school-based apprentices and trainees to be paid loadings in lieu).

(2)        If:

                     (a)  a transitional instrument includes terms referred to in subsection (1) of section 93 or 101 of the National Employment Standards; but

                     (b)  the terms do not include the requirements referred to in subsection (2) of that section;

the instrument is taken to include terms that include the requirements.

## 25  Shiftworker annual leave entitlement

(1)        If:

                     (a)  a transitional instrument applies to an employee; and

                     (b)  the employee is a shift worker as defined in section 228 of the WR Act;

the employee is taken to qualify for the shiftworker annual leave entitlement for the purposes of section 87 of the FW Act.

(2)        This item has effect subject to subsection 87(4) of the FW Act.

## 26  Resolving difficulties about application of this Division

(1)        On application by a person covered  by a transitional instrument, FWA may make a determination varying the transitional instrument:

                     (a)  to resolve an uncertainty or difficulty relating to the interaction between the instrument and the National Employment Standards; or

                     (b)  to make the instrument operate effectively with the National Employment Standards.

(2)        A variation of a transitional instrument operates from the day specified in the determination, which may be a day before the determination is made.

## 27  Division does not affect transitional instruments before NES commencement

This Division (including determinations under item 26) does not affect the operation of a transitional instrument at any time before the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day.

<h8 class="ActHead8">Division 2—Interaction between transitional instruments and FW Act modern awards, enterprise agreements and workplace determinations</h8>

## 28  Modern awards and agreement-based transitional instruments

(1)        While an agreement-based transitional instrument of any of the following kinds applies to an employee, or to an employer or other person in relation to the employee:

                     (a)  a workplace agreement;

                     (b)  a workplace determination;

                     (c)  a preserved State agreement;

                     (d)  an AWA;

                     (e)  a pre-reform AWA;

a modern award does not apply to the employee, or to the employer or other person in relation to the employee.

_Note 1:    However, a modern award can continue to cover the employee while the agreement-based transitional instrument continues to apply._

_Note 2:    This subitem has effect subject to item 13 of Schedule 9 (which requires that the base rate of pay under an agreement-based transitional instrument must not be less than the relevant modern award rate)._

(2)        If:

                     (a)  an agreement-based transitional instrument of any of the following kinds:

                              (i)  a pre-reform certified agreement;

                             (ii)  an old IR agreement;

                            (iii)  a section 170MX award; and

                     (b)  a modern award;

both apply to an employee, or to an employer or other person in relation to the employee, the agreement-based transitional instrument prevails over the modern award, to the extent of any inconsistency.

_Note:       This subitem has effect subject to item 13 of Schedule 9 (which requires that the base rate of pay under an agreement-based transitional instrument must not be less than the relevant modern award rate)._

## 28A  Terms of modern awards about outworker conditions continue to apply

(1)        This item applies if, at a particular time:

                     (a)  an agreement-based transitional instrument applies to an employee; and

                     (b)  outworker terms (within the meaning of the FW Act) in a modern award would, but for the transitional instrument, apply to the employee.

(2)        Despite item 28 and despite any terms of the agreement-based transitional instrument that are detrimental to the employee in any respect when compared to the terms of the modern award, the outworker terms apply at that time to the following persons:

                     (a)  the employee;

                     (b)  the employer;

                     (c)  each employee organisation to which the modern award applies.

(3)        To avoid doubt, to the extent to which terms of a modern award apply to an employee, an employer or an employee organisation because of subitem (2), the modern award applies to the employee, employer or organisation.

## 29  Modern awards and award-based transitional instruments

Modern awards other than the miscellaneous modern award

(1)        If a modern award (other than the miscellaneous modern award) that covers an employee, or an employer or other person in relation to the employee, comes into operation, then an award-based transitional instrument ceases to cover (and can never again cover) the employee, or the employer or other person in relation to the employee.

_Note:       A modern award cannot be expressed to cover an employee who is covered by a transitional instrument that is an enterprise instrument or a State reference public sector transitional award (see subsections 143(8) and (10) of the FW Act)._

The miscellaneous modern award

(2)        While an award-based transitional instrument that covers an employee, or an employer or other person in relation to the employee, is in operation, the miscellaneous modern award does not cover the employee, or the employer or other person in relation to the employee.

Outworker entities

(3)        If a modern award (other than the miscellaneous modern award) that contains outworker terms that cover an outworker entity comes into operation, then outworker terms in an award-based transitional instrument cease to cover (and can never again cover) the outworker entity.

(4)        While outworker terms in an award-based transitional instrument that is in operation cover an outworker entity, any outworker terms in the miscellaneous modern award do not cover the outworker entity.

(5)        **_Outworker terms_** in an award-based transitional instrument are terms that would be outworker terms as defined in the FW Act if they were in a modern award.

## 30  FW Act enterprise agreements and workplace determinations, and agreement-based transitional instruments

Individual agreement-based transitional instruments

(1)        While an individual agreement-based transitional instrument applies to an employee, or to an employer in relation to the employee, an enterprise agreement or workplace determination (under the FW Act) does not apply to the employee, or the employer in relation to the employee.

Collective agreement-based transitional instruments

(2)        If an enterprise agreement or workplace determination (under the FW Act) starts to apply to an employee, or an employer or other person in relation to the employee, then a collective agreement-based transitional instrument ceases to cover (and can never again cover) the employee, or the employer or other person in relation to the employee.

_Note 1:    The fact that a collective agreement-based transitional instrument applies to employees does not prevent those employees and their employer from replacing that transitional instrument at any time with an enterprise agreement, regardless of whether the transitional instrument has passed its nominal expiry date._

_Note 2:    Industrial action must not be taken before the nominal expiry date of an agreement-based transitional instrument, even if it is being replaced by an enterprise agreement (see item 4 of Schedule 13)._

## 31  FW Act enterprise agreements and workplace determinations, and award-based transitional instruments

If an enterprise agreement or workplace determination (under the FW Act) applies  to an employee, or an employer or other person in relation to the employee, then:

                     (a)  an award-based transitional instrument ceases to apply to the employee, and the employer or other person in relation to the employee; but

                     (b)  the award-based transitional instrument can (subject to the other provisions of this Part) continue to cover the employee, and the employer or other person in relation to the employee.

_Note:       Subject to the other provisions of this Part, the award-based transitional instrument can again start to apply to the employee, and the employer or other person in relation to the employee, if the enterprise agreement or workplace determination (under the FW Act) ceases to apply to the employee._

## 31A  Designated outworker terms of award-based transitional instrument continue to apply

(1)        This item applies if, at a particular time:

                     (a)  an enterprise agreement or workplace determination (under the FW Act) applies to an employer; and

                     (b)  an award-based transitional instrument covers the employer (whether the transitional instrument covers the employer in the employer’s capacity as an employer or an outworker entity); and

                     (c)  the transitional instrument includes one or more designated outworker terms.

(2)        Despite item 31, the designated outworker terms of the award-based transitional instrument apply at that time to the following:

                     (a)  the employer;

                     (b)  each employee who is both:

                              (i)  a person to whom the enterprise agreement or workplace determination applies; and

                             (ii)  a person who is covered by the transitional instrument;

                     (c)  each employee organisation that is covered by the transitional instrument.

(3)        To avoid doubt:

                     (a)  award-based transitional instruments are taken to be instruments to which the definition of **_designated outworker term_** in section 12 of the FW Act applies; and

                     (b)  designated outworker terms of an award-based transitional instrument can apply to an employer under subitem (2) even if none of the employees of the employer is an outworker; and

                     (c)  to the extent to which designated outworker terms of an award-based transitional instrument apply to an employer, an employee or an employee organisation because of subitem (2), the transitional instrument applies to the employer, employee or organisation.

<h8 class="ActHead8">Division 3—Other general provisions about how the FW Act applies in relation to transitional instruments</h8>

## 32  Employee not award/agreement free if transitional instrument applies

(1)        An employee is not an award/agreement free employee for the purposes of the FW Act if a transitional instrument applies to the employee.

(2)        The regulations may make provision in relation to any of the following in relation to employees to whom transitional instruments apply:

                     (a)  what is the base rate of pay of such an employee for the purposes of the FW Act (either generally or for the purposes of entitlements under the National Employment Standards);

                     (b)  what is the full rate of pay of such an employee for the purposes of the FW Act (either generally or for the purposes of entitlements under the National Employment Standards);

                     (c)  whether such an employee is a pieceworker for the purposes of the FW Act.

## 33  Employee’s ordinary hours of work

Item applies for purpose of determining employee’s ordinary hours of work for the FW Act

(1)        For the purposes of the FW Act, the ordinary hours of work of an employee to whom a transitional instrument applies are to be determined in accordance with this item.

Ordinary hours as specified in transitional instrument

(2)        If a transitional instrument that applies to the employee specifies, or provides for the determination of, the employee’s ordinary hours of work, the employee’s **_ordinary hours of work_** are as specified in, or determined in accordance with, that instrument.

If subitem (2) does not apply and there is agreement

(3)        If subitem (2) does not apply, the employee’s **_ordinary hours of work_** are the hours agreed by the employee and his or her employer as the employee’s ordinary hours of work.

If subitem (2) does not apply and there is no agreement

(4)        If subitem (2) does not apply but there is no agreement under subitem (3), the **_ordinary hours of work_** of the employee in a week are:

                     (a)  if the employee is a full time employee—38 hours; or

                     (b)  if the employee is not a full-time employee—the lesser of:

                              (i)  38 hours; and

                             (ii)  the employee’s usual weekly hours of work.

If subitem (2) does not apply: agreed hours are less than usual weekly hours

(5)        If:

                     (a)  subitem (2) does not apply; and

                     (b)  the employee is not a full-time employee; and

                     (c)  there is an agreement under subitem (3) between the employee and his or her employer, but the agreed ordinary hours of work are less than the employee’s usual weekly hours of work;

the **_ordinary hours of work_** of the employee in a week are the lesser of:

                     (d)  38 hours; and

                     (e)  the employee’s usual weekly hours of work.

Regulations may prescribe usual weekly hours

(6)        For an employee who is not a full-time employee and who does not have usual weekly hours of work, the regulations may prescribe, or provide for the determination of, hours that are taken to be the employee’s usual weekly hours of work for the purposes of subitems (4) and (5).

## 34  Payment of wages

Division 2 of Part 2-9 of the FW Act (which deals with payment of wages) applies, on and after the WR Act repeal day, in relation to a transitional instrument as if:

                     (a)  a reference to an enterprise agreement included a reference to an agreement-based transitional instrument; and

                     (b)  a reference to a modern award included a reference to an award-based transitional instrument.

## 35  Guarantee of annual earnings

Division 3 of Part 2-9 of the FW Act (which deals with the guarantee of annual earnings) applies, on and after the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day, as if:

                     (a)  a reference to an enterprise agreement included a reference to an agreement-based transitional instrument; and

                     (b)  a reference to a modern award included a reference to an award-based transitional instrument and a transitional APCS.

_Note:       For provisions about transitional APCSs, see Schedule 9._

## 36  Application of unfair dismissal provisions

Part 3-2 of the FW Act (which deals with unfair dismissal) applies, on and after the WR Act repeal day, as if:

                     (a)  the reference in subparagraph 382(b)(i) and paragraph 389(1)(b) of that Act to a modern award included a reference to an award-based transitional instrument; and

                     (b)  the reference in subparagraph 382(b)(ii) and paragraph 389(1)(b) of that Act to an enterprise agreement included a reference to an agreement-based transitional instrument.

## 37  Regulations may deal with other matters

The regulations may deal with other matters relating to how the FW Act applies in relation to transitional instruments.

<h7 class="ActHead7">Part 6—Preservation of redundancy provisions in agreements etc.</h7>

## 38  Preservation of redundancy provisions when agreement-based transitional instrument terminates

When this item applies

(1)        This item applies if a termination of an agreement-based transitional instrument (the **_terminated instrument_**) takes effect during the bridging period in either of the following circumstances:

                     (a)  the instrument is a preserved collective State agreement or a pre-reform certified agreement  that is terminated by FWA as provided for by item 16 because of an application made by an employer covered by the agreement;

                     (b)  the instrument is an individual agreement-based transitional instrument that terminates under item 19 because FWA approves a termination of the instrument by an employer covered by the instrument.

Continuation of redundancy provisions

(2)        Any redundancy provision that was in the terminated instrument continues to apply to any person to whom the terminated instrument applied immediately before the termination took effect, as if the terminated instrument had continued operating.

_Note:       For how long the redundancy provision continues to apply, see subitem (6)._

(3)        A redundancy provision that continues to apply to a person under subitem (2) is taken, for the purpose of this Act, to be a transitional instrument of the same kind as the terminated instrument. However, this does not apply for the purpose of:

                     (a)  the provisions of Parts 2, 3, 4 and 5 of this Schedule, other than subitem 20(2) and item 23; or

                     (b)  any other provisions prescribed by the regulations.

Continued redundancy provisions generally prevail over other instruments

(4)        Subject to subitem (5), a redundancy provision that continues to apply to a person under subitem (2) prevails over any other redundancy provision included in any other instrument that would otherwise apply (even if the provisions in that other instrument might be more beneficial to the employee).

_Note:       For how long the redundancy provision continues to apply, see subitem (6)._

(5)        However, if:

                     (a)  an industry-specific redundancy scheme in a modern award applies to an employee; and

                     (b)  a redundancy provision that continues to apply to an employee under subitem (2) is detrimental to the employee, in any respect, when compared to the scheme in the modern award;

then the scheme in the modern award prevails over the redundancy provision, to the extent that the redundancy provision is detrimental to the employee.

Period for which redundancy provisions are continued

(6)        A redundancy provision continues under subitem (2) to apply to a person, in relation to an employee to whom the provision applies, until the earliest of the following:

                     (a)  the end of the period of 24 months from the time the termination took effect;

                     (b)  the time when the employee ceases to be employed by the employer (otherwise than in circumstances covered by the provision);

                     (c)  the time when an enterprise agreement, workplace determination or ITEA starts to apply to the employee.

Definitions

(7)        In this item:

**_instrument_** means:

                     (a)  an award-based transitional instrument; or

                     (b)  a collective agreement; or

                     (c)  a collective preserved State agreement; or

                     (d)  a pre-reform certified agreement; or

                     (e)  an old IR agreement.

**_redundancy provision_** means any of the following kinds of provisions:

                     (a)  a provision relating to redundancy pay in relation to a termination of employment;

                     (b)  a provision that is incidental to a provision relating to redundancy pay in relation to a termination of employment;

                     (c)  a machinery provision that is in respect of a provision relating to redundancy pay in relation to a termination of employment;

where the termination is at the initiative of the employer and on the grounds of operational requirements, or because the employer is insolvent.

## 39  Notification of preservation of redundancy provisions

When this item applies

(1)        This item applies if:

                     (a)  FWA makes a decision (a **_termination decision_**) of either of the following kinds:

                              (i)  a decision to terminate a transitional instrument as referred to in paragraph 38(1)(a);

                             (ii)  a decision to approve a termination of a transitional instrument as referred to in paragraph 38(1)(b); and

                     (b)  when the termination takes effect, one or more redundancy provisions in the instrument will continue to apply to persons (**_affected persons_**) in accordance with item 38.

Notification requirements if the transitional instrument is a preserved collective State agreement or a pre-reform certified agreement

(2)        If the transitional instrument is a preserved collective State agreement or a pre-reform certified agreement:

                     (a)  the termination decision must:

                              (i)  identify the redundancy provision or the redundancy provisions; and

                             (ii)  state that the provision or provisions will continue to apply to the affected persons; and

                            (iii)  specify the date that is 24 months after the time when the termination takes effect; and

                            (iv)  state that the provision or provisions will continue to apply until that date, or an earlier date, in accordance with subitem 38(6); and

                     (b)  FWA must give  a copy of the termination decision to each affected person that is:

                              (i)  an employer; or

                             (ii)  an employee organisation.

(3)        An employer that has, under subitem (2), received a copy of a termination decision must take reasonable steps to ensure that all employees to whom the instrument applied immediately before the termination takes effect are given a copy of the decision within 21 days of the employer receiving a copy of the decision.

_Note:       For compliance with this obligation, see item 4 of Schedule 16._

Notification requirements if the transitional instrument is an individual agreement-based transitional instrument

(4)        If the transitional instrument is an individual agreement-based transitional instrument, the termination decision must:

                     (a)  identify the redundancy provision or the redundancy provisions; and

                     (b)  state that the provision or provisions will continue to apply to the affected persons; and

                     (c)  specify the date that is 24 months after the time when the termination takes effect; and

                     (d)  state that the provision or provisions will continue to apply until that date, or an earlier date, in accordance with subitem 38(6).

## 40  Redundancy provisions that were already preserved as at the WR Act repeal day

(1)        This item applies if, immediately before the WR Act repeal day, redundancy provisions that were in a WR Act instrument (the **_terminated instrument_**) that was terminated before that day (the **_actual termination_**) were continuing to bind persons under any of the following provisions:

                     (a)  section 399A of the WR Act;

                     (b)  section 399A of the pre-transition Act (within the meaning of Schedule 7A to the WR Act);

                     (c)  clause 6A of Schedule 7 to the WR Act;

                     (d)  clause 20A of Schedule 7 to the WR Act;

                     (e)  clause 21A of Schedule 8 to the WR Act;

                      (f)  clause 21D of Schedule 8 to the WR Act.

(2)        Item 38 applies as if:

                     (a)  the redundancy provisions were a transitional instrument of the same kind as the terminated instrument; and

                     (b)  a termination of that transitional instrument took effect on the WR Act repeal day as referred to in subitem 38(1); and

                     (c)  the reference in paragraph 38(6)(a) to 24 months were instead a reference to the unexpired part of the period of 24 months that started on the actual termination.

(3)        Item 39 does not apply to the termination referred to in paragraph (2)(b).

<h7 class="ActHead7">Part 3—Operation of the National Employment Standards</h7>

## 5  Non-accruing entitlements: counting service before the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day

General rule

(1)        An employee’s service with an employer before the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day counts as service of the employee with the employer for the purpose of determining the employee’s entitlements under the National Employment Standards, other than entitlements to:

                     (a)  paid annual leave; and

                     (b)  paid personal/carer’s leave.

_Note 1:    References to the National Employment Standards include a reference to the extended parental leave provisions and the extended notice of termination provisions (see sections 746 and 761 of the FW Act)._

_Note 2:    Interaction between the National Employment Standards and transitional instruments is dealt with in Division 1 of Part 5 of Schedule 3._

No double entitlement

(2)        If, before the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day, the employee has already had the benefit of an entitlement, the amount of which was calculated by reference to a period of service, subitem (1) does not result in that period of service with the employer being counted again when calculating the employee’s entitlements of that kind under the National Employment Standards.

(3)        To avoid doubt, subitem (2) does not require an employee to serve any initial qualifying period of service for long service leave again.

Limitation on application of general rule to redundancy pay

(4)        Subitem (1) does not apply in relation to an employee and an employer for the purposes of Subdivision B of Division 11 of the National Employment Standards (which deals with redundancy pay) if the terms and conditions of employment that applied to the employee’s employment by the employer immediately before the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day did not provide for an entitlement to redundancy pay.

## 6  Accruing entitlements: leave accrued immediately before the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day

(1)        This item applies if, immediately before the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day, an employee has an accrued entitlement to an amount of paid annual leave or paid personal/carer’s leave, whether the leave accrued under Part 7 of the WR Act, a transitional instrument or otherwise.

(2)        The provisions of the National Employment Standards relating to taking that kind of leave (including rates of pay while taking leave), or cashing-out that kind of leave, apply, as a minimum standard, to the accrued leave as if it had accrued under the National Employment Standards.

## 7  Leave that, immediately before the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day, is being, or is to be, taken under Part 7 of the WR Act

(1)        If:

                     (a)  immediately before the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day, an employee is taking a period of a type of leave under Part 7 of the WR Act; and

                     (b)  there is an equivalent type of leave under the National Employment Standards;

the employee is entitled to continue on leave of the equivalent type under the National Employment Standards for the remainder of the period.

_Note:       For example, if an employee is taking paid annual leave under Part 7 of the WR Act immediately before the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day, the employee is entitled to continue on paid annual leave under the National Employment Standards._

(2)        If an employee, or his or her spouse or de facto partner (if the spouse or de facto partner is also an employee), continues on leave under the National Employment Standards in accordance with subitem (1), the employee is entitled to adjust any of the following consistently with the provisions of the National Employment Standards in relation to that type of leave:

                     (a)  the amount of leave the employee is taking or will take;

                     (b)  the time at which the leave is taken;

                     (c)  the arrangements for taking the leave.

_Note:       If the employee’s spouse or de facto partner is also an employee, the employees will be an employee couple for the purposes of the parental leave provisions of the National Employment Standards._

(3)        If, before the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day:

                     (a)  an employee has taken a step that the employee is required to take so that the employee can, on or after the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day, take a type of leave referred to in subitem (1); and

                     (b)  an equivalent step is required under the National Employment Standards;

the employee is taken to have taken the step under the National Employment Standards.

_Note:       For example, if an employee has given the employer an application under section 271 of the WR Act so that the employee can take ordinary maternity leave, the employee is taken to have given the employer notice under section 74 of the FW Act of the taking of unpaid parental leave._

(4)        If an employee is taken, by subitem (3), to have taken a step, in relation to leave, under the National Employment Standards, the employee is entitled to adjust the step consistently with the provisions of the National Employment Standards in relation to that type of leave.

_Note:       For example, an employee could vary the content of a notice given to the employer in relation to the leave, or vary the amount of leave the employee has notified the employer that the employee intends to take._

(5)        The regulations may deal with other matters relating to how the National Employment Standards apply to leave that, immediately before the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day, is being, or is to be, taken under Part 7 of the WR Act.

## 8  Community service leave

(1)        An employee may, on or after the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day, be absent from his or her employment under Division 8 of the National Employment Standards even if the period of absence began before that day.

(2)        If an employee is absent from his or her employment in accordance with subitem (1), subsection 111(5) of the National Employment Standards applies as if a reference to the first 10 days of absence were a reference to the first 10 days of absence occurring on or after the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day.

## 9  Notice of termination

(1)        Subdivision A of Division 11 of the National Employment Standards applies only to terminations of employment occurring on or after the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day.

(2)        However, that Subdivision does not apply to a termination if notice of the termination was given before the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day.

## 10  Redundancy pay

Subdivision B of Division 11 of the National Employment Standards applies only to terminations of employment occurring on or after the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day, even if notice of the termination was given before that day.

## 11  References to transfers of employment

References to a transfer of employment in:

                     (a)  provisions of the National Employment Standards; and

                     (b)  subsections 22(5) and (6) of the FW Act, as those provisions apply for the purposes of the National Employment Standards;

do not cover a situation where the employee became employed by the second employer (within the meaning of subsection 22(7) of the FW Act) at a time before the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day.

## 12  Recognised emergency management bodies

A body that was established, or continued in existence, for the purpose, or for purposes that include the purpose, of enabling one or more employees to obtain the protection of subsection 659(2) of the WR Act (which dealt with unlawful termination) is not a recognised emergency management body for the purposes of the FW Act.

## 13  Fair Work Information Statement

The obligation in section 125 of the National Employment Standards for an employer to give an employee the Fair Work Information Statement only applies to an employee who starts employment with the employer on or after the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day.

## 14  Regulations

The regulations may make provision in relation to how the National Employment Standards apply to, or are affected by, things done or matters occurring before the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day.

###### Schedule 5—Modern awards (other than modern enterprise awards and State reference public sector modern awards)

<h7 class="ActHead7">Part 1—Preliminary</h7>

## 1  Meanings of _employee_ and _employer_

In this Schedule, **_employee_** means a national system employee and **_employer_** means a national system employer.

<h7 class="ActHead7">Part 2—The WR Act award modernisation process</h7>

## 2  AIRC to continue and complete the award modernisation process

(1)        The Australian Industrial Relations Commission is to continue and complete the award modernisation process provided for by Part 10A of the WR Act (the **_Part 10A award modernisation process_**).

_Note:       Enterprise award etc. modernisation is provided for in Schedule 6._

(2)        For that purpose, Part 10A of the WR Act continues to apply on and after the WR Act repeal day in accordance with this Part.

(3)        Without limiting subitem (2), the request under section 576C of the WR Act continues to apply on and after the WR Act repeal day, and may be varied in accordance with that section.

(4)        The Australian Industrial Relations Commission’s power under section 576H of the WR Act to vary a modern award cannot be exercised after the modern award has come into operation.

(5)        In continuing and completing the Part 10A award modernisation process, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission must have regard to:

                     (a)  the state of the national economy; and

                     (b)  the likely effects on the national economy of any modern award that the Commission is considering, or is proposing to make, with special reference to likely effects on the level of employment and on inflation; and

                     (c)  the likely effects on the relevant industry or industry sector of any modern award that the Commission is considering, or is proposing to make, including on productivity, labour costs and the regulatory burden on businesses.

## 3  Variation and termination of certain transitional instruments etc. to take account of Part 10A award modernisation process

(1)        FWA must, as soon as practicable after a modern award (other than the miscellaneous modern award) made in the Part 10A award modernisation process comes into operation (and subject to subitem (3)):

                     (a)  terminate any of the following (**_modernisable instruments_**) that FWA considers are completely replaced by the modern award:

                              (i)  award-based transitional instruments;

                             (ii)  transitional APCSs; and

                     (b)  if FWA considers that the modern award only partly replaces a modernisable instrument—vary the coverage terms of the modernisable instrument accordingly.

_Note 1:    The main provisions about transitional instruments are in Schedule 3, and the main provisions about transitional APCSs are in Schedule 9._

_Note 2:    This item does not limit the effect of any other provision of this Act under which a modernisable instrument ceases to cover a person from a time earlier than when the instrument is terminated or varied under this item._

(2)        As soon as practicable after all modern awards made in the Part 10A modernisation process have come into operation, FWA must (subject to subitem (3)) terminate any remaining modernisable instruments.

(3)        However, FWA must not, under this item:

                     (a)  terminate a modernisable instrument that is an enterprise instrument or a State reference public sector transitional award, or that covers employees who are also covered by an enterprise instrument or a State reference public sector transitional award; or

                     (b)  vary a modernisable instrument that is an enterprise instrument or a State reference public sector transitional award; or

                     (c)  vary a modernisable instrument so that it ceases to cover employees who are also covered by an enterprise instrument or a State reference public sector transitional award.

_Note 1:    Item 9 of Schedule 6 deals with termination and variation of modernisable instruments to take account of the enterprise instrument or a State reference public sector transitional award modification process._

_Note 2:    Item 10 of Schedule 6A deals with termination and variation of State reference public sector transitional awards to take account of the State reference public sector transitional award modernisation process._

(4)        FWA may establish a process for making decisions under this item to terminate or vary one or more modernisable instruments.

(5)        FWA may advise persons or bodies about that process in any way FWA considers appropriate.

(6)        Section 625 of the FW Act (which deals with delegation by the President of functions and powers of FWA) has effect as if subsection (2) of that section included a reference to FWA’s powers under subitem (5).

## 4  How the FW Act applies to modern awards made in the Part 10A award modernisation process

(1)        A modern award made in the Part 10A award modernisation process is, for the purposes of the FW Act (and any other law), taken to be a modern award within the meaning of that Act from the later of the following days:

                     (a)  the day on which the award is made;

                     (b)  the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day.

(2)        Section 49 of the FW Act does not apply for the purpose of determining when the modern award comes into operation. Instead, the modern award comes into operation on the day on which it is expressed to commence (in accordance with section 576Y of the WR Act).

(3)        The regulations may deal with other matters relating to how the FW Act applies in relation to modern awards made in the Part 10A award modernisation process.

## 5  Variations to deal with minor problems attributable to award modernisation starting before enactment of FW Act

(1)        If FWA considers that there is a minor or technical problem with a modern award that is attributable to the fact that the Part 10A award modernisation process started before the enactment of the FW Act, FWA may make a determination varying the modern award to resolve the problem.

_Note:       Certain modern awards may, for example, contain references to concepts or provisions that are not consistent with the FW Act as enacted. This variation power allows FWA to fix such references._

(2)        FWA may make the determination:

                     (a)  on its own initiative; or

                     (b)  on application by an employer, employee, organisation or outworker entity covered by the modern award; or

                     (c)  on application by an organisation that is entitled to represent the industrial interests of one or more employers or employees that are covered by the modern award; or

                     (d)  if the variation is of outworker terms in the modern award—on application by an organisation that is entitled to represent the industrial interests of one or more outworkers to whom the terms relate.

## 6  Review of all modern awards (other than modern enterprise awards and State reference public sector modern awards) after first 2 years

(1)        As soon as practicable after the second anniversary of the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day, FWA must conduct a review of all modern awards, other than modern enterprise awards and State reference public sector modern awards.

_Note:       The review required by this item is in addition to the annual wage reviews and 4 yearly reviews of modern awards that FWA is required to conduct under the FW Act._

(2)        In the review, FWA must consider whether the modern awards:

                     (a)  achieve the modern awards objective; and

                     (b)  are operating effectively, without anomalies or technical problems arising from the Part 10A award modernisation process.

(2A)     The review must be such that each modern award is reviewed in its own right. However, this does not prevent FWA from reviewing 2 or more modern awards at the same time.

(3)        FWA may make a determination varying any of the modern awards in any way that FWA considers appropriate to remedy any issues identified in the review.

_Note:       Any variation of a modern award must comply with the requirements of the FW Act relating to the content of modern awards (see Subdivision A of Division 3 of Part 2-3 of the FW Act)._

(4)        The modern awards objective applies to FWA making a variation under this item, and the minimum wages objective also applies if the variation relates to modern award minimum wages.

(5)        FWA may advise persons or bodies about the review in any way FWA considers appropriate.

(6)        Section 625 of the FW Act (which deals with delegation by the President of functions and powers of FWA) has effect as if subsection (2) of that section included a reference to FWA’s powers under subitem (5).

## 7  Review of transitional arrangements included in modern awards

(1)        If:

                     (a)  a modern award includes terms (**_review terms_**) under which FWA may review transitional arrangements included in the award; and

                     (b)  the review terms, and the transitional arrangements, were included in the award in the Part 10A award modernisation process;

FWA may:

                     (c)  review the award in accordance with the review terms; and

                     (d)  make a determination varying the award in any way it considers necessary, having regard to that review.

_Note:       Any variation of the modern award must comply with the requirements of the FW Act relating to the content of modern awards (see Subdivision A of Division 3 of Part 2-3 of the FW Act)._

(2)        The review terms are taken to be terms that are permitted to be included in the modern award by Subdivision B of Division 3 of Part 2-3 of the FW Act.

<h7 class="ActHead7">Part 3—Avoiding reductions in take-home pay</h7>

## 8  Part 10A award modernisation process is not intended to result in reduction in take-home pay

(1)        The Part 10A award modernisation process is not intended to result in a reduction in the take-home pay of employees or outworkers.

(2)        An employee’s or outworker’s **_take-home pay_** is the pay an employee or outworker actually receives:

                     (a)  including wages and incentive-based payments, and additional amounts such as allowances and overtime; but

                     (b)  disregarding the effect of any deductions that are made as permitted by section 324 of the FW Act.

_Note:       Deductions permitted by section 324 of the FW Act may (for example) include deductions under salary sacrificing arrangements._

(3)        An employee suffers a **_modernisation-related reduction in take-home pay_** if, and only if:

                     (a)  a modern award made in the Part 10A award modernisation process starts to apply to the employee when the award comes into operation; and

                     (b)  the employee is employed in the same position as (or a position that is comparable to) the position he or she was employed in immediately before the modern award came into operation; and

                     (c)  the amount of the employee’s take-home pay for working particular hours or for a particular quantity of work after the modern award comes into operation is less than what would have been the employee’s take-home pay for those hours or that quantity of work immediately before the award came into operation; and

                     (d)  that reduction in the employee’s take-home pay is attributable to the Part 10A award modernisation process.

(4)        An outworker who is not an employee suffers a **_modernisation-related reduction in take-home pay_** if, and only if:

                     (a)  when a modern award that contains outworker terms comes into operation, the outworker is a person to whom outworker terms in the modern award relate; and

                     (b)  the outworker is performing the same work as (or work that is similar to) the work he or she was performing immediately before the modern award came into operation; and

                     (c)  the amount of the outworker’s take-home pay for working particular hours or for a particular quantity of work after the modern award comes into operation is less than what would have been the outworker’s take-home pay for those hours or that quantity of work immediately before the award came into operation; and

                     (d)  that reduction in the outworker’s take-home pay is attributable to the Part 10A award modernisation process.

## 9  Orders remedying reductions in take-home pay

Employees

(1)        If FWA is satisfied that an employee, or a class of employees, to whom a modern award applies has suffered a modernisation-related reduction in take-home pay, FWA may make any order (a **_take-home pay order_**) requiring, or relating to, the payment of an amount or amounts to the employee or employees that FWA considers appropriate to remedy the situation.

Outworkers

(2)        If FWA is satisfied that an outworker, or a class of outworkers, to whom outworker terms in a modern award relate has suffered a modernisation-related reduction in take-home pay, FWA may make any order (a **_take-home pay order_**) requiring, or relating to, the payment of an amount or amounts to the outworker or outworkers that FWA considers appropriate to remedy the situation.

General provisions

(3)        FWA may make a take-home pay order only on application by:

                     (a)  an employee or outworker who has suffered a modernisation-related reduction in take-home pay; or

                     (b)  an organisation that is entitled to represent the industrial interests of such an employee or outworker; or

                     (c)  a person acting on behalf of a class of such employees or outworkers.

(4)        If FWA is satisfied that an application for a take-home pay order has already been made in relation to an employee or a class of employees, or an outworker or a class of outworkers, FWA may dismiss any later application that is made under these provisions in relation to the same employee or employees, or the same outworker or outworkers.

## 10  Ensuring that take-home pay orders are confined to the circumstances for which they are needed

(1)        FWA must not make a take-home pay order in relation to an employee or class of employees, or an outworker or a class of outworkers, if:

                     (a)  FWA considers that the modernisation-related reduction in take-home pay is minor or insignificant; or

                     (b)  FWA is satisfied that the employee or employees, or outworker or outworkers, have been adequately compensated in other ways for the reduction.

(2)        FWA must ensure that a take-home pay order is expressed so that:

                     (a)  it does not apply to an employee or outworker unless the employee or outworker has actually suffered a modernisation-related reduction in take-home pay; and

                     (b)  if the take-home pay payable to the employee or outworker under the modern award increases after the order is made, there is a corresponding reduction in any amount payable to the employee or outworker under the order.

## 11  Take-home pay order continues to have effect so long as modern award continues to cover the employee or employees

A take-home pay order made in relation to an employee or class of employees to whom a particular modern award applies continues to have effect in relation to those employees (subject to the terms of the order) for so long as the modern award continues to cover the employee or employees, even if it stops applying to the employee or employees because an enterprise agreement starts to apply.

## 12  Inconsistency with modern awards and enterprise agreements

A term of a modern award or an enterprise agreement has no effect in relation to an employee or outworker to the extent that it is less beneficial to the employee or outworker than a term of a take-home pay order that applies to the employee or outworker.

## 13  Application of provisions of FW Act to take-home pay orders

The FW Act applies as if the following provisions of that Act included a reference to a take-home pay order:

                     (a)  subsection 675(2);

                     (b)  subsection 706(2).

_Note:       For compliance with take-home pay orders, see item 7 of Schedule 16._

                     (b)  if the State award had continued to have effect in relation to employees, a notional agreement preserving State awards to which subitem (2B) applies would have been taken to come into operation in relation to those employees.

## 3  Meaning of _single enterprise_ and _part of a single enterprise_

(1)        A **_single enterprise_** is:

                     (a)  a business, project or undertaking that is carried on by an employer; or

                     (b)  the activities carried on by:

                              (i)  the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; or

                             (ii)  a body, association, office or other entity established for a public purpose by or under a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; or

                            (iii)  any other body in which the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory has a controlling interest.

(2)        For the purposes of subitem (1), if 2 or more employers carry on a business, project or undertaking as a joint venture or common enterprise, the employers are taken to be one employer.

(3)        For the purposes of subitem (1), if 2 or more related bodies corporate each carry on a single enterprise:

                     (a)  the bodies corporate are taken to be one employer; and

                     (b)  the single enterprises are taken to be one single enterprise.

_Note:       However, an enterprise instrument or a modern enterprise award could just relate to a part of that single enterprise._

(4)        A **_part of a single enterprise_** includes, for example:

                     (a)  a geographically distinct part of the single enterprise; or

                     (b)  a distinct operational or organisational unit within the single enterprise.

<h8 class="ActHead8">Division 2—The enterprise instrument modernisation process</h8>

## 4  The enterprise instrument modernisation process

(1)        The **_enterprise instrument modernisation process_** is the process of making modern awards under this Division to replace enterprise instruments.

(2)        On application, FWA may make a modern award (a **_modern enterprise award_**) to replace an enterprise instrument.

(3)        The application may be made only:

                     (a)  by a person covered by the enterprise instrument; and

                     (b)  during the period starting on the WR Act repeal day and ending at the end of 31 December 2013.

(4)        A modern enterprise award must be made by a Full Bench.

(5)        In deciding whether or not to make a modern enterprise award, and in determining the content of that award, FWA must take into account the following:

                     (a)  the circumstances that led to the making of the enterprise instrument rather than an instrument of more general application;

                     (b)  whether there is a modern award (other than the miscellaneous modern award) that would, but for the enterprise instrument, cover the persons who are covered by the instrument, or whether such a modern award is likely to be made in the Part 10A award modernisation process;

                     (c)  the content, or likely content, of the modern award referred to in paragraph (b) (taking account of any variations of the modern award that are likely to be made in the Part 10A award modernisation process);

                     (d)  the terms and conditions of employment applying in the industry in which the persons covered by the enterprise instrument operate, and the extent to which those terms and conditions are reflected in the instrument;

                     (e)  the extent to which the enterprise instrument provides enterprise-specific terms and conditions of employment;

                      (f)  the likely impact on the persons covered by the enterprise instrument, and the persons covered by the modern award referred to in paragraph (b), of a decision to make, or not make, the modern enterprise award, including any impact on the ongoing viability or competitiveness of any enterprise carried on by those persons;

                     (g)  the views of the persons covered by the enterprise instrument;

                     (h)  any other matter prescribed by the regulations.

_Note:       A variation referred to in paragraph (c) may, for example, be a variation to reflect the outcome of the AFPC’s final wage review under the WR Act, or to include transitional arrangements in the modern award._

(5A)     If FWA makes a modern enterprise award before the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day, the modern enterprise award must not be expressed to commence on a day earlier than the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day.

_Note:       For when a modern enterprise award is in operation, see item 17._

(6)        The regulations may deal with other matters relating to the enterprise instrument modernisation process.

## 5  Enterprise instruments: termination by FWA

(1)        A person covered by an enterprise instrument may apply to FWA for FWA to terminate the instrument.

(2)        The application may be made only during the period starting on the WR Act repeal day and ending at the end of 31 December 2013.

(3)        If an application for FWA to terminate the enterprise instrument is made under subitem (1), FWA may:

                     (a)  terminate the enterprise instrument; or

                     (b)  decide that the enterprise instrument should not be terminated; or

                     (c)  decide to treat the application as if it were an application under item 4.

(4)        In making a decision under subitem (3), FWA must take into account the following:

                     (a)  the circumstances that led to the making of the enterprise instrument rather than an instrument of more general application;

                     (b)  whether there is a modern award (other than the miscellaneous modern award) that would, but for the enterprise instrument, cover the persons who are covered by the instrument, or whether such a modern award is likely to be made in the Part 10A award modernisation process;

                     (c)  the content, or likely content, of the modern award referred to in paragraph (b) (taking account of any variations of the modern award that are likely to be made in the Part 10A award modernisation process);

                     (d)  the terms and conditions of employment applying in the industry in which the persons covered by the enterprise instrument operate, and the extent to which those terms and conditions are reflected in the instrument;

                     (e)  the extent to which the enterprise instrument provides enterprise-specific terms and conditions of employment;

                      (f)  the likely impact on the persons covered by the enterprise instrument, and the persons covered by the modern award referred to in paragraph (b), of a decision to terminate, or not terminate, the enterprise instrument, including any impact on the ongoing viability or competitiveness of any enterprise carried on by those persons;

                     (g)  the views of the persons covered by the enterprise instrument;

                     (h)  any other matter prescribed by the regulations.

_Note:       A variation referred to in paragraph (c) may, for example, be a variation to reflect the outcome of the AFPC’s final wage review under the WR Act, or to include transitional arrangements in the modern award._

(5)        If FWA terminates the enterprise instrument, the termination operates from the day specified in the decision to terminate the instrument, being a day that is not earlier than the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day.

## 6  The modern enterprise awards objective

(1)        The modern awards objective and the minimum wages objective apply to FWA making a modern enterprise award under this Division.

(2)        However, in applying the modern awards objective and the minimum wages objective, FWA must recognise that modern enterprise awards may provide terms and conditions tailored to reflect employment arrangements that have been developed in relation to the relevant enterprises. This is the **_modern enterprise awards objective_**.

_Note 1:    See also item 11 (enterprise instrument modernisation process is not intended to result in reduction in take-home pay)._

_Note 2:    See also item 16A (how the FW Act applies to the enterprise instrument modernisation process before the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day)._

## 7  Terms of modern enterprise awards

(1)        Subject to this item and item 8, Division 3 of Part 2-3 of the FW Act (which deals with terms of modern awards) applies in relation to a modern enterprise award made under this Division.

_Note:       See also item 16A (how the FW Act applies to the enterprise instrument modernisation process before the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day)._

Increases in entitlements

(2)        If the making of a modern enterprise award results in an increase in an employee’s entitlements, the modern enterprise award may provide for the increases to take effect in stages.

Industry-specific redundancy schemes

(3)        If a modern award includes an industry-specific redundancy scheme in relation to a particular industry, and FWA makes a modern enterprise award that covers persons who operate in that industry, FWA may include the industry-specific redundancy scheme in the modern enterprise award.

## 8  Coverage terms

Coverage terms must be included

(1)        A modern enterprise award must include terms (**_coverage terms_**) setting out, in accordance with this item:

                     (a)  the enterprise or enterprises to which the modern enterprise award relates; and

                     (b)  the employer or employers, employees and organisations that are covered by the modern enterprise award.

Enterprises

(2)        A modern enterprise award must be expressed to relate:

                     (a)  to a single enterprise (or a part of a single enterprise) only; or

                     (b)  to one or more enterprises, but only if the employers all carry on similar business activities under the same franchise and are:

                              (i)  franchisees of the same franchisor; or

                             (ii)  related bodies corporate of the same franchisor; or

                            (iii)  any combination of the above.

Employers and employees

(3)        A modern enterprise award must be expressed to cover:

                     (a)  a specified employer that carries on, or specified employers that carry on, the enterprise or enterprises referred to in subitem (2); and

                     (b)  specified employees of the employer or employers covered by the modern enterprise award.

Organisations

(4)        A modern enterprise award may be expressed to cover one or more specified organisations, in relation to:

                     (a)  all or specified employees covered by the award; or

                     (b)  the employer, or all or specified employers, covered by the award.

Outworker entities

(5)        A modern enterprise award must not be expressed to cover outworker entities.

How coverage etc. is expressed

(6)        For the purposes of subitem (2), an enterprise must be specified:

                     (a)  if paragraph (2)(a) applies to the enterprise—by name; or

                     (b)  if paragraph (2)(b) applies to the enterprise—by name, or by the name of the franchise.

(7)        For the purposes of subitems (3) and (4):

(a)  an employer or employers may be specified by name or by inclusion in a specified class or specified classes; and

                     (b)  employees must be specified by inclusion in a specified class or specified classes; and

                     (c)  organisations must be specified by name.

Employees not traditionally covered by awards etc.

(8)        A modern enterprise award must not be expressed to cover classes of employees:

                     (a)  who, because of the nature or seniority of their role, have traditionally not been covered by awards (whether made under laws of the Commonwealth or the States); or

                     (b)  who perform work that is not of a similar nature to work that has traditionally been regulated by such awards.

_Note:       For example, in some industries, managerial employees have traditionally not been covered by awards._

## 9  Variation and termination of certain transitional instruments etc. to take account of enterprise instrument modernisation process

(1)        If FWA makes a modern enterprise award to replace an enterprise preserved collective State agreement, the agreement terminates when the modern award comes into operation.

(2)        FWA must, as soon as practicable after a modern enterprise award that is made to replace an enterprise instrument comes into operation:

                     (a)  terminate the enterprise instrument (if it has not already terminated under subitem (1)); and

                     (b)  vary or terminate (as appropriate) any of the following (**_modernisable instruments_**):

                              (i)  other award-based transitional instruments;

                             (ii)  transitional APCSs;

                            so that employees who were covered by the enterprise instrument are no longer covered by those modernisable instruments.

_Note 1:    The main provisions about transitional instruments are in Schedule 3, and the main provisions about transitional APCSs are in Schedule 9._

_Note 2:    This item does not limit the effect of any other provision of this Act under which a modernisable instrument ceases to cover a person from a time earlier than when the instrument is terminated or varied under this item._

(3)        If FWA decides not to make a modern enterprise award to replace an enterprise instrument, the instrument terminates when that decision comes into operation.

(3A)     Despite subitem (3), if, before the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day, FWA makes a decision not to make a modern enterprise award to replace an enterprise instrument, the decision must not come into operation before the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day.

(4)        If, by the end of the period specified in paragraph 4(3)(b), no application under item 4 or 5 has been made in relation to an enterprise instrument, the instrument terminates at the end of that period.

(5)        As soon as practicable after all modern enterprise awards made in the enterprise instrument modernisation process have come into operation, FWA must terminate any remaining modernisable instruments.

## 10  Notification of the cut-off for the enterprise instrument modernisation process

(1)        FWA must, at least 6 months before the end of the period specified in paragraph 4(3)(b), advise any persons still covered by an enterprise instrument:

                     (a)  that the period for making applications under items 4 and 5 ends on 31 December 2013; and

                     (b)  of the consequences for the enterprise instrument if an application in relation to the instrument is not made.

(2)        FWA may give that advice by any means it considers appropriate.

(3)        Section 625 of the FW Act (which deals with delegation by the President of functions and powers of FWA) has effect as if subsection (2) of that section included a reference to FWA’s functions and powers under this item.

<h8 class="ActHead8">Division 3—Avoiding reductions in take-home pay</h8>

## 11  Enterprise instrument modernisation process is not intended to result in reduction in take-home pay

(1)        The enterprise instrument modernisation process is not intended to result in a reduction in the take-home pay of employees.

(2)        An employee’s **_take-home pay_** is the pay an employee actually receives:

                     (a)  including wages and incentive-based payments, and additional amounts such as allowances and overtime; but

                     (b)  disregarding the effect of any deductions that are made as permitted by section 324 of the FW Act.

_Note:       Deductions permitted by section 324 of the FW Act may (for example) include deductions under salary sacrificing arrangements._

(3)        An employee suffers a **_modernisation-related reduction in take-home pay_** if, and only if:

                     (a)  a modern enterprise award made in the enterprise instrument modernisation process starts to apply to the employee when the award comes into operation; and

                     (b)  the employee is employed in the same position as (or a position that is comparable to) the position he or she was employed in immediately before the modern enterprise award came into operation; and

                     (c)  the amount of the employee’s take-home pay for working particular hours or for a particular quantity of work after the modern enterprise award comes into operation is less than what would have been the employee’s take-home pay for those hours or that quantity of work immediately before the award came into operation; and

                     (d)  that reduction in the employee’s take-home pay is attributable to the enterprise instrument modernisation process.

## 12  Orders remedying reductions in take-home pay

(1)        If FWA is satisfied that an employee, or a class of employees, to whom a modern enterprise award applies has suffered a modernisation-related reduction in take-home pay, FWA may make any order (a **_take-home pay order_**) requiring, or relating to, the payment of an amount or amounts to the employee or employees that FWA considers appropriate to remedy the situation.

(2)        FWA may make a take-home pay order only on application by:

                     (a)  an employee who has suffered a modernisation-related reduction in take-home pay; or

                     (b)  an organisation that is entitled to represent the industrial interests of such an employee; or

                     (c)  a person acting on behalf of a class of such employees.

(3)        If FWA is satisfied that an application for a take-home pay order has already been made in relation to an employee or a class of employees, FWA may dismiss any later application that is made under these provisions in relation to the same employee or employees.

## 13  Ensuring that take-home pay orders are confined to the circumstances for which they are needed

(1)        FWA must not make a take-home pay order in relation to an employee or class of employees if:

                     (a)  FWA considers that the modernisation-related reduction in take-home pay is minor or insignificant; or

                     (b)  FWA is satisfied that the employee or employees have been adequately compensated in other ways for the reduction.

(2)        FWA must ensure that a take-home pay order is expressed so that:

                     (a)  it does not apply to an employee unless the employee has actually suffered a modernisation-related reduction in take-home pay; and

                     (b)  if the take-home pay payable to the employee under the modern enterprise award increases after the order is made, there is a corresponding reduction in any amount payable to the employee under the order.

## 14  Take-home pay order continues to have effect so long as modern enterprise award continues to cover the employee or employees

A take-home pay order made in relation to an employee or class of employees to whom a particular modern enterprise award applies continues to have effect in relation to those employees (subject to the terms of the order) for so long as the modern enterprise award continues to cover the employee or employees, even if it stops applying to the employee or employees because an enterprise agreement starts to apply.

## 15  Inconsistency with modern enterprise awards and enterprise agreements

A term of a modern enterprise award or an enterprise agreement has no effect in relation to an employee to the extent that it is less beneficial to the employee than a term of a take-home pay order that applies to the employee.

## 16  Application of provisions of FW Act to take-home pay orders

The FW Act applies as if the following provisions of that Act included a reference to a take-home pay order:

                     (a)  subsection 675(2);

                     (b)  subsection 706(2).

_Note:       For compliance with take-home pay orders, see item 7 of Schedule 16._

<h8 class="ActHead8">Division 4—Application of the FW Act</h8>

## 16A  How the FW Act applies to the modernisation process before the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day

For the purposes of making a modern enterprise award before the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day, the following provisions of the FW Act apply as if they had already commenced:

                     (a)  Part 2-2 (which deals with the National Employment Standards);

                     (b)  section 134 (which deals with the modern awards objective);

                     (c)  Division 3 of Part 2-3 (which deals with terms of modern awards);

                     (d)  section 284 (which deals with the minimum wages objective);

                     (e)  any provisions that are necessary for the effectual operation of the provisions referred to in paragraphs (a) to (d).

## 17  How the FW Act applies to modern awards made in the enterprise instrument modernisation process

(1)        A modern enterprise award made under Division 2 is, for the purposes of the FW Act (and any other law), taken to be a modern award (being a modern enterprise award) within the meaning of that Act from the day on which the modern enterprise award is made.

(2)        Section 49 of the FW Act does not apply for the purpose of determining when the modern enterprise award comes into operation. Instead, the modern enterprise award comes into operation on the day on which it is expressed to commence, being a day that is not earlier than the day on which the modern enterprise award is made.

(3)        The regulations may deal with other matters relating to how the FW Act applies in relation to modern enterprise awards.

Note:          For example, in some industries, managerial employees have traditionally not been covered by awards.

## 27  At the end of Part 2-3

Add:

### Division 7—Additional provisions relating to modern enterprise awards

##### <a id="168A"></a>168A  Modern enterprise awards

             (1)  This Division contains additional provisions that relate to modern enterprise awards. The provisions in this Division have effect despite anything else in this Part.

             (2)  A **_modern enterprise award_** is a modern award that is expressed to relate to:

                     (a)  a single enterprise (or a part of a single enterprise) only; or

                     (b)  one or more enterprises, if the employers all carry on similar business activities under the same franchise and are:

                              (i)  franchisees of the same franchisor; or

                             (ii)  related bodies corporate of the same franchisor; or

                            (iii)  any combination of the above.

             (3)  A **_single enterprise_** is:

                     (a)  a business, project or undertaking that is carried on by an employer; or

                     (b)  the activities carried on by:

                              (i)  the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; or

                             (ii)  a body, association, office or other entity established for a public purpose by or under a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; or

                            (iii)  any other body in which the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory has a controlling interest.

             (4)  For the purposes of subsection (3), if 2 or more employers carry on a business, project or undertaking as a joint venture or common enterprise, the employers are taken to be one employer.

             (5)  For the purposes of subsection (3), if 2 or more related bodies corporate each carry on a single enterprise:

                     (a)  the bodies corporate are taken to be one employer; and

                     (b)  the single enterprises are taken to be one single enterprise.

Note:          However, a modern enterprise award could just relate to a part of that single enterprise.

             (6)  A **_part of a single enterprise_** includes, for example:

                     (a)  a geographically distinct part of the single enterprise; or

                     (b)  a distinct operational or organisational unit within the single enterprise.

##### <a id="168B"></a>168B  The modern enterprise awards objective

What is the modern enterprise awards objective?

             (1)  FWA must recognise that modern enterprise awards may provide terms and conditions tailored to reflect employment arrangements that have been developed in relation to the relevant enterprises. This is the **_modern enterprise awards objective_**.

When does the modern enterprise awards objective apply?

             (2)  The modern enterprise awards objective applies to the performance of FWA’s functions or powers under this Act, so far as they relate to modern enterprise awards.

References to the modern awards objective

             (3)  A reference to the modern awards objective in this Act, other than section 134, is taken to include a reference to the modern enterprise awards objective.

##### <a id="168C"></a>168C  Rules about making and revoking modern enterprise awards

Making modern enterprise awards

             (1)  FWA must not, under this Part:

                     (a)  make a modern enterprise award; or

                     (b)  make a determination varying a modern award so that it becomes a modern enterprise award.

Note:          Modern enterprise awards can be made only in accordance with the enterprise instrument modernisation process provided for by Part 2 of Schedule 6 of the _Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 2009_.

Revoking modern enterprise awards

             (2)  FWA may make a determination revoking a modern enterprise award only on application under section 158.

             (3)  FWA must not make a determination revoking a modern enterprise award unless FWA is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the award is obsolete or no longer capable of operating; or

                     (b)  all the employees covered by the award will, when the revocation comes into operation, be covered by a different modern award (other than the miscellaneous modern award or a modern enterprise award) that is appropriate for them.

             (4)  In deciding whether to make a determination revoking a modern enterprise award FWA must take into account the following:

                     (a)  the circumstances that led to the making of the modern enterprise award;

                     (b)  the content of the modern award referred to in paragraph (3)(b);

                     (c)  the terms and conditions of employment applying in the industry in which the persons covered by the modern enterprise award operate, and the extent to which those terms and conditions are reflected in the modern enterprise award;

                     (d)  the extent to which the modern enterprise award provides enterprise-specific terms and conditions of employment;

                     (e)  the likely impact on the persons covered by the modern enterprise award, and the persons covered by the modern award referred to in paragraph (3)(b), of a decision to revoke, or not revoke, the modern enterprise award, including any impact on the ongoing viability or competitiveness of any enterprise carried on by those persons;

                      (f)  the views of the persons covered by the modern enterprise award;

                     (g)  any other matter prescribed by the regulations.

##### <a id="168D"></a>168D  Rules about changing coverage of modern enterprise awards

             (1)  FWA must not make a determination varying a modern enterprise award so as to extend the coverage of the modern enterprise award so that it ceases to be a modern enterprise award.

             (2)  In deciding whether to make a determination varying the coverage of a modern enterprise award in some other way, FWA must take into account the following:

                     (a)  the circumstances that led to the making of the modern enterprise award;

                     (b)  whether there is a modern award (other than the miscellaneous modern award or a modern enterprise award) that would, but for the modern enterprise award, cover the persons covered, or proposed to be covered, by the modern enterprise award;

                     (c)  the content of the modern award referred to in paragraph (b);

                     (d)  the terms and conditions of employment applying in the industry in which the persons covered, or proposed to be covered, by the modern award operate, and the extent to which those terms and conditions are reflected in the modern enterprise award;

                     (e)  the extent to which the modern enterprise award provides enterprise-specific terms and conditions of employment;

                      (f)  the likely impact on the persons covered, or proposed to be covered, by the modern enterprise award, and the persons covered by the modern award referred to in paragraph (b), of a decision to make, or not make, the variation, including any impact on the ongoing viability or competitiveness of any enterprise carried on by those persons;

                     (g)  the views of the persons covered, or proposed to be covered, by the modern enterprise award;

                     (h)  any other matter prescribed by the regulations.

## 28  Subsection 292(1)

Repeal the subsection, substitute:

             (1)  If FWA makes one or more determinations varying modern award minimum wages in an annual wage review, FWA must publish the rates of those wages as so varied:

                     (a)  for wages in a modern award (other than a modern enterprise award)—before 1 July in the next financial year; and

                     (b)  for wages in a modern enterprise award—as soon as practicable.

Note:          FWA must also publish the modern award as varied (see section 168).

_Note:       The heading to section 292 is altered by omitting “by 1 July”._

###### Schedule 6A—State reference public sector modern awards

<h7 class="ActHead7">Part 1—Preliminary</h7>

## 1  Meanings of _employer_ and _employee_

In this Schedule, **_employer_** and **_employee_** have their ordinary meanings.

<h7 class="ActHead7">Part 2—The State reference public sector transitional award modernisation process</h7>

<h8 class="ActHead8">Division 1—State reference public sector transitional awards</h8>

## 2  State reference public sector transitional awards

(1)        A **_State reference public sector transitional award_** is a State reference transitional award or common rule in relation to which the following conditions are satisfied:

                     (a)  the only employers that are expressed to be covered by the award or common rule are one or more specified State reference public sector employers;

                     (b)  the only employees who are expressed to be covered by the award or common rule are specified State reference public sector employees of those employers.

_Note:       State reference transitional awards and common rules are continued in existence as transitional instruments by Schedule 3._

(2)        A **_State reference public sector employee_** is a State reference employee who is a State public sector employee as defined in section 30A of the FW Act.

(3)        A **_State reference public sector employer_** is a State reference employer that is a State public sector employer as defined in section 30A of the FW Act.

(4)        If:

                     (a)  a State reference transitional award or common rule (the **_current award_**) covers one or more State reference public sector employers, and State reference public sector employees of those employers; and

                     (b)  the current award also covers:

                              (i)  other employees of those employers; or

                             (ii)  other employers, and employees of those other employers;

then, for the purposes of this Act, the current award is taken instead to constitute 2 separate State reference transitional awards or common rules as follows:

                     (c)  a State reference public sector transitional award covering:

                              (i)  the employers, and the employees of those employers, referred to in paragraph (a); and

                             (ii)  if the current award covers an organisation, in relation to certain employers or employees referred to in paragraph (a)—that organisation in relation to those employers or employees; and

                     (d)  a State reference transitional award or a State reference common rule (as the case requires) covering:

                              (i)  the employers, and the employees of those employers, referred to in paragraph (b); and

                             (ii)  if the current award covers an organisation, in relation to certain employers or employees referred to in paragraph (b)—that organisation in relation to those employers or employees.

<h8 class="ActHead8">Division 2—The State reference public sector transitional award modernisation process</h8>

## 3  The State reference public sector transitional award modernisation process

(1)        The **_State reference public sector transitional award modernisation process_** is the process of making State reference public sector modern awards under this Division covering employers, employees and organisations that are covered by State reference public sector transitional awards.

(2)        A **_State reference public sector modern award_** is a modern award in relation to which the following conditions are satisfied:

                     (a)  the only employers that are expressed to be covered by the modern award are one or more specified State reference public sector employers;

                     (b)  the only employees who are expressed to be covered by the modern award are specified State reference public sector employees of those employers.

(3)        A State reference public sector modern award must be made by a Full Bench.

## 4  Making State reference public sector modern awards on application

(1)        An employer or organisation that is covered by a State reference public sector transitional award (the **_current award_**) may apply to FWA for the making of a State reference public sector modern award (the **_proposed award_**).

(2)        The application may be made only during the period starting on the WR Act repeal day and ending at the end of 31 December 2013.

(3)        The application must specify the employers, employees and organisations (the **_proposed parties_**) proposed to be covered by the proposed award.

(4)        FWA must consider the application, and must make a State reference public sector modern award covering the proposed parties if FWA is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the proposed parties are covered by State reference public sector transitional awards; and

                     (b)  the employers and organisations that are proposed parties have agreed to the making of the application.

_Note:       The proposed parties will cease to be covered by State reference public sector transitional awards when the State reference public sector modern award comes into operation: see item 29 of Schedule 3._

## 5  Terminating State reference public sector transitional awards on application

(1)        An employer or organisation that is covered by a State reference public sector transitional award (the **_current award_**) may apply to FWA to terminate the current award.

(2)        The application may be made only during the period starting on the WR Act repeal day and ending at the end of 31 December 2013.

(3)        FWA must not terminate the current award unless FWA is satisfied that the employees who are covered by the current award will, if the current award is terminated, be covered by a modern award (other than the miscellaneous modern award) that is in operation and that is appropriate for them.

(4)        In deciding whether to terminate the current award, FWA must take into account the following:

                     (a)  the circumstances that led to the making of the current award;

                     (b)  the terms and conditions of employment applying in the industry or occupation in which the persons covered by the current award operate, and the extent to which those terms and conditions are reflected in the current award;

                     (c)  the extent to which the current award facilitates arrangements, and provides terms and conditions of employment, referred to in paragraphs 7(2)(a) and (b);

                     (d)  the likely impact on the persons covered by the current award of a decision to terminate, or not to terminate, the current award;

                     (e)  the views of the persons covered by the current award;

                      (f)  any other matter prescribed by the regulations.

(5)        If FWA terminates the current award, the termination operates from the day specified in the decision to terminate the current award, being a day that is not earlier than the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day.

## 6  Further obligation of FWA to make or vary State reference public sector modern awards at end of application period

If, at the end of the period referred to in subitem 4(2), there are one or more State reference public sector transitional awards that still cover some employers and employees, FWA must make, or (in accordance with section 168L of the FW Act) vary the coverage of, one or more State reference public sector modern awards so that all those employers and employees are covered by State reference public sector modern awards.

_Note:       The employers and employees will cease to be covered by the State reference public sector transitional awards when they start to be covered by a State reference public sector modern award that is in operation: see item 29 of Schedule 3._

## 7  The State reference public sector modern awards objective

(1)        If FWA is required by item 4 or 6 to make a State reference public sector modern award, the modern awards objective and the minimum wages objective apply to the making of the modern award.

(2)        However, in applying the modern awards objective and the minimum wages objective, FWA must recognise:

                     (a)  the need to facilitate arrangements for State reference public sector employers and State reference public sector employees that are appropriately adapted to the effective administration of a State; and

                     (b)  that State reference public sector modern awards may provide terms and conditions tailored to reflect employment arrangements that have been developed in relation to State reference public sector employers and State reference public sector employees.

This is the **_State reference public sector modern awards objective_**.

_Note 1:    See also item 13 (State reference public sector transitional award modernisation process is not intended to result in reduction in take-home pay)._

_Note 2:    See also item 19 (how the FW Act applies in relation to the State reference public sector transitional award modernisation process before the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day)._

## 8  Terms of State reference public sector modern awards

(1)        Division 3 (other than sections 143 and 154) of Part 2-3 of the FW Act (which deals with terms of modern awards) applies in relation to a State reference public sector modern award made under this Division.

_Note:       See also item 19 (how the FW Act applies in relation to the State reference public sector transitional award modernisation process before the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day)._

(2)        If FWA makes a State reference public sector modern award before the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day, the State reference public sector modern award must not be expressed to commence on a day earlier than the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day.

## 9  Coverage terms

Coverage terms must be included

(1)        A State reference public sector modern award must include terms (**_coverage terms_**) setting out, in accordance with this item, the employers, employees and organisations that are covered by the State reference public sector modern award.

Employers and employees

(2)        The coverage terms must be such that:

                     (a)  the only employers that are expressed to be covered by the modern award are one or more specified State reference public sector employers; and

                     (b)  the only employees who are expressed to be covered by the modern award are specified State reference public sector employees of those employers.

Organisations

(3)        A State reference public sector modern award may be expressed to cover one or more specified organisations, in relation to:

                     (a)  all or specified employees covered by the modern award; or

                     (b)  the employer, or all or specified employers, covered by the modern award.

Outworker entities

(4)        A State reference public sector modern award must not be expressed to cover outworker entities.

How coverage etc. is expressed

(5)        For the purposes of this item:

(a)  an employer or employers may be specified by name or by inclusion in a specified class or specified classes; and

                     (b)  employees must be specified by inclusion in a specified class or specified classes; and

                     (c)  organisations must be specified by name.

## 10  Variation and termination of State reference public sector transitional awards to take account of the modernisation process

(1)        If a State reference public sector modern award completely replaces a State reference public sector transitional award, the transitional award terminates when the modern award comes into operation.

(2)        If a State reference public sector modern award partially replaces a State reference public sector transitional award, FWA must, as soon as practicable after the modern award comes into operation, vary the transitional award so that employees who are covered by the modern award are no longer covered by the transitional award.

(3)        For the purposes of this item:

                     (a)  the modern award **_completely replaces_** the transitional award if all the employees who are covered by the transitional award become covered by the modern award when it comes into operation; and

                     (b)  the modern award **_partially replaces_** the transitional award if only some of the employees who are covered by the transitional award become covered by the modern award when it comes into operation.

_Note:       This item does not limit the effect of any other provision of this Act under which a transitional instrument (a State reference public sector transitional award is a transitional instrument) ceases to cover a person from a time earlier than when the instrument is terminated or varied under this item._

## 11  Notification of the cut-off for the State reference public sector transitional award modernisation process

(1)        FWA must, at least 6 months before the end of the period specified in subitem 4(2), advise any persons still covered by a State reference public sector transitional award:

                     (a)  that the period for making applications under items 4 and 5 ends on 31 December 2013; and

                     (b)  that FWA will, at the end of that period, commence the State reference public sector transitional award modernisation process in relation to the transitional award for any employees and employers who are still covered by the transitional award at that time.

(2)        FWA may give that advice by any means it considers appropriate.

(3)        Section 625 of the FW Act (which deals with delegation by the President of functions and powers of FWA) has effect as if subsection (2) of that section included a reference to FWA’s functions and powers under this item.

## 12  Regulations dealing with other matters

The regulations may deal with other matters relating to the State reference public sector transitional award modernisation process.

<h8 class="ActHead8">Division 3—Avoiding reductions in take-home pay</h8>

## 13  State reference public sector transitional award modernisation process is not intended to result in reduction in take-home pay

(1)        The State reference public sector transitional award modernisation process is not intended to result in a reduction in the take-home pay of employees.

(2)        An employee’s **_take-home pay_** is the pay an employee actually receives:

                     (a)  including wages and incentive-based payments, and additional amounts such as allowances and overtime; but

                     (b)  disregarding the effect of any deductions that are made as permitted by section 324 of the FW Act.

_Note:       Deductions permitted by section 324 of the FW Act may (for example) include deductions under salary sacrificing arrangements._

(3)        An employee suffers a **_modernisation-related reduction in take-home pay_** if, and only if:

                     (a)  a State reference public sector modern award made in the State reference public sector transitional award modernisation process starts to apply to the employee when the modern award comes into operation; and

                     (b)  the employee is employed in the same position as (or a position that is comparable to) the position he or she was employed in immediately before the State reference public sector modern award came into operation; and

                     (c)  the amount of the employee’s take-home pay for working particular hours or for a particular quantity of work after the State reference public sector modern award comes into operation is less than what would have been the employee’s take-home pay for those hours or that quantity of work immediately before the modern award came into operation; and

                     (d)  that reduction in the employee’s take-home pay is attributable to the State reference public sector transitional award modernisation process.

## 14  Orders remedying reductions in take-home pay

(1)        If FWA is satisfied that an employee, or a class of employees, to whom a State reference public sector modern award applies has suffered a modernisation-related reduction in take-home pay, FWA may make any order (a **_take-home pay order_**) requiring, or relating to, the payment of an amount or amounts to the employee or employees that FWA considers appropriate to remedy the situation.

(2)        FWA may make a take-home pay order only on application by:

                     (a)  an employee who has suffered a modernisation-related reduction in take-home pay; or

                     (b)  an organisation that is entitled to represent the industrial interests of such an employee; or

                     (c)  a person acting on behalf of a class of such employees.

(3)        If FWA is satisfied that an application for a take-home pay order has already been made in relation to an employee or a class of employees, FWA may dismiss any later application that is made under these provisions in relation to the same employee or employees.

## 15  Ensuring that take-home pay orders are confined to the circumstances for which they are needed

(1)        FWA must not make a take-home pay order in relation to an employee or class of employees if:

                     (a)  FWA considers that the modernisation-related reduction in take-home pay is minor or insignificant; or

                     (b)  FWA is satisfied that the employee or employees have been adequately compensated in other ways for the reduction.

(2)        FWA must ensure that a take-home pay order is expressed so that:

                     (a)  it does not apply to an employee unless the employee has actually suffered a modernisation-related reduction in take-home pay; and

                     (b)  if the take-home pay payable to the employee under the State reference public sector modern award increases after the order is made, there is a corresponding reduction in any amount payable to the employee under the order.

## 16  Take-home pay order continues to have effect so long as State reference public sector modern award continues to cover the employee or employees

A take-home pay order made in relation to an employee or class of employees to whom a particular State reference public sector modern award applies continues to have effect in relation to those employees (subject to the terms of the order) for so long as the State reference public sector modern award continues to cover the employee or employees, even if it stops applying to the employee or employees because an enterprise agreement starts to apply.

## 17  Inconsistency with State reference public sector modern awards and enterprise agreements

A term of a State reference public sector modern award or an enterprise agreement has no effect in relation to an employee to the extent that it is less beneficial to the employee than a term of a take-home pay order that applies to the employee.

## 18  Application of provisions of FW Act to take-home pay orders

The FW Act applies as if the following provisions of that Act included a reference to a take-home pay order:

                     (a)  subsection 675(2);

                     (b)  subsection 706(2).

_Note:       For compliance with take-home pay orders, see item 7 of Schedule 16._

<h8 class="ActHead8">Division 4—Application of the FW Act</h8>

## 19  How the FW Act applies to the modernisation process before the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day

For the purposes of making a State reference public sector modern award before the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day, the following provisions of the FW Act apply as if they had already commenced:

                     (a)  Part 2-2 (which deals with the National Employment Standards);

                     (b)  section 134 (which deals with the modern awards objective);

                     (c)  Division 3 of Part 2-3 (which deals with terms of modern awards);

                     (d)  section 284 (which deals with the minimum wages objective);

                     (e)  any provisions that are necessary for the effectual operation of the provisions referred to in paragraphs (a) to (d).

## 20  How the FW Act applies to modern awards made in the State reference public sector transitional award modernisation process

(1)        A State reference public sector modern award made under Division 2 is, for the purposes of the FW Act (and any other law), taken to be a modern award (being a State reference public sector modern award) within the meaning of that Act from the day on which the State reference public sector modern award is made.

(2)        Section 49 of the FW Act does not apply for the purpose of determining when the State reference public sector modern award comes into operation. Instead, the modern award comes into operation on the day on which it is expressed to commence, being a day that is not earlier than the day on which the modern award is made.

(3)        The regulations may deal with other matters relating to how the FW Act applies in relation to State reference public sector modern awards.

###### Schedule 7—Enterprise agreements and workplace determinations made under the FW Act

<h7 class="ActHead7">Part 1—Preliminary</h7>

## 1  Meanings of _employer_ and _employee_

In this Schedule,**_employee_** means a national system employee, and **_employer_** means a national system employer.

<h7 class="ActHead7">Part 2—Transitional provisions relating to the application of the no-disadvantage test to enterprise agreements made and varied during bridging period</h7>

<h8 class="ActHead8">Division 1—Enterprise agreements and variations made during bridging period must pass no-disadvantage test</h8>

## 2  Approval of agreement or variation by FWA—passing the no-disadvantage test

(1)        Paragraph 186(2)(d) of the FW Act (including as that paragraph has effect under subsection 211(3) of that Act) and subsection 211(5) of that Act apply in relation to:

                     (a)  an enterprise agreement made during the bridging period; and

                     (b)  a variation of an enterprise agreement, if the variation was made during the bridging period;

as if the words “better off overall test” were omitted and the words “no-disadvantage test as set out in Division 2 of Part 2 of Schedule 7 to the _Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 2009_” were substituted.

(2)        Paragraph 189(1)(b) of the FW Act applies in relation to an enterprise agreement made during the bridging period as if the words “better off overall test” were omitted and the words “no-disadvantage test as set out in Division 2 of Part 2 of Schedule 7 to the _Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 2009_” were substituted.

_Note:       This means that section 193 (which deals with passing the better off overall test) and subsections 211(4) and (5) (which deal with applying the better off overall test to agreements as proposed to be varied) of the FW Act will have no effect in relation to the approval by FWA of agreements and variations during the bridging period._

<h8 class="ActHead8">Division 2—The no-disadvantage test</h8>

## 3  Definitions

(1)        In this Division:

**_award_** includes a State reference transitional award or common rule.

**_designated award_**, for an employee or employees who are or may be covered by an enterprise agreement, means an award determined by the FWA under item 8, and includes an award taken to be so designated in relation to the employee or employees under item 7 (unless a different award has been designated in relation to the employee or employees under item 8).

**_industrial instrument_** means any of the following:

                     (a)  an AWA;

                     (c)  a pre-reform AWA;

                     (d)  a pre-reform certified agreement;

                     (e)  a workplace determination (within the meaning of the WR Act);

                      (f)  a section 170MX award;

                     (g)  an old IR agreement;

                     (h)  a preserved State agreement.

**_reference instrument_** has the meaning given by subitem 5(1).

**_relevant general instrument_** has the meaning given by subitem 5(2).

Application of this Division to variations

(2)        Unless the contrary intention appears, this Division applies to an enterprise agreement as proposed to be varied in a corresponding way to the way in which it applies to an enterprise agreement.

(3)        For the purposes of subitem (2):

                     (a)  a reference in a provision of this Division to an employee who is covered by the agreement is taken to be a reference to an employee who is one of the affected employees for the variation of the agreement (within the meaning of the FW Act); and

                     (b)  a reference in a provision of this Division to the employees who are covered by the agreement is taken to be a reference to the affected employees for the variation; and

                     (c)  a reference in a provision of this Division to an application for approval of the agreement under section 185 of the FW Act is taken to be a reference to an application for approval of a variation of the agreement under section 210 of that Act.

Application of this Division to prospective employees

(4)        For the purposes of applying this Division to an enterprise agreement, a reference to an employee who is covered by the enterprise agreement is, so far as the context permits, taken to include a reference to a person who may at a future time be covered by the enterprise agreement.

## 4  When does an agreement pass the no-disadvantage test?

(1)        An enterprise agreement passes the no-disadvantage test if FWA is satisfied that the agreement does not, or would not result, on balance, in a reduction in the overall terms and conditions of employment of the employees who are covered by the agreement under any reference instrument relating to one or more of the employees.

(2)        For the purposes of subitem (1):

                     (a)  a law of a State or Territory that:

                              (i)  relates to long service leave; and

                             (ii)  applied, immediately before the application was made for approval of the agreement under section 185 of the FW Act, to an employee referred to in that subitem, or would have applied to such an employee if he or she had been employed by the employer at that time;

                            is taken, to the extent that it provides for long service leave, to be a reference instrument relating to the employee; and

                     (b)  if, apart from this subitem, the only reference instrument relating to the employee is a designated award for the employee—the designated award is to be disregarded to the extent (if any) that it provides for long service leave.

_Note:       An enterprise agreement made during the bridging period will prevail over a law of a State or Territory, to the extent of any inconsistency, so far as that law deals with long service leave (see item 17)._

(3)        An enterprise agreement or a variation of an enterprise agreement is taken to pass the no-disadvantage test if there is no reference instrument in relation to any of the employees who are covered by the agreement.

(4)        To avoid doubt, if there is a reference instrument in relation to one or more, but not all, of the employees referred to in subitem (1):

                     (a)  if the agreement passes the no-disadvantage test under subitem (1)—it passes the test in relation to all employees who are covered by the agreement; or

                     (b)  if the agreement does not pass the no-disadvantage test under subitem (1)—it does not pass the test in relation to any employees who are covered by the agreement.

_Note 1:    In addition to the no-disadvantage test, during the bridging period, the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard prevails over an enterprise agreement to the extent to which the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard provides a more favourable outcome for the employee or employees—see subitem 27(1)._

_Note 2:    From the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day, a term of an enterprise agreement has no effect to the extent it excludes the National Employment Standards or any provision of the National Employment Standards (see sections 55 and 56 of the FW Act)._

_Note 3:    This item applies to an enterprise agreement as proposed to be varied in a corresponding way to the way in which it applies to an enterprise agreement—see subitems 3(2) and (3)._

_Note 4:    See item 10 for how FWA makes decisions under this item._

(5)        For the purposes of determining whether an enterprise agreement as proposed to be varied passes the no-disadvantage test, FWA must disregard any individual flexibility arrangement that has been agreed to by an affected employee and his or her employer under the flexibility term in the agreement.

## 5  Reference instruments etc.

(1)        A **_reference instrument_**, in relation to employees who are covered by an enterprise agreement, is:

                     (a)  any relevant general instrument; or

                     (b)  if there is no relevant general instrument—any designated award;

for one or more of the employees.

(2)        A **_relevant general instrument_**, for an employee who is covered by an enterprise agreement, is an award-based transitional instrument:

                     (a)  that regulates, or would but for an enterprise agreement or another industrial instrument having come into operation regulate, any term or condition of employment of persons engaged in the same kind of work as that performed or to be performed by the employee under the enterprise agreement; and

                     (b)  that applied, or would but for an enterprise agreement or another industrial instrument having come into operation have applied, to the employee’s employer immediately before the day on which the application for approval of the agreement was made under section 185 of the FW Act.

## 6  Enterprise agreement to be tested as at test time

(1)        In deciding whether an enterprise agreement passes, or does not pass, the no-disadvantage test, FWA must consider it as in existence at the test time.

(2)        The **_test time_** is the time when the application for approval of the agreement was made under section 185 of the FW Act.

## 7  Designated awards—before application for FWA approval

(1)        FWA may, on application by an employer, determine that an award is a designated award for an employee or class of employees of the employer.

(2)        FWA may make a determination under this item only if it is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the employee or employees are or may be employed in an industry or occupation in which the terms and conditions of the kind of work performed or to be performed by the employee or employees:

                              (i)  are usually regulated by an award; or

                             (ii)  would, but for an enterprise agreement or another industrial instrument having come into operation, usually be regulated by an award; and

                     (b)  unless there is a designated award for the employee or employees, there would be no reference instrument relating to the employee or employees; and

                     (c)  there is an award that satisfies the requirements specified in subitem (3).

(3)        An award or awards determined by FWA under this item:

                     (a)  must be an award or awards regulating, or that would, but for an enterprise agreement or another industrial instrument having come into operation, regulate, terms or conditions of employment of employees engaged in the same kind of work as the work performed or to be performed by the employee or employees; and

                     (b)  must, in the opinion of FWA, be an award or awards  that would be appropriate for the purpose referred to in paragraph 8(3)(b) if an application were made for approval of an enterprise agreement under section 185 of the FW Act; and

                     (c)  must not be an award that regulates the terms and conditions of employment in a single business only (being the single business specified in the award).

(4)        An award determined under this item in relation to an employee or employees is taken to be the designated award determined by FWA under item 8 in relation to the employee or employees if, later, an application is made for approval of an enterprise agreement under section 185 of the FW Act, in relation to the employee or the employees.

(5)        Despite subitem (4), FWA may determine under item 8 that another award  is a designated award in relation to the employee, or in relation to some or all of the employees, if:

                     (a)  FWA becomes aware of information that was not available to it at the time of the determination under subitem (1); and

                     (b)  FWA is satisfied that, had that information been available to it at that time, FWA would have determined under subitem (1) the other award to be the designated award.

(6)        FWA may determine different awards under subitem (1) in relation to different employees.

(7)        In this item, a reference to an employee or employees of an employer includes a reference to a person or persons who may become an employee or employees of the employer.

(8)        A determination made under this item is not a legislative instrument.

## 8  Designated awards—after application for FWA approval

(1)        This item applies to an enterprise agreement if there is no relevant general instrument in relation to an employee who is, or a class of employees who are, covered by the agreement.

(2)        FWA must determine that an award is a designated award for the employee or employees referred to in subitem (1), if it is satisfied that:

                     (a)  on the date on which the application for approval of the enterprise agreement was made under section 185 of the FW Act, the employee or employees are or would be employed in an industry or occupation in which the terms and conditions of the kind of work performed or to be performed by the employee or employees:

                              (i)  are usually regulated by an award; or

                             (ii)  would, but for an enterprise agreement or another industrial instrument having come into operation, usually be regulated by an award; and

                     (b)  there is an award that satisfies the requirements specified in subitem (3).

(3)        An award or awards  determined by FWA under this item:

                     (a)  must be an award or awards regulating, or that would, but for an enterprise agreement or another industrial instrument having come into operation, regulate, terms or conditions of employment of employees engaged in the same kind of work as the work performed by the employee or employees under the enterprise agreement concerned; and

                     (b)  must, in the opinion of FWA, be appropriate for the purpose of deciding whether an enterprise agreement passes the no-disadvantage test; and

                     (c)  must not be an award that regulates the terms and conditions of employment in a single business only (being the single business specified in the award).

(4)        FWA may determine different awards under subitem (2) in relation to different employees.

(5)        A determination made under this item is not a legislative instrument.

## 9  Effect of State awards etc.

For the purposes of paragraphs 7(2)(a) and 8(2)(a), an industry or occupation in which the terms and conditions of the kind of work performed or to be performed by an employee are usually regulated by an award is taken to include an industry or occupation in which the terms and conditions of the kind of work performed or to be performed by the employee:

                     (a)  were, immediately before the reform commencement, usually regulated by a State award; or

                     (b)  would, but for an industrial instrument or a State employment agreement having come into operation, usually have been so regulated immediately before the reform commencement.

## 10  Matters taken into account when testing agreement etc.

(1)        In deciding whether an enterprise agreement passes, or does not pass, the no-disadvantage test, FWA:

                     (a)  must have regard to the work obligations of the employee or employees under the enterprise agreement; and

                     (b)  may inform itself in any way it considers appropriate including (but not limited to) contacting any of the following:

                              (i)  the employer;

                             (ii)  the employee, or some or all of the employees, who are covered by the enterprise agreement;

                            (iii)  a bargaining representative in relation to the agreement.

(2)        In deciding whether to determine that an award is a designated award in relation to an employee or employees of an employer, FWA may inform itself in any way it considers appropriate including (but not limited to) contacting any of the following:

                     (a)  the employer;

                     (b)  the employee or employees;

                     (c)  if the determination would be made under item 8—a bargaining representative in relation to the agreement.

<h7 class="ActHead7">Part 3—Other requirements and modifications applying to making and varying enterprise agreements during the bridging period</h7>

<h8 class="ActHead8">Division 1—Requirements relating to approval</h8>

## 11  Approval of agreement by FWA—interaction with the National Employment Standards

Paragraph 186(2)(c) of the FW Act (which deals with terms that contravene section 55 of that Act) does not apply in relation to:

                     (a)  an enterprise agreement made during the bridging period; or

                     (b)  a variation of an enterprise agreement, if the variation is made during the bridging period.

_Note:       Section 55 of the FW Act (which deals with the interaction between the National Employment Standards and enterprise agreements etc.) will apply after the end of the bridging period. Section 56 of that Act provides that a term of an enterprise agreement has no effect to the extent that it contravenes section 55._

## 12  Approval of agreement by FWA—term about settling disputes

Subparagraph 186(6)(a)(ii) of the FW Act (which deals with a requirement for an enterprise agreement to have a term about settling disputes in relation to the National Employment Standards) applies in relation to:

                     (a)  an enterprise agreement made during the bridging period; or

                     (b)  a variation of an enterprise agreement, if the variation is made during the bridging period;

as if the words “as those provisions apply after the end of the bridging period” were added after “National Employment Standards”.

_Note:       For disputes relating to the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard as it applies during the bridging period, see item 27._

## 13  Approval of agreement by FWA—requirements relating to particular kinds of employees

(1)        Subsection 187(4) of the FW Act (which deals with requirements relating to particular kinds of employees) does not apply in relation to:

                     (a)  an enterprise agreement made during the bridging period; or

                     (b)  a variation of an enterprise agreement, if the variation is made during the bridging period;

except in so far as that subsection requires FWA to be satisfied as referred to in section 200 of the FW Act.

(2)        Section 200 of the FW Act (which deals with requirements relating to outworkers) applies in relation to the agreement or variation as if:

                     (a)  references in that section to a modern award were references to an award, a State reference transitional award or common rule, or a notional agreement preserving State awards; and

                     (b)  references in that section to outworker terms were references to terms that are (or that would be, if the terms were in an award) outworker terms as defined in section 564 of the WR Act.

<h8 class="ActHead8">Division 2—Base rate of pay</h8>

## 14  Base rate of pay under enterprise agreements

The FW Act applies during the bridging period as if section 206 (which deals with base rate of pay under enterprise agreements) were omitted.

<h8 class="ActHead8">Division 3—No extensions of time</h8>

## 15  No extension of time to apply for approval of agreement made in final 14 days of bridging period

Paragraph 185(3)(b) of the FW Act (which deals with extending the period within which an application must be made to FWA for approval of an enterprise agreement) does not apply in relation to an enterprise agreement made during the period of 14 days ending at the end of the bridging period.

_Note:       If an application for approval of an enterprise agreement referred to in this item is not made to FWA within 14 days of it being made:_

(a)    FWA cannot approve the enterprise agreement; but

(b)    another enterprise agreement may be made in accordance with Part 2-4 of the FW Act.

## 16  No extension of time to apply for approval of variation of agreement made in final 14 days of bridging period

Paragraph 210(3)(b) of the FW Act (which deals with extending the period within which an application must be made to FWA for approval of a variation of an enterprise agreement) does not apply in relation to a variation of an enterprise agreement, if that variation was made during the period of 14 days ending at the end of the bridging period.

_Note:       If an application for approval of a variation referred to in this item is not made to FWA within 14 days of it being made:_

(a)    FWA cannot approve the variation; but

(b)    another variation may be made in accordance with Part 2-4 of the FW Act.

<h8 class="ActHead8">Division 4—State and Territory laws dealing with long service leave</h8>

## 17  Enterprise agreement made during the bridging period prevails over State and Territory laws dealing with long service leave

Despite subsection 29(2) of the FW Act, an enterprise agreement made during the bridging period prevails over a law of a State or Territory, to the extent of any inconsistency, so far as that law deals with long service leave.

_Note:       A term of such an enterprise agreement will still apply subject to a law of a State or Territory so far as that law is otherwise covered by paragraph 29(2)(a) or (b) of the FW Act._

<h7 class="ActHead7">Part 4—Transitional provisions to apply the better off overall test after end of bridging period if award modernisation not yet completed</h7>

## 18  Application of better off overall test to making of enterprise agreements that cover unmodernised award covered employees

(1)        This item applies in relation to an enterprise agreement made after the end of the bridging period if one or more of the employees covered by the agreement is an unmodernised award covered employee.

Non-greenfields agreements

(2)        Despite section 193 of the FW Act, if the enterprise agreement is not a greenfields agreement, the agreement passes the better off overall test under that section only if:

                     (a)  FWA is satisfied as referred to in subsection (1) of that section in relation to the agreement; and

                     (b)  FWA is satisfied, as at the test time, that each unmodernised award covered employee, and each prospective unmodernised award covered employee, for the agreement would be better off overall if the agreement applied to the employee than if the relevant award-based transitional instrument and transitional APCS applied to the employee.

Greenfields agreements

(3)        Despite section 193 of the FW Act, if the enterprise agreement is a greenfields agreement, the agreement passes the better off overall test under that section only if:

                     (a)  FWA is satisfied as referred to in subsection (3) of that section in relation to the agreement; and

                     (b)  FWA is satisfied, as at the test time, that each prospective unmodernised award covered employee for the agreement would be better off overall if the agreement applied to the employee than if the relevant award-based transitional instrument and transitional APCS  applied to the employee.

FWA may assume employee better off overall in certain circumstances

(4)        For the purposes of determining whether an enterprise agreement passes the better off overall test, if a class of employees to which a particular employee belongs would be better off if the agreement applied to that class than if the relevant modern award or relevant award-based transitional instrument and transitional APCS  applied to that class, FWA is entitled to assume, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the employee would be better off overall if the agreement applied to the employee.

State reference transitional awards or common rules: transitional APCSs not relevant

(5)        If the relevant award-based transitional instrument in relation to an employee is a State reference transitional award or common rule, the references in this item to a transitional APCS are to be disregarded.

_Note:       State reference transitional awards or common rules contain terms dealing with wages._

## 19  Application of better off overall test to variation of enterprise agreements that cover unmodernised award covered employees

(1)        This item applies in relation to a variation of an enterprise agreement if:

                     (a)  the variation is made after the end of the bridging period; and

                     (b)  one or more of the employees who are covered by the agreement is an unmodernised award covered employee.

(2)        Despite subsections 211(4) and (5) of the FW Act, subitems (3) and (4) apply in relation to the variation for the purposes of FWA being satisfied that the agreement as proposed to be varied passes the better off overall test.

Modification of the better off overall test

(3)        An enterprise agreement as proposed to be varied passes the better off overall test if FWA is satisfied, as at the test time, that:

                     (a)  each award covered employee, and each prospective award covered employee, for the agreement would be better off overall if the agreement applied to the employee than if the relevant modern award applied to the employee; and

                     (b)  each unmodernised award covered employee, and each prospective unmodernised award covered employee, for the agreement would be better off overall if the agreement applied to the employee than if the relevant award-based transitional instrument and transitional APCS applied to the employee.

FWA may assume employee better off overall in certain circumstances

(4)        For the purposes of determining whether the enterprise agreement as proposed to be varied passes the better off overall test, if a class of employees to which a particular employee belongs would be better off if the agreement applied to that class than if the relevant modern award or relevant award-based transitional instrument and transitional APCS  applied to that class, FWA is entitled to assume, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the employee would be better off overall if the agreement applied to the employee.

FWA must disregard individual flexibility arrangement

(5)        For the purposes of determining whether an enterprise agreement as proposed to be varied passes the better off overall test, FWA must disregard any individual flexibility arrangement that has been agreed to by an award covered employee and his or her employer under the flexibility term in the agreement.

State reference transitional awards or common rules: transitional APCSs not relevant

(6)        If the relevant award-based transitional instrument in relation to an employee is a State reference transitional award or common rule, the references in this item to a transitional APCS are to be disregarded.

_Note:       State reference transitional awards or common rules contain terms dealing with wages._

## 20  Definitions

In this Part:

**_prospective unmodernised award covered employee_**, for an enterprise agreement, means a person who, if he or she were an employee at the test time of an employer covered by the agreement:

                     (a)  would be covered by the agreement; and

                     (b)  would be covered by an award-based transitional instrument (the **_relevant award-based transitional instrument_**) that:

                              (i)  is in operation; and

                             (ii)  would cover the person in relation to the work that he or she would perform under the agreement; and

                            (iii)  covers the employer.

**_test time_**:

                     (a)  for the purposes of item 18—means the time the application for approval of the agreement by FWA was made under section 185 of the FW Act; and

                     (b)  for the purposes of item 19—means the time the application for approval of the variation of the enterprise agreement by FWA was made under section 210 of that Act.

**_unmodernised award covered employee_**, for an enterprise agreement, means an employee who:

                     (a)  is covered by the agreement; and

                     (b)  at the test time, is covered by an award-based transitional instrument (the **_relevant award-based transitional instrument_**) that:

                              (i)  is in operation; and

                             (ii)  covers the employee in relation to the work that he or she is to perform under the agreement; and

                            (iii)  covers his or her employer.

<h7 class="ActHead7">Part 5—Transitional provisions relating to workplace determinations made under the FW Act</h7>

## 21  Application made during bridging period for special low-paid workplace determination—general requirement relating to minimum safety net

Subsection 262(3) of the FW Act (which deals with a general requirement relating to the minimum safety net) applies in relation to an application for a special low-paid workplace determination made during the bridging period as if the words “modern awards together with the National Employment Standards” were omitted and the words “awards (including State reference transitional awards and common rules) together with the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard” were substituted.

## 22  Special low-paid workplace determination—employer must not previously have been covered by agreement-based transitional instrument

(1)        Subsection 263(3) of the FW Act (which deals with additional requirements for making a special low-paid workplace determination) applies in relation to a workplace determination, whether made during or after the bridging period, as if the reference in that subsection to an enterprise agreement included a reference to a collective agreement-based transitional instrument.

(2)        However, subitem (1) does not apply in relation to a workplace determination if:

                     (a)  the collective agreement-based transitional instrument has ceased to operate; and

                     (b)  FWA considers that it is appropriate in the circumstances to make the workplace determination.

(3)        In making a decision for the purposes of paragraph (2)(b) of this item, FWA must take into account the objects set out in section 241 of the FW Act.

## 23  Core terms of workplace determinations—assessment of determination made during bridging period against the no disadvantage test

Subsection 272(4) of the FW Act (which deals with workplace determinations passing the better off overall test) applies in relation to a workplace determination made during the bridging period as if the words “better off overall test under section 193” were omitted and the words “no-disadvantage test as set out in Division 2 of Part 2 of Schedule 7 to the _Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 2009_” were substituted.

## 24  Core terms of workplace determinations—assessment of determination made after bridging period that covers unmodernised award covered employees against the better off overall test

(1)        This item applies in relation to a workplace determination made after the end of the bridging period if one or more of the employees who will be covered by the determination is an unmodernised award covered employee (within the meaning of Part 4).

(2)        Subsection 272(4) of the FW Act (which deals with workplace determinations passing the better off overall test) applies in relation to the workplace determination as if the words “under section 193” were omitted and the words “under item 18 of Schedule 7 to the _Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 2009_” were substituted.

## 25  Core terms of workplace determinations—safety net requirements

(1)        This item applies in relation to a workplace determination made during the bridging period.

(2)        Subsection 272(5) of the FW Act (which deals with terms relating to safety net requirements) does not apply in relation to the workplace determination, except in so far as that subsection prevents a workplace determination from including a term that would, if the determination were an enterprise agreement, mean that FWA could not approve the agreement because of the operation of section 200 of that Act (which deals with requirements relating to outworkers).

_Note:       Section 55 of the FW Act (which deals with the interaction between the National Employment Standards and workplace determinations etc.) will apply after the end of the bridging period. Section 56 of that Act provides that a term of a workplace determination has no effect to the extent that it contravenes section 55._

(3)        Section 200 of the FW Act (which deals with requirements relating to outworkers) applies in relation to the workplace determination as if:

                     (a)  references in that section to a modern award were references to an award or a State reference transitional award or common rule; and

                     (b)  references in that section to outworker terms were references to outworker terms as defined in section 564 of the WR Act.

## 26  Mandatory terms of workplace determinations—term about settling disputes

(1)        This item applies in relation to a workplace determination made during the bridging period.

(2)        Paragraph 273(2)(b) of the FW Act (which deals with a requirement for a workplace determination to have a term about settling disputes in relation to the National Employment Standards) applies in relation to the workplace determination as if the words “as the National Employment Standards apply after the end of the bridging period” were added after “National Employment Standards”.

(3)        Subsection 273(3) of the FW Act (which deals with a requirement for a workplace determination to have a term about settling disputes) applies in relation to the workplace determination as if the reference to paragraph 186(6)(a) of the FW Act were a reference to that paragraph in its application to an enterprise agreement made during the bridging period (see item 12).

_Note:       For disputes relating to the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard as it applies during the bridging period, see item 27._

<h7 class="ActHead7">Part 6—Interaction with Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard during bridging period</h7>

## 27  Interaction with Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard during bridging period

Continued application of Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard

(1)        The Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard, in its application during the bridging period under item 2 of Schedule 4 and item 5 of Schedule 9 prevails over an enterprise agreement or a workplace determination that applies to an employee to the extent to which, in a particular respect, the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard provides a more favourable outcome for the employee.

Disputes about Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard to be resolved using the model dispute resolution process

(2)        A dispute about:

                     (a)  whether the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard provides a more favourable outcome for an employee in a particular respect than an enterprise agreement or workplace determination that applies to that employee; or

                     (b)  what the outcome is for an employee in a particular respect under the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard, where an enterprise agreement or a workplace determination applies to that employee;

is to be resolved using the model dispute resolution process referred to in Part 13 of the WR Act.

(3)        For the purposes of subitem (2), Divisions 2 and 3 of Part 13 of the WR Act apply as if a reference in those Divisions to the Commission or the Industrial Registrar were a reference to FWA.

(4)        The fact that the model dispute resolution process applies in relation to the dispute does not affect any right of a party to the dispute to take court action to resolve it.

(5)        To avoid doubt, subitems (2) and (3) apply despite:

                     (a)  subsection 694(2) of the WR Act (which deals with when the model dispute resolution process applies); and

                     (b)  subsection 595(1) of the FW Act (which deals with when FWA may deal with a dispute).

Continued application of regulations

<h8 class="ActHead8">Division 1—Transitional provisions relating to collective agreements made before the WR Act repeal day</h8>

## 2  Division applies to collective agreements made before WR Act repeal day

This Division applies to a collective agreement made before the WR Act repeal day.

_Note:       Schedule 3 (which deals with transitional instruments) also contains rules that apply to such agreements._

## 3  General rule—continued application of lodgment provisions, no-disadvantage test and prohibited content rules, etc.

The following provisions of Part 8 of the WR Act continue to apply in relation to the collective agreement on and after the WR Act repeal day:

                     (a)  subsections 337(8), (9), (10) and (11) (which deal with non-compliance with access and information requirements);

                     (b)  section 341 (which deals with lodging unapproved agreements);

                     (c)  Division 5 of Part 8 (which deals with lodgment);

                     (d)  Division 5A of Part 8 (which deals with the no-disadvantage test);

                     (e)  subsections 347(1) and (3) (which deal with when a workplace agreement comes into operation);

                      (f)  section 347A (which deals with the operation of workplace agreements);

                     (g)  Division 7 of Part 8 (which deals with content rules), other than sections 353 (which deals with dispute settlement) and 358 (which deals with prohibited content being void);

                     (h)  subsection 401(1) and section 412A.

_Note 1:    The general effect of this provision is to preserve the Part 8 rules about lodgment, the no-disadvantage test and prohibited content for collective agreements made before the WR Act repeal day, subject to the modifications set out in this Division. The rules about variation and termination of such collective agreements, and certain other rules, are contained in Schedule 3 (which deals with transitional instruments)._

_Note 2:    The rules requiring a collective agreement to include dispute settlement procedures and about prohibited content being void continue to apply under subitem 4(1) of Schedule 3 (which deals with instrument content rules for transitional instruments)._

## 4  Modification—unlodged collective agreements must be lodged within 14 days

(1)        Despite item 3, if the collective agreement is an unlodged collective agreement:

                     (a)  the Workplace Authority Director must not consider whether the agreement passes the no-disadvantage test under section 346D of the WR Act, as that section continues to apply because of item 3, unless:

                              (i)  the agreement is lodged before the end of the period (the **_cut-off period_**) of 14 days referred to in subsection 342(1) or (2) of that Act; and

                             (ii)  for a union collective agreement—the agreement was approved before the WR Act repeal day; and

                     (b)  if the agreement is not lodged before the end of the cut-off period, it does not come into operation; and

                     (c)  subsection 342(3) of the WR Act (which deals with a civil remedy for late lodgment), as that subsection continues to apply because of item 3, does not apply to the lodgment of the agreement.

_Note:       The general effect of this provision is that unlodged collective agreements (other than union collective agreements) must be lodged within 14 days of being made in order to come into operation. Unlodged union collective agreements must have been approved before the WR Act repeal day and be lodged within 14 days of that approval in order to come into operation. However, late lodgment will not give rise to a civil remedy._

(2)        If the collective agreement is lodged after the end of the cut-off period, the Workplace Authority Director must give a written notice, stating that the agreement cannot come into operation because it was lodged after the end of the cut-off period, to the following:

                     (a)  the employer to which the agreement would have applied if it had come into operation;

                     (b)  if the agreement is a union collective agreement or a multiple-business agreement that would be a union collective agreement but for subsection 331(1) of the WR Act—the organisation or organisations that would have been covered by the agreement if it had come into operation.

## 5  Modification—limits on variation of a collective agreement that operates from approval for the purpose of passing the no-disadvantage test

(1)        Despite item 3, if the collective agreement is a workplace agreement that operates from approval, the rules in this item also apply.

_Note:       The general effect of this item is that a collective agreement that operates from approval can only be varied for the purpose of passing the no-disadvantage test if a variation for that purpose is lodged within a specified period._

(2)        If, as at the WR Act repeal day:

                     (a)  a notice under section 346M of the WR Act about whether the agreement passes the no-disadvantage test has not been given; or

                     (b)  a notice under subsection 346M(2) of the WR Act stating that the agreement does not pass the no-disadvantage test has been given but a variation of the agreement, for the purposes of passing that test, has not been made; or

                     (c)  a notice under subsection 346M(2) of the WR Act stating that the agreement does not pass the no-disadvantage test has been given and a variation of the agreement, for the purposes of passing that test, has been made but has not been lodged;

then Division 5A of Part 8 of the WR Act, as that Division continues to apply because of item 3, has effect in relation to the collective agreement subject to subitems (3) and (5).

(3)        Section 346N of the WR Act, as that section continues to apply because of item 3, has effect in relation to the agreement, on and after the WR Act repeal day, as if it provided that a variation for the purposes of passing the no-disadvantage test set out in section 346D of that Act must be lodged under section 346N of that Act before the end of:

                     (a)  the period of 37 days beginning on whichever of the following days is later:

                              (i)  the WR Act repeal day;

                             (ii)  the date of issue specified in the notice under subsection 346M(2) of that Act in relation to the agreement; or

                     (b)  if the period is extended under subitem (4)—the period as extended.

(4)        The Workplace Authority Director may extend the period referred to in paragraph (3)(b) in relation to a particular agreement in circumstances prescribed by the regulations.

(5)        Section 346Q of the WR Act, as that section continues to apply because of item 3, has effect in relation to the agreement, on and after the WR Act repeal day, as if it provided that the Workplace Authority Director must not consider under that section whether the agreement as varied passes the no-disadvantage test unless the variation is lodged within the period referred to in paragraph (3)(a) or (b).

<h8 class="ActHead8">Division 2—Transitional provisions relating to variations of collective agreements made before the WR Act repeal day</h8>

## 6  Division applies to variations of collective agreements made before WR Act repeal day

This Division applies to a variation of a collective agreement under Division 8 of Part 8 of the WR Act, if the variation is made before the WR Act repeal day.

## 7  General rule—continued application of lodgment provisions and no-disadvantage test to ordinary variations

The following provisions of Part 8 of the WR Act continue to apply in relation to the variation on and after the WR Act repeal day:

                     (a)  Division 5A of Part 8 (which deals with the no-disadvantage test);

                     (b)  subsections 370(8), (9), (10) and (11) (which deal with non-compliance with access and information requirements);

                     (c)  section 374 (which deals with lodgment of unapproved variations);

                     (d)  Subdivision C of Division 8 of Part 8 (which deals with lodgment);

                     (e)  Subdivision D of Division 8 of Part 8 (which deals with when a variation comes into operation);

                      (f)  subsection 401(1) and section 412A.

_Note:       The general effect of this provision is to preserve the Part 8 rules about lodgment and the no-disadvantage test for variations under Division 8 made before the WR repeal day, subject to the modifications set out in this Division._

## 8  Modification—unlodged variations must be lodged within 14 days

(1)        Despite item 7, if the variation is an unlodged variation:

                     (a)  the Workplace Authority Director must not consider whether the varied agreement passes the no-disadvantage test under section 346D of the WR Act, as that section continues to apply because of item 7, unless:

                              (i)  the variation is lodged before the end of the period (the **_cut-off period_**) of 14 days referred to in subsection 375(1) of that Act; and

                             (ii)  for a variation of a union collective agreement or a union greenfields agreement—the variation was approved before the WR Act repeal day; and

                     (b)  subsection 375(2) of the WR Act (which deals with a civil remedy for late lodgment), as that subsection continues to apply because of item 7, does not apply to the variation.

_Note:       The general effect of this provision is that unlodged variations of collective agreements must be lodged within 14 days of being approved in order to come into operation. Unlodged variations of union collective agreements and union greenfields agreements must also have been approved before the WR Act repeal day. However, late lodgment will not give rise to a civil remedy._

(2)        If the variation is lodged after the end of the cut-off period, the Workplace Authority Director must give a written notice, stating that the variation cannot come into operation because it was lodged after the end of the cut-off period, to the following:

                     (a)  the employer to which the agreement applies;

                     (b)  if the agreement is a union collective agreement or a multiple-business agreement that would be a union collective agreement but for subsection 331(1) of the WR Act—the organisation or organisations covered by the agreement.

## 9  Modification—limits on varying variations for the purpose of passing the no-disadvantage test

(1)        Despite item 7, if, as at the WR Act repeal day:

                     (a)  a notice under section 346M of the WR Act about whether the agreement as varied passes the no-disadvantage test has not been given in relation to the variation; or

                     (b)  a notice under subsection 346M(2) of the WR Act stating that the agreement as varied does not pass the no-disadvantage test has been given in relation to the variation, but a variation, for the purposes of passing that test, has not been made; or

                     (c)  a notice under subsection 346M(2) of the WR Act stating that the agreement as varied does not pass the no-disadvantage test has been given in relation to the variation and a variation of the agreement, for the purposes of passing that test, has been made but has not been lodged;

then Division 5A of Part 8 of the WR Act, as that Division continues to apply because of item 7, has effect in relation to the variation, on and after the WR Act repeal day, subject to subitems (2) and (4).

(2)        Section 346N of the WR Act, as that section continues to apply because of item 7, has effect in relation to the variation, on and after the WR Act repeal day, as if it provided that a variation for the purposes of passing the no-disadvantage test set out in section 346D of that Act must be lodged under section 346N of that Act before the end of:

                     (a)  the period of 37 days beginning on whichever of the following days is later:

                              (i)  the WR Act repeal day;

                             (ii)  the date of issue specified in the notice under subsection 346M(2) of that Act in relation to the agreement as varied; or

                     (b)  if the period is extended under subitem (3)—the period as extended.

(3)        The Workplace Authority Director may extend the period referred to in paragraph (2)(a) in relation to a particular variation in circumstances prescribed by the regulations.

(4)        Section 346Q of the WR Act, as that section continues to apply because of item 7, has effect in relation to the variation, on and after the WR Act repeal day, as if it provided that the Workplace Authority Director must not consider under that section whether the agreement as varied passes the no-disadvantage test unless the variation for the purposes of passing that test is lodged within the period referred to in paragraph (2)(a) or (b).

## 10  Termination by approval general rule—continued application of lodgment provisions

(1)        This item applies to a termination of a collective agreement, if the termination has been approved in accordance with section 386 of the WR Act (which deals with terminations by approval) before the WR Act repeal day, but not lodged in accordance with section 389 of that Act before that day.

(2)        The following provisions of Part 8 of the WR Act continue to apply in relation to the termination on and after the WR Act repeal day:

                     (c)  section 387 (which deals with lodgment of unapproved terminations);

                     (d)  Subdivision C of Division 9 of Part 8 (which deals with lodgment);

Terminations after that day are dealt with in Schedule 3 (which deals with transitional instruments)._

## 11  Modification—unlodged terminations must be lodged within 14 days

(1)        Despite item 10, if a termination to which that item applies is an unlodged termination:

                     (a)  the termination does not come into operation unless it is lodged before the end of the 14 day period (the **_cut-off period_**) referred to in subsection 388(1) of the WR Act as that subsection continues to apply because of item 10; and

                     (b)  subsection 388(2) of the WR Act (which deals with a civil remedy for late lodgment), as that subsection continues to apply because of item 10, does not apply to the termination.

_Note:       The general effect of this provision is that unlodged terminations must be lodged within 14 days of being made in order to come into operation. However, late lodgment will not give rise to a civil remedy._

(2)        If the termination is lodged after the end of the cut-off period, the Workplace Authority Director must give a written notice, stating that the termination cannot come into operation because it was lodged after the end of the cut-off period, to the following:

                     (c)  section 397 (which deals with giving notice after lodging notice of termination);

                     (d)  section 398 (which deals with the effect of non-compliance);

                     (e)  section 412A.

_Note:       The general effect of this provision is to preserve the Part 8 rules in relation to unilateral terminations of workplace agreements, if a declaration to terminate the agreement has been lodged before the WR Act repeal day. Terminations after that day are dealt with in Schedule 3 (which deals with transitional instruments)._

## 13  Termination by the Commission—Commission may continue to deal with applications made before the WR Act repeal day

                     (e)  subsection 401(1) and section 412A.

_Note 1:    The general effect of this provision is to preserve the Part 8 rules about lodgment, the no-disadvantage test and prohibited content in relation to ITEAs made before the WR Act repeal day, subject to the modification set out in item 15\. The rules about making ITEAs after that day are contained in Division 7 of this Part. The rules about variation and termination of ITEAs after that day, and some other rules, are contained in Schedule 3 (which deals with transitional instruments)._

_Note 2:    The rules requiring an ITEA to include dispute settlement procedures and about prohibited content being void continue to apply under subitem 4(1) of Schedule 3 (which deals with instrument content rules for transitional instruments)._

## 15  Modification—limits on variation of an ITEA that operates from approval for the purpose of passing the no-disadvantage test

(1)        Despite item 14, if the ITEA is a workplace agreement that operates from approval, the rules in this item also apply.

(1)        This item applies to a termination of an ITEA if a declaration to terminate the ITEA is lodged under subsection 392(2) of the WR Act (which deals with unilateral termination in the manner provided in the ITEA) before the WR Act repeal day.

(2)        The following provisions of Part 8 of the WR Act continue to apply in relation to the termination on and after the WR Act repeal day:

                     (a)  subsection 381(2) (which deals with when a workplace agreement is terminated);

                     (b)  section 396 (which deals with receipts for lodgment of declarations);

                     (c)  section 397 (which deals with giving notice after lodging notice of termination);

                     (d)  section 398 (which deals with effect of non-compliance).

                     (e)  section 412A.

_Note:       The general effect of this provision is to preserve the Part 8 rules in relation to terminations of ITEAs, if a declaration to terminate is lodged before the WR Act repeal day. Terminations after that day are dealt with in Schedule 3 (which deals with transitional instruments)._

## 20  Continued application of lodgment provisions where termination by written notice is given before the WR Act repeal day and lodged within 120 days

(1)        This item applies to an ITEA, if notice to terminate the ITEA is given in accordance with subsection 393(4) of the WR Act (which deals with unilateral termination by giving written notice) before the WR Act repeal day.

(2)        The following provisions of Part 8 of the WR Act continue to apply on and after the WR Act repeal day in relation to the termination of the ITEA:

                     (a)  subsection 381(2) (which deals with when an ITEA is terminated);

                     (b)  sections 393, 394, 395, 396, 397, 397A, 398 and 399A (which deal with matters relating to lodgment of terminations, etc.);

                     (c)  section 412A.

_Note:       The general effect of this provision is to preserve the Part 8 rules in relation to terminations of ITEAs by written notice given before the WR Act repeal day, subject to the modifications set out in subitems (3) to (6). Terminations after that day are dealt with in Schedule 3 (which deals with transitional instruments)._

Modification—declaration to terminate must be lodged within 120 days of WR Act repeal day

(3)        A declaration may only be lodged, in relation to the ITEA under subsection 393(2) of the WR Act, as that subsection continues to apply because of subitem (2), before the end of the period (the **_cut-off period_**) of 120 days beginning on the WR Act repeal day.

(4)        Section 396 of the WR Act, as that section continues to apply because of subitem (2), does not apply in relation to the ITEA if the declaration is not lodged before the end of the cut-off period.

(5)        Despite subsection 381(2) and section 398 of the WR Act, as those provisions continue to apply because of subitem (2), the termination of the ITEA does not take effect if the declaration is not lodged before the end of the cut-off period.

(6)        If the termination is lodged after the end of the cut-off period, the Workplace Authority Director must give a written notice, stating that the termination cannot come into operation because the declaration was lodged after the end of the cut-off period, to the following:

                     (a)  the employer to which the agreement applies;

                     (b)  the employee to whom the agreement applies.

<h8 class="ActHead8">Division 7—Transitional provisions relating to making ITEAs during the bridging period</h8>

## 21  General rule—continued application of Part 8 to making of ITEAs

(1)        Despite the repeal of Part 8 of the WR Act, an ITEA may, during the bridging period, be made under Division 2 of that Part as if that Part had not been repealed.

(2)        The following provisions of Part 8 of the WR Act continue to apply in relation to the ITEA on and after the WR Act repeal day:

                     (a)  Divisions 1 to 5A of Part 8 (which deal with the making and lodgment of workplace agreements and the no-disadvantage test), other than sections 346ZJ and 346ZK (which deal with dismissing an employee if an agreement does not pass that test);

                     (b)  subsections 347(1) and (3) (which deal with when a workplace agreement comes into operation);

                     (c)  section 347A (which deals with the operation of workplace agreements);

                     (d)  Division 7 of Part 8 (which deals with content rules), other than sections 353 (which deals with dispute settlement) and 358 (which deals with prohibited content being void);

                     (e)  subsections 400(3) and (5), subsection 401(1) and section 412A.

_Note 1:    The general effect of this provision is to permit ITEAs to be made during the bridging period and to preserve the Part 8 rules about lodgment, the no-disadvantage test and prohibited content, subject to the modifications set out in this Division. The rules about variation and termination of ITEAs on and after the WR Act repeal day, and certain other rules, are contained in Schedule 3 (which deals with transitional instruments)._

_Note 2:    The rules requiring an ITEA to include dispute settlement procedures and about prohibited content being void continue to apply under subitem 4(1) of Schedule 3 (which deals with instrument content rules for transitional instruments)._

(3)        The provisions referred to in subitem (2) do not apply to an ITEA lodged after the end of the bridging period.

(4)        If the ITEA is lodged after the end of the bridging period, the Workplace Authority Director must give a written notice, stating that the ITEA cannot come into operation because the ITEA was lodged after the end of the bridging period, to the following:

                     (a)  the employer to which the ITEA would have applied if it had come into operation;

                     (b)  the employee to whom the ITEA would have applied if it had come into operation.

## 22  Modification—enterprise agreements and workplace determinations are taken to be instruments

(1)        This item applies to an ITEA made during the bridging period as referred to in subitem 21(1).

(2)        For the purposes of the application to the ITEA of section 346E of the WR Act, as that section continues to apply because of item 21, enterprise agreements and workplace determinations are taken to be specified in subsection 346E(3) (in addition to the other instruments so specified).

(3)        For the purposes of the application to the ITEA of section 346ZB of the WR Act, as that section continues to apply because of item 21, enterprise agreements and workplace determinations (within the meaning of the FW Act) are taken to be specified in subsection 346ZB(5) (in addition to the other instruments so specified).

## 23  Modification—limits on variation of an ITEA that operates from approval for the purpose of passing the no-disadvantage test

(1)        Despite item 21, if the ITEA is a workplace agreement that operates from approval, the rules in this item also apply.

(2)        Section 346N of the WR Act, as that section continues to apply because of item 21, has effect in relation to the ITEA, on and after the WR Act repeal day, as if it provided that a variation for the purposes of passing the no-disadvantage test set out in section 346D of that Act must be lodged under section 346N of that Act before the end of:

                     (a)  the period of 30 days beginning on the seventh day after the date of issue specified in the notice under subsection 346M(2) of that Act in relation to the ITEA; or

                     (b)  if the period is extended under subitem (3)—the period as extended

(3)        The Workplace Authority Director may extend the period referred to in paragraph (2)(a) in relation to a particular ITEA in circumstances prescribed by the regulations.

(4)        Section 346Q of the WR Act, as that section continues to apply because of item 21, has effect in relation to the ITEA, on and after the WR Act repeal day, as if it provided that the Workplace Authority Director must not consider under that section whether the ITEA as varied passes the no-disadvantage test unless the variation is lodged within the period referred to in paragraph (2)(a) or (b).

## 24  Modification—subsection 400(5)

(1)        This item applies to an ITEA made during the bridging period as referred to in subitem 21(1).

(2)        For the purposes of the application to the ITEA of subsection 400(5) of the WR Act, as that subsection continues to apply because of item 21, the circumstance referred to in subsection 400(6) of that Act is taken to include a reference to the circumstance referred to in subitem 25(2).

## 25  Effect of section 342 of the FW Act during the bridging period

(1)        Despite section 342 of the FW Act, a prospective employer does not contravene subsection 340(1) of that Act if, during the bridging period, the person refuses to employ a person merely because the person requires another person to make an ITEA as a condition of engagement, other than in the circumstance referred to in subitem (2).

(2)        The circumstance referred to in subitem (1) is that:

                     (a)  the first person mentioned in subitem (1) is a new employer; and

                     (b)  the new employer requires another person to make an ITEA; and

                     (c)  the other person would, if employed by the new employer, be a transferring employee; and

                     (d)  the requirement to make the ITEA is a condition of the other person becoming employed by the new employer.

<h8 class="ActHead8">Division 8—Applying the no-disadvantage test where there is a transmission or transfer of business</h8>

## 26  Applying the no-disadvantage test where there is a transmission or a transfer of business

(1)        This item applies if the Workplace Authority Director is required, because of the application of this Schedule to a workplace agreement, to decide, on or after the WR Act repeal day, whether the workplace agreement passes the no-disadvantage test.

(2)        Division 7A of Part 11 of the WR Act continues to apply, in relation to the workplace agreement, as if that Division had not been repealed, with the following modifications:

                     (a)  references to a workplace agreement binding an employer or an employee are taken to include references to a workplace agreement that is a transitional instrument covering an employer or employee;

                     (b)  references to sections 583 and 585 of the WR Act (other than in section 601D) are taken to include references to section 313 of the FW Act;

                     (c)  enterprise agreements and workplace determinations (within the meaning of the FW Act) are taken to be specified in the definition of **_instrument_** in subsection 601D(5) (in addition to the other instruments so specified);

                     (d)  the reference in subparagraph 601G(1)(b)(i) to the instrument described in paragraph 601D(2)(a) is taken to include a reference to the instrument described in paragraph 27(2)(a) of this Schedule;

                     (e)  the reference in subparagraph 601G(1)(b)(ii) to section 598A or clause 27A of Schedule 9 is taken to include a reference to item 9 of Schedule 11;

                      (f)  the reference in paragraph 601H(1)(b) to the time of transmission is taken to include a reference to the time when the new employer first employs a transferring employee;

                     (g)  paragraph 601H(2)(d) does not apply if the workplace agreement applies to the new employer because of the operation of section 313 of the FW Act.

## 27  Employment arrangements if there is a transfer of business and a workplace agreement ceases to operate because it does not pass the no-disadvantage test

(1)        This item applies if:

                     (a)  on a particular day (the **_cessation day_**), a workplace agreement (the **_original agreement_**) ceases to operate under section 346W or 346ZA of the WR Act (as those provisions continue to apply because of the operation of this Schedule) because the original agreement does not pass the no-disadvantage test; and

                     (b)  during the period beginning when the original agreement was lodged and ending on the cessation day, the original agreement started to cover a new employer and a transferring employee or transferring employees because of the operation of section 313 of the FW Act.

(2)        Despite subsection 346ZB(2) of the WR Act (as that provision continues to apply because of the operation of this Schedule), the new employer and the transferring employee or transferring employees who were covered by the original agreement immediately before the cessation day are taken, on and from the cessation day, to be covered by:

                     (a)  the instrument:

                              (i)  that, but for the original agreement having come into operation, would have covered the old employer and the transferring employee or transferring employees immediately before the termination of the employment of the transferring employee or transferring employees with the old employer; and

                             (ii)  that was capable of covering the new employer after the time the transferring employee or transferring employees became employed by the new employer under Schedule 11; or

                     (b)  if there is no instrument of a kind referred to in paragraph (a) in relation to the old employer and one or more of the transferring employees—the designated award (within the meaning of Division 5A of Part 8 of the WR Act) in relation to that employee or those employees.

(3)        If, but for the original agreement having come into operation, a redundancy provision would, immediately before the termination of the employment of a transferring employee or transferring employees with the old employer, have applied to the old employer in relation to a transferring employee or transferring employees to who the original agreement applied because of a preservation item (within the meaning of item 9 of Schedule 11) relating to the agreement, the redundancy provision is taken:

                     (a)  to apply to the new employer under item 9 of Schedule 11, on and from the cessation day, in relation to the transferring employee or transferring employees; and

                     (b)  to continue to so apply to the employer, in relation to the transferring employee or transferring employees, until the earliest of the following:

                              (i)  the end of the period of 24 months beginning on the first day on which the old employer became covered, under the preservation item, by the redundancy provision;

                             (ii)  the time when the transferring employee ceases to be employed by the new employer;

                            (iii)  the time when an enterprise agreement, workplace determination or ITEA starts to apply to the transferring employee or transferring employees and the new employer.

(4)        If the original agreement is a workplace agreement as varied under Division 8 of Part 8 of the WR Act, the workplace agreement as in force before the variation was lodged is, despite section 346ZE of that Act (as that section continues to apply because of the operation of this Schedule), capable of being an instrument described in paragraph (2)(a).

(5)        In this item:

**_award_** includes a State reference transitional award.

**_instrument_** means:

                     (a)  if the termination of the employment of the transferring employee or transferring employees with the old employer occurred before the WR Act repeal day—any of the following:

                              (i)  a workplace agreement;

                             (ii)  an award;

                            (iii)  a pre-reform certified agreement;

                            (iv)  a preserved State agreement;

                             (v)  a notional agreement preserving State awards; and

                     (b)  if the termination of the employment of the transferring employee or transferring employees with the old employer occurred on or after the WR Act repeal day—any of the following:

                              (i)  an instrument referred to in subparagraph (a)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) that is a transitional instrument;

                             (ii)  an enterprise agreement;

                            (iii)  a workplace determination made under the FW Act.

**_redundancy provision_** has the meaning given by subitem 38(7) of Schedule 3.

<h8 class="ActHead8">Division 9—Miscellaneous</h8>

## 28  References to variations under Division 8

To avoid doubt, a reference in this Part to a variation under Division 8 of Part 8 of the WR Act does not include a reference to a variation made for the purposes of passing the no-disadvantage test.

## 28A  Variations to pass no-disadvantage test after WR Act repeal day

Despite any other provision of Division 5A of Part 8 of the WR Act, as that Division continues to apply because of this Schedule in relation to:

                     (a)  a workplace agreement; or

                     (b)  a variation of such an agreement under Division 8 of that Part;

only one variation for the purposes of passing the no-disadvantage test of the agreement or variation may be lodged with the Workplace Authority Director on or after the WR Act repeal day.

## 29  Documents taken to be workplace agreements, etc.

To avoid doubt, sections 324A, 368A and 381A of the WR Act continue to have effect for the purposes of a provision of the WR Act that continues to apply because of this Act.

<h7 class="ActHead7">Part 3—Transitional provisions relating to workplace determinations made under the WR Act</h7>

## 30  Continued application of WR Act prohibited content provisions

(1)        This item applies to a workplace determination made under the WR Act before the WR Act repeal day.

(2)        Despite the repeal of section 506 of the WR Act, Subdivision B of Division 7 of Part 8 of that Act (which deals with prohibited content), other than section 358 (which deals with prohibited content being void), continues to apply in relation to the workplace determination on and after the WR Act repeal day as if that section had not been repealed.

_Note 1:    The general effect of this provision is to preserve the Part 8 rules about prohibited content for workplace determinations made before the WR Act repeal day. The rules about variation and termination of such workplace determinations, and certain other rules, are contained in Schedule 3 (which deals with transitional instruments)._

_Note 2:    The rules about prohibited content being void continue to apply under subitem 4(1) of Schedule 3 (which deals with instrument content rules for transitional instruments)._

## 31  Termination by approval general rule—continued application of lodgment provisions

(1)        This item applies to a termination of a workplace determination, if the termination has been approved in accordance with section 386 of the WR Act (which deals with terminations by approval) before the WR Act repeal day, but not lodged in accordance with section 389 of that Act before that day.

_Note:       Under subsection 506(3) of the WR Act, a workplace determination can only be terminated under Subdivision B of Division 9 of Part 8 of that Act after the determination has passed its nominal expiry date._

(2)        Despite the repeal of section 506 of the WR Act, the following provisions of that Act continue to apply in relation to the termination on and after the WR Act repeal day, as if that section had not been repealed:

                     (a)  subsection 381(2) (which deals with when a workplace determination is terminated);

                     (b)  subsections 384(4), (5) and (6) (which deal with non-compliance with information requirements);

                     (c)  section 387 (which deals with lodgment of unapproved terminations);

                     (d)  Subdivision C of Division 9 of Part 8 (which deals with lodgment);

                     (e)  section 398 (which deals with the effect of non-compliance);

                      (f)  subsection 401(1) and section 412A.

_Note:       The general effect of this provision is to preserve the Part 8 rules in relation to terminations of workplace determinations approved before the WR Act repeal day, subject to the modification set out in item 32\. Terminations after that day are dealt with in Schedule 3 (which deals with transitional instruments)._

## 32  Modification—unlodged terminations must be lodged within 14 days

(1)        Despite item 31, if a termination to which that item applies is an unlodged termination:

                     (a)  the termination does not come into operation unless it is lodged before the end of the 14 day period (the **_cut-off period_**) referred to in subsection 388(1) of the WR Act as that subsection continues to apply because of item 31; and

                     (b)  subsection 388(2) of the WR Act (which deals with a civil remedy for late lodgment), as that subsection continues to apply because of item 31, does not apply to the termination.

_Note:       The general effect of this provision is that unlodged terminations must be lodged within 14 days of being made in order to come into operation. However, late lodgment will not give rise to a civil remedy._

(2)        If the termination is lodged after the end of the cut-off period, the Workplace Authority Director must give a written notice, stating that the termination cannot come into operation because it was lodged after the end of the cut-off period, to the following:

                     (a)  the employer to which the workplace determination applies;

                     (b)  the employees to which the workplace determination applies.

(3)        In this item:

**_unlodged termination_**, in relation to a workplace determination, means a termination of a workplace determination approved in accordance with section 386 of the WR Act, but not lodged with the Workplace Authority Director under section 389 of that Act as at the WR Act repeal day.

## 33  Termination by the Commission—Commission may continue to deal with applications made before the WR Act repeal day

(1)        This item applies to a workplace determination in relation to which an application has been made under subsection 397A(2) of the WR Act (which deals with termination by the Commission) before the WR Act repeal day.

(2)        Despite the repeal of section 506 of the WR Act, the following provisions of that Act continue to apply in relation to the workplace determination on and after the WR Act repeal day as if that section had not been repealed:

                     (a)  subsection 381(2) (which deals with when a workplace determination is terminated);

                     (b)  subsections 397A(1) and (3) (which deal with when the Commission may terminate a workplace determination).

_Note:       The general effect of this provision is to preserve the Part 8 rules in relation to applications for terminations of workplace determinations by the Commission made before the WR Act repeal day. Terminations after that day are dealt with in Schedule 3 (which deals with transitional instruments)._

## 34  Documents taken to be workplace determinations, etc.

To avoid doubt, section 381A of the WR Act continues to apply for the purposes of a provision of that Act that continues to apply because of this Part.

FWA’s first annual wage review is to be conducted and completed in the period:

                     (a)  starting on the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day; and

                     (b)  ending at the end of the next 30 June;

(1)        In its first annual wage review, FWA does not have to set a full range of special national minimum wages covering all the classes of employees referred to in paragraph 294(1)(b) of the FW Act.

(2)        However, FWA must set a special national minimum wage for a class or subclass of those employees in its first annual wage review if the transitional national minimum wage order sets a special national minimum wage order for those employees.

_Note:       The transitional national minimum wage order is taken to have been made on the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day: see item 12._

(3)        If FWA does not set a full range of special national minimum wages in its first annual wage review, the President of  FWA must establish a process for the setting of the remaining special national minimum wages in FWA’s second annual wage review.

(4)        FWA may advise persons or bodies about that process in any way FWA considers appropriate.

(5)        Section 625 of the FW Act (which deals with delegation by the President of functions and powers of FWA) has effect as if subsection (2) of that section included a reference to FWA’s powers under subitem (4).

<h8 class="ActHead8">Division 1—General provisions</h8>

## 5  Continuation of Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard wages provisions

(1)        Division 2 (other than as provided in subitem (2)) of Part 7 of the WR Act continues to apply on and after the WR Act repeal day in accordance with this Part. That Division as it continues to apply is the **_continued AFPCS wages provisions_**.

_Note 1:    Part 7 of the WR Act contains the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard. Schedule 4 provides for the continued application of the rest of the Standard during the bridging period. The effect of this Division is not limited just to the bridging period._

_Note 2:    Schedule 3 provides for the continued application of the rules about the interaction between transitional instruments and the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard._

(2)        The continued application of Division 2 of Part 7 of the WR Act has effect subject to the following paragraphs:

                     (a)  subsections 182(1) and (2), and Subdivisions H, I, L and M, cease to apply when there are no longer any employees covered by transitional APCSs (see also item 11);

                     (b)  subsections 182(3) and (4), section 185 and Subdivision G cease to apply at the end of the bridging period (see also item 12;

                     (c)  Subdivision D does not continue to apply at all;

                     (d)  Subdivisions E, F, K and N cease to apply after the AFPC has ceased to exist (see item 7 of Schedule 18).

(3)        Without limiting subitem (1) (but subject to subitem (2)), each of the following, as it was under Division 2 of Part 7 of the WR Act immediately before the WR Act repeal day, continues to exist, as a **_transitional minimum wage instrument_**, in accordance with this Part on and after that day:

                     (a)  an APCS, which continues as a **_transitional APCS_**;

                     (b)  the rate of the standard FMW, which continues as the **_transitional standard FMW_**;

                     (c)  a special FMW, which continues as a **_transitional special FMW_**;

                     (d)  the rate of the default casual loading, which continues as the **_transitional default casual loading_**.

_Note:       APCS is short for Australian Pay and Classification Scale. FMW is short for Federal Minimum Wage._

(4)        Despite item 6 of Schedule 2, the following provisions of Part 21 of the WR Act do not apply in relation to the continued AFPCS wages provisions:

                     (a)  subparagraph 861(1)(d)(iii);

                     (b)  section 865.

_Note:       Paragraph (a) has a flow-through effect to the reference in subparagraph 885(1)(j) of the WR Act to section 861._

## 5A  References to workplace agreements include references to enterprise agreements

(1)        The provisions of the WR Act that continue to apply because of item 5 have effect as if a reference in the provisions to a workplace agreement included a reference to an enterprise agreement.

(2)        Subitem (1) has effect unless the context otherwise requires and subject to the regulations.

## 6  The employees who are _covered_ by transitional minimum wage instruments

(1)        Transitional minimum wage instruments **_cover_** employees as provided in the following paragraphs:

                     (a)  a transitional APCS covers an employee if, under sections 204 and 205 of the continued AFPCS wages provisions, the APCS covers the employment of the employee;

                     (b)  the transitional standard FMW covers an employee if, under section 194 of the continued AFPCS wages provisions, the FMW for the employee is the standard FMW;

                     (c)  a transitional special FMW covers an employee if, under section 194 of the continued AFPCS wages provisions, the FMW for the employee is that special FMW;

                     (d)  the transitional default casual loading covers an employee who is described in subsection 185(1) of the continued AFPCS wages provisions.

(2)        However, a transitional APCS does not cover an employee (or an employer, or an employee organisation, in relation to the employee) at a time when the employee is a high income employee (see section 329 of the FW Act).

_Note 1:    Item 35 of Schedule 3 deals with the application of section 329 of the FW Act to transitional APCSs._

_Note 2:    Divisions 2 and 3 of this Part deal with when transitional minimum wage instruments cease to cover employees._

## 7  Transitional minimum wage instruments can only be varied or terminated in limited circumstances

(1)        Despite anything in the continued AFPCS wages provisions, a transitional minimum wage instrument cannot be varied or terminated (or otherwise brought to an end) except as referred to in one of the following subitems.

(2)        The AFPC can exercise its wage-setting powers to vary a transitional minimum wage instrument as necessary depending on the outcome of the AFPC’s final wage review under the WR Act. Those exercises of wage-setting powers take effect at the time determined by the AFPC (which may be a time after the AFPC has ceased to exist).

_Note:       Schedule 18 provides for when the AFPC ceases to exist._

(3)        A transitional APCS can be varied in an annual wage review under the FW Act as provided for in item 10.

(4)        A transitional APCS can be varied or terminated under:

                     (a)  item 3 of Schedule 5 (which deals with variation and termination of transitional APCSs to take account of the Part 10A award modernisation process); or

                     (b)  item 9 of Schedule 6 (which deals with variation and termination of transitional APCSs to take account of the enterprise instrument modernisation process).

## 8  Effect of termination

If a transitional minimum wage instrument terminates, it ceases to cover (and can never again cover) any employees.

## 9  No loss of accrued rights or liabilities when transitional minimum wage instrument terminates or ceases to cover an employee

(1)        If a transitional minimum wage instrument terminates, or ceases to cover a person, that does not affect:

                     (a)  any right or liability that a person acquired, accrued or incurred before the transitional minimum wage instrument terminated or ceased to cover the person; or

                     (b)  any investigation, legal proceeding or remedy in respect of any such right or liability.

(2)        Any such investigation, legal proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or enforced as if the transitional minimum wage instrument had not terminated or ceased to cover the person.

<h8 class="ActHead8">Division 2—Special provisions about transitional APCSs</h8>

## 10  Variation of transitional APCS in annual wage reviews under the FW Act

(1)        In an annual wage review, FWA may make a determination varying a transitional APCS.

(2)        For that purpose, Division 3 of Part 2-6 of the FW Act (other than section 292) applies to a transitional APCS in the same way as it applies to a modern award.

## 11  Transitional APCS ceases to cover an employee if a modern award starts to cover the employee

A transitional APCS ceases to cover an employee when a modern award that covers the employee comes into operation.

<h8 class="ActHead8">Division 3—Special provisions about the FMW, special FMWs and the default casual loading</h8>

## 12  Cessation of coverage of transitional standard FMW etc.

(1)        On the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day, the transitional standard FMW, any transitional special FMWs and the transitional default casual loading cease to cover any employees. Subsections 182(3) and (4), and section 185, of the continued AFPCS wages provisions also cease to cover any employees.

(2)        On the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day, FWA is taken to have made a national minimum wage order (the **_transitional national minimum wage order_**) under Part 2-6 of the FW Act:

                     (a)  that:

                              (i)  sets the national minimum wage at the rate that was the transitional standard FMW immediately before that day; and

                             (ii)  requires employers to pay employees to whom the national minimum wage applies (see subsection 294(3) of the FW Act) a base rate of pay that at least equals the national minimum wage; and

                     (b)  if, immediately before that day, there was a transitional special FMW for a class of employees—that:

                              (i)  sets a special national minimum wage for that class of employees that is the same as the transitional special FMW immediately before that day; and

                             (ii)  requires employers to pay employees to whom that special national minimum wage applies (see subsection 294(4) of the FW Act) a base rate of pay that at least equals that special national minimum wage; and

                     (c)  that:

                              (i)  sets the casual loading for award/agreement free employees at the rate that was the transitional default casual loading immediately before that day; and

                             (ii)  requires employers to pay, to award/agreement free employees who are casual employees, a casual loading that at least equals the casual loading for award/agreement free employees (as applied to the employees’ base rates of pay).

_Note:       The requirement in paragraph 294(1)(b) of the FW Act that a national minimum wage order must set special national minimum wages for all award/agreement free employees in the classes referred to in that paragraph does not apply to the transitional national minimum wage order._

(3)        The hours for which a rate set in the transitional national minimum wage order is payable are the same as the hours for which the transitional standard FMW, transitional special FMW or transitional default casual loading (as the case requires) would have been payable under the continued AFPCS wages provisions.

<h7 class="ActHead7">Part 4—Universal application of minimum wages to employees</h7>

## 13  Base rate of pay under agreement-based transitional instrument must not be less than the modern award rate or the national minimum wage order rate etc.

If employee is covered by a modern award that is in operation

(1)        If, on or after the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day:

                     (a)  an agreement-based transitional instrument applies to an employee; and

                     (b)  a modern award that is in operation covers the employee;

the base rate of pay payable to the employee under the transitional instrument (the **_instrument rate_**) must not be less than the base rate of pay that would be payable to the employee under the modern award (the **_award rate_**) if the modern award applied to the employee.

(2)        If the instrument rate is less than the award rate, the transitional instrument has effect in relation to the employee as if the instrument rate were equal to the award rate.

If employee is not covered by a modern award that is in operation

(3)        If, on or after the FW (safety net provisions) commencement day:

                     (a)  an agreement-based transitional instrument applies to an employee; and

                     (b)  the employee is not covered by a modern award that is in operation; and

                     (c)  a national minimum wage order would, if the employee were an award/agreement free employee, require the employee’s employer to pay the employee a base rate of pay (the **_employee’s order rate_**) that at least equals the national minimum wage, or a special national minimum wage, set by the order;

the base rate of pay payable to the employee under the transitional instrument (the **_instrument_** **_rate_**) must not be less than the employee’s order rate.

(4)        If the instrument rate is less than the employee’s order rate, the transitional instrument has effect in relation to the employee as if the instrument rate were equal to the employee’s order rate.

_Note:       The AFPCS interaction rules may affect the base rate of pay payable to an employee (see item 22 of Schedule 3)._

## 14  FWA may make determinations to phase-in the effect of rate increases resulting from item 13  etc.

(1)        On application by an employer to whom a transitional instrument applies, FWA may make a determination the effect of which is to phase-in the effect of increases in base rates of pay that would otherwise take effect on a particular day because of:

                     (a)  item 13; or

                     (b)  subitem 22(2) of Schedule 3.

_Note:       Under subitem 22(2) of Schedule 3, AFPCS interaction rules that provide for instruments to prevail over the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard stop applying when the bridging period ends. That may result in an employee becoming entitled to a higher rate of pay under a transitional APCS._

(2)        FWA must not make a determination under this item in relation to an employer unless it is satisfied that the determination is necessary to ensure the ongoing viability of the employer’s enterprise.

(3)        Item 13, and subitem 22(2) of Schedule 3, have effect in relation to an employer subject to any determinations FWA makes under this item.

## 15  Enterprise agreement base rate of pay not to be less than transitional minimum wage instrument rate

(1)        If:

                     (a)  a transitional minimum wage instrument covers an employee; and

                     (b)  an enterprise agreement applies to the employee;

the base rate of pay payable to the employee under the enterprise agreement (the **_agreement rate_**) must not be less than the base rate of pay that is payable to the employee under the transitional minimum wage instrument (the **_instrument_** **_rate_**).

(2)        If the agreement rate is less than the instrument rate, the enterprise agreement has effect in relation to the employee as if the agreement rate were equal to the instrument rate.

_Note:       If a transitional instrument applies to an employee who is covered by a transitional minimum wage instrument, then (subject to the continued application of the AFPCS interaction rules) the employee must be paid at least the rate required by the continued AFPCS wages provisions._

###### Schedule 10—Equal remuneration

<h7 class="ActHead7">Part 1—Preliminary</h7>

## 1  Meaning of _employee_

In this Schedule, **_employee_** means a national system employee.

<h7 class="ActHead7">Part 2—Equal remuneration orders under the FW Act</h7>

## 2  FWA must take into account AFPC’s final wage review

(1)        This item applies in relation to a decision whether to make an equal remuneration order under Part 2-7 of the FW Act during the period:

                     (a)  starting on the WR Act repeal day; and

                     (b)  ending on the day FWA completes its first annual wage review.

(2)        In deciding whether to make the equal remuneration order, FWA must take into account the outcome of the AFPC’s final wage review under the WR Act.

## 3  Inconsistency with certain instruments and orders

(1)        A term of an instrument or order referred to in subitem (2) has no effect in relation to an employee to the extent that it is less beneficial to the employee than a term of an equal remuneration order that:

                     (a)  is made under Part 2-7 of the FW Act; and

                     (b)  applies to the employee.

(2)        For the purposes of subitem (1), the instruments and orders are as follows:

                     (a)  a transitional instrument;

                     (b)  an order of the Commission made under the WR Act;

                     (c)  a transitional APCS.

_Note:       A term of a modern award, an enterprise agreement or an FWA order also has no effect in relation to an employee to the extent that it is less beneficial to the employee than a term of an equal remuneration order that is made under Part 2-7 of the FW Act and applies to the employee (see section 306 of the FW Act)._

<h7 class="ActHead7">Part 3—Equal remuneration orders under the WR Act</h7>

## 4  Continued effect of equal remuneration orders

(1)        An order (a **_WR Act equal remuneration order_**) that was:

continues to have effect on and after the WR Act repeal day.

(2)        A WR Act equal remuneration order may be varied or revoked by FWA under subsections 603(1) and (2) of the FW Act as if it were an order made under Part 2-7 of the FW Act.

## 5  Inconsistency with certain instruments and orders

(1)        A term of an instrument or order referred to in subitem (2) has no effect in relation to an employee to the extent that it is less beneficial to the employee than a term of an order that:

                     (a)  was made under Division 3 of Part 12 of the WR Act (as in force from time to time); and

                     (b)  was in force immediately before the WR Act repeal day; and

                     (c)  applies to the employee.

                      (f)  an order of the Commission made under the WR Act.

###### Schedule 11—Transfer of business

<h7 class="ActHead7">Part 1—Preliminary</h7>

## 1  Meanings of _employee_ and _employer_

In this Schedule, **_employee_** and **_employer_** have their ordinary meanings.

<h7 class="ActHead7">Part 2—Transmissions of business occurring before WR Act repeal day</h7>

## 2  General rule—continued application of WR Act

(1)        This Part applies if:

                     (a)  at a time (the **_time of transmission_**), a person (the **_new employer_**) became the successor, transmittee or assignee of the whole, or a part, of a business of another person (the **_old employer_**); and

                     (b)  the time of transmission was before the WR Act repeal day.

(2)        The following provisions of Part 11 of the WR Act (as modified by items 5 and 6 of this Schedule) continue to apply in relation to the transmission of business on and after the WR Act repeal day:

                     (a)  Divisions 1 and 2 (which deal with introductory matters);

                     (b)  Division 3 (which deals with the transmission of ITEAs) (other than subsection 583(2) and section 584);

                     (h)  Division 8 (which deals with notice requirements and enforcement) (other than section 605).

(2A)     For the purpose of the continued application, by subitem (2), of Division 5 of Part 11 of the WR Act:

                     (a)  a reference in those provisions to an award is taken to include a reference to a State reference transitional award; and

                     (b)  despite item 6 of Schedule 2, paragraph 885(1)(e) of that Act does not continue to apply.

_Note:       Paragraph 885(1)(e) would otherwise have disapplied Division 5 of Part 11 of the WR Act._

(3)        The following provisions of Schedule 9 to the WR Act (as modified by items 5 and 6 of this Schedule) continue to apply in relation to the transmission of business on and after the WR Act repeal day:

                     (a)  Parts 1 and 2 (which deal with introductory matters);

                     (b)  Part 2A (which deals with the transmission of AWAs) (other than subclauses 6B(2) and (3) and clause 6C);

                     (g)  Part 6 (which deals with notice requirements and enforcement) (other than clause 31).

## 3  Period for which transmitted transitional instrument etc. continues to cover or apply to new employer

Transitional instrument covers new employer

(1)        If the new employer is covered by a transitional instrument in relation to a transferring employee because of a provision of Part 11 of the WR Act or Schedule 9 to that Act, the new employer remains covered by the transitional instrument, by force of this subitem, until whichever of the following first occurs:

                     (a)  the instrument is terminated;

                     (b)  the transmission period ends;

                     (c)  the instrument otherwise ceases to cover the new employer in relation to the transferring employee.

(2)        However, paragraph (1)(b) does not apply in relation to a pre-reform certified agreement if:

                     (a)  the pre-reform certified agreement is a Division 3 pre-reform certified agreement; and

                     (b)  the old employer was not an employer within the meaning of subsection 6(1) of the WR Act immediately before the time of transmission; and

                     (c)  the new employer was an employer within the meaning of subsection 6(1) of the WR Act at the time of transmission; and

                     (d)  the transmission of business occurs as part of the process of the employer in relation to the business being transferred becoming an employer within the meaning of subsection 6(1) of the WR Act.

Transitional APCS covers new employer

(3)        If a transferring employee’s employment with the new employer is covered by a transitional APCS because of Division 6 of Part 11 of the WR Act, the transferring employee’s employment with the new employer remains covered by that APCS until whichever of the following first occurs:

                     (a)  the transitional APCS is terminated;

                     (b)  the transitional APCS otherwise ceases to cover the transferring employee.

Preserved redundancy provisions apply to new employer

(4)        If a redundancy provision applies to the new employer and a transferring employee because of Division 6A of Part 11 of the WR Act or Part 5A of Schedule 9 to that Act, the redundancy provision continues to apply to the new employer and the transferring employee until the earliest of the following:

                     (a)  the end of the period of 24 months from the time that the agreement that contained the redundancy provision ceased operating;

                     (b)  the time when the transferring employee ceases to be employed by the new employer;

                     (c)  the time when an enterprise agreement, workplace determination or ITEA starts to apply to the employee.

## 4  Effect of industry-specific redundancy scheme in modern award in relation to preserved redundancy provisions

If:

                     (a)  a redundancy provision applies to the new employer and a transferring employee because of Division 6A of Part 11 of the WR Act or Part 5A of Schedule 9 to that Act; and

                     (b)  an industry-specific redundancy scheme in a modern award applies to the transferring employee; and

                     (c)  the redundancy provision is detrimental to the transferring employee, in any respect, when compared to the scheme in the modern award;

then, despite subsection 598A(2) of the WR Act or subclause 27A(2) of Schedule 9 to that Act (as the case requires), the scheme in the modern award prevails over the redundancy provision, to the extent that the redundancy provision is detrimental to the transferring employee.

## 5  Modification—applications to Commission in relation to transmission of certain transitional instruments

Certain provisions have effect subject to orders of the Commission

(1)        Subsection 585(1) of the WR Act (as it continues to apply because of subitem 2(2) of this Schedule) and subitem 3(1) of this Schedule (to the extent that it applies in relation to a transitional instrument that is a collective agreement) have effect subject to any order of the Commission under section 590 of the WR Act (as that section continues to apply because of subitem 2(2) of this Schedule).

(2)        Subsection 595(1) of the WR Act (as it continues to apply because of subitem 2(2) of this Schedule) and subitem 3(1) of this Schedule (to the extent that it applies in relation to a transitional instrument that is an award or a State reference transitional award) have effect subject to any order of the Commission (other than an order that would have the effect of extending the transmission period).

(3)        Subclauses 10(1), (2) and (3) of Schedule 9 to the WR Act (as they continue to apply because of subitem 2(3) of this Schedule) and subitems 3(1) and (2) of this Schedule (to the extent that they apply in relation to a transitional instrument that is a pre-reform certified agreement) have effect subject to any order of the Commission under clause 14 of Schedule 9 to the WR Act (as that clause continues to apply because of subitem 2(3) of this Schedule).

(4)        Subclause 19(1) of Schedule 9 to the WR Act (as it continues to apply because of subitem 2(3) of this Schedule) and subitem 3(1) of this Schedule (to the extent that it applies in relation to a transitional instrument that is a State transitional instrument) have effect subject to any order of the Commission under clause 23 of Schedule 9 to the WR Act (as that clause continues to apply because of subitem 2(3) of this Schedule).

Time within which application to Commission may be made

(5)        The following provisions of the WR Act (as they continue to apply because of item 2 of this Schedule) are modified by omitting “before, at or after the transfer time” and substituting “not later than 90 days after the WR Act repeal day”:

                     (a)  section 591 (which deals with collective agreements);

                     (c)  paragraphs 319(1)(c) and (2)(c).

(6)        Paragraph 319(1)(b) of the FW Act applies in relation to the transfer of business as if the words “(other than an individual agreement-based transitional instrument)” were inserted after the words “a transferable instrument”.

<h8 class="ActHead8">Division 2—Transfer of preserved redundancy provisions during bridging period</h8>

## 9  Transfer of preserved redundancy provisions

(1)        This item applies if:

                     (a)  there is a transfer of business from an employer (the **_old employer_**) to another employer (the **_new employer_**) as described in subsection 311(1) of the FW Act; and

                     (b)  the connection between the old employer and the new employer referred to in paragraph 311(1)(d) of the FW Act occurs during the bridging period; and

                     (c)  immediately before the termination of an employee’s employment with the old employer, a redundancy provision applied to the old employer and the employee because of a preservation item or a previous application of this item; and

                     (d)  the employee is a transferring employee in relation to the transfer of business.

(2)        This item applies regardless of whether:

                     (a)  the termination of the transferring employee’s employment with the old employer occurs before, on or after the WR Act repeal day; or

                     (b)  the employment of the transferring employee by the new employer occurs before, on or after the WR Act repeal day.

(3)        The redundancy provision applies to the new employer and the transferring employee after the time the transferring employee becomes employed by the new employer.

(4)        Subject to subitem (5), the redundancy provision prevails over any other redundancy provision included in any other instrument that would otherwise have effect, to the extent of any inconsistency (even if the provisions in that other instrument might be more beneficial to the transferring employee).

(5)        However, if:

                     (a)  an industry-specific redundancy scheme in a modern award applies to the transferring employee; and

                     (b)  the redundancy provision is detrimental to the transferring employee, in any respect, when compared to the scheme in the modern award;

then the scheme in the modern award prevails over the redundancy provision, to the extent that the redundancy provision is detrimental to the transferring employee.

(6)        The redundancy provision continues to apply to the new employer and the transferring employee until the earliest of the following:

                     (a)  the end of the period of 24 months from the time that the agreement that contained the redundancy provision ceased operating;

                     (b)  the time when the transferring employee ceases to be employed by the new employer;

                     (c)  the time when an enterprise agreement, workplace determination or ITEA starts to apply to the transferring employee.

(7)        In this item:

**_instrument_** has the meaning given by subitem 38(7) of Schedule 3.

**_preservation item_** means any of the following:

                     (a)  item 38 of Schedule 3;

                     (b)  item 40 of Schedule 3;

                     (c)  a provision of Division 6A of Part 11 of the WR Act or Part 5A of Schedule 9 to that Act (as those provisions continue to apply because of item 2 of this Schedule).

**_redundancy provision_** has the meaning given by subitem 38(7) of Schedule 3.

## 10  Notification of transfer of preserved redundancy provisions

(1)        This item applies if one or more redundancy provisions apply to the new employer and a transferring employee under item 9 of this Schedule.

(2)        Within 28 days after the time the transferring employee becomes employed by the new employer, the new employer must take reasonable steps to give the transferring employee a written notice that complies with subitem (3).

_Note:       This is a civil remedy provision: see subitem 11(3) of Schedule 16._

(3)        The notice must:

                     (a)  identify the redundancy provision or the redundancy provisions; and

                     (b)  state that the provision or provisions apply to the new employer and the transferring employee; and

                     (c)  specify the date on which the period of 24 months, being the period that applies in relation to the provision or provisions under paragraph 9(6)(a) of this Schedule, ends; and

                     (d)  state that the provision or provisions will continue to apply to the new employer and the transferring employee until that date, or an earlier date in accordance with subitem 9(6) of this Schedule.

(4)        Subitem (2) does not apply if an enterprise agreement, workplace determination or ITEA starts to apply to the transferring employee within 14 days after the time the transferring employee becomes employed by the new employer.

## 11  Lodging copy of notice about preserved redundancy provisions with FWA

(1)        If the new employer gives a notice under subitem 10(2) of this Schedule to a transferring employee, the new employer must lodge a copy of the notice with FWA within the period specified in subitem (2). The copy must be lodged in accordance with subitem (3).

_Note:       This is a civil remedy provision: see subitem 11(4) of Schedule 16._

(2)        The notice must be lodged within 14 days after the day specified in paragraph (a) or (b) (as the case requires):

                     (a)  if the new employer gives a notice to a transferring employee in respect of a redundancy provision that was included in an ITEA, a pre-reform AWA or a preserved individual State agreement—the day on which that notice is given; or

                     (b)  if the new employer gives one or more notices to one or more transferring employees in respect of a redundancy provision that was included in a collective agreement, a pre-reform certified agreement or a preserved collective State agreement—the earliest day on which a notice was given.

(3)        A notice is lodged with FWA in accordance with this item only if it is actually received by FWA.

_Note:       This means that section 29 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (to the extent that it deals with the time of service of documents) does not apply to lodgment of a notice._

## 12  FWA must issue receipt for lodgment

(1)        If a notice is lodged under item 11 of this Schedule, FWA must issue a receipt for the lodgment.

(2)        The receipt must state that the notice was lodged under item 11 of this Schedule on a particular day.

(3)        FWA must give a copy of the receipt to the person who lodged the notice under item 11 of this Schedule.

<h8 class="ActHead8">Division 3—Transfer of entitlements under the AFPCS during bridging period</h8>

## 13  Transfer of entitlements under the AFPCS

(1)        This item applies if:

                     (b)  the employment of a transferring employee by the new employer occurs before, on or after the WR Act repeal day.

(3)        Despite the repeal of Division 7 of Part 11 of the WR Act (which deals with an employee’s entitlements under the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard), that Division applies in relation to the transfer of business as if:

                     (a)  a reference in the following provisions to at the time of transmission were a reference to at the time the transferring employee becomes employed by the new employer:

                              (i)  subsection 599(1);

                             (ii)  subsection 600(2);

                            (iii)  subsection 601(2); and

                     (b)  a reference in the following provisions to before the time of transmission were a reference to before the termination of the transferring employee’s employment with the old employer:

                              (i)  subparagraph 599(1)(a)(ii);

                             (ii)  paragraphs 599(3)(a) and (b) and (4)(b);

                     (d)  a reference in subsection 599(4) to after the time of transmission were a reference to after the time of termination of the transferring employee’s employment with the old employer; and

                     (e)  a reference in subsections 600(1) and 601(1) to before the time of transmission were a reference to before the time the transferring employee becomes employed by the new employer; and

                      (f)  the reference to section 605 in the note to subsection 599(4) were a reference to subitem 11(5) of Schedule 16 to the _Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 2009_.

###### Schedule 12—General protections

## 1  Meanings of _employee_ and _employer_

In this Schedule, **_employee_** and **_employer_** have their ordinary meanings.

## 2  Application in relation to Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard

For the purposes of the operation of Part 3-1 of the FW Act in relation to the bridging period, a reference in that Part to the National Employment Standards is taken to include a reference to the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard.

_Note:       References in Part 3-1 of the FW Act to the National Employment Standards are found in paragraph 344(a) and subparagraph 354(1)(a)(i) of that Act._

## 3  Application in relation to award-based transitional instruments and agreement-based transitional instrument

(1)        Part 3-1 of the FW Act has effect as if:

                     (a)  a reference in that Part to an enterprise agreement included a reference to an agreement-based transitional instrument; and

                     (b)  a reference in that Part to a modern award included a reference to an award-based transitional instrument.

_Note:       References in Part 3-1 of the FW Act:_

(a)    to an enterprise agreement are found in paragraphs 341(2)(e) and (g), paragraph 344(b), subsection 353(3) and subparagraphs 354(1)(a)(iii) and (b)(ii) of that Act; and

(b)    to a modern award are found in paragraphs 341(2)(g) and 344(b) of Part 3-1 of that Act.

(2)        Without limiting subitem (1), paragraph 344(b) of the FW Act has effect in relation to the bridging period as if a term referred to in that paragraph were a term of an agreement-based transitional instrument or an award-based transitional instrument that dealt with:

                     (a)  averaging of hours of work; or

                     (b)  cashing out paid annual leave; or

                     (c)  taking paid annual leave; or

                     (h)  paid loadings for school-based apprentices and trainees in lieu of paid annual leave, paid annual leave or paid absence on public holidays.

_Note:       This means, for example, that an employer is prohibited from exerting undue influence or undue pressure on an employee to have the employee agree to a cashing out of annual leave arrangement under a term of a pre-reform certified agreement._

###### Schedule 12A—Unfair dismissal

## 1  Meanings of _employee_ and _employer_

In this Schedule, **_employee_** and **_employer_** have their ordinary meanings.

## 2  Meaning of _small business employer_, for unfair dismissal purposes, prior to 1 January 2011

(1)        For the purposes of the application of Part 3-2 of the FW Act in relation to the dismissal of a person before 1 January 2011, a national system employer is a **_small business employer_** if, and only if, the employer’s number of full-time equivalent employees, worked out under this item, is less than 15 at the earlier of the following times (the **_notice or dismissal time_**):

                     (a)  the time when the person is given notice of the dismissal;

                     (b)  immediately before the dismissal.

(2)        The employer’s **_number of full-time equivalent employees_** at the notice or dismissal time is worked out as follows:

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.    For each person who was an employee of the employer at any time during the period of 4 weeks immediately preceding the day on which the notice or dismissal time occurs, work out the number of ordinary hours (including parts of hours) of the person as the employer’s employee during the period.

                   Note:             Subitem (3) sets out what are a person’s ordinary hours.

Step 2.    If, during the period, the person took leave to which subitem (4) applies, work out the number of hours of leave to which that subitem applies that the person took during the period.

Step 3\. Add together all of the numbers of ordinary hours worked out under step 1, and subtract all of the number of hours of leave worked out under step 2.

Step 4\. Divide by 152 the number worked out under step 3\. The result is the employer’s **_number of full-time equivalent employees_** at the notice or dismissal time.

                   Note:             The number 152 is based on the maximum number of hours that a full-time employee would work in 4 weeks (being 38 hours per week) excluding reasonable additional hours.

* * *

(3)        For the purposes of step 1 of the method statement in subitem (2), the ordinary hours of work of a person as the employer’s employee are:

                     (a)  to the extent that a modern award, enterprise agreement or workplace determination applied to the person, and the person was not a casual employee—the ordinary hours of work specified or provided for in that award, agreement or determination; or

                     (b)  to the extent that a transitional instrument applied to the person, and the person was not a casual employee—the person’s ordinary hours of work under item 33 of Schedule 3; or

                     (c)  to the extent that:

                              (i)  a State industrial instrument applied to the person as a non-national system employee; and

                             (ii)  the instrument specified, or provided for the determination of, the person’s ordinary hours of work; and

                            (iii)  the person was not a casual employee;

                            the ordinary hours of work as specified in, or determined in accordance with, that instrument; or

                     (d)  to the extent that no such award, agreement, determination or instrument applied to the person, and the person was not a casual employee:

                              (i)  if the person was a national system employee—the person’s ordinary hours of work under section 20 of the FW Act; or

                             (ii)  if the person was a non-national system employee—what would have been the person’s ordinary hours of work under that section if the person had been a national system employee; or

                     (e)  to the extent that the person was a casual employee—the lesser of:

                              (i)  152 hours; and

                             (ii)  the number of hours actually worked by the person.

(4)        This subitem applies to leave, whether paid or unpaid, that the person took if:

                     (a)  the person was entitled to the leave in connection with:

                              (i)  the birth of a child of the person or the person’s spouse or de facto partner; or

                             (ii)  the placement of a child with the person for adoption; and

                     (b)  the duration of the period of leave has been at least 4 weeks;

            whether or not the person took any other kind of paid leave while taking that leave.

(5)        For the purposes of this item, a national system employer and the employer’s associated entities are taken to be one entity.

(6)        This item has effect despite section 23 of the FW Act.

###### Schedule 13—Bargaining and industrial action

<h7 class="ActHead7">Part 1—Preliminary</h7>

## 1  Meanings of _employee_ and _employer_

In this Schedule, **_employee_** means a national system employee and **_employer_** means a national system employer.

<h7 class="ActHead7">Part 2—Bargaining</h7>

## 2  Employee covered by individual agreement-based transitional instrument is taken not to be an employee who will be, or who is, covered by enterprise agreement in certain circumstances

(1)        This item applies to an employee at a particular time if, at that time, an individual agreement-based transitional instrument covers the employee.

(2)        The employee is only taken, for the purposes of the FW Act, to be at that time an employee who is or will be covered by an enterprise agreement or a proposed enterprise agreement, if one of the following applies:

                     (a)  the nominal expiry date of the individual agreement-based transitional instrument has passed;

                     (b)  a conditional termination of the individual agreement-based transitional instrument has been made under subitem 18(2) of Schedule 3.

_Note:       The main effect of this subitem is that an employee who is covered by an individual agreement-based transitional instrument will not be able to do any of the following until the nominal expiry date of the instrument passes or a conditional termination of the instrument is made under subitem 18(2) of Schedule 3:_

(a)    be represented in bargaining for an enterprise agreement; 

(b)    vote on the agreement;

(c)    be in a group of employees covered by a protected action ballot order in relation to the agreement;

(d)    have the agreement apply to the employee.

(3)        Despite subitem (2), an employer must give a notice of employee representational rights to an employee under section 173 of the FW Act, if the employer would have been required to give such a notice but for subitem (2). However, the notice must explain that a person can only become the employee’s bargaining representative for the agreement when one of the following occurs:

                     (a)  the nominal expiry date of the individual agreement-based transitional instrument passes;

                     (b)  a conditional termination of the individual agreement-based transitional instrument is made under subitem 18(2) of Schedule 3.

## 3  Application for bargaining order where certain collective agreement-based transitional instruments have not passed nominal expiry date

Despite subsection 229(3) of the FW Act, if one or more of the following transitional instruments apply to an employee, or employees, who will be covered by a proposed enterprise agreement:

                     (a)  a collective agreement;

                     (b)  a workplace determination;

                     (c)  a preserved collective State agreement;

                     (d)  a pre-reform certified agreement;

                     (e)  a section 170MX award;

an application for a bargaining order may only be made under subsection 229(1) of that Act:

                      (f)  not more than 90 days before the nominal expiry date of the transitional instrument, or the latest nominal expiry date of those transitional instruments (as the case may be); or

                     (g)  after an employer that will be covered by the proposed enterprise agreement has requested under subsection 181(1) of that Act that employees approve the agreement, but before the agreement is so approved.

<h7 class="ActHead7">Part 3—Industrial action</h7>

## 4  Industrial action must not be taken before the nominal expiry date of transitional instrument

(1)        The following provisions of the FW Act:

                     (a)  section 417 (which prohibits industrial action before the nominal expiry date of enterprise agreements etc.);

                     (b)   item 14 of the table in subsection 539(2) of the FW Act (which deals with civil remedies);

apply, on and after the WR Act repeal day, in relation to an agreement-based transitional instrument, in a corresponding way to the way that those provisions apply in relation to an enterprise agreement.

(2)        Subitem (1) does not apply to an individual agreement-based transitional instrument if the employee and employer covered by the instrument have made a conditional termination in relation to the instrument under subitem 18(2) of Schedule 3.

_Note:       The effect of this provision is that an employee who is covered by an agreement-based transitional instrument may not organise or engage in industrial action until after the nominal expiry date of the instrument has passed. However, this does not apply to an individual agreement-based transitional instrument in relation to which a conditional termination has been made._

(3)        For the purposes of subitem (1), the reference in subsection 417(1) of the WR Act to the day on which an enterprise agreement was approved by FWA is taken to be a reference to the day on which the agreement-based transitional instrument became such an instrument.

## 5  Applications on foot under sections 496 and 497 of the WR Act

(1)        Despite the repeal of sections 496 and 497 of the WR Act, if:

                     (a)  before the WR Act repeal day, an application was made to the Commission or the Court under either of those sections; and

                     (b)  the application had not been finally dealt with as at the WR Act repeal day;

the Commission or the Court, as the case requires, must consider the application on or after that day as if the WR Act had not been repealed.

(2)        To avoid doubt, if the Commission or the Court does not make an order, or grant an injunction, under section 496 or 497 of the WR Act, as those sections continue to apply because of subitem (1), the decision not to make the order or grant the injunction does not affect whether or not the industrial action concerned is protected industrial action under the FW Act.

## 6  Continuation of section 496 and 497 orders and injunctions

Despite the repeal of sections 496 and 497 of the WR Act:

                     (a)  an order made, or an injunction granted, under either of those provisions that was in operation immediately before the WR Act repeal day continues to have effect on and after that day; and

                     (b)  a person who, immediately before the WR Act repeal day, was required to comply with the order or injunction must not breach the order or injunction on or after the WR repeal day.

## 7  Civil remedy provisions of FW Act apply to section 496 orders

Subsections 421(1), (3) and (4) and item 15 of the table in subsection 539(2) of the FW Act have effect, on and after the WR Act repeal day, as if:

                     (a)  references in those provisions to an order under section 418 included references to an order under subsection 496(1) of the WR Act as referred to in item 5 or 6 of this Schedule; and

                     (b)  references in those provisions to an order under section 419 included references to an order under subsection 496(2) of the WR Act as referred to in item 5 or 6 of this Schedule; and

                     (c)  references in those provisions to an order under section 420 included references to an order under subsection 496(6) of the WR Act as referred to in item 5 or 6 of this Schedule.

## 8  Effect of orders terminating bargaining periods upon industrial action related workplace determinations

(1)        This item applies if one of the following is in force in relation to a proposed collective agreement under the WR Act immediately before the WR Act repeal day:

                     (a)  an order terminating a bargaining period under subsection 430(1) of the WR Act that was made on the ground, or on grounds including the ground, that the Commission was satisfied as mentioned in subsection 430(3) of that Act;

                     (b)  a declaration by the Minister under section 498 of the WR Act (which deals with industrial action endangering life, etc.).

(2)        Divisions 3 and 5 of Part 2-5 of the FW Act have effect, on and after the WR Act repeal day, in relation to the making of an industrial action related workplace determination, as if:

                     (a)  references to a termination of industrial action instrument included references to the order or declaration referred to in subitem (1); and

                     (b)  references to a proposed enterprise agreement included references to the proposed collective agreement; and

                     (c)  references to the bargaining representatives for a proposed enterprise agreement included references to the persons who were, immediately before the WR Act repeal day, negotiating parties for the proposed collective agreement; and

                     (d)  references to an employer or employee that would have been covered by a proposed enterprise agreement included references to an employer or employee, as the case requires, that would have been bound by the proposed collective agreement; and

                     (e)  the reference in paragraph 275(g) to bargaining representatives complying with the good faith bargaining requirements included a reference to the negotiating parties genuinely trying to reach agreement in relation to the proposed collective agreement.

_Note:       The effect of this provision is that FWA may make an industrial action related workplace determination under the FW Act based on conduct, orders and declarations in relation to negotiations for a proposed collective agreement under the WR Act._

## 9  Commission must not deal further with applications, appeals or reviews relating to bargaining periods

If:

                     (a)  before the WR Act repeal day, an application was made under Division 2 of Part 9 of the WR Act for the suspension or termination of a bargaining period; and

                     (b)  the application had not been finally dealt with as at the WR Act repeal day;

the Commission must not, on or after that day, deal with or continue to deal with the application, or any appeal or review relating to the application.

## 10  Effect of suspension or termination orders on or after the WR Act repeal day

An order under Division 2 of Part 9 of the WR Act suspending or terminating a bargaining period is of no effect on or after the WR Act repeal day, other than as referred to in item 8.

## 11  Notices of industrial action of no effect on or after WR Act repeal day

A notice of intention to take industrial action given under section 441 of the WR Act before the WR Act repeal day is of no effect on or after that day.

<h7 class="ActHead7">Part 4—Protected action ballots</h7>

## 12  Commission must not deal further with application, appeal or review relating to ballot order

The Commission must not, on or after the WR Act repeal day, deal with or continue to deal with any application, appeal or review relating to a ballot order.

## 13  Ballot orders and authorisations have no effect on or after WR Act repeal day

(1)        A ballot order under subsection 451(1) of the WR Act, or a ballot or authorisation under such an order, has no effect on or after the WR Act repeal day.

_Note:       This means that no protected action ballots can be conducted or continued on or after the WR Act repeal day, and any nomination in a ballot order of a person as an authorised ballot agent, or as an authorised independent adviser, will also have no effect._

(2)        This item has effect subject to items 14A and 15.

## 14  Continuation of sections 476, 477 and 479 of the WR Act for protected action ballots completed before WR Act repeal day

            The following provisions of Part 9 of the WR Act continue to apply in relation to a ballot completed before the WR Act repeal day as if that Part had not been repealed:

                     (a)  section 476;

## <a id="14A"></a>14A  FWA may order that industrial action is taken to be authorised by a protected action ballot

(2)        The application must be made within 28 days after the WR Act repeal day.

(3)        FWA may order that industrial action that was authorised under section 478 of the WR Act in relation to the proposed collective agreement is taken to be authorised, in relation to the proposed enterprise agreement, by a protected action ballot under subsection 459(1) of the FW Act, if FWA is satisfied that:

                     (a)  on or after 1 March 2009, the person organised or engaged in industrial action, for the purpose of supporting or advancing claims in relation to the proposed collective agreement; and

                     (b)  all such industrial action organised or engaged in by the person was:

                              (i)  authorised by a protected action ballot under section 478 of the WR Act; and

                     (c)  the person did not first organise or engage in such industrial action on or after the WR Act repeal day; and

                     (d)  no collective agreement covering the employees whose employment would have been subject to the proposed collective agreement was approved by those employees before the WR Act repeal day; and

                     (e)  the proposed enterprise agreement will cover those employees; and

                      (f)  the person is genuinely trying to reach agreement in relation to the proposed enterprise agreement; and

                     (g)  it is reasonable in all the circumstances to make the order.

(4)        Industrial action that is taken to be authorised because of the operation of subitem (3) is only taken to be authorised in relation to employees who:

                     (a)  will be covered by the proposed enterprise agreement; and

                     (b)  were relevant employees (within the meaning of section 450 of the WR Act) in relation to the proposed collective agreement.

(5)        For the purposes of subsection 414(3) of the FW Act, the results of the protected action ballot under that Act are taken to have been declared on the day of the order.

## 17  Restriction on when protected action ballot orders may be made—certain agreement-based transitional instruments cover employees who will be covered by proposed enterprise agreement

(2)        An application for a protected action ballot order must not be made under subsection 437(1) of the FW Act earlier than 30 days before the nominal expiry date of the transitional instrument, or the latest nominal expiry date of those transitional instruments (as the case may be).

(3)        To avoid doubt, making an application for a protected action ballot order does not constitute organising industrial action.

_Note:       See section 5C._

##### <a id="1"></a>1  Recognition of State-registered associations

                     (a)  the association has no federal counterpart; and

                     (b)  the law of a State under which the association is registered is a law to which subclause (2) applies.

                     (a)  a copy of the current rules of the association; and

                     (b)  as if a recognised State-registered association were a person.

             (2)  To avoid doubt, this section does not confer on a recognised State-registered association:

                     (a)  a legal identity that it would not otherwise have; or

                     (b)  a right to represent its members’ industrial interests outside the State in relation to which it is a State-registered association.

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Cancellation of recognition

Cancellation by the Federal Court

             (1)  A person interested or the Minister may apply to the Federal Court for an order cancelling the recognition under this Schedule of a recognised State-registered association on the ground that:

                     (a)  the conduct of:

                              (i)  the association (in relation to its continued breach of an order of FWA or an industrial instrument, or its continued failure to ensure that its members comply with and observe an order of FWA or an industrial instrument, or in any other respect); or

                             (ii)  a substantial number of the members of the association (in relation to their continued breach of an order of FWA or an industrial instrument, or in any other respect);

                            has, on or after the commencement of this Schedule, prevented or hindered the achievement of an object of this Act as in force at that time; or

                     (b)  the association, or a substantial number of the members of the association or of a section or class of members of the association, has engaged in industrial action (other than protected industrial action) that has, on or after the commencement of this Schedule, prevented, hindered or interfered with:

                              (i)  the activities of a federal system employer; or

                             (ii)  the provision of any public service by the Commonwealth or a State or Territory or an authority of the Commonwealth or a State or Territory; or

                     (c)  the association, or a substantial number of the members of the association or of a section or class of members of the association, has or have been, or is or are, engaged, on or after the commencement of this Schedule, in industrial action (other than protected industrial action) that has had, is having or is likely to have a substantial adverse effect on the safety, health or welfare of the community or a part of the community; or

                     (d)  the association, or a substantial number of the members of the association or of a section or class of members of the association, has or have failed to comply with one of the following, made on or after the commencement of this Schedule:

                              (i)  an injunction granted under subsection 421(3) of the Fair Work Act (which deals with orders to stop industrial action);

                             (ii)  an order made under the Fair Work Act in relation to a contravention of Part 3-1 of that Act (which deals with general protections);

                            (iii)  an interim injunction granted under section 545 of the Fair Work Act so far as it relates to conduct or proposed conduct that could be the subject of an injunction under a provision mentioned in subparagraph (i) or (ii);

                            (iv)  an order under section 23 of this Act (which deals with contraventions of the employee associations provisions).

             (2)  The Court must give the association an opportunity to be heard.

             (3)  If the Court:

                     (a)  finds that a ground for cancellation set out in the application has been established; and

                     (b)  does not consider that it would be unjust to do so having regard to the degree of gravity of the matters constituting the ground and the action (if any) that has been taken by or against the association in relation to the matters;

the Court must cancel the recognition of the association under this Schedule.

             (4)  A finding of fact in:

                     (a)  proceedings commenced on or after the commencement of this Schedule:

                              (i)  under section 421 of the Fair Work Act; or

                             (ii)  under the Fair Work Act in relation to a contravention of Part 3-1 of that Act; or

                     (b)  proceedings under section 23 of this Act;

is admissible as prima facie evidence of that fact in an application made on a ground specified in paragraph (1)(d).

Cancellation by FWA

             (5)  FWA may cancel the recognition under this Schedule of a recognised State-registered association:

                     (a)  on application by the association made under the regulations; or

                     (b)  on application by a person interested or by the Minister, if FWA has satisfied itself, as prescribed:

                              (i)  that the association was recognised by mistake; or

                             (ii)  that the association is no longer a State-registered association; or

                            (iii)  that the association has been found by another industrial body (within the meaning of the Fair Work Act) to have contravened a State or Territory industrial law, and that the contravention constitutes serious misconduct.

Cancellation by General Manager

             (6)  The General Manager may, by written instrument, cancel the recognition under this Schedule of a recognised State-registered association if he or she is satisfied that the association no longer exists.

             (7)  An instrument under subclause (6) is not a legislative instrument.

Cancellation if subclause 1(2) no longer applies

             (8)  The recognition under this Schedule of a recognised State-registered association is taken to be cancelled if the law of a State under which the association is registered ceases to be a law to which subclause 1(2) applies.

##### <a id="137A"></a>137A  Orders about representation rights of organisations of employees

             (1)  Subject to this Part, Part 4 and subsection 151(6), FWA may, on the application of an organisation, an employer or the Minister, make the following orders in relation to a dispute (including a threatened, impending or probable dispute) about the entitlement of an organisation of employees to represent, under this Act or the Fair Work Act, the industrial interests of employees:

                     (a)  an order that an organisation of employees is to have the right, to the exclusion of another organisation or other organisations, to represent under this Act or the Fair Work Act the industrial interests of the employees in a particular workplace group who are eligible for membership of the organisation;

                     (b)  an order that an organisation of employees is not to have the right to represent under this Act or the Fair Work Act the industrial interests of the employees in a particular workplace group.

Note:          Section 151 deals with agreements between organisations of employees and State unions.

Interim orders

             (2)  FWA may make an interim order in relation to an application under subsection (1) on application by a person or organisation who would have been eligible to make the application under subsection (1).

             (4)  An interim order made under subsection (2) ceases to have effect if the application under subsection (1) is determined.

Variation of orders

             (5)  FWA may, on application by an organisation, an employer or the Minister, vary an order made under subsection (1) or (2).

##### <a id="137B"></a>137B  Factors to be taken into account by FWA

             (1)  In considering whether to make an order under subsection 137A(1) in relation to a particular workplace group, FWA must have regard to:

                     (a)  the history of award coverage and agreement making in relation to the employees in the workplace group; and

                     (b)  the wishes of the members of the workplace group; and

                     (c)  the extent to which particular organisations of employees represent the employees in the workplace group, and the nature of that representation; and

                     (d)  any agreement or understanding of which FWA becomes aware that deals with the right of an organisation of employees to represent under this Act or the Fair Work Act the industrial interests of a particular class or group of employees; and

                     (e)  the consequences of not making the order for any employer, employees or organisation concerned; and

                      (f)  any matter prescribed by the regulations.

             (2)  However, if:

                     (a)  the workplace group relates to a genuine new enterprise (within the meaning of the Fair Work Act) that one or more employers are establishing or propose to establish; and

                     (b)  the employer or employees have not employed any of the persons who will be necessary for the normal conduct of that enterprise;

FWA must, as far as practicable, have regard to the matters set out in subsection (1) as they would apply in relation to the persons who would be the employees in the workplace group.

Note:          The expression genuine new enterprise includes a genuine new business, activity, project or undertaking (see the definition of **_enterprise_** in section 12 of the Fair Work Act).

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  the eligibility rules of an organisation of employees have been altered with the consent of the General Manager under section 158A; and

                     (b)  because of the alteration, members of an association of employees registered under a State or Territory industrial law have become eligible for membership of the organisation;

a reference in this section to the organisation includes a reference to the association referred to in paragraph (b) of this subsection.

##### <a id="137C"></a>137C  Submissions by peak councils

## Part 4—Miscellaneous

##### <a id="137F"></a>137F  FWA may make orders reflecting State representation orders

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  the eligibility rules of an organisation of employees have been altered with the consent of the General Manager under section 158A; and

                     (b)  because of the alteration, members of an association of employees that is registered under a State or Territory industrial law (a **_State registered association_**) have become eligible for membership of the organisation; and

                     (c)  immediately before the alteration took effect, an order (a **_State representation order_**) was in force that:

                              (i)  was made by a State industrial authority in relation to the State registered association; and

                             (ii)  was an order of the same kind as, or of a similar kind to, an order that FWA could make under this Chapter in relation to an organisation;

FWA may, on application by the organisation or by a party to the State representation order, make an order in relation to the organisation that is to the same effect, or substantially the same effect, as the State representation order.

             (2)  The order under subsection (1) applies to each organisation that is:

                     (a)  a federal counterpart of the State registered association; or

                     (b)  a federal counterpart of any other association of employees:

                              (i)  that is registered under a State or Territory industrial law; and

                             (ii)  to which the State representation order applied.
