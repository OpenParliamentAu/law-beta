## Part 3—Food regulatory measures

### Division 1—Applications for the development or variation of food regulatory measures

#### Subdivision A—Overview

##### <a id="21"></a>21  Steps in the consideration of an application

                   The following is a simplified outline of the procedure for considering an application for the development of a food regulatory measure, or the variation of a food regulatory measure, other than a high level health claims variation.

* * *

Step 1.   An application is made.

Step 2.   The Authority decides whether to accept or reject the application. If the application is accepted, the Authority proceeds to step 3.

Step 3.   The Authority notifies the applicant of acceptance.

Step 4.   The Authority gives public notice of the application, indicating when the Authority proposes to undertake key steps in considering it.

Step 5.   The Authority assesses the application.

              The Authority may, after assessing the application, either reject it or proceed to the next step.

              If the application is for a new food regulatory measure or a major variation of a food regulatory measure, the next step is step 6.

              In any other case, it is step 7.

Step 6.   The Authority calls for public submissions.

Step 7.   The Authority prepares a draft food regulatory measure or a draft variation of a food regulatory measure, as the case requires. If the Authority has called for submissions under step 6, the Authority must have regard to the submissions in doing so.

Step 8.   If the application is for a minor variation, the Authority calls for submissions from the applicant and appropriate government agencies.

              In any other case, the Authority calls for public submissions.

Step 9.   If the draft is a draft standard or a draft variation of a standard, the Authority must decide whether to approve or reject it and prepare a report, having regard to any submissions made. If approved, the Authority notifies the Council and the public of the approval and proceeds to step 10.

              If the draft is a draft code of practice or a draft variation of a code of practice, the Authority must revoke or vary any existing code or practice and give public notice of its decision. No further steps are taken in relation to measures of this kind.

Step 10 _._ The standard or variation comes into effect after it has been considered by the Council and published.

                     (a)  would enable the Authority to assess the application and develop the relevant food regulatory measure, or the relevant variation of a food regulatory measure; or

                     (b)  would enable the Authority to determine whether a charge fixed under section 146 is payable to the Authority in relation to the application.

             (3)  The Authority may only specify a thing, or a kind of thing, under paragraph (1)(c) in relation to an application, if the inclusion of that thing, or things of those kinds, would enable the Authority to assess the application and develop the relevant food regulatory measure, or the relevant variation of a food regulatory measure.

Guidelines not subject to disallowance or sunsetting

             (4)  Section 42 and Part 6 of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ do not apply to guidelines made under subsection (1).

##### <a id="24"></a>24  Withdrawal of applications

             (1)  An applicant may withdraw the applicant’s application by giving written notice of the withdrawal to the Authority at any time after the Authority has accepted the application under paragraph 26(1)(a) or 47(1)(a), but before:

                     (b)  the Authority notifies the applicant that the Authority has rejected the application.

             (2)  If the Authority receives notice of the withdrawal of an application after the applicant pays a charge fixed under section 146, the Authority must refund to the applicant so much of the charge as is equivalent to the sum paid by the applicant but not expended from the charge, calculated in accordance with the regulations.

             (3)  If the Authority receives notice of the withdrawal of an application after public notice of the application has been given under section 28 or 51, the Authority must give public notice that the application has been withdrawn.

#### Subdivision C—Procedures for considering applications

##### <a id="25"></a>25  Which procedure is appropriate?

             (1)  The Authority must adopt the general  procedure  in considering an application for the development of a food regulatory measure or the variation of a food regulatory measure, unless:

                     (a)  the application is one to which Subdivision E applies (application for a minor variation of a food regulatory measure); or

                     (b)  the application is one to which Subdivision F applies (application for the development of a new food regulatory measure or a major variation of a food regulatory measure); or

             (2)  In determining whether to accept or reject the application, the Authority must have regard to the following matters:

                     (a)  whether the application complies with subsection 22(2);

                     (b)  whether the application relates to a matter that may be developed as a food regulatory measure, or that warrants the variation of a food regulatory measure;

                     (c)  whether the application is so similar to a previous application or proposal for the development or variation of a food regulatory measure that it ought to be rejected;

                     (d)  any other relevant matter.

             (3)  If an application is rejected because it does not comply with subsection 22(2), the application must be disregarded for the purposes of determining whether a later application or proposal for the development or variation of a food regulatory measure is so similar to a previous application that the later application or proposal ought to be rejected.

##### <a id="27"></a>27  Notice of acceptance

Note:          The Board must not delegate its powers to act on behalf of the Authority under paragraph (a)—see section 150.

             (3)  The report must include each of the following:

                     (a)  the reasons for initially accepting the application;

                     (b)  a summary of the results of the Authority’s assessment of the application;

                     (c)  the Authority’s reasons for approving or rejecting the draft variation;

                     (d)  a copy of the draft variation.

             (4)  If the draft variation is of a standard and the Authority approves the draft variation, the Authority must, within 10 business days after the approval:

                     (a)  give the Council:

                              (i)  a written notification of the approval; and

                             (ii)  a copy of the report prepared by the Authority under this section; and

                     (b)  give public notice of the approval, together with information about where further information about the draft variation may be obtained; and

                     (c)  publish in a generally circulating newspaper, in each State or Territory and in New Zealand, a notice:

                              (i)  stating that the draft variation has been approved; and

### Division 2—Proposals for the development or variation of food regulatory measures

#### Subdivision A—Overview

##### <a id="54"></a>54  Steps in the consideration of a proposal

                   The following is a simplified outline of the procedure for considering a proposal for the development of a food regulatory measure, or the variation of a food regulatory measure, other than a high level health claims variation.

* * *

Step 1.   A proposal is prepared.

Step 2\. As the Authority prepares the proposal, there is no equivalent to step 2 of the applications procedure in which the application is accepted or rejected.

Step 3 _._   As the Authority prepares the proposal, there is no equivalent to step 3 of the applications procedure in which the Authority notifies the applicant of acceptance.

Step 4 _._   The Authority gives public notice of the proposal, indicating when the Authority proposes to undertake key steps in considering it.

Step 5 _._   The Authority assesses the proposal.

              The Authority may, after assessing the proposal, either abandon it or proceed to the next step.

              If the proposal is for a new food regulatory measure or a major variation of a food regulatory measure, the next step is step 6.

              In any other case, it is step 7.

Step 6 _._   The Authority calls for public submissions.

Step 7 _._   The Authority prepares a draft food regulatory measure or a draft variation of a food regulatory measure, as the case requires. If the Authority has called for submissions under step 6, the Authority must have regard to the submissions in doing so.

Step 8 _._   If the proposal is for a minor variation, the Authority calls for submissions from the applicant and appropriate government agencies.

              In any other case, the Authority calls for public submissions.

Step 9 _._   If the draft is a draft standard or a draft variation of a standard, the Authority must decide whether to approve or reject it and prepare a report, having regard to any submissions made. If approved, the Authority notifies the Council and the public of the approval and proceeds to step 10.

              If the draft is a draft code of practice or a draft variation of a code of practice, the Authority must revoke or vary any existing code of practice and give public notice of its decision. No further steps are taken in relation to measures of this kind.

Step 10 _._ The standard or variation comes into effect after it has been considered by the Council and published.

* * *

Note:          Division 2A deals with variations by the APVMA of the Maximum Residue Limits Standard.

#### Subdivision B—Proposals
