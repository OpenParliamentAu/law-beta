#### Subdivision AA—Recapitalisation directions by APRA

##### <a id="13D"></a>13D  Who this Subdivision applies to

                   This Subdivision applies to an ADI that:

                     (a)  is a company that:

                              (i)  is registered under the _Corporations Act 2001_; and

                             (ii)  has a share capital; and

                     (b)  does not have an ADI statutory manager.

##### <a id="13E"></a>13E  Recapitalisation direction by APRA

             (1)  APRA may give an ADI a direction (a **_recapitalisation direction_**) that requires the ADI to increase the ADI’s level of capital to the level specified in the direction if:

                     (a)  the ADI informs APRA that:

                              (i)  the ADI considers that the ADI is likely to become unable to meet the ADI’s obligations; or

                             (ii)  the ADI is about to suspend payment; or

                     (b)  APRA considers that, in the absence of external support:

                              (i)  the ADI may become unable to meet the ADI’s obligations; or

                             (ii)  the ADI may suspend payment; or

                            (iii)  it is likely that the ADI will be unable to carry on banking business in Australia consistently with the interests of the ADI’s depositors; or

                            (iv)  it is likely that the ADI will be unable to carry on banking business in Australia consistently with the stability of the financial system in Australia; or

                     (c)  the ADI:

                              (i)  becomes unable to meet the ADI’s obligations; or

                             (ii)  suspends payment.

             (2)  In deciding whether to give a recapitalisation direction, APRA must consult with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (the **_ACCC_**), unless the ACCC notifies APRA, in writing, that the ACCC does not wish to be consulted about:

                     (a)  the direction; or

                     (b)  a class of directions that includes the direction.

             (3)  The regulations may specify that a particular form of support is not external support for the purposes of paragraph (1)(b).

             (2)  APRA must:

             (1)  In determining the fair value for each share in a general insurer for the purposes of paragraph 103E(3)(a), the expert must:

                     (a)  first, assess the value of the insurer as a whole, in accordance with the assumptions (if any) notified to the expert by the Minister for the valuation of the insurer; and

                     (b)  then, allocate that value among the classes of shares in the insurer that:

                              (i)  have been issued; or

                             (ii)  APRA proposes to direct be issued (taking into account the relative financial risk, and voting and distribution rights, of the classes); and

                     (c)  then, allocate the value of each class pro rata among the shares in that class that:

                              (i)  have been issued; or

             (3)  The Minister may, by further written notice given to the expert, revoke, but not vary, notice of the assumptions.

                     (b)  law of a foreign country, including the law of part of a foreign country.
