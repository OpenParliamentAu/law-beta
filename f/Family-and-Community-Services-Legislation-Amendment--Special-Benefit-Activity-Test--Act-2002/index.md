Special benefit rate calculator for activity test breach rate reduction period applying under this Part

This is how to work out a person's rate of special benefit for an activity test breach rate reduction period that applies to the person under this Part.

_Method statement_

_Step 1_.	Work out the person's _maximum payment rate_, being:

	(a)	if the person has not turned 21&#151;the amount that would be the person's maximum basic rate if the Youth Allowance Rate Calculator applied to the person; and
 	(b)	if the person has turned 21&#151;the amount that would be the person's maximum basic rate calculated under Table B of Module B of Benefit Rate Calculator B.

_Step 2_.	Work out the _rate reduction amount_ in accordance with subsection&#160;(2).
 _Step 3_.	Take the rate reduction amount away from the rate of special benefit determined by the Secretary under section&#160;746:
 	the result (which may be a nil rate) is called the _activity test_ _breach reduced rate_.
