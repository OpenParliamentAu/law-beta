                             (ii)  would not be contrary to the interests of depositors of the body corporate.

             (2)  APRA may revoke a body corporate’s section 9 authority if APRA is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the body corporate has failed to comply with:

             (4)  APRA may determine that the procedures in subsection (3) do not apply if APRA is satisfied that following those procedures could result in a delay in revocation that would be:

                     (a)  contrary to the national interest; or

                     (b)  contrary to the interests of depositors with the body corporate.

             (5)  A revocation of a body corporate’s section 9 authority under subsection (1) or (2) must be in writing, and APRA must give the body corporate written notice of the revocation of the authority.

##### 9B  Bodies that cease to exist or change their names

             (1)  If APRA is satisfied that a body corporate that has been granted a section 9 authority:

                     (a)  has ceased to exist; or

(b)           for a purpose connected with the _Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act 1998_.

             (6)  If APRA:

                     (a)  grants an authority under subsection (2); or

                              (i)  would not be contrary to the national interest; and

                             (ii)  would not be contrary to the interests of depositors of any ADI that is a subsidiary of the body corporate.

             (2)  APRA may revoke a NOHC authority granted to a body corporate if APRA is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the body corporate has failed to comply with:

                              (i)  a requirement of this Act or the regulations; or

                             (ii)  a direction under Division 1BA; or

                            (iii)  a condition of its NOHC authority; or

                     (b)  the body corporate has ceased to be a NOHC of any ADI or ADIs; or

                     (c)  it would be contrary to the national interest for the authority to remain in force; or

                     (d)  it would be contrary to the interests of depositors of any ADI that is a subsidiary of the body corporate for the authority to remain in force; or

                     (e)  the body corporate has failed to pay:

                              (i)  an amount of levy or late penalty to which the _Financial Institutions Supervisory Levies Collection Act 1998_ applies; or

             (4)  APRA may determine that the procedures in subsection (3) do not apply if APRA is satisfied that following those procedures could result in a delay in revocation that would be:

                     (a)  contrary to the national interest; or

                     (b)  contrary to the interests of depositors of any ADI that is a subsidiary of the body corporate.

             (5)  A revocation of a body corporate’s NOHC authority under subsection (1) or (2) must be in writing, and APRA must give the body corporate written notice of the revocation of the authority.

             (7)  A failure to comply with subsection (5) (so far as it requires a body corporate to be given written notice of a revocation) or with subsection (6) does not affect the validity of a revocation.

##### <a id="11AC"></a>11AC  Bodies that cease to exist or change their names

                   APRA may, from time to time, publish a list of authorised NOHCs:

                     (a)  the body corporate has contravened a prudential regulation or a prudential standard; or

                     (b)  if the body corporate is an ADI—the direction is necessary in the interests of depositors of the ADI; or

                     (c)  if the body corporate is an authorised NOHC—the direction is necessary in the interests of depositors of any ADI that is a subsidiary of the body corporate.

The direction is to be by notice in writing given to the body corporate.

             (2)  The kinds of direction the body corporate may be given are as follows:

                     (a)  a direction to comply with the whole or a part of a prudential regulation or a prudential standard;

                     (b)  a direction to order an audit of the affairs of the body corporate, at the expense of the body corporate, by an auditor chosen by APRA;

             (4)  The body corporate has power to comply with the direction despite anything in its constitution or any contract or arrangement to which it is a party.

             (5)  The direction has effect until APRA revokes it by notice in writing to the body corporate. APRA may revoke the direction if, at the time of revocation, it considers that the direction is no longer necessary or appropriate.

             (6)  APRA may revoke the certification of the industry liquidity contract if it considers that it is appropriate to do so for any reason.

### <span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt">Subdivision C—General provisions relating to all directions</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt"> </span>

##### 11CD  Direction not grounds for denial of obligations

             (1)  Subject to subsections (2) and (3), the fact that an ADI or an authorised NOHC is subject to a direction by APRA under Subdivision A or B is not a ground for any other party to a contract to which the ADI or NOHC is a party to deny any obligations under that contract, accelerate any debt under that contract or close out any transaction relating to that contract.

             (2)  If an ADI or an authorised NOHC is prevented from fulfilling its obligations under a contract because of a direction under Subdivision A, other than a direction under paragraph 11CA(2)(k), the other party or parties to the contract are, subject to any orders made under subsection (3), relieved from obligations owed to the ADI or authorised NOHC under the contract.

             (3)  A party to a contract to which subsection (2) applies may apply to the Federal Court of Australia for an order relating to the effect on the contract of a direction under Subdivision A. The order may deal with matters including (but not limited to):

                     (a)  requiring a party to the contract to fulfil an obligation under the contract despite subsection (2);

                     (b)  obliging a party to the contract to take some other action (for example, paying money or transferring property) in view of obligations that were fulfilled under the contract before the direction was made.

The order must not require a person to take action that would contravene the direction, or any other direction under Subdivision A.

##### 11CE  Supply of information about issue and revocation of directions

Power to publish notice of directions in Gazette

             (1)  APRA may publish in the _Gazette_ notice of any direction made under Subdivision A or B. The notice must include the name of the ADI or authorised NOHC given the direction and a summary of the direction.

Requirement to publish notice of revocation of certain directions in Gazette

             (2)  If APRA publishes notice of a direction made under Subdivision A or B and then later revokes the direction, APRA must publish in the _Gazette_ notice of that revocation as soon as practicable after the revocation. Failure to publish notice of the revocation does not affect the validity of the revocation.

Requirement to provide information about direction to Treasurer and Reserve Bank

             (3)  If the Treasurer or the Reserve Bank requests APRA to provide information about:

                     (a)  any directions under Subdivision A or B in respect of a particular ADI or authorised NOHC; or

                     (b)  any directions made during a specified period under Subdivision A or B in respect of any ADIs or authorised NOHCs;

APRA must comply with the request.

Power to inform Treasurer and Reserve Bank of direction

             (4)  APRA may provide any information that it considers appropriate to the Treasurer or the Reserve Bank about any directions, or revocations of directions, made under Subdivision A or B, in respect of any ADI or authorised NOHC, at any time.

Requirement to inform Treasurer and Reserve Bank of revocation of direction if informed of making of direction

             (5)  If APRA provides the Treasurer or the Reserve Bank with information about a direction and then later revokes the direction, APRA must notify that person of the revocation of the direction as soon as practicable after the revocation. Failure to notify the person does not affect the validity of the revocation.

##### 11CF  Secrecy requirements

                   Information relating to directions and revocations of directions is subject to the secrecy requirements in Part 6 of the _Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998_, unless the information has been published in the _Gazette_ under section 11CE.

##### 11CG  Non-compliance with a direction

             (1)  An ADI or an authorised NOHC must comply with any direction given to it under Subdivision A or Subdivision B.

             (2)  An officer of an ADI or of an authorised NOHC must take reasonable steps to ensure that the ADI or NOHC complies with any direction given to it under Subdivision A or Subdivision B if the officer’s duties include ensuring that the ADI or NOHC complies with the direction, or with a class of directions that includes the direction.

             (3)  For the purposes of this section:

                    <a name="offic"></a>**_officer_**, in relation to an ADI or an authorised NOHC includes:

                     (a)  a director, secretary, executive officer or employee of the ADI or NOHC; and

                     (b)  a receiver and manager, appointed under a power contained in an instrument, of property of the ADI or NOHC; and

                     (c)  an official manager, or deputy official manager, of the ADI or NOHC; and

APRA’s power to obtain information

             (1)  APRA may, by notice in writing to an ADI, require the ADI to supply it, within the time specified in the notice, with such information relating to the ADI’s financial stability as is specified in the notice.

             (2)  The information supplied in compliance with a requirement under subsection (1) must, if required by the notice, be verified by a statutory declaration made by an officer of the ADI concerned who is authorised by the ADI to make the declaration.

                   _Information to be supplied if ADI unable, or likely to be unable, to meet obligations_

             (3)  An ADI must immediately inform APRA if the ADI considers that it is likely to become unable to meet its obligations, or is about to suspend payment.

APRA’s power to appoint an investigator if information not provided

             (4)  APRA may appoint a person to investigate the affairs of an ADI if the ADI fails to comply with a requirement to provide information under this section.

Interpretation

             (5)  In this section:

                    <a name="offic"></a>**_officer_**, in relation to an ADI, has the same meaning as in section 11CG.

##### <a id="13A"></a>13A  Consequences of inability or failure of ADI to meet obligations

Appointment of investigator or administrator or control by APRA

             (1)  APRA may appoint a person to investigate the affairs of an ADI, take control of the ADI’s business or appoint an administrator to take control of the ADI’s business if:

                     (a)  the ADI informs APRA that the ADI considers that it is likely to become unable to meet its obligations or that it is about to suspend payment; or

                     (b)  APRA considers that the ADI is likely to become unable to meet its obligations or is about to suspend payment; or

                     (c)  the ADI becomes unable to meet its obligations or suspends payment.

Note:          For information about another circumstance in which APRA may take control of the business of an ADI, see section 65.

             (2)  Throughout this Subdivision and Subdivision B, the term **_ADI statutory manager_** is used. It refers to the entity in control of an ADI’s business under this Subdivision. That entity will be either APRA or an administrator of an ADI’s business appointed by APRA.

Australian assets of ADI to be available to meet deposit liabilities

             (3)  If an ADI becomes unable to meet its obligations or suspends payment, the assets of the ADI in Australia are to be available to meet that ADI’s deposit liabilities in Australia in priority to all other liabilities of the ADI.

             (4)  An ADI must hold assets (excluding goodwill) in Australia of a value that is equal to or greater than the total amount of its deposit liabilities in Australia unless it is authorised by APRA to hold assets of a lesser value.

##### <a id="13B"></a>13B  Investigators—ADI must provide information and facilities

             (1)  If APRA has appointed a person to investigate the affairs of an ADI under section 13 or 13A, the ADI must give the person access to its books, accounts and documents and must give the person such information and facilities as the person requires to conduct the investigation.

             (2)  Part 6 of the _Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998_ prohibits certain disclosures of information received by investigators under this Act.

##### <a id="13C"></a>13C  ADI statutory managers—termination of control

Conditions necessary for termination of control

             (1)  If APRA assumes control of an ADI’s business or appoints an administrator of an ADI’s business, APRA must ensure that either it or an administrator of the ADI’s business has control of the ADI’s business until:

                     (a)  the following conditions are satisfied:

                              (i)  the ADI’s deposit liabilities in Australia have been repaid or APRA is satisfied that suitable provision has been made for their repayment; and

                             (ii)  APRA considers that it is no longer necessary for it or an administrator to remain in control of the ADI’s business; or

                     (b)  APRA considers that the ADI is insolvent and is unlikely to be returned to solvency within a reasonable time, and APRA has applied for the ADI to be wound up under the Corporations Law (see section 14F).

A termination of control that is permitted under this section is called an **_ultimate termination of control_**.

Note:          This provision does not prevent a change, or changes, between control of an ADI’s business by APRA and an administrator or between administrators.

Events to precede termination

             (2)  Before making an ultimate termination of control by an ADI statutory manager of an ADI’s business, APRA must:

                     (a)  ensure that directors of the ADI have been appointed or elected under the ADI’s constitution at a meeting called by the ADI statutory manager in accordance with the ADI’s constitution; or

                     (b)  appoint directors of the ADI by instrument in writing; or

                     (c)  ensure that a liquidator for the ADI has been appointed.

Power to terminate control

             (3)  If the requirements in subsections (1) and (2) are satisfied, APRA may by instrument in writing make an ultimate termination of control of an ADI’s business by an ADI statutory manager.

             (4)  If the ADI statutory manager at the time of the termination is an administrator, the instrument of termination also operates as a termination of the appointment of the administrator. A copy of the instrument must be given to the administrator. However, mere failure to give the copy to the administrator does not affect the termination of the appointment.

Period of director’s appointment

             (5)  If a director is elected or appointed under subsection (2), the director takes office on the termination of the ADI statutory manager’s control of the ADI’s business. If the director was appointed by APRA, the director holds office until the ADI’s next annual general meeting, subject to any terms and conditions imposed by APRA on the director’s appointment. If the director was appointed or elected under the ADI’s constitution, the constitution governs the appointment.

Note:          For further information about what happens when an ADI statutory manager is in control of an ADI’s business, see Subdivision B.

## 64  At the end of Division 2 of Part II

Add:

#### Subdivision B—Provisions dealing with control of an ADI’s business by an ADI statutory manager

##### <a id="14A"></a>14A  ADI statutory manager’s powers and functions

ADI statutory manager’s powers and functions include powers and functions of board

             (1)  An ADI statutory manager has the powers and functions of the members of the board of directors of the ADI (collectively and individually), including the board’s powers of delegation.

Note:          When an ADI statutory manager takes control of the business of an ADI, the directors of the ADI cease to hold office (see section 15).

ADI statutory manager’s power to obtain information

             (2)  An ADI statutory manager may, for the purposes of this Division, require a person who has, at any time, been an officer of the ADI to give the ADI statutory manager any information relating to the business of the ADI that the ADI statutory manager requires. The person must comply with the requirement.

                    Penalty:  Imprisonment for 12 months.

             (3)  An individual is not excused from complying with a requirement under subsection (2) to give information on the ground that doing so would tend to incriminate the individual or make the individual liable to a penalty.

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  before giving information in compliance with a requirement under subsection (2), an individual claims that giving the information might tend to incriminate the individual or make the individual liable to a penalty; and

                     (b)  giving the information might in fact tend to incriminate the individual or make the individual so liable;

the information given in compliance with the requirement is not admissible in evidence against the individual in a criminal proceeding or a proceeding for the imposition of a penalty, other than a proceeding in respect of the falsity of the information.

ADI statutory manager’s power to sell whole or part of ADI’s business

             (5)  An ADI statutory manager may sell or otherwise dispose of the whole or any part of the ADI’s business. The sale or disposal may occur on any terms and conditions that the ADI statutory manager considers appropriate.

Interpretation

             (6)  In this section:

                    <a name="offic"></a>**_officer_**, in relation to an ADI, has the same meaning as in section 11CG.

##### <a id="14B"></a>14B  Administrator in control—additional powers to recommend action by APRA

Types of recommendation

             (1)  An administrator of an ADI’s business may make any of the following recommendations to APRA, by instrument in writing given to APRA:

                     (a)  that APRA make a particular direction under Division 1BA in respect of the ADI;

                     (b)  if the administrator considers that the ADI is insolvent and could not be restored to solvency within a reasonable period:

                              (i)  that APRA apply under section 14F to the Federal Court of Australia for an order that the ADI be wound up; or

                             (ii)  that APRA revoke the ADI’s section 9 authority.

Effect of recommendation

             (2)  If an administrator of an ADI’s business makes a recommendation under this section, APRA must consider the recommendation but is not required to act on it.

##### <a id="14C"></a>14C  ADI statutory manager’s liabilities and duties

Liability for loss due to fraud etc.

             (1)  If an ADI incurs any loss because of any fraud, dishonesty, negligence or wilful failure to comply with this Act by the ADI statutory manager, the ADI statutory manager is liable for the loss.

Other losses

             (2)  An ADI statutory manager is not liable for a loss that is not a loss incurred because of fraud, dishonesty, negligence or wilful failure to comply with this Act. If the ADI statutory manager is an administrator of the ADI’s business, the administrator must provide details of the loss in a written report to APRA. However, failure to do so does not make the administrator liable for the loss.

Subsections (1) and (2) apply instead of general indemnity provisions

             (3)  The question whether an ADI statutory manager is liable for a loss is to be determined in accordance with subsections (1) and (2), rather than in accordance with section 70A of this Act or section 58 of the _Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998_.

ADI statutory manager not liable under section 588G of the Corporations Law

             (4)  An ADI statutory manager is not to be taken to be a director for the purposes of section 588G of the Corporations Law of a State or internal Territory.

Signpost to secrecy obligations

             (5)  Part 6 of the _Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998_ prohibits certain disclosures of information received by ADI statutory managers under this Act.

##### <a id="14D"></a>14D  Administrator in control—additional duties

Duty to report to APRA on request

             (1)  A person who is an administrator of an ADI’s business must give to APRA a written report showing how the control of the ADI’s business is being carried out if APRA requests that such a report be provided to it. The report must be given to APRA within a reasonable time after the request.

Duty to report to APRA on termination of appointment

             (2)  A person who was an administrator of an ADI’s business must give to APRA a written report showing how the control of the ADI’s business was carried out over the period of the administrator’s appointment if the administrator’s appointment has been terminated. The report must be given to APRA within a reasonable time of the termination.

Duty to follow directions by APRA

             (3)  APRA may give an administrator of an ADI’s business a direction relating to the control of the ADI’s business, and may alter such a direction. If a direction (including an altered direction) is given to an administrator by APRA, the administrator must:

                     (a)  act in accordance with the direction; or 

                     (b)  immediately provide to APRA information relating to the control of the ADI’s business and request APRA to alter the direction.

             (4)  If an administrator of an ADI’s business requests APRA to alter a direction and APRA considers the request then confirms the direction, the administrator must act in accordance with the direction.

##### <a id="14E"></a>14E  Termination of administrator’s appointment

             (1)  If an administrator of an ADI’s business contravenes a requirement of this Division, APRA may terminate the administrator’s appointment.

             (2)  The terms and conditions of the administrator’s appointment may provide for termination in circumstances in addition to those mentioned in subsection (1).

             (3)  This section has effect subject to section 13C.

##### <a id="14F"></a>14F  APRA’s powers to apply for ADI to be wound up

Power to apply for ADI to be wound up

             (1)  APRA may apply to the Federal Court of Australia for an order that an ADI be wound up if:

                     (a)  an ADI statutory manager is in control of the ADI’s business; and

                     (b)  APRA considers that the ADI is insolvent and could not be restored to solvency within a reasonable period.

             (2)  The winding up of the ADI is to be conducted in accordance with the Corporations Law of a State or internal Territory under which the ADI is incorporated or is taken to be incorporated.

##### <a id="15"></a>15  Effect on directors of ADI statutory manager taking control of an ADI’s business

             (1)  The directors of an ADI cease to hold office when an ADI statutory manager takes control of the ADI’s business.

Note:          For the definition of **_director_**, see subsection (4).

             (2)  A director of an ADI must not be appointed or elected while an ADI statutory manager is in control of the ADI’s business unless the appointment is made under subsection 13C(2).

             (3)  If a person who ceased to hold office under subsection (1), or a purported director of the ADI appointed or elected in contravention of subsection (2), purports to act in relation to the ADI’s business while an ADI statutory manager has control of the ADI’s business, those acts are invalid and of no effect.

             (4)  For the purposes of this section, **_director_** has the same meaning as it has in the Corporations Law.

##### <a id="15A"></a>15A  Effect on external administrator of ADI statutory manager taking control of an ADI’s business

             (1)  The appointment of an external administrator of an ADI is terminated when an ADI statutory manager takes control of the ADI’s business. 

Note:          For the definition of **_external administrator_**, see subsection (5).

             (2)  An external administrator of an ADI must not be appointed while an ADI statutory manager is in control of the ADI’s business unless APRA approves the appointment.

             (3)  If a person who ceased to be the external administrator of an ADI under subsection (1), or a purported external administrator of the ADI appointed in contravention of subsection (2), purports to act in relation to the ADI’s business while an ADI statutory manager has control of the ADI’s business, those acts are invalid and of no effect.

             (4)  APRA must inform the external administrator of an ADI that an ADI statutory manager will take control of the ADI’s business as soon as possible after the decision that an ADI statutory manager will take control of the ADI’s business is made. However, failure to inform the external administrator does not affect the operation of this section.

             (5)  For the purposes of this section, **_external administrator_** means any of the following:

                     (a)  a liquidator or provisional liquidator;

             (3)  In this section, a reference to a proceeding against an ADI includes a reference to a cross-claim or third party claim against an ADI.

##### <a id="15C"></a>15C  ADI statutory manager being in control not grounds for denial of obligations

                   The fact that an ADI statutory manager is in control of an ADI’s business is not a ground for any other party to a contract to which the ADI is a party to deny any obligations under that contract, accelerate any debt under that contract or close out any transaction relating to that contract.

##### <a id="16"></a>16  Costs of statutory management

             (1)  APRA’s costs (including costs in the nature of remuneration and expenses) of being in control of an ADI’s business, or of having an administrator in control of an ADI’s business, are payable from the ADI’s funds and are a debt due to APRA.

             (2)  Despite anything contained in any law relating to the winding-up of companies, but subject to subsection 13A(3), debts due to APRA by an ADI under subsection (1) have priority in a winding-up of the ADI over all other unsecured debts.

##### <a id="16A"></a>16A  APRA must report to Treasurer and publish information about statutory management

Reports to the Treasurer

             (1)  If the Treasurer requests APRA to give him or her a written report concerning the activities of ADI statutory managers in respect of specified ADIs or in respect of a specified period, APRA must give the Treasurer such a written report within a reasonable time after the Treasurer requests it.

             (2)  If an ADI statutory manager takes control of an ADI’s business during a financial year, or if there is an ultimate termination of control during a financial year, APRA must give the Treasurer a written report within a reasonable time after the end of the financial year concerning activities of all ADI statutory managers and each ultimate termination of control that occurred during that financial year.

Requirement to publish notices in Gazette

             (3)  If APRA:

                     (a)  takes control of an ADI’s business; or

                     (b)  appoints an administrator of an ADI’s business; or 

                     (c)  makes an ultimate termination of control in respect of an ADI’s business;

APRA must publish notice of that fact in the _Gazette_. However, mere failure to publish such a notice does not affect the validity of the act.

Additional duty to give information about ADIs

             (2)  A person who is, or who has been, an auditor of an ADI must inform APRA if the person has reasonable grounds for believing that:
