Preamble

WHEREAS by clause 1 of Part III of the Agreement set forth in the Schedule to the _Financial Agreement Validation Act 1929_ it was agreed that, subject to the provisions of that Part of the Agreement, the Commonwealth would take over on the first day of July One thousand nine hundred and twenty-nine:
