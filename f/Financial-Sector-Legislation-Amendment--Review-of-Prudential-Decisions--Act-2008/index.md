             (1)  On application by APRA, the Federal Court of Australia may, by order, disqualify a person from being or acting as a person referred to in subsection (2), for a period that the Court considers appropriate, if the Court is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the person is not a fit and proper person to be or act as such a person; and

                     (b)  the disqualification is justified.

             (2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), the Court may disqualify a person from being or acting as one or more of the following:

                     (a)  a director or senior manager of:

                              (i)  a particular ADI; or

                             (ii)  a class of ADIs; or

                            (iii)  any ADI;

                     (b)  a senior manager of the Australian operations of:

                              (i)  a particular foreign ADI; or

                             (ii)  a class of foreign ADIs; or

                            (iii)  any foreign ADI;

                            (iii)  any authorised NOHC;

                     (d)  an auditor of:

                              (i)  a particular ADI or a particular authorised NOHC; or

                             (ii)  a class of ADIs or a class of authorised NOHCs; or

                            (iii)  any ADI or any authorised NOHC.

             (3)  In deciding whether it is satisfied as mentioned in paragraph (1)(a), the Court may take into account:

                     (a)  any matters specified in the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph; and

                     (b)  any criteria for fitness and propriety set out in the prudential standards; and

                     (c)  any other matters the Court considers relevant.

             (4)  In deciding whether the disqualification is justified as mentioned in paragraph (1)(b), the Court may have regard to:

                     (a)  if the application is for the person to be disqualified from being or acting as a director or senior manager—the person’s conduct in relation to the management, business or property of any corporation; and

                     (b)  if the application is for the person to be disqualified from being or acting as an auditor—the person’s conduct in relation to the functions or duties of the person as required under this Act and the prudential standards; and

                     (c)  in any case—any other matters the Court considers relevant.

             (5)  As soon as practicable after the Court disqualifies a person under this section, APRA must cause particulars of the disqualification:

                     (a)  to be given:

                              (i)  if the person is, or is acting as, a person referred to in subparagraph (2)(a)(i)—to the ADI concerned; or

                             (ii)  if the person is, or is acting as, a person referred to in subparagraph (2)(b)(i)—to the foreign ADI concerned; or

                            (iii)  if the person is, or is acting as, a person referred to in subparagraph (2)(c)(i)—to the authorised NOHC concerned; or

                            (iv)  if the person is, or is acting as, a person referred to in subparagraph (2)(d)(i)—to the ADI or authorised NOHC concerned; and

                     (b)  to be published in the _Gazette_.

             (1)  A disqualified person, or APRA, may apply to the Federal Court of Australia for:

                     (a)  if the person is a disqualified person only because he or she was disqualified under section 21—a variation or a revocation of the order made under that section; or

                     (b)  otherwise—an order that the person is not a disqualified person.

             (2)  If the Court revokes an order under paragraph (1)(a) or makes an order under paragraph (1)(b), then, despite section 20, the person is not a **_disqualified person_**.

             (3)  At least 21 days before commencing the proceedings, written notice of the application must be lodged:

                     (a)  if the disqualified person makes the application—by the person with APRA; or

                     (b)  if APRA makes the application—by APRA with the disqualified person.

                     (a)  the body corporate has contravened a provision of this Act, regulations made under this Act, prudential standards, or the _Financial Sector (Collection of Data) Act 2001_; or

                     (b)  the body corporate is likely to contravene this Act, regulations made under this Act, prudential standards, or the _Financial Sector (Collection of Data) Act 2001_, and such a contravention is likely to give rise to a prudential risk; or

                     (c)  the body corporate has contravened a condition or direction under this Act or the _Financial Sector (Collection of Data) Act 2001_; or

                     (d)  the direction is necessary in the interests of:

                              (i)  if the body corporate is a general insurer—policyholders of the general insurer; or

                             (ii)  if the body corporate is an authorised NOHC—policyholders of any general insurer that is a subsidiary of the NOHC; or

                     (e)  the body corporate is, or is about to become, unable to meet its liabilities; or

                      (f)  there is, or there might be, a material risk to the security of the body corporate’s assets; or

                     (h)  the body corporate is conducting its affairs in an improper or financially unsound way; or

                      (i)  the failure to issue a direction would materially prejudice the interests of:

                              (i)  if the body corporate is a general insurer—policyholders of the general insurer; or

                             (ii)  if the body corporate is an authorised NOHC—policyholders of any general insurer that is a subsidiary of the NOHC; or

                      (j)  the body corporate is conducting its affairs in a way that may cause or promote instability in the Australian financial system.

Requirements for direction

             (2)  The direction must:

                     (b)  specify the ground referred to in subsection (1) as a result of which the direction is given.

Contents of directions

Note:          **_Senior manager_** is defined in section 3 of this Act.

##### <a id="105"></a>105  Direction not grounds for denial of obligations

             (1)  Subject to subsections (2) and (3), the fact that a general insurer or an authorised NOHC is subject to a direction by APRA under section 104 is not a ground for any other party to a contract to which the insurer or NOHC, or a subsidiary of the insurer or the NOHC, is a party:

                     (a)  to deny any obligations under that contract; or

                     (b)  to accelerate any debt under that contract; or

                     (c)  to close out any transaction relating to that contract.

             (2)  If a general insurer or an authorised NOHC, or a subsidiary of a general insurer or authorised NOHC, is prevented from fulfilling its obligations under a contract because of a direction under section 104, other than a direction under paragraph 104(3)(t), the other party or parties to the contract are, subject to any orders made under subsection (3) of this section, relieved from obligations owed to the insurer or NOHC under the contract.

             (3)  A party to a contract to which subsection (2) applies may apply to the Federal Court of Australia for an order relating to the effect on the contract of a direction under section 104\. The order may deal with matters including (but not limited to):

                     (a)  requiring a party to the contract to fulfil an obligation under the contract despite subsection (2); or

                     (b)  obliging a party to the contract to take some other action (for example, paying money or transferring property) in view of obligations that were fulfilled under the contract before the direction was made.

The order must not require a person to take action that would contravene the direction, or any other direction under section 104.

##### <a id="106"></a>106  Supply of information about issue and revocation of directions

Power to publish notice of directions in Gazette

             (1)  APRA may publish in the _Gazette_ notice of any direction made under section 104\. The notice must include the name of the general insurer or authorised NOHC given the direction and a summary of the direction.

Requirement to publish notice of revocation of certain directions in Gazette

             (2)  If APRA publishes notice of a direction made under section 104 and then later revokes the direction, APRA must publish in the _Gazette_ notice of that revocation as soon as practicable after the revocation. Failure to publish notice of the revocation does not affect the validity of the revocation.

Requirement to provide information about direction to Treasurer

             (3)  If the Treasurer requests APRA to provide information about:

                     (a)  any directions given under section 104 to a particular general insurer or authorised NOHC; or

                     (b)  any directions given under section 104, during a specified period, to any general insurers or authorised NOHCs;

APRA must comply with the request.

Power to inform Treasurer of direction

             (4)  APRA may provide any information that it considers appropriate to the Treasurer about:

                     (a)  any directions given under section 104 to any general insurer or authorised NOHC at any time; or

                     (b)  any revocations of any such directions.

Requirement to inform Treasurer of revocation of direction if informed of making of direction

             (5)  If APRA provides the Treasurer with information about a direction and then later revokes the direction, APRA must notify the Treasurer of the revocation of the direction as soon as practicable after the revocation. Failure to notify the Treasurer does not affect the validity of the revocation.

##### <a id="107"></a>107  Secrecy requirements

                   Information relating to directions and revocations of directions is subject to the secrecy requirements in Part 6 of the _Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998_, unless the information has been published in the _Gazette_ under section 106 of this Act.

##### <a id="108"></a>108  Non-compliance with a direction

                     (a)  the first day on which the offence is committed; and

                     (b)  each subsequent day (if any) on which the circumstances that gave rise to the insurer or NOHC committing the offence continue (including the day of conviction for any such offence or any later day).

Note:          This subsection is not intended to imply that section 4K of the _Crimes Act 1914_ does not apply to offences against this Act or the regulations.

             (4)  An officer of a general insurer or an authorised NOHC commits an offence if:

                     (a)  the officer fails to take reasonable steps to ensure that the insurer or NOHC complies with a direction given to it under section 104; and

                     (b)  the officer’s duties include ensuring that the insurer or NOHC complies with the direction or with a class of directions that includes the direction; and

                     (c)  there is no order in force under section 7 determining that subsection (1) does not apply to the general insurer or authorised NOHC.

                    Penalty:  50 penalty units.

Note:          Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.

             (5)  Subsection (4) is an offence of strict liability.

Note:          For **_strict liability_**, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

             (6)  If an officer of a general insurer or authorised NOHC fails to take reasonable steps to ensure that the insurer or NOHC complies with a direction given to it under section 104 in circumstances that give rise to the officer committing an offence against subsection (4), the officer commits an offence against that subsection in respect of:

                     (a)  the first day on which the offence is committed; and

                     (b)  each subsequent day (if any) on which the circumstances that gave rise to the officer committing the offence continue (including the day of conviction for any such offence or any later day).

Note:          This subsection is not intended to imply that section 4K of the _Crimes Act 1914_ does not apply to offences against this Act or the regulations.
