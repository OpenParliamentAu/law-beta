![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00068/Html/FringeBenTA1986Vol1_WD02_image004.gif)

Increase in fringe benefits taxable amount for year of tax 2000-2001 and later years

          (1D)  If any benefits provided in respect of the employment of an employee of an employer are exempt benefits under section 57A, the employer’s **_fringe benefits taxable amount_** for the year of tax beginning on 1 April 2000 or a later year of tax as worked out under subsection (1A) is increased by the employer’s aggregate non-exempt amount for the year of tax concerned.

How to work out aggregate non-exempt amount

           (1E)  An employer’s **_aggregate non-exempt amount_** for the year of tax is worked out as follows.

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.    For each employee, add:

               (a)     the individual grossed-up type 1 non-exempt amount (see subsection (1F)) in relation to the employer for the year of tax; and

               (b)     the individual grossed-up type 2 non-exempt amount (see subsection (1G)) in relation to the employer for the year of tax.

              The result is the **_individual grossed-up non-exempt amount_** for the employee.

Step 2.    If:

               (b)     the employer is a government body and the duties of the employment of one or more employees are as described in paragraph 57A(2)(b) (which is about duties of employment being exclusively performed in or in connection with certain hospitals); or

               (c)     the employer is a public hospital; or

             (ca)     the employer provides public ambulance services or services that support those services and the employee is predominantly involved in connection with the provision of those services; or

               (d)     the employer is a hospital described in subsection 57A(4) (which is about hospitals carried on by non-profit societies and associations);

              subtract $17,000 from the individual grossed-up non-exempt amount for each employee of the employer referred to in paragraph (c), (ca) or (d), or each employee referred to in paragraph (b), for the year of tax. However, if the individual grossed-up non-exempt amount for such an employee is equal to or less than $17,000, the amount calculated under this step for the employee is nil.

Step 3.    If step 2 does not apply in respect of one or more employees of the employer:

               (a)     reduce the individual grossed-up non-exempt amount for each such employee for the year of tax beginning on 1 April 2000 to zero; and

               (b)     reduce the individual grossed-up non-exempt amount for each such employee for a later year of tax by $30,000, but not below zero.

Step 4.    Add together the amounts calculated under steps 2 and 3 in relation to the employees of the employer. The total amount is the employer’s **_aggregate non-exempt amount_** for the year of tax.

* * *

Individual grossed-up type 1 non-exempt amount

           (1F)  For the purposes of step 1 in the method statement in subsection (1E), the **_individual grossed-up type 1 non-exempt amount_** of an employee in relation to the employer for the year of tax is:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00068/Html/FringeBenTA1986Vol1_WD02_image005.gif)

Individual grossed-up type 2 non-exempt amount

          (1G)  For the purposes of step 1 in the method statement in subsection (1E), the **_individual grossed-up type 2 non-exempt amount_** of an employee in relation to the employer for the year of tax is:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00068/Html/FringeBenTA1986Vol1_WD02_image006.gif)

Working out the type 1 individual base non-exempt amount

          (1H)  An employee’s **_type 1 individual base non-exempt amount_** in relation to the employer for the year of tax is worked out by adding the amounts worked out under step 3 of the method statement in subsection (1K) and step 3 of the method statement in subsection (1L).

Working out the type 2 individual base non-exempt amount

           (1J)  An employee’s **_type 2 individual base non-exempt amount_** in relation to the employer for the year of tax is worked out by adding the amounts worked out under step 4 of the method statement in subsection (1K) and step 4 of the method statement in subsection (1L).

Working out the subsection (1K) amounts

          (1K)  An employee’s subsection (1K) amounts for the year of tax are worked out as follows.

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.    Work out under subsection 135Q(3) for each of the employer’s employees the amount that would be the employee’s individual fringe benefit amount for the year of tax in respect of the employee’s employment by the employer if subsection 135Q(1) were amended:

An employee’s individual fringe benefits amount is the employee’s share of the taxable value of fringe benefits (with some exclusions) provided in respect of his or her employment.

* * *

##### <a id="5E"></a>5E  Employee’s individual fringe benefits amount

Overview

             (1)  This section explains how to work out an employee’s **_individual fringe benefits amount_** for a year of tax in respect of the employee’s employment by an employer.

General rule

             (2)  The **_individual fringe benefits amount_** is the sum of the employee’s share of the taxable value of each fringe benefit that relates to the year of tax and is provided in respect of the employment other than an excluded fringe benefit.

What is an **excluded fringe benefit**?

             (3)  An **_excluded fringe benefit_** is a fringe benefit:

                     (a)  constituted by the provision of meal entertainment (as defined in section 37AD, whether or not the employer has elected that Division 9A of Part III apply to the employer); or

                     (b)  that is a car parking fringe benefit (see subsection 136(1)); or

                     (c)  whose taxable value is wholly or partly attributable to entertainment facility leasing expenses; or

                     (e)  whose taxable value is worked out under section 59 (about remote area residential fuel); or

                      (f)  whose taxable value is reduced under section 60 (about remote area housing); or

                     (g)  that is an amortised fringe benefit (see subsection 136(1)); or

                     (h)  that is a reducible fringe benefit (see subsection 136(1)); or

                      (i)  that is a benefit prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph; or

                      (j)  that relates to occasional travel to a major population centre in Australia provided to employees and family members resident in a location that is not in or adjacent to an eligible urban area; or

                     (k)  that relates to freight costs for foodstuffs provided to employees resident in a location that is not in or adjacent to an eligible urban area; or

                      (l)  that is provided to address a security concern:

                              (i)  relating to the personal safety of an employee, or an associate of an employee; and

                             (ii)  that arises in respect of the employee’s employment.

If section 135G applies to the employer

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  section 135G applies for working out the employer’s liability to pay tax for the year of tax; and

                     (b)  one or more fringe benefits are provided in relation to the year of tax in respect of the employee’s employment by the employer;

the employee’s **_individual fringe benefits amount_** is the amount determined by the employer in writing. This subsection has effect despite subsection (2).

Note:          Section 135G allows use of the employer’s aggregate fringe benefits amount for an earlier year of tax in working out the employer’s liability for tax for the current year of tax.

Determining individual fringe benefits amounts

             (5)  In making a determination under subsection (4), the employer must:

                     (a)  ensure that the total of the amount or amounts determined by the employer under that subsection for the year of tax equals the aggregate fringe benefits amount used for working out the employer’s liability to pay tax for the year of tax; and

                     (b)  if that subsection applies to 2 or more of the employer’s employees for the year of tax—act reasonably, having regard to the fringe benefit or fringe benefits provided in relation to the year of tax in respect of each employee’s employment.

Security concerns relating to employees or associates

             (6)  A fringe benefit referred to in paragraph (3)(l) is an **_excluded fringe benefit_** only to the extent that its provision is consistent with a threat assessment in relation to the employee or associate made by a person who is recognised by:

                     (a)  a relevant industry body or government body; or

                     (b)  the Commissioner;

as competent to make threat assessments.

##### <a id="5F"></a>5F  Working out the _employee’s share_

Overview

             (1)  This section explains how to work out an **_employee’s share_** of the taxable value of a fringe benefit relating to the employee, an employer and a year of tax.

Individually-valued benefit provided in respect of one employee

             (2)  The **_employee’s share_** is 100% of the taxable value if:

                     (a)  the fringe benefit was provided in respect of the employment of the employee by the employer and was not provided in respect of the employment of anyone else; and

                     (b)  the taxable value of the fringe benefit was worked out for that particular fringe benefit (not merely as part of the total taxable value of fringe benefits in a class including that particular benefit).

Individually-valued benefit shared by 2 or more employees

             (3)  The **_employee’s share_** is so much of the taxable value as is reasonably attributable to the provision of the fringe benefit in respect of the employee’s employment by the employer, taking account of any relevant matters, if:

                     (a)  the fringe benefit was provided in respect of the employment of the employee by the employer and in respect of the employment of another employee; and

                     (b)  the taxable value of the fringe benefit was worked out for that particular fringe benefit (not merely as part of the total taxable value of fringe benefits in a class including that particular benefit).

Benefits valued in aggregate

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  the fringe benefit is one of a class of fringe benefits provided in respect of the employment of one or more employees by the employer; and

                     (b)  the total taxable value of all the fringe benefits in the class is worked out by a single calculation;

the **_employee’s share_** of the taxable value of the fringe benefit is so much of the total taxable value as is reasonably attributable to the provision of the fringe benefit in respect of the employee’s employment by the employer, taking account of any relevant matters.

Shares of different employees must total 100% of taxable value

             (5)  If:

                     (a)  the fringe benefit was provided in respect of the employment of 2 or more employees; and

                     (b)  each of those employees has an employee’s share of the taxable value of the fringe benefit;

the sum of those shares must equal the taxable value of the fringe benefit.

Single employee’s shares must equal total taxable value

             (6)  If all the fringe benefits in a class described in subsection (4) are provided in respect of the employment of the same employee (and none of them is provided in respect of the employment of anyone else), the sum of the employee’s shares of the taxable value of the fringe benefits must equal the total taxable value of the fringe benefits.

## Part III—Fringe benefits

### Division 1—Preliminary

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Part not to limit generality of _benefit_ 

                   The provisions of this Part do not limit the generality of the expression **_benefit_**.

             (1)  Where:

                     (a)  at any time on a day, in respect of the employment of an employee, a car held by a person (in this subsection referred to as the **_provider_**):

                              (i)  is applied to a private use by the employee or an associate of the employee; or

                             (ii)  is taken to be available for the private use of the employee or an associate of the employee; and

                                        (A)  the provider or another person; and

                                        (B)  the employer, or an associate of the employer, of the employee;

that application or availability of the car shall be taken to constitute a benefit provided on that day by the provider to the employee or associate in respect of the employment of the employee.

             (2)  Where, at a particular time, the following conditions are satisfied in relation to an employee of an employer:

                     (a)  a car is held by a person, being:

                              (i)  the employer;

                             (ii)  an associate of the employer; or

                            (iii)  a person (other than the employer or an associate of the employer) with whom, or in respect of whom, the employer or an associate of the employer has an arrangement relating to the use or availability of the car;

                     (b)  the car is not at business premises of:

                              (i)  the employer;

                             (ii)  an associate of the employer; or

                            (iii)  a person (other than the employer or an associate of the employer) with whom, or in respect of whom, the employer or an associate of the employer has an arrangement relating to the use or availability of the car;

                     (c)  any of the following conditions is satisfied:

                              (i)  the employee is entitled to apply the car to a private use;

                             (ii)  the employee is not performing the duties of his or her employment and has custody or control of the car;

                            (iii)  an associate of the employee is entitled to use, or has custody or control of, the car;

the car shall be taken, for the purposes of this Act, to be available at that time for the private use of the employee or associate, as the case may be.

             (4)  For the purposes of subsection (3), where a prohibition on the application of a car, or on the application of a car for a private use, by a person is not consistently enforced, the person shall be deemed to be entitled to use the car, or to apply the car to a private use, notwithstanding the prohibition.

             (5)  For the purposes of this Act, a car shall be deemed to be applied by a person if it is applied in accordance with the directions, instructions or wishes of the person.

             (6)  For the purposes of this Division, a car that is let on hire to a person under a hire-purchase agreement shall be deemed:

                     (a)  to have been purchased by the person at the time when the person first took the car on hire; and

                     (b)  to have been owned by the person at all material times.

             (7)  A reference in this Division to a car held by a person (in this subsection referred to as the **_provider_**) does not include a reference to:

                     (a)  a taxi let on hire to the provider; or

                     (b)  a car let on hire to the provider under an agreement of a kind ordinarily entered into by persons taking cars on hire intermittently as occasion requires on an hourly, daily, weekly or other short-term basis unless the car has been or may reasonably be expected to be on hire under successive agreements of a kind that result in substantial continuity of the hiring of the car.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Exempt car benefits

             (1)  Except insofar as section 7 provides that the application or availability of a car held by a person is a benefit, the application or availability of a car held by a person is an exempt benefit.

             (2)  A car benefit provided in a year of tax in respect of the employment of a current employee is an exempt benefit in relation to the year of tax if:

                     (a)  the car is:

                              (i)  a taxi, panel van or utility truck, designed to carry a load of less than 1 tonne; or

                             (ii)  any other road vehicle designed to carry a load of less than 1 tonne (other than a vehicle designed for the principal purpose of carrying passengers); and

                     (b)  there was no private use of the car during the year of tax and at a time when the benefit was provided other than:

                              (i)  work-related travel of the employee; and

                             (ii)  other private use by the employee or an associate of the employee, being other use that was minor, infrequent and irregular.

             (3)  Where:

                     (a)  a car benefit relating to a particular car is provided by a particular person (in this subsection called the **_provider_**) in a year of tax in respect of the employment of a current employee of an employer;

                     (b)  at all times during the year of tax when the car was held by the provider, the car was unregistered; and

                     (c)  during the period in the year of tax when the car was held by the provider, the car was wholly or principally used directly in connection with business operations of:

                              (i)  the employer; or

                             (ii)  if the employer is a company—the employer or a company that is related to the employer;

the car benefit is an exempt benefit in relation to the year of tax.

             (4)  A car benefit is an exempt benefit in relation to a year of tax if:

                     (a)  the car benefit is provided in the year of tax in respect of the employment of a current employee; and

                     (b)  the person providing the benefit cannot deduct an amount under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ for providing the benefit because of section 86-60 of that Act.

Note:       Section 86-60 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (read together with section 86-70 of that Act) limits the extent to which personal service entities can deduct car expenses. Deductions are not allowed for more than one car for private use.

#### Subdivision B—Taxable value of car fringe benefits

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Taxable value of car fringe benefits—statutory formula

             (1)  Subject to this Part, where one or more car fringe benefits in relation to an employer in relation to a year of tax relate to a particular car held by a particular person (in this section referred to as the **_provider_**), the taxable value of that fringe benefit, or the aggregate of the taxable values of those fringe benefits, as the case may be, in relation to that year of tax, is the amount calculated in accordance with the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00068/Html/FringeBenTA1986Vol1_WD02_image007.gif)

where:

                    <a name=""></a>**_A_** is the base value of the car;

                    <a name=""></a>**_B_** is the statutory fraction;

                    <a name=""></a>**_D_** is the number of days in that year of tax; and

                    <a name=""></a>**_E_** is the amount (if any) of the recipient’s payment.

             (2)  For the purposes of this section:

                     (a)  the base value of the car is the sum of:

                              (i)  where, at the earliest holding time, the car was owned by the provider or an associate of the provider, the amount calculated in accordance with the formula AB, where:

                    <a name=""></a>**_A_**is the cost price of the car to the provider or associate, as the case may be; and

                    <a name=""></a>**_B_** is:

                                        (A)  in a case where the commencement of the year of tax is later than the fourth anniversary of the earliest holding time—![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00068/Html/FringeBenTA1986Vol1_WD02_image008.gif); or

                                        (B)  in any other case—1;

                             (ii)  in a case to which subparagraph (i) does not apply—the amount calculated in accordance with the formula AB, where: 

                    <a name=""></a>**_A_** is the leased car value of the car at the earliest holding time; and

                    <a name=""></a>**_B_** is:

                                        (A)  in a case where the commencement of the year of tax is later than the fourth anniversary of the earliest holding time—![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00068/Html/FringeBenTA1986Vol1_WD02_image008.gif); or

                                        (B)  in any other case—1; and

                            (iii)  the cost price of each non-business accessory that:

             (4)  Where the recipients expenditure in relation to each of 2 or more in-house expense payment fringe benefits (whether or not in relation to the same year of tax) is the same expenditure, this Act applies, and shall be deemed to have applied, as if all the payments or reimbursements to which those fringe benefits relate had been made at the time when the first of those payments or reimbursements was made and not otherwise.

             (5)  Nothing in section 74 prevents the amendment of an assessment for the purpose of giving effect to subsection (4).

##### <a id="23"></a>23  Taxable value of external expense payment fringe benefits

                   Subject to this Part, the taxable value in relation to a year of tax of an external expense payment fringe benefit provided during the year of tax is the amount of the payment referred to in paragraph 20(a), or the reimbursement referred to in paragraph 20(b), as the case requires, reduced, in a case to which paragraph 20(a) applies, by the amount of the recipients contribution.

                             (ii)  in the case of an external expense payment fringe benefit—the amount of the recipients expenditure;

                            a once-only deduction (in this subsection called the **_gross deduction_**) would, or would if not for section 82A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, and Divisions 28 and 900 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, have been allowable to the recipient under either of those Acts in respect of the gross expenditure; and

### Division 9A—Meal entertainment

#### Subdivision A—Meal entertainment

##### <a id="37A"></a>37A  Key principle

* * *

An employer may elect that this Division will apply to the employer for an FBT year. If the employer does this, the taxable value of meal entertainment fringe benefits provided to the employer’s employees and associates of those employees by the employer will either be half the expenses incurred for the FBT year by the employer in providing meal entertainment benefits or, if the employer makes a further election, an amount worked out based on a 12 week register kept by the employer.

* * *

##### <a id="37AA"></a>37AA  Division only applies if election made

                   An employer may elect that this Division applies to the employer for an FBT year.

##### <a id="37AB"></a>37AB  Employee contributions to be excluded

                   For the purposes of this Division any reference to expenses or expenditure in relation to meal entertainment or meal entertainment benefits excludes any contribution from an employee or an associate of an employee that is not subject to reimbursement by the employer.

##### <a id="37AC"></a>37AC  Meal entertainment benefits

                   Where at a particular time an employer (the **_provider_**) to whom this Division applies provides meal entertainment to another person (the **_recipient_**) the provision of the meal entertainment is taken to constitute a meal entertainment benefit provided by the provider to the recipient at that time.

##### <a id="37AD"></a>37AD  Meaning of _provision of meal entertainment_

                   A reference to the **_provision of meal entertainment_** is a reference to the provision of:

                     (a)  entertainment by way of food or drink; or

                     (b)  accommodation or travel in connection with, or for the purpose of facilitating, entertainment to which paragraph (a) applies; or

                     (g)  at or in connection with a seminar.

##### <a id="37AE"></a>37AE  Fringe benefits only arise if employer is provider

                   No meal entertainment fringe benefit arises where the employer in relation to whom the benefit would otherwise arise is not the provider of the benefit.

##### <a id="37AF"></a>37AF  No other fringe benefits arise if election made

                   If a meal entertainment fringe benefit arises in respect of the provision of meal entertainment, no other fringe benefit arises in relation to any person in respect of the provision of the meal entertainment.

##### <a id="37AG"></a>37AG  Some benefits still arise

                   To avoid doubt, sections 37AE and 37AF do not prevent a fringe benefit in relation to an employer arising under any provision of this Act where the employer is not the provider of the benefit. 

#### Subdivision B—50/50 split method of valuing meal entertainment

##### <a id="37B"></a>37B  Key principle

* * *

If an employer elects that this Division applies, then (unless the employer elects that Subdivision C applies) the taxable value of meal entertainment fringe benefits provided to the employer’s employees and associates of those employees by the employer is half the expenses incurred for the FBT year by the employer in providing meal entertainment benefits.

* * *

##### <a id="37BA"></a>37BA  Taxable value using 50/50 split method

                   If this Division applies to an employer for an FBT year then, unless the employer elects that Subdivision C applies, the total taxable value of meal entertainment fringe benefits of the employer for the FBT year is 50% of the expenses incurred by the employer in providing meal entertainment for the FBT year.

Note:          This means that the employer’s **_aggregate fringe benefits amount_**(see section 5C) for the FBT year will include 50% of the total expenses incurred by the employer for the provision of meal entertainment to all persons in the FBT year.

#### Subdivision C—12 week register method

##### <a id="37C"></a>37C  Key principle

* * *

* * *

##### <a id="37CA"></a>37CA  Election by employer

                   An employer who elects that this Division applies may elect also that this Subdivision applies to meal entertainment provided by the employer for an FBT year if the employer has a valid meal entertainment register for that year.

##### <a id="37CB"></a>37CB  Taxable value using 12 week register method

             (1)  If the employer elects that this Subdivision applies for an FBT year then, despite any other provision of this Act, the taxable value of meal entertainment fringe benefits for the employer for the FBT year is worked out using the formula: 

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00068/Html/FringeBenTA1986Vol1_WD02_image023.gif)

Note:          This means that the employer’s **_aggregate fringe benefits amount_**(see section 5C) for the FBT year will include a proportion of the expenses incurred by the employer for the provision of meal entertainment for all persons in the FBT year. The proportion is worked out on the basis of the 12 week register.

             (2)  The **_register percentage_** is the percentage worked out using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00068/Html/FringeBenTA1986Vol1_WD02_image024.gif)

where:

                    <a name="total-valu-meal-entertain-fring-benefit"></a>**_total value of meal entertainment fringe benefits_** means the total value of meal entertainment fringe benefits that are provided by the employer in the 12 week period covered by the employer’s register.

                    <a name="total-valu-meal-entertain"></a>**_total value of meal entertainment_** means the total value of meal entertainment provided by the employer during the 12 week period covered by the register.

##### <a id="37CC"></a>37CC  Choosing the 12 week period for a register

             (1)  The register must be kept for a continuous period of at least
 12 weeks throughout which meal entertainment is provided by the employer.

             (2)  The period for which the register is kept must be representative of the first FBT year for which it is valid.

             (3)  If the register does not meet these conditions it is not valid.

##### <a id="37CD"></a>37CD  FBT years for which register is valid

12 week period in one FBT year

             (1)  If the 12 week period begins and ends in the same FBT year, the register is valid for that FBT year and, subject to subsection (3), for each of the 4 FBT years immediately following that year.

12 week period over 2 FBT years

             (2)  If the 12 week period begins in one FBT year and ends in another FBT year, the register is only valid for the second FBT year and, subject to subsection (3), for each of the 4 FBT years immediately following that year.

When register ceases to be valid

             (3)  A register that is valid for an FBT year ceases to be valid at the end of that FBT year if the total of expenses incurred by the employer in providing meal entertainment for that FBT year is more than 20% higher than the corresponding total for the first FBT year for which the register was valid. A register also ceases to be valid for an FBT year if there is a later valid register for that FBT year.

##### <a id="37CE"></a>37CE  Matters to be included in register

             (2)  A person responsible for making entries in the register must make the entry as soon as practicable after he or she knows the details required by subsection (1).

##### <a id="37CF"></a>37CF  False or misleading entries invalidate register

                            (iii)  the car is made available to an employee or an associate of an employee at any time during the period or periods by another person, where:

                                        (A)  the other person is neither the employer of the employee nor an associate of the employer of the employee; and

                                        (B)  the other person did not make the car available under an arrangement to which the employer of the employee, or an associate of the employer of the employee, is a party;

                     (d)  the provision of parking facilities for the car during the period or periods is in respect of the employment of the employee;

                     (e)  on that day, the employee has a primary place of employment;

                      (f)  during the period or periods, the car is parked at, or in the vicinity of, that primary place of employment;

             (4)  If at any time, whether before or after the commencement of this section, the Australian Statistician has changed or changes the reference base for the Consumer Price Index, then, for the purposes of the application of this section after the change, regard is to be had only to the index numbers published in terms of the new reference base.

##### <a id="39AA"></a>39AA  Anti-avoidance—fee on first business day not representative

                   For the purposes of subparagraph 39A(1)(a)(iii), any fee charged on the first business day of an FBT year that is not representative is to be disregarded.

##### <a id="39AB"></a>39AB  When fees are _not representative_

                   A fee charged by an operator of a commercial parking station on a particular day is **_not representative_** if the fee is substantially greater or less than the average of the lowest fee charged by the operator in the ordinary course of business to members of the public for all-day parking on each of the days in whichever of the following periods is chosen by the employer:

                     (a)  the 4 week period beginning on the day; or

                     (b)  the 4 week period ending on the day.

##### <a id="39B"></a>39B  When commercial parking stations are located within a 1 km radius of business premises or associated premises

#### Subdivision B—Taxable value of car parking fringe benefits

##### <a id="39C"></a>39C  Taxable value of car parking fringe benefits—_commercial parking station_ method

                   Subject to this Part, the taxable value, in relation to an FBT year, of a car parking fringe benefit provided on a day in the FBT year in connection with one or more premises is equal to:

                     (a)  if, on that day, there is only one commercial parking station located within a 1 km radius of any of those premises—the lowest fee charged by the operator of the parking station in the ordinary course of business to members of the public for all-day parking on that day; or

                     (b)  if, on that day, there are 2 or more commercial parking stations located within a 1 km radius of any of those premises—the lowest fee charged by any of the operators of those parking stations in the ordinary course of business to members of the public for all-day parking on that day;

\[Employer may choose market value basis]

             (1)  An employer may elect that this section apply in relation to any or all of the car parking fringe benefits in relation to the employer in relation to a particular FBT year.

\[Market value basis of working out taxable value]

             (2)  Subject to this Part, if an election is made under subsection (1) in relation to a car parking fringe benefit provided on a day in an FBT year, the taxable value, in relation to the FBT year, of the fringe benefit is:

                     (a)  the amount that the recipient could reasonably be expected to have been required to pay the provider in respect of the provision of the benefit if it were assumed that the provider and the recipient were dealing with each other at arm’s length;

reduced by:

                     (b)  the amount of the recipients contribution.

\[Valuer’s report must be given to employer]

             (3)  An election purporting to be made under subsection (1) in relation to one or more car parking fringe benefits is of no effect unless:

                     (a)  a suitably qualified valuer gives to the employer, before the declaration date, a report, in a form approved by the Commissioner, about the valuation of the fringe benefits; and

                     (b)  the valuer is at arm’s length in relation to the valuation; and

                     (c)  the return of the employer of the FBT year, in so far as it relates to the taxable values of the fringe benefits, is based on the report.

##### <a id="39DA"></a>39DA  Taxable value of car parking fringe benefits—_average cost_ method

Election

             (1)  An employer may elect that this section applies to any or all of the employer’s car parking fringe benefits for a particular FBT year.

Taxable value

             (2)  Subject to this Part, if an election covers a car parking fringe benefit, the taxable value of the fringe benefit is the average cost worked out under subsection (3) reduced by the recipients contribution.

##### <a id="39E"></a>39E  Fees charged by commercial parking stations for all-day parking

\[Daily rate equivalent for periodic parking arrangements]

             (1)  For the purposes of this Division, if the operator of a commercial parking station provides all-day parking in the ordinary course of business to members of the public on a weekly, monthly, yearly or other periodic basis, the operator is taken to charge a fee for all-day parking on a particular day during the period equal to the amount worked out using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00068/Html/FringeBenTA1986Vol1_WD02_image026.gif)

where:

                    <a name="total-fee"></a>**_Total fee_** is the total fee charged by the operator in respect of all-day parking on days in that period.

                    <a name="busi-dai-period"></a>**_Business days in period_** means the number of business days in that period.

\[Anti-avoidance]

             (2)  If either or both of the following apply:

                     (a)  a transaction between the operator of a commercial parking station and a customer is not at arm’s length;

                     (b)  the operator of a commercial parking station sets the level of a fee for the sole or dominant purpose of enabling one or more employers to obtain reductions in the taxable values of car parking fringe benefits;

then, for the purposes of this Subdivision:

                     (c)  if only paragraph (a) applies—it is to be assumed that the fee is the fee that would have been payable if the operator and the customer had been dealing with each other at arm’s length in relation to the transaction; and

                     (d)  if only paragraph (b) applies—it is to be assumed that the fee is the fee that would have been payable if it had been set without that purpose in mind; and

                     (e)  if both paragraphs (a) and (b) apply—it is to be assumed that the fee is the fee that would have been payable if:

                              (i)  the operator and the customer had been dealing with each other at arm’s length in relation to the transaction; and

                             (ii)  it had been set without that purpose in mind. 

#### Subdivision C—Statutory formula method—spaces

##### <a id="39F"></a>39F  The key principle

* * *

Under this Subdivision, an employer may elect to calculate the value of certain car parking fringe benefits by using a statutory formula based on the number and value of spaces available to employees covered by the election.

* * *

##### <a id="39FA"></a>39FA  Spaces method of calculating total taxable value of car parking fringe benefits

Election

             (1)  If a provider provides one or more car parking benefits in respect of one or more employees of an employer in a particular FBT year, the employer may elect that this Subdivision applies to the employer’s car parking fringe benefits for some or all of the employees for that FBT year.

Employer must specify employees covered by election

             (2)  The employer must specify that the election covers:

                     (a)  all the employees; or

                     (b)  all employees of a particular class; or

                     (c)  particular employees.

Total value of car parking fringe benefits

             (3)  Despite any other provision of this Act (other than section 39FB) the total taxable value of the employer’s car parking fringe benefits for employees covered by the election for the FBT year is the amount worked out using the spaces method under subsection (4).

Note:          Section 39FB covers the situation where the number of spaces available to employees exceeds the number of employees.

Method 

             (4)  The spaces method is:

_Step 1_:     Work out an amount using the following formula, for each space for which there is, in the FBT year, at least one car parking benefit for an employee covered by the election:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00068/Html/FringeBenTA1986Vol1_WD02_image027.gif)

_Step 2_:     Work out the total of all the amounts calculated under Step 1 (the **_total statutory benefit_**).

_Step 3_:     Subtract from the total statutory benefit the sum of all relevant recipients contributions.

Note 1:       Section 39FC defines **_daily rate amount_**.

Note 2:       Section 39FD defines **_availability period_**.

Note 3:       Section 39FE defines **_relevant recipients contribution_**.

             (5)  The election is of no effect if, in working out the daily rate for a space, the fees referred to in subsection 39DA(3) are **_not representative_**(see section 39AB).

##### <a id="39FB"></a>39FB  Number of spaces exceeds number of employees

             (1)  This section applies if, throughout the parking period (see subsection (5)), the average number of employees covered by the election is less than the average number of spaces (**_eligible spaces_**) for which there is an availability period.

Formula to reduce total statutory benefits

             (2)  If this section applies, the total statutory benefit (see Step 2 in subsection 39FA(4)) is multiplied by the following fraction:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00068/Html/FringeBenTA1986Vol1_WD02_image028.gif)

             (3)  The **_average number of employees_** is:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00068/Html/FringeBenTA1986Vol1_WD02_image029.gif)

             (4)  The **_average number of eligible spaces_** is:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00068/Html/FringeBenTA1986Vol1_WD02_image030.gif)

             (5)  The**_parking period_** is the period:

                     (a)  beginning on the first day in the FBT year on which the parking of a car in any space referred to in subsection 39FA(4) gives rise to a car parking fringe benefit of the employer for an employee covered by the election; and

                     (b)  ending on the last day in the FBT year on which the parking of a car in any space referred to in subsection 39FA(4) gives rise to a car parking fringe benefit of the employer for an employee covered by the election.

Number of employees and number of spaces must be representative

             (6)  This section does not apply if the number of employees or the number of eligible spaces referred to in subsections (3) and (4) are **_not representative_** (see subsection (7)).

Meaning of not representative

             (7)  A number of employees, or a number of eligible spaces, as the case requires, is **_not representative_** if the number of employees, or eligible spaces, as the case requires, is substantially greater or less than the average number throughout whichever of the following periods is chosen by the employer:

                     (a)  the 4 week period ending on the first day of the parking period; or

                     (b)  the 4 week period beginning on the last day of the parking period.

##### <a id="39FC"></a>39FC  Meaning of _daily rate amount_

                   The _daily rate amount_ for a space is the amount that would be worked out using whichever of the following methods that the taxpayer chooses:

                     (a)  the commercial parking station method;

                     (b)  the market value method;

                     (c)  the average cost method;

as the taxable value of the car parking fringe benefit for the space, if there were no recipients contribution.

##### <a id="39FD"></a>39FD  Meaning of _availability period_

                   An **_availability period_** for a space begins on the first day in the FBT year on which there is a car parking benefit for the space for an employee covered by the election and ends on the last day in the FBT year on which there is a car parking benefit for the space for an employee covered by the election.

##### <a id="39FE"></a>39FE  Meaning of _relevant recipients contribution_

                   A **_relevant recipients contribution_** is a recipients contribution in respect of any car parking fringe benefit provided in respect of the employment of an employee covered by the election for the FBT year.

#### Subdivision D—12 week record keeping method

##### <a id="39G"></a>39G  The key principle

* * *

Under this Subdivision, an employer may keep a 12 week register of car parking provided to employees. An employer who keeps such a register may elect that the total value of certain car parking fringe benefits for an FBT year for which the register is valid is to be determined in accordance with the register.

* * *

##### <a id="39GA"></a>39GA  Employer may elect to use 12 week record keeping method

             (1)  An employer may elect that this Subdivision applies to the employer’s car parking fringe benefits for some or all of the employer’s employees for that FBT year if the employer has a valid register for that FBT year covering those employees. 

             (2)  The employer must specify that the election covers:

                     (a)  all the employees; or

                     (b)  all employees of a particular class; or

                     (c)  particular employees.

##### <a id="39GB"></a>39GB  Value of fringe benefits for year

                   Despite any other provision of this Act (other than this section), the total taxable value of the employer’s car parking fringe benefits for employees covered by the election for the FBT year is the amount worked out using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00068/Html/FringeBenTA1986Vol1_WD02_image031.gif)

##### <a id="39GC"></a>39GC  Meaning of _total value of car parking benefits (register)_

                   The **_total value of car parking benefits (register)_**, in relation to the FBT year, means the amount that would be the total taxable value of car parking fringe benefits for employees covered by the election for the 12 week period for which a register is kept, assuming that:

                     (a)  the register had been kept in that FBT year; and

                     (b)  the value of the benefits were calculated in accordance with the information in the register; and

                     (c)  the value of the benefits were calculated using whichever of the following methods that the taxpayer chooses:

                              (i)  the commercial parking station method;

                             (ii)  the market value method;

                            (iii)  the average cost method.

##### <a id="39GD"></a>39GD  Meaning of _car parking availability period_

                   The **_car parking availability period_** is the period:

                     (a)  beginning on the first day in the FBT year on which there is a car parking benefit for an employee covered by the election; and

                     (b)  ending on the last day in the FBT year on which there is a car parking benefit for an employee covered by the election.

##### <a id="39GE"></a>39GE  Choosing the 12 week period for a register

             (1)  The register must be kept for a continuous period of at least 12 weeks throughout which car parking benefits are provided to employees covered by the election.

             (2)  The period for which the register is kept must be representative of usage for the first FBT year for which it is valid.

             (3)  If subsection (1) or (2) is not satisfied, the register is not valid. 

##### <a id="39GF"></a>39GF  FBT years for which register is valid

12 week period in one FBT year

             (1)  If the 12 week period begins and ends in the one FBT year, the register is valid for that FBT year and, subject to subsections (3) and (4), for each of the 4 FBT years immediately following that year.

12 week period over 2 FBT years

             (2)  If the 12 week period begins in one FBT year and ends in another FBT year, the register is only valid for the second FBT year and, subject to subsections (3) and (4), for each of the 4 years immediately following that year.

When register ceases to be valid—increase in benefits

             (3)  A register that is valid for an FBT year ceases to be valid at the end of that FBT year if the number of car parking fringe benefits for the employer for employees covered by the election increases by more than 10% on any day in that FBT year.

Note:          This means that if the number of car parking fringe benefits increases by more than 10%, the employer will have to keep a new register in the FBT year following the year of the increase if the employer wants to use the method in this Subdivision for that following year.

When a register ceases to be valid—later register

             (4)  A register that is valid for an FBT year ceases to be valid if there is a later valid register for that FBT year that covers the same employee.

##### <a id="39GG"></a>39GG  Matters to be included in register

             (1)  The register must include details of the following:

                     (a)  the date on which each car covered by subsection (4) was parked;

                     (b)  whether the car was parked for a total that exceeds 4 hours;

                     (c)  whether the car travelled between the place of residence of an employee covered by the election and his or her primary place of employment on that day;

                     (d)  the place where the car was parked.

             (2)  The person responsible for making entries in the register must make the entry as soon as practicable after he or she knows the details required by subsection (1).

             (3)  If subsection (1) or (2) is not satisfied, the register is not valid.

             (4)  A car is covered by this subsection if:

                     (a)  a car benefit relating to the car is provided on a day during the 12 week period to an employee covered by the election in respect of the employee’s employment; or

                     (b)  the car is owned by, or leased to, an employee covered by the election at any time during the 12 week period; or

                     (c)  the car is made available by another person to an employee covered by the election at any time during the 12 week period where:

                              (i)  the other person is not the employee’s employer; and

                             (ii)  the other person did not make the car available under an arrangement to which the employee’s employer is a party.

##### <a id="39GH"></a>39GH  Fraudulent entries invalidate register

                   For the purposes of this Act, a register is not valid if the register contains an entry that is false or misleading in a material particular.

### Division 11—Property fringe benefits

                             (ii)  if the employer is a company, of the employer or of a company that is related to the employer;

the benefit is an exempt benefit.

             (2)  This section does not apply to food or drink provided to, and consumed by, an employee if the food or drink is provided:

                     (a)  because of the employee agreeing to receive the food or drink in return for a reduction in the employee’s salary or wages that would not have happened apart from the agreement; or

                     (b)  as part of the employee’s remuneration package, in circumstances where it is reasonable to conclude that the employee’s salary or wages would be greater if the food or drink were not made part of that package.

#### Subdivision B—Taxable value of property fringe benefits

##### <a id="42"></a>42  Taxable value of in-house property fringe benefits

             (1)  Subject to this Part, the taxable value of an in-house property fringe benefit in relation to an employer in relation to a year of tax is:

                     (a)  if the recipient’s property was manufactured, produced, processed or treated by the provider:

                              (i)  if identical property that was manufactured, produced, processed or treated, as the case may be, by the provider was, at or about the provision time, sold by the provider in the ordinary course of business to purchasers being manufacturers, wholesalers or retailers—an amount equal to:

                                        (A)  if any of that identical property was, at or about the provision time, sold by the provider under an arm’s length transaction or arm’s length transactions—the lowest price at which it was sold under such a transaction; or

                                        (B)  if sub-subparagraph (A) does not apply—the lowest price at which any of that identical property could reasonably be expected to have been sold by the provider at or about the provision time under an arm’s length transaction; or

                                        (B)  in similar circumstances and subject to identical terms and conditions (other than as to price) as those that applied in relation to the provision of the recipient’s property to the recipient;

                                   an amount equal to 75% of the lowest price at which that property was so sold to a member of the public; or

                            (iii)  in any other case—an amount equal to 75% of the notional value of the recipient’s property at the provision time; or

                     (b)  if paragraph (a) does not apply and the property was acquired by the provider—an amount equal to the lesser of:

How to work out aggregate non-rebatable amount

          (2B)  An employer’s **_aggregate non-rebatable amount_** for the year of tax is the amount worked out as follows.

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.    For each employee, add:

               (a)     the individual grossed-up type 1 non-rebatable amount (see subsection (2C)) in relation to the employer for the year of tax; and

               (b)     the individual grossed-up type 2 non-rebatable amount (see subsection (2D)) in relation to the employer for the year of tax.

              The result is the **_individual grossed-up non-rebatable amount_** for the employee.

Step 2.    Reduce the individual grossed-up non-rebatable amount for each employee of the employer:

               (a)     to zero for the year of tax beginning on 1 April 2000; and

               (b)     by $30,000, but not below zero, for a later year of tax.

                   Note:             Paragraph (a) means the employer’s aggregate non-rebatable amount for the year of tax beginning on 1 April 2000 will be nil.

Step 3.    Add up the results of step 2 for all the employer’s employees.

Step 4.    Multiply the sum from step 3 by the FBT rate. The result is the employer’s **_aggregate non-rebatable amount_** for the year of tax.

* * *

Individual grossed-up type 1 non-rebatable amount

          (2C)  For the purposes of step 1 in the method statement in subsection (2B), the **_individual grossed-up type 1 non-rebatable amount_** of an employee in relation to the employer for the year of tax is:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00068/Html/FringeBenTA1986Vol1_WD02_image040.gif)

Working out the type 1 individual base non-rebatable amount

           (2E)  An employee’s **_type 1 individual base non-rebatable amount_** in relation to the employer for the year of tax is worked out by adding the amounts worked out under step 3 of the method statement in subsection (2G) and step 3 of the method statement in subsection (2H).

Working out the type 2 individual base non-rebatable amount

           (2F)  An employee’s **_type 2 individual base non-rebatable amount_** in relation to the employer for the year of tax is worked out by adding the amounts worked out under step 4 of the method statement in subsection (2G) and step 4 of the method statement in subsection (2H).

Working out the subsection (2G) amounts

          (2G)  An employee’s subsection (2G) amounts for the year of tax are worked out as follows.

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.    Work out under section 5E for each of the employer’s employees the employee’s individual fringe benefits amount (if any) for the year of tax in respect of the employee’s employment by the employer.

Step 2.    Identify the benefits taken into account in step 1 that are GST-creditable benefits (see section 149A).

Step 3.    So much of the amount worked out under step 1 that relates to the benefits identified under step 2 is the **_step 3 of subsection (2G) amount_** for the individual.

Step 4.    The remainder of the amount is the **_step 4 of subsection (2G) amount_** for the individual.

* * *

Working out the subsection (2H) amounts

          (2H)  An employee’s subsection (2H) amounts for the year of tax are worked out as follows.

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.    Work out for each employee his or her share (if any) of the taxable values of the excluded fringe benefits for the year of tax in respect of the employee’s employment by the employer, but disregarding benefits:

               (a)     that constitute the provision of meal entertainment as defined in section 37AD (whether or not the employer made an election under section 37AA); or

               (b)     that are car parking fringe benefits; or

               (c)     whose taxable values are wholly or partly attributable to entertainment facility leasing expenses.

Step 2.    Identify the benefits taken into account in step 1 that are GST-creditable benefits (see section 149A).

Step 3.    So much of the amount worked out under step 1 that relates to the benefits identified under step 2 is the **_step 3 of subsection (2H) amount_** for the individual.

Step 4.    The remainder of the amount is the **_step 4 of subsection (2H) amount_** for the individual.

             (1)  Subject to this Act, tax imposed in respect of the fringe benefits taxable amount of an employer of a year of tax is payable by the employer.

             (2)  A law, or a provision of a law, passed before the commencement of this Act that purports to exempt a person from liability to pay fringe benefits tax or to pay taxes that include that tax does not exempt that person from liability to pay that tax.

             (3)  A law, or a provision of a law, passed after the commencement of this Act that purports to exempt a person from liability to pay taxes under the laws of the Commonwealth or to pay certain taxes under those laws that include fringe benefits tax, other than a law or a provision that expressly exempts a person from liability to pay that tax, shall not be construed as exempting the person from liability to pay that tax.

##### <a id="67"></a>67  Arrangements to avoid or reduce fringe benefits tax

             (1)  Where:

                     (a)  an employer (in this subsection referred to as the **_eligible employer_**) has obtained or, but for this section, would obtain, a tax benefit in respect of a year of tax in connection with an arrangement under which a benefit is or was provided to a person, being an arrangement that was entered into, or commenced to be carried out, on or after 19 September 1985; and

                     (b)  it would be concluded that the person, or one of the persons, who entered into or carried out the arrangement or any part of the arrangement did so for the sole or dominant purpose of enabling the eligible employer to obtain a tax benefit in connection with the arrangement or of enabling the eligible employer and another employer or other employers each to obtain a tax benefit in connection with the arrangement (whether or not that person who entered into or carried out the arrangement or any part of the arrangement is the eligible employer or is the other employer or one of the other employers);

the Commissioner:

                     (c)  may determine that the aggregate fringe benefits amount (if any) of the eligible employer of the year of tax be increased by the amount of the tax benefit; and

                     (d)  may determine that appropriate adjustments (if any) be made to the aggregate fringe benefits amount of the eligible employer in respect of another year of tax or of another employer in respect of any year of tax;

and any such determination has effect accordingly.

             (2)  A reference in this section to the obtaining by an employer of a tax benefit in respect of a year of tax in connection with an arrangement under which a benefit is provided to a person is a reference to an amount not being included in the aggregate fringe benefits amount of the employer of the year of tax in respect of that benefit where the amount would have been included, or could reasonably be expected to have been included, in that aggregate fringe benefits amount if the arrangement had not been entered into or carried out.

             (3)  A reference in this section to the obtaining by an employer of a tax benefit in respect of a year of tax in connection with an arrangement under which a benefit is provided to a person does not include a reference to an amount not being included in the aggregate fringe benefits amount of the employer of the year of tax in respect of that benefit, being an amount that would have been included, or could reasonably be expected to have been included, in that aggregate fringe benefits amount if the arrangement had not been entered into or carried out, where the non-inclusion of the amount in that aggregate fringe benefits amount is attributable to the payment or provision by a person of consideration in respect of the provision of the benefit.

             (4)  Where, at any time, an employer considers that the Commissioner ought to make a determination under paragraph (1)(d) in relation to the employer in relation to a year of tax, the employer may post to or lodge with the Commissioner a request in writing for the making by the Commissioner of a determination under that paragraph.

             (5)  The Commissioner shall consider the request and serve on the employer a written notice of the Commissioner’s decision on the request.

             (6)  If the employer is dissatisfied with the Commissioner’s decision on the request, the employer may object against the decision in the manner set out in Part IVC of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

             (8)  Nothing in section 74 prevents the amendment of an assessment at any time before the end of 6 years after the original assessment date if the amendment is for the purposes of giving effect to subsection (1) of this section as it applies by virtue of paragraph (1)(c).

             (9)  Nothing in section 74 prevents the amendment of an assessment at any time if the amendment is for the purpose of giving effect to subsection (1) of this section as it applies by virtue of paragraph (1)(d).

           (10)  In this section, a reference to an employer, in relation to an arrangement, includes a reference to a person who would be, or might reasonably be expected to be, an employer but for the arrangement.

           (11)  A reference in this section to the carrying out of an arrangement by a person shall be read as including a reference to the carrying out of an arrangement by a person together with another person or other persons.

           (12)  Nothing in the provisions of this Act other than this section or in the _International Tax Agreements Act 1953_ or in the _Petroleum (__Timor Sea__Treaty) Act 2003_ shall be taken to limit the operation of this section.
