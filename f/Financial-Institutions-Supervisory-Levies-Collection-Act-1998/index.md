                              (i)  the day that is 6 weeks after the day on which the leviable body becomes that type of leviable body; or

                             (ii)  if the day applicable under subparagraph (i) is not a business day, the first business day following that day.

             (2)  Levy payable under subsection 8(6) for a financial year by a trustee of a superannuation entity is due and payable:

                     (a)  if the entity is a superannuation entity on 1 July of the financial year and became a superannuation entity before that day—on a business day that:

                              (i)  is specified in a notice given by APRA to the Treasurer on or after the day on which an annual return that is a reporting document under section 13 of the _Financial Sector (Collection of Data) Act 2001_ and that relates to the previous financial year was received by APRA; and

                              (i)  is specified in a notice given by APRA to the trustee; and

                             (ii)  is not earlier than 6 weeks after the day on which the notice is given.

##### <a id="10"></a>10  Late payment penalty

             (1)  If any levy payable by a levy paying entity:

                     (a)  is not paid on or before the day on which it is due and payable (the **_due day for payment_**); and

                     (b)  remains unpaid after the penalty calculation day;

the levy paying entity is liable to pay, by way of penalty, an amount worked out at the rate of 20% per year on the amount unpaid, computed from the end of the due day for payment to the end of the penalty calculation day.

             (2)  The **_penalty calculation day_** is:

                     (a)  if the levy is paid on or after the first day of a month and before the sixth day of that month—the 20th day of the immediately preceding month; or

                     (c)  if the levy is paid on or after the 20th day of a month and on or before the last day of that month—the 20th day of that month.

##### <a id="11"></a>11  Payment of levy and late payment penalty

                   Levy and late payment penalty are payable to APRA on behalf of the Commonwealth.

Note:          Levy and late payment penalty may be payable to the Commissioner of Taxation because of section 252G of the _Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993_.

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Waiver of levy and late payment penalty

                   APRA, on behalf of the Commonwealth, may, if APRA considers it is appropriate to do so, waive the payment of the whole or a part of an amount of levy or late payment penalty that is payable by a levy paying entity.

Note:          For example, if levy is payable by a body corporate which has ceased to be authorised under the _Insurance Act 1973_ to carry on an insurance business and has ceased to be a life company, APRA may waive the payment of the levy if APRA considers it appropriate to do so because payment of the levy would prevent payment in full of claims under contracts of insurance made with the body corporate.

##### <a id="13"></a>13  Recovery of levy and late payment penalty

             (1)  The following amounts may be recovered by the Commonwealth as debts due to the Commonwealth:

                     (b)  late payment penalty that is due and payable.

             (2)  APRA is authorised, as agent of the Commonwealth, to bring proceedings in the name of the Commonwealth for the recovery of a debt due to the Commonwealth of a kind mentioned in subsection (1).

##### <a id="14"></a>14  Exempting laws ineffective

             (1)  Nothing in a law passed before the commencement of this section exempts a levy paying entity from liability to pay levy.

             (2)  If a law (including a provision of a law) passed after the commencement of this section purports to exempt a levy paying entity from:

                     (a)  liability to pay taxes under laws of the Commonwealth; or

                     (b)  liability to pay certain taxes under laws of the Commonwealth that would otherwise include levy;

the law does not operate to exempt the levy paying entity from liability to pay levy unless the exemption expressly refers to levy under this Act.

##### <a id="15"></a>15  Regulations may modify this Part if levy Act commences during a financial year

                   If an Act mentioned in section 8 that imposes levy in respect of a particular type of leviable body commences during a financial year (but not on 1 July of that financial year), this Act has effect in relation to that financial year and that type of leviable body subject to the modifications specified in the regulations.

             (1)  If any levy payable by the trustee of a fund remains unpaid as at:

                     (a)  the beginning of the first levy month after the time when it became due for payment; or

                     (b)  the beginning of a later levy month;

                     (b)  the levy payable by the entity would, apart from this item, have been due and payable under section 9 of the Collection Act before the deferred payment day.

(2)        The levy payable by the entity is taken to be due and payable on the deferred payment day, despite section 9 of the Collection Act.

_Note:       This provision affects the calculation of late payment penalty (if any) under section 10 of the Collection Act._

## 3  No retrospective criminal liability

Nothing in this Part or the Validation Acts is taken to make a person criminally liable in respect of acts or omissions of the person before the day on which this Part commences, if the person would not have been so liable had this Part and the Validation Acts not been enacted.
