             (1)  Levy payable by a leviable body (other than a superannuation entity) for a financial year under section 8 is due and payable on:

                     (a)  if the levy imposition day relating to the levy payable by the leviable body i<st1:personname style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x">s 1</st1:personname> July of the financial year—a business day that is:

                              (i)  specified in a notice given to the leviable body by APRA in relation to the financial year; and

                             (ii)  is not earlier than 28 days after the day on which the notice is given; or

                     (b)  if the levy imposition day relating to the levy payable by the leviable body is a day of that financial year after 1 July—by:

                              (i)  the day that is 6 weeks after the day on which the leviable body becomes that type of leviable body; or

                             (ii)  if the day applicable under subparagraph (i) is not a business day, the first business day following that day.

             (2)  Levy payable under subsection 8(6) for a financial year by a trustee of a superannuation entity is due and payable:

                     (a)  if the entity is a superannuation entity on 1 July of the financial year and became a superannuation entity before that day—on a business day that:

                              (i)  is specified in a notice given by APRA to the trustee on or after the day on which a return under section 36 of the _Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993_ that relates to the previous financial year was received by APRA; and

                             (ii)  is not earlier than 6 weeks after the day on which the notice is given; or

                     (b)  if the entity becomes a superannuation entity on or after 1 July of the financial year—on a business day that:

                              (i)  is specified in a notice given by APRA to the trustee; and

                             (ii)  is not earlier than 6 weeks after the day on which the notice is given.

##### <a id="10"></a>10  Late payment penalty

             (1)  If any levy payable by a levy paying entity:

                     (a)  is not paid on or before the day on which it is due and payable (the **_due day for payment_**); and

                     (b)  remains unpaid after the penalty calculation day;

the levy paying entity is liable to pay, by way of penalty, an amount worked out at the rate of 20% per year on the amount unpaid, computed from the end of the due day for payment to the end of the penalty calculation day.

             (2)  The **_penalty calculation day_** is:

                     (a)  if the levy is paid on or after the first day of a month and before the sixth day of that month—the 20th day of the immediately preceding month; or

                     (b)  if the levy is paid on or after the sixth day of a month and before the 20th day of that month—the sixth day of that month; or

                     (c)  if the levy is paid on or after the 20th day of a month and on or before the last day of that month—the 20th day of that month.

##### <a id="11"></a>11  Payment of levy and late payment penalty

             (1)  Levy and late payment penalty are payable to APRA on behalf of the Commonwealth.

             (2)  APRA must pay to the Commonwealth any amounts of levy or late payment penalty received by it.

Note:          Levy and late payment penalty may be payable to the Commissioner of Taxation because of section 252G of the _Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993_.

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Waiver of levy and late payment penalty

                   APRA, on behalf of the Commonwealth, may, if APRA considers it is appropriate to do so, waive the payment of the whole or a part of an amount of levy or late payment penalty that is payable by a levy paying entity.

Note:          For example, if levy is payable by a body corporate which has ceased to be authorised under the _Insurance Act 1973_ to carry on an insurance business and has ceased to be a life company, APRA may waive the payment of the levy if APRA considers it appropriate to do so because payment of the levy would prevent payment in full of claims under contracts of insurance made with the body corporate.

##### <a id="13"></a>13  Recovery of levy and late payment penalty

             (1)  The following amounts may be recovered by the Commonwealth as debts due to the Commonwealth:

                     (a)  levy that is due and payable;

                     (b)  late payment penalty that is due and payable.

             (2)  APRA is authorised, as agent of the Commonwealth, to bring proceedings in the name of the Commonwealth for the recovery of a debt due to the Commonwealth of a kind mentioned in subsection (1).

             (3)  If, in proceedings brought by APRA under subsection (2), the Commonwealth is ordered to pay costs, APRA must pay the costs out of APRA’s money and the Commonwealth is not liable to reimburse APRA for the payment.

##### <a id="14"></a>14  Exempting laws ineffective

             (1)  Nothing in a law passed before the commencement of this section exempts a levy paying entity from liability to pay levy.

             (2)  If a law (including a provision of a law) passed after the commencement of this section purports to exempt a levy paying entity from:

                     (a)  liability to pay taxes under laws of the Commonwealth; or

                     (b)  liability to pay certain taxes under laws of the Commonwealth that would otherwise include levy;

the law does not operate to exempt the levy paying entity from liability to pay levy unless the exemption expressly refers to levy under this Act.

##### <a id="15"></a>15  Regulations may modify this Part if levy Act commences during a financial year

                   If an Act mentioned in section 8 that imposes levy in respect of a particular type of leviable body commences during a financial year (but not on 1 July of that financial year), this Act has effect in relation to that financial year and that type of leviable body subject to the modifications specified in the regulations.

##### <a id="20"></a>20  Late payment penalty

             (1)  If any levy payable by the trustee of a fund remains unpaid as at:

                     (a)  the beginning of the first levy month after the time when it became due for payment; or

                     (b)  the beginning of a later levy month;

the trustee is liable to pay to the Commonwealth, in respect of that levy month, by way of penalty, the amount worked out using the formula:

<v:shape id="_x0000_i1026" style="WIDTH: 87.75pt; HEIGHT: 27pt" o:ole="" type="#_x0000_t75" coordsize="21600,21600"><v:imagedata o:title="" src="27C8F306DF3207D2CA256FB7001E568F/$FILE/image003.wmz"></v:imagedata></v:shape>

                     (a)  levy that is due and payable;

                     (b)  late payment penalty that is due and payable.

##### <a id="24"></a>24  How payments of levy and late payment penalty and repayments of financial assistance are to be applied

             (1)  If a levy is imposed as a result of a determination by the Minister to make a grant of financial assistance not from the Account, then the following amounts must be paid to the Commonwealth and not credited to the Account:

                     (a)  any amounts of that levy, and of late payment penalty in respect of that levy, that are received by the Minister; and

                     (b)  any repayments of that financial assistance.

             (2)  If a levy is imposed as a result of a determination by the Minister to make a grant of financial assistance from the Account, then the following amounts must be paid to the Commonwealth and credited to the Account:

                     (a)  amounts equal to any amounts of that levy, and of late payment penalty in respect of that levy, that are received by the Minister; and

                     (a)  liability to pay taxes under laws of the Commonwealth; or

                     (b)  liability to pay certain taxes under laws of the Commonwealth that would otherwise include levy;

##### <a id="27"></a>27  Review of certain decisions

             (1)  A levy paying entity that is affected by a reviewable decision of the decision maker may, if dissatisfied with the decision, request the decision maker to reconsider the decision.

                     (a)  be made by notice given to the decision maker within:

                              (i)  the period of 21 days after the day on which the levy paying entity first receives notice of the decision; or

             (3)  When the decision maker receives the request the decision maker must reconsider the decision. 

             (4)  The decision maker may confirm or revoke the decision or vary the decision in the manner that the decision maker thinks fit.

             (5)  If the decision maker confirms, revokes or varies the decision during the period of 21 days after the day on which the decision maker received the request, the decision maker is to give a notice in writing to the levy paying entity that made the request.

             (7)  If a decision is taken to be confirmed under subsection (4), section 29 of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ applies as if the prescribed time for making application for review of the decision were the period commencing on the day on which the decision is taken to be confirmed and ending on the 28th day after that day.

             (8)  If a request is made under subsection (1) in respect of a reviewable decision, section 41 of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ applies as if the making of the request were the making of an application to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of that decision.

             (9)  The hearing of a proceeding relating to a reviewable decision is to take place in private and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal may, by order:

                     (a)  give directions as to the persons who may be present; and

                     (b)  give directions of a kind referred to in paragraph 35(2)(b) or (c) of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_.

##### <a id="28"></a>28  Statements to accompany notification of decisions

             (1)  If notice in writing is given to a levy paying entity affected by a reviewable decision that the reviewable decision has been made, that notice must include words to the effect that:

                     (a)  the levy paying entity may seek a reconsideration of the reviewable decision by the decision maker in accordance with subsection 27(1) if the levy paying entity is dissatisfied with the decision; and

                     (b)  the levy paying entity may, subject to the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_, apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of a reviewable decision that is confirmed or varied under subsection 27(4), or for review of a decision to revoke a reviewable decision.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  the decision maker confirms or varies a reviewable decision under subsection 27(4), or makes a decision to revoke a reviewable decision under that subsection; and

                     (b)  gives the levy paying entity affected by the decision notice in writing of the confirmation or variation of the decision, or of the revocation of the decision;

that notice must include words to the effect that the levy paying entity may, subject to the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_, apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of the reviewable decision as confirmed or varied, or for review of the decision to revoke the reviewable decision.

             (3)  A failure to comply with the requirements of subsections (1) and (2) in relation to a reviewable decision or a decision under subsection 27(4) does not affect the validity of that decision.
