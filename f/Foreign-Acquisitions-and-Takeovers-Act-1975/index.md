             (2)  Notwithstanding the repeal of the _Companies (Foreign Take‑overs) Act 1972‑1974_, that Act, other than section 17 shall be deemed to continue in force in relation to:

                     (a)  an offer (including an offer constituting, or made in pursuance of an invitation constituting, a take‑over offer) to sell or purchase shares that was accepted before the date of commencement of this Act; and
