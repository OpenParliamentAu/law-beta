	(3)	A reference in this Act to a holding corporation of another corporation is a reference to a corporation of which that other corporation is a subsidiary.
11  Interests in shares

that person shall be deemed to hold an interest in that share.
	(3)	A person shall not be deemed not to hold an interest in a share by reason only that he holds the interest in the share jointly with another person.
	(4)	It is immaterial, for the purpose of determining whether a person holds an interest in a share, that the interest cannot be related to a particular share.

	(b)	an interest of a person in a share, being an interest held by him by reason of his holding a prescribed office; and
	(c)	an interest of a prescribed kind in a share, being an interest of such person, or of the persons included in such class of persons, as is prescribed.
	(6)	An interest in a share shall not be disregarded by reason only of:
	(a)	its remoteness;
	(b)	the manner in which it arose; or
	(c)	the fact that the exercise of a right conferred by the interest is or is capable of being made subject to restraint or restriction.
	(7)	In relation to a corporation the whole or a portion of the share capital of which consists of stock, an interest of a person in any such stock shall be deemed to be an interest in an issued share in the corporation having the same nominal amount as the amount of that stock and having attached to it the same rights as are attached to that stock.
