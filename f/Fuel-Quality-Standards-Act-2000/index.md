## Part 2—Regulation of fuel and fuel additives

### Division 1—Overview

##### <a id="11"></a>11  Overview of Part

* * *

This Part sets out a regulatory regime in relation to activities involving fuel and fuel additives.

Division 2 creates offences and civil penalty provisions relating to supplying fuel that does not comply with fuel standards and to supplies of fuel that do not comply with fuel quality information standards.

Division 3 deals with the granting of approvals (including emergency approvals) to vary a fuel standard or a fuel quality information standard. It also deals with varying and revoking those approvals.

Division 4 deals with fuel documentation that is required for certain supplies of fuel in Australia.

Division 5 creates an offence and a civil penalty provision relating to the alteration of fuel.

Division 6 deals with the making and varying of fuel standards and fuel quality information standards and the consultation required beforehand. In some cases, notification, rather than consultation, is required.

Division 7 creates offences and civil penalty provisions relating to the supply or importation of a fuel additive that is covered by an entry in the Register of Prohibited Fuel Additives.

Division 8 deals with keeping the Register and the process to be followed before entries are made in it.

Application for order

             (1)  Within 6 years of a person (the **_wrongdoer_**) contravening a civil penalty provision, the Minister may apply to a Court for an order that the wrongdoer pay the Commonwealth a pecuniary penalty.

Court may order wrongdoer to pay pecuniary penalty

             (2)  If the Court is satisfied that the wrongdoer has contravened a civil penalty provision, the Court may order the wrongdoer to pay to the Commonwealth, for each contravention, the pecuniary penalty that the Court determines is appropriate (but not more than the relevant amount specified for the provision).

Determining amount of pecuniary penalty

             (3)  In determining the pecuniary penalty, the Court must have regard to all relevant matters, including:

                     (a)  the nature and extent of the contravention; and

                     (b)  the nature and extent of any loss or damage suffered as a result of the contravention; and

                     (c)  the circumstances in which the contravention took place; and

                     (d)  whether the person has previously been found by a court in proceedings under this Act to have engaged in any similar conduct.

Civil evidence and procedure rules apply

             (4)  The Court must apply the rules of evidence and procedure for civil matters when hearing and determining an application for an order under this section.

Note:          The standard of proof in civil proceedings is the balance of probabilities: see section 140 of the _Evidence Act 1995_.

             (1)  A person must not:

                   If a Court orders a person to pay a pecuniary penalty:

                     (a)  the penalty is payable to the Commonwealth; and

                     (b)  the Commonwealth may enforce the order as if it were a judgment of the Court.

##### <a id="65D"></a>65D  Gathering information for application for pecuniary penalty

             (1)  This section applies if it appears to the Secretary that a person (the **_wrongdoer_**) may have contravened a civil penalty provision.

             (2)  If the Secretary, on reasonable grounds, suspects that a person other than the wrongdoer can give information relevant to an application for a civil penalty order in relation to the contravention, whether or not such an application has been made, the Secretary may, by writing given to the person, require the person to give all reasonable assistance in connection with such an application.

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not apply in relation to a duly qualified legal practitioner who is acting, or has acted, for the wrongdoer.

             (4)  If a person fails to give assistance as required under subsection (2), a Court may, on the application of the Secretary, order the person to comply with the requirement as specified in the order.

             (5)  If a person fails to give assistance as required under subsection (2), the person commits an offence against this subsection.

                    Penalty:  30 penalty units.

             (6)  A requirement made under subsection (2) is not a legislative instrument.

#### Subdivision B—Civil penalty proceedings and criminal proceedings

##### <a id="65E"></a>65E  Civil proceedings after criminal proceedings

                   A Court must not order a person to pay a pecuniary penalty for contravening a civil penalty provision if the person has been convicted of an offence constituted by conduct that is substantially the same as the conduct constituting the contravention.

##### <a id="65F"></a>65F  Criminal proceedings during civil proceedings

             (1)  Proceedings for an order for a person to pay a pecuniary penalty for contravening a civil penalty provision are stayed if:

                     (a)  criminal proceedings are started, or have already been started, against the person for an offence; and

                     (b)  the offence is constituted by conduct that is substantially the same as the conduct alleged to constitute the contravention.

             (2)  The proceedings for the order may be resumed if the person is not convicted of the offence. Otherwise, the proceedings for the order are dismissed.

##### <a id="65G"></a>65G  Criminal proceedings after civil proceedings

                   Criminal proceedings may not be started against a person for conduct that is substantially the same as conduct that contravenes a civil penalty provision if the person has been ordered to pay a pecuniary penalty under this Act for the contravention.

##### <a id="65H"></a>65H  Evidence given in proceedings for penalty not admissible in criminal proceedings

                   Evidence of information given or evidence of production of documents by an individual is not admissible in criminal proceedings for an offence against the individual if:

                     (a)  the individual previously gave the evidence or produced the documents in proceedings for an order for a contravention of a civil penalty provision (whether or not the order was made); and

                     (b)  the conduct alleged to constitute the offence is substantially the same as the conduct that was claimed to constitute the contravention.

However, this does not apply to a criminal proceeding in respect of the falsity of the evidence given by the individual in the proceedings for the pecuniary penalty order.

##### <a id="65J"></a>65J  Civil double jeopardy

                   If a person is ordered to pay a pecuniary penalty for contravening a civil penalty provision in respect of particular conduct, the person is not liable to a pecuniary penalty under some other provision of a law of the Commonwealth in respect of that conduct.

#### Subdivision C—Miscellaneous

##### <a id="65K"></a>65K  Multiple contraventions of civil penalty provisions

             (1)  Proceedings against a person for any number of orders to pay pecuniary penalties for contraventions of a civil penalty provision that are founded on the same facts or form, or are part of, a series of contraventions of the same or a similar character, may be joined.

             (2)  A Court may make a single order to pay a pecuniary penalty for all the contraventions described in subsection (1), but the penalty must not exceed the sum of the maximum penalties that could be ordered if a separate penalty were ordered for each of the contraventions.
