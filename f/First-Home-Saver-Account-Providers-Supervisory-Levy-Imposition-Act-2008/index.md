Note:          For **_restricted levy component_**, see subsection (2). For **_unrestricted levy component_**, see subsection (3).

                     (a)  the **_maximum restricted levy_** **_amount_** for each financial year; and

                     (b)  the **_minimum restricted levy amount_** for each financial year; and

                     (c)  the **_restricted levy percentage_** for each financial year; and

                     (d)  the **_unrestricted levy percentage_** for each financial year; and

                     (e)  how a **_leviable FHSA entity’s levy base_** is to be worked out.

             (6)  An amount determined under paragraph (5)(a) as the maximum restricted levy amount must not exceed the statutory upper limit as at the time when the determination is made.

             (7)  The Treasurer’s determination under paragraph (5)(e) of how a leviable FHSA entity’s levy base is to be worked out must:

                     (a)  in the case of a leviable FHSA entity that is the trustee of a trust—specify that the value is to be worked out using the total value of the assets of FHSA trusts provided by the entity; and

                     (b)  in the case of a leviable FHSA entity that is an ADI or a life insurance company—specify that the value is to be worked out using the balances of all FHSAs provided by the entity.

             (8)  The Treasurer’s determination under paragraph (5)(e) of how a leviable FHSA entity’s levy base is to be worked out must include, but is not limited to, a determination of the day as at which the leviable FHSA entity’s levy base is to be worked out. That day must be:

                     (a)  if the leviable FHSA entity was a leviable FHSA entity at all times from and including 17 March of the previous financial year to and including the following 30 June—a day in the period from and including that 17 March to and including the following 14 April; or

                     (b)  if the leviable FHSA entity was not a leviable FHSA entity at all times from and including 17 March of the previous financial year to and including the following 30 June—the day after that 17 March when the leviable FHSA entity became, or becomes, a leviable FHSA entity.

(9)  A determination under subsection (5) may make different provision for different classes of leviable FHSA entity.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Calculation of indexation factor

             (1)  The **_indexation factor_** for a financial year is the number worked out by:

                     (a)  dividing the index number for the March quarter immediately preceding that financial year by the index number for the March quarter immediately preceding that first‑mentioned March quarter; and

                     (b)  adding 0.030 to the number worked out under paragraph (a).

             (2)  The indexation factor is to be calculated to 3 decimal places, but increased by .001 if the 4th decimal place is more than 4.

             (3)  Calculations under paragraph (1)(a) are to be made:

                     (a)  using only the index numbers published in terms of the most recently published reference base for the Consumer Price Index; and

                     (b)  disregarding index numbers published in substitution for previously published index numbers (except where the substituted numbers are published to take account of changes in the reference base).
