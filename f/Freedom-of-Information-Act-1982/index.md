## Part II—Information publication scheme

### Division 1—Guide to this Part

##### <a id="7A"></a>7A  Information publication scheme—guide

* * *

This Part establishes an information publication scheme for agencies.

Each agency must publish a plan showing how it proposes to implement this Part.

An agency must publish a range of information including information about what the agency does and the way it does it, as well as information dealt with or used in the course of its operations, some of which is called operational information.

In addition, an agency may publish other information held by the agency.

Information published by an agency must be kept accurate, up‑to‑date and complete.

An agency is not required to publish exempt matter. An agency is also not required to publish information if prohibited by another enactment.

The information (or details of how to access the information) must be published on a website. If there is a charge for accessing the information, the agency must publish details of the charge.

An agency must, in conjunction with the Information Commissioner, review the operation of the scheme in the agency every 5 years (if not earlier).

An agency must have regard to the objects of this Act, and guidelines issued by the Information Commissioner, in doing anything for the purposes of this Part.

If operational information is not published in accordance with this Part, a person must not be subjected to any prejudice as a result of not having access to the information.

             (2)  A decision in respect of a request made to a court, or made to a tribunal, authority or body that is specified in Schedule 1, may be made on behalf of that court, tribunal, authority or body by the principal officer of that court, tribunal, authority or body or, subject to the regulations, by an officer of that court, tribunal, authority or body acting within the scope of authority exercisable by him or her in accordance with arrangements approved by the principal officer of that court, tribunal, authority or body.

##### <a id="24"></a>24  Power to refuse request—diversion of resources etc.

             (1)  If an agency or Minister is satisfied, when dealing with a request for a document, that a practical refusal reason exists in relation to the request (see section 24AA), the agency or Minister:

                     (a)  must undertake a request consultation process (see section 24AB); and

                     (b)  if, after the request consultation process, the agency or Minister is satisfied that the practical refusal reason still exists—the agency or Minister may refuse to give access to the document in accordance with the request.

             (2)  For the purposes of this section, the agency or Minister may treat 2 or more requests as a single request if the agency or Minister is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the requests relate to the same document or documents; or

                     (b)  the requests relate to documents, the subject matter of which is substantially the same.

##### <a id="24AA"></a>24AA  When does a _practical refusal reason_ exist?

             (1)  For the purposes of section 24, a **_practical refusal reason_** exists in relation to a request for a document if either (or both) of the following applies:

                     (a)  the work involved in processing the request:

                              (i)  in the case of an agency—would substantially and unreasonably divert the resources of the agency from its other operations; or

                             (ii)  in the case of a Minister—would substantially and unreasonably interfere with the performance of the Minister’s functions;

                     (b)  the request does not satisfy the requirement in paragraph 15(2)(b) (identification of documents).

             (2)  Subject to subsection (3), but without limiting the matters to which the agency or Minister may have regard, in deciding whether a practical refusal reason exists, the agency or Minister must have regard to the resources that would have to be used for the following:

                     (a)  identifying, locating or collating the documents within the filing system of the agency, or the office of the Minister;

                     (b)  deciding whether to grant, refuse or defer access to a document to which the request relates, or to grant access to an edited copy of such a document, including resources that would have to be used for:

             (3)  In deciding whether a practical refusal reason exists, an agency or Minister must not have regard to:

                     (a)  any reasons that the applicant gives for requesting access; or

                     (b)  the agency’s or Minister’s belief as to what the applicant’s reasons are for requesting access; or

                     (c)  any maximum amount, specified in the regulations, payable as a charge for processing a request of that kind.

##### <a id="24AB"></a>24AB  What is a _request consultation process_?

Scope

             (1)  This section sets out what is a **_request consultation process_** for the purposes of section 24.

Requirement to notify

             (2)  The agency or Minister must give the applicant a written notice stating the following:

                     (a)  an intention to refuse access to a document in accordance with a request;

                     (b)  the practical refusal reason;

                     (c)  the name of an officer of the agency or member of staff of the Minister (the **_contact person_**) with whom the applicant may consult during a period;

                     (d)  details of how the applicant may contact the contact person;

                     (e)  that the period (the **_consultation period_**) during which the applicant may consult with the contact person is 14 days after the day the applicant is given the notice.

Assistance to revise request

             (3)  If the applicant contacts the contact person during the consultation period in accordance with the notice, the agency or Minister must take reasonable steps to assist the applicant to revise the request so that the practical refusal reason no longer exists.

             (4)  For the purposes of subsection (3), **_reasonable steps_** includes the following:

                     (a)  giving the applicant a reasonable opportunity to consult with the contact person;

                     (b)  providing the applicant with any information that would assist the applicant to revise the request.

Extension of consultation period

             (5)  The contact person may, with the applicant’s agreement, extend the consultation period by written notice to the applicant.

Outcome of request consultation process

             (6)  The applicant must, before the end of the consultation period, do one of the following, by written notice to the agency or Minister:

                     (a)  withdraw the request;

                     (b)  make a revised request;

                     (c)  indicate that the applicant does not wish to revise the request.

             (7)  The request is taken to have been withdrawn under subsection (6) at the end of the consultation period if:

                     (a)  the applicant does not consult the contact person during the consultation period in accordance with the notice; or

                     (b)  the applicant does not do one of the things mentioned in subsection (6) before the end of the consultation period.

Consultation period to be disregarded in calculating processing period

             (8)  The period starting on the day an applicant is given a notice under subsection (2) and ending on the day the applicant does one of the things mentioned in paragraph (6)(b) or (c) is to be disregarded in working out the 30 day period mentioned in paragraph 15(5)(b).

Note:          Paragraph 15(5)(b) requires that an agency or Minister take all reasonable steps to notify an applicant of a decision on the applicant’s request within 30 days after the request is made.

No more than one request consultation process required

             (9)  To avoid doubt, this section only obliges the agency or Minister to undertake a request consultation process once for any particular request.

##### <a id="24A"></a>24A  Requests may be refused if documents cannot be found, do not exist or have not been received

Document lost or non‑existent

             (1)  An agency or Minister may refuse a request for access to a document if:

                     (a)  all reasonable steps have been taken to find the document; and

                     (b)  the agency or Minister is satisfied that the document:

                              (i)  is in the agency’s or Minister’s possession but cannot be found; or

                             (ii)  does not exist.

Document not received as required by contract

             (2)  An agency may refuse a request for access to a document if:

                     (a)  in order to comply with section 6C, the agency has taken contractual measures to ensure that it receives the document; and

                     (b)  the agency has not received the document; and

                     (c)  the agency has taken all reasonable steps to receive the document in accordance with those contractual measures.

##### <a id="25"></a>25  Information as to existence of certain documents

             (1)  Nothing in this Act shall be taken to require an agency or Minister to give information as to the existence or non‑existence of a document where information as to the existence or non‑existence of that document, if included in a document of an agency, would cause the last‑mentioned document to be an exempt document by virtue of section 33 or subsection 37(1).

             (2)  Where a request relates to a document that is, or if it existed would be, of a kind referred to in subsection (1), the agency or Minister dealing with the request may give notice in writing to the applicant that the agency or the Minister, as the case may be, neither confirms nor denies the existence, as a document of the agency or an official document of the Minister, of such a document but that, assuming the existence of such a document, it would be an exempt document under section 33 or subsection 37(1) and, where such a notice is given:

                     (a)  section 26 applies as if the decision to give such a notice were a decision referred to in that section; and

                     (b)  the decision shall, for the purposes of Part VI, be deemed to be a decision refusing to grant access to the document in accordance with the request for the reason that the document would, if it existed, be an exempt document under section 33 or subsection 37(1), as the case may be.

##### <a id="26"></a>26  Reasons and other particulars of decisions to be given

             (1)  Where, in relation to a request, a decision is made relating to a refusal to grant access to a document in accordance with the request or deferring provision of access to a document, the decision‑maker shall cause the applicant to be given notice in writing of the decision, and the notice shall:

                     (a)  state the findings on any material questions of fact, referring to the material on which those findings were based, and state the reasons for the decision; and

                    (aa)  in the case of a decision to refuse to give access to a conditionally exempt document—include in those reasons the public interest factors taken into account in making the decision; and

Note:       Access must generally be given to a conditionally exempt document unless it would be contrary to the public interest (see section 11A).

                     (b)  where the decision relates to a document of an agency, state the name and designation of the person giving the decision; and

                     (c)  give to the applicant appropriate information concerning:

                              (i)  his or her rights with respect to review of the decision;

                             (ii)  his or her rights to make a complaint to the Information Commissioner in relation to the decision; and

                            (iii)  the procedure for the exercise of the rights referred to in subparagraphs (i) and (ii);

                            including (where applicable) particulars of the manner in which an application for internal review (Part VI) and IC review (Part VII) may be made.

          (1A)  Section 13 of the _Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977_ does not apply to a decision referred to in subsection (1).

             (2)  A notice under this section is not required to contain any matter that is of such a nature that its inclusion in a document of an agency would cause that document to be an exempt document.

                              (i)  of the applicant’s agreement to pay the charge; or

                             (ii)  if the applicant contends that the charge has been wrongly assessed, or should be reduced or not imposed, or both—that the applicant so contends, giving the applicant’s reasons for so contending; or

                            (iii)  that the applicant withdraws the request for access to the document concerned; and

                     (g)  that if the applicant fails to give the agency or Minister such a notice within that period or further period, the request for access to the document will be taken to have been withdrawn.

             (2)  If the applicant fails to notify the agency or Minister in a manner mentioned in paragraph (1)(f) within the period or further period mentioned in that paragraph, the applicant is to be taken to have withdrawn the request for access to the document concerned.

             (3)  An agency or Minister must not impose a charge in respect of a request for access to a document, or the provision of access to a document, until:

                     (a)  the applicant has notified the agency or Minister in a manner mentioned in paragraph (1)(f); or

                     (b)  the end of the period or further period mentioned in that paragraph.

             (4)  Where the applicant has notified the agency or Minister, in a manner mentioned in subparagraph (1)(f)(ii), that the applicant contends that the charge should be reduced or not imposed, the agency or Minister may decide that the charge is to be reduced or not to be imposed.

             (5)  Without limiting the matters the agency or Minister may take into account in determining whether or not to reduce or not to impose the charge, the agency or Minister must take into account:

                     (a)  whether the payment of the charge, or part of it, would cause financial hardship to the applicant, or to a person on whose behalf the application was made; and

                     (b)  whether the giving of access to the document in question is in the general public interest or in the interest of a substantial section of the public.

             (6)  If the applicant has notified the agency or Minister in the manner mentioned in subparagraph (1)(f)(ii), the agency or Minister must take all reasonable steps to enable the applicant to be notified of the decision on the amount of charge payable as soon as practicable but in any case no later than 30 days after the day on which the applicant so notified the agency or Minister.

             (7)  If:

                     (a)  that period of 30 days has elapsed since the day on which the agency or Minister was so notified; and

                     (b)  the applicant has not received notice of a decision on the amount of charge payable;

the principal officer of the agency, or the Minister, as the case requires, is, for all purposes of this Act, taken to have made, on the last day of the period, a decision to the effect that the amount of charge payable is the amount equal to the agency’s or Minister’s preliminary assessment of the amount of the charge mentioned in paragraph (1)(b).

             (8)  If:

                     (a)  the applicant makes a contention about a charge as mentioned in subsection (4); and

                     (b)  the agency or Minister makes a decision to reject the contention, in whole or in part;

the agency or Minister, as the case requires, must give the applicant written notice of the decision and of the reasons for the decision.

Note:          Section 25D of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ sets out rules about the contents of a statement of reasons.

             (9)  A notice under subsection (8) must also state the name and designation of the person making the decision and give the applicant appropriate information about:

                     (a)  his or her rights with respect to review of the decision; and

                     (b)  his or her rights to make a complaint to the Information Commissioner in relation to the decision; and

                     (c)  the procedure for the exercise of those rights;

including (where applicable) particulars of the manner in which an application for internal review (Part VI) and IC review (Part VII) may be made.

           (10)  Section 13 of the _Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977_ does not apply to a decision referred to in subsection (8).

           (11)  A notice under subsection (8) is not required to contain any matter that is of such a nature that its inclusion in a document of an agency would cause that document to be an exempt document.

##### <a id="31"></a>31  Decision to impose charge—extended period for processing request

Scope

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  on a particular day (the **_charge notice day_**) an applicant in relation to a request receives a notice under subsection 29(1) or (6) to the effect that the applicant is liable to pay a charge in respect of the request; and

                     (b)  the notice is received before the end of the period (the **_processing period_**) applicable under paragraph 15(5)(b) in relation to the request (or that period as extended).

Processing period to be calculated disregarding period when charge unpaid

             (2)  In working out the length of the processing period (or that period as extended) for the purposes of paragraph 15(5)(b), disregard the number of days in the period starting on the charge notice day and ending on the earliest occurring of the following days:

                     (a)  the day the applicant pays the amount of the charge (or a deposit on account of the charge prescribed by the regulations), whether or not the decision to impose the charge has been considered under section 29, or is the subject of a review under this Act;

                     (b)  if the amount of the charge is changed under section 29, or following a review under this Act—the day the applicant pays the amount of the charge (or a deposit on account of the charge prescribed by the regulations) as changed following the review;

                     (c)  if, under section 29, or following a review under this Act, a decision is made with the effect that the charge is not imposed—the day the applicant is notified of the decision.

Note:          A decision under section 29 relating to the imposition of a charge or the amount of a charge may be the subject of an internal review (see Part VI), an IC review (see Part VII) or review by the Tribunal (see Part VIIA).

##### <a id="45"></a>45  Documents containing material obtained in confidence

##### <a id="53"></a>53  Interpretation

                   For the purposes of this Act, unless the contrary intention appears, a claim that a document would, if it exists, be an exempt document under section 33 or 34 is to be deemed to be a claim that the document is an exempt document under that section despite the fact that the existence or non‑existence of the document is not acknowledged.

##### <a id="53A"></a>53A  What is an _access refusal decision_?

                   An **_access refusal decision_** is any of the following decisions:

                     (b)  a decision giving access to a document but not giving, in accordance with the request, access to all documents to which the request relates;

                     (c)  a decision purporting to give, in accordance with a request, access to all documents to which the request relates, but not actually giving that access;

                     (d)  a decision to defer the provision of access to a document (other than a document covered by paragraph 21(1)(d) (Parliament should be informed of contents));

                     (e)  a decision under section 29 relating to imposition of a charge or the amount of a charge;

                     (h)  a decision refusing to annotate a record of personal information in accordance with an application made under section 48.

Note:          If a decision is not made on a request under section 15 within the time required by that section, a decision is taken to have been made to refuse to give access to a document in accordance with the request (see section 15AC).

##### <a id="53B"></a>53B  What is an _access grant decision_? [_see_ Note 3]

             (1)  An **_access grant decision_** is a decision covered by the following table:

Note:          The table covers documents that may be conditionally exempt under section 47B (items 1 and 1A), 47G (item 2) or 47F (items 3 and 4), or exempt under section 47 (item 2).

                     (e)  after such period as is reasonably necessary for the purposes of giving evidence to the Tribunal, the Inspector‑General must:

                              (i)  return the original of any document to the Tribunal or to the agency or Minister; and

                             (ii)  destroy any copies of or extracts taken from any document.

             (7)  The Inspector‑General must permit a person who would be entitled to inspect a document mentioned in paragraphs (6)(a) to (d) if it were not in the possession of the Inspector‑General to inspect the document at all reasonable times as the person would be so entitled.

             (8)  The Tribunal is not bound by any opinion of the Inspector‑General expressed while giving evidence under this section.

             (9)  The Tribunal must allow the Inspector‑General a period within which to consider the documents mentioned in paragraphs (6)(a) to (d) that is reasonable having regard to:

                     (a)  the nature of the evidence that the Inspector‑General has been requested to give; and

                     (b)  the time required by the Inspector‑General to perform the Inspector‑General’s other functions.

           (10)  The fact that a person is obliged to produce a document under subsection (6) does not otherwise affect a claim of legal professional privilege that anyone may make in relation to that document.

##### <a id="61"></a>61  Onus

             (1)  In proceedings under this Part for review of a decision in relation to a request, or in relation to an application under section 48 (a **_personal records application_**):

                     (a)  if an agency or a Minister applied for the review—the agency or Minister has the onus of establishing that the decision is not justified, or that the Tribunal should give a decision adverse to the applicant in relation to the request or the personal records application; or

                     (b)  if the applicant in relation to the request or the personal records application applied for the review—the agency to which, or the Minister to whom, the request or personal records application was made has the onus of establishing that the decision is justified, or that the Tribunal should give a decision adverse to the applicant.

             (2)  However, in proceedings under this Part that relate to a decision to give access to a document to which a consultation requirement applies under section 26A, 26AA, 27 or 27A, an affected third party for the document in relation to which the decision was made has, if the affected third party is a party to the proceeding, the onus of establishing that:

                     (a)  a decision refusing to give access to the document is justified; or

                     (b)  the Tribunal should give a decision adverse to the person who made the relevant request.

Note:          For **_affected third party_**, see section 53C.

             (2)  The agency or Minister who made the IC reviewable decision is taken to have complied with the obligation under paragraph 37(1)(a) of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ if the agency or Minister gives the AAT the number of copies prescribed by the regulations of the decision under section 55K in relation to which an application has been made to the Tribunal.

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not limit the powers of the Tribunal under section 38 of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_.

##### <a id="62"></a>62  Application of section 28 of Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act etc.

             (1)  Where, in relation to a decision in respect of a request, the applicant has been given a notice in writing under section 26, section 28 of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ does not apply to that decision.

             (2)  If the Tribunal, upon application for a declaration under this subsection made to it by a person to whom a notice has been furnished in pursuance of subsection 26(1), considers that the notice does not contain adequate particulars of findings on material questions of fact, an adequate reference to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based or adequate particulars of the reasons for the decision, the Tribunal may make a declaration accordingly, and, where the Tribunal makes such a declaration, the person responsible for furnishing the notice shall, as soon as practicable but in any case within 28 days after the Tribunal makes the declaration, furnish to the applicant an additional notice or additional notices containing further and better particulars in relation to matters specified in the declaration with respect to those findings, that evidence or other material or those reasons.

### Division 5—Protection of information in Tribunal

##### <a id="63"></a>63  Tribunal to ensure non‑disclosure of certain matters

             (1)  In determining whether the Tribunal is satisfied that it is desirable to make an order or orders under subsection 35(2) of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_, the Tribunal must:

                     (a)  have regard to:

                              (i)  the necessity of avoiding the disclosure to the applicant of exempt matter contained in a document to which the proceedings relate; and

                             (ii)  the necessity of avoiding the disclosure to the applicant of information of the kind referred to in subsection 25(1); and

                     (b)  where the proceedings relate to a document that is claimed to be an exempt document under section 33—give particular weight to a submission made by an agency or a Minister  that it is desirable to make the order or orders under subsection 35(2) of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ because disclosure of the document:

                              (i)  would, or could reasonably be expected to, cause damage to the security, defence or international relations of the Commonwealth; or

                             (ii)  would divulge information or matter communicated in confidence by or on behalf of a foreign government, an authority of a foreign government or an international organisation to the Government of the Commonwealth, to an authority of the Commonwealth or to a person receiving the communication on behalf of the Commonwealth or of an authority of the Commonwealth.

             (2)  Notwithstanding anything contained in the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_:

                     (a)  the Tribunal shall not, in its decision, or reasons for a decision, in a matter arising under this Act, include any matter or information of a kind referred to in paragraph (1)(a); and

                     (b)  the Tribunal may receive evidence, or hear argument, in the absence of the applicant or his or her representative where it is necessary to do so in order to prevent the disclosure to the applicant of matter or information of a kind referred to in paragraph (1)(a).

##### <a id="64"></a>64  Production of exempt documents

             (1)  Section 37 of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ does not apply in relation to a document that is claimed to be an exempt document, but in proceedings before the Tribunal in relation to such a document, the Tribunal may, for the purpose of deciding whether the document is an exempt document, require the document to be produced for inspection by members of the Tribunal only.

       (1AA)  If, upon the inspection, the Tribunal is satisfied that the document is an exempt document, the Tribunal must return the document to the person by whom it was produced without permitting a person to have access to the document, or disclosing the contents of the document to a person, unless the person is:

                     (a)  a member of the Tribunal as constituted for the purposes of the proceeding; or

                     (b)  a member of the staff of the Tribunal in the course of the performance of his or her duties as a member of that staff; or

                     (c)  in the circumstances permitted under paragraph 60A(6)(a)—the Inspector‑General of Intelligence and Security.

          (1A)  If, for the purposes of proceedings before the Tribunal under this Act in relation to a document that is claimed to be an exempt document, the document is voluntarily produced to the Tribunal, then only:

                     (a)  the members of the Tribunal as constituted for the purposes of the review; or

                     (b)  a member of the staff of the Tribunal in the course of the performance of his or her duties as a member of that staff;

may inspect, or have access to, the document.

             (2)  The Tribunal may require the production, for inspection by members of the Tribunal only, of an exempt document for the purpose of determining whether it is practicable for an agency or a Minister to grant access to a copy of the document with such deletions as to make the copy not an exempt document and, where an exempt document is produced by reason of such a requirement, the Tribunal shall, after inspection of the document by the members of the Tribunal as constituted for the purposes of the proceeding, return the document to the person by whom it was produced without permitting a person to have access to the document, or disclosing the contents of the document to a person, unless the person is:

                     (a)  a member of the Tribunal as constituted for the purposes of the proceeding; or

                     (b)  a member of the staff of the Tribunal in the course of the performance of his or her duties as a member of that staff; or

                     (c)  in the circumstances permitted under paragraph 60A(6)(a)—the Inspector‑General of Intelligence and Security.

Note:          The Tribunal is not entitled, under this section, to require production of documents that are exempt under section 33 or 34, but is entitled to do so under section 58E if the Tribunal is not satisfied by evidence on affidavit or otherwise that the document is an exempt document.

          (4A)  In making an order for the purposes of subsection (1) or (2), the Tribunal may require the relevant document to be produced at any time later than 28 days after the decision‑maker was given notice of the application, even if that time is before the Tribunal has begun to hear argument or otherwise deal with the matter.

             (5)  Subsections (1), (1A) and (2) apply in relation to a document in the possession of a Minister that is claimed by the Minister not to be an official document of the Minister as if references in those subsections to an exempt document were references to a document in the possession of a Minister that is not an official document of the Minister.

             (6)  Subsection (1), (1A) or (2) does not operate so as to prevent the Tribunal from causing a document produced in accordance with that subsection to be sent to the Federal Court of Australia in accordance with section 46 of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_, but, where such a document is so sent to the Court, the Court shall do all things necessary to ensure that the contents of the document are not disclosed (otherwise than in accordance with this Act) to any person other than a member of the Court as constituted for the purpose of the proceeding before the Court or a member of the staff of the Court in the course of the performance of his or her duties as a member of that staff.

             (7)  Subsection (6) does not prevent the Federal Court of Australia from causing the document concerned to be sent to the Federal Magistrates Court as mentioned in subparagraph 46(1)(c)(i) of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_.

             (8)  If a document produced in accordance with subsection (1), (1A) or (2) is sent to the Federal Magistrates Court as mentioned in subparagraph 46(1)(c)(i) of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_, the Federal Magistrates Court must do all things necessary to ensure that the contents of the document are not disclosed (otherwise than in accordance with this Act) to any person other than:

                     (a)  the Federal Magistrate who constitutes the Federal Magistrates Court for the purposes of the proceeding before the Federal Magistrates Court; or

                     (b)  a member of the staff of the Federal Magistrates Court in the course of the performance of his or her duties as a member of that staff.

### Division 6—Recommendations as to costs

##### <a id="66"></a>66  Tribunal may make recommendation that costs be available in certain circumstances

             (1)  Where:

                     (a)  a person applies, under section 57A, to the Tribunal for review of a decision of the Information Commissioner on an IC review; and

                     (b)  the person is successful, or substantially successful, in his or her application for review;

the Tribunal may, in its discretion, recommend to the responsible Minister that the costs of the applicant in relation to the proceedings be paid by the Commonwealth or Norfolk Island.

             (2)  Without limiting the generality of the matters to which the Tribunal may have regard in deciding whether to make a recommendation under subsection (1), the Tribunal shall have regard to:

                     (a)  the question whether payment of the costs or any part of the costs would cause financial hardship to the applicant;

                     (b)  the question whether the decision of the Tribunal on review will be of benefit to the general public;

                     (c)  the question whether the decision of the Tribunal on review will be of commercial benefit to the person making application to the Tribunal; and

                     (d)  the reasonableness of the decision reviewed by the Tribunal.

             (3)  The responsible Minister may, pursuant to a recommendation of the Tribunal under subsection (1), authorize the payment of costs to an applicant.

### Division 7—Automatic stay of certain decisions

##### <a id="67"></a>67  Automatic stay of certain decisions on appeal

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a person applies, under section 57A, to the Tribunal for review in relation to a decision by an agency or Minister refusing to grant access to a document in accordance with a request, being a document that is claimed to be an exempt document; and

                     (b)  the Tribunal decides that a person may have access to the document; and

                     (c)  the agency or the Minister institutes an appeal to the Federal Court of Australia from the decision of the Tribunal.

             (2)  If this section applies to a decision of the Tribunal, the operation of the decision is stayed by force of this section from the time at which the appeal is instituted.

             (3)  If the agency or the Minister appeals to the Federal Court of Australia from the decision of the Tribunal and the appeal in relation to the decision is determined by the Federal Court of Australia, the stay continues to have effect until the earlier of:

                     (a)  the time at which the decision of the Federal Court of Australia on the appeal takes effect; and

                     (b)  the time otherwise determined by the Federal Court of Australia.

             (4)  If the agency or the Minister appeals to the Federal Court of Australia from the decision of the Tribunal and the appeal in relation to the decision is determined by the Federal Magistrates Court, the stay continues to have effect until the earlier of:

                     (a)  the time at which the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court on the appeal takes effect; and

                     (b)  the time otherwise determined by the Federal Magistrates Court.

             (5)  Nothing in this section affects the power of the Federal Court of Australia or the Federal Magistrates Court to make orders under section 44A of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ in relation to matters other than staying the decision of the Tribunal.

## Part VIIB—Investigations and complaints

### Division 1—Guide to this Part

##### <a id="68"></a>68  Investigations and complaints—guide

* * *

This Part is about investigations by the Information Commissioner and by the Ombudsman.

Division 2 sets up a system for investigations by the Information Commissioner.

The Information Commissioner may investigate an action taken by an agency in the performance of functions or the exercise of powers under this Act on a complaint from a person, or on the Information Commissioner’s initiative.

If a person disputes the merits of an access refusal decision or an access grant decision, this Act provides elsewhere for the review of that decision (see Parts VI, VII and VIIA).

However, this does not prevent a person from making a complaint to the Information Commissioner about the way in which the agency has handled the decision.

The Information Commissioner has powers to obtain documents, to question persons and to enter premises (see Subdivision D of Division 2).

At the conclusion of the investigation, the Information Commissioner must give a notice to the complainant and to the respondent agency about the Information Commissioner’s findings, with any recommendations that the Information Commissioner believes the agency ought to implement (see section 86).

If the Information Commissioner is not satisfied that the agency has taken adequate and appropriate action to implement the recommendations, the Information Commissioner may take further steps (see sections 89, 89A and 89B).

Division 3 deals with the investigation of complaints by the Ombudsman about action taken under this Act.

##### <a id="74"></a>74  Information Commissioner investigations—transfer to Ombudsman

Scope

             (1)  This section applies if the Information Commissioner is satisfied that a complaint about an action could be more effectively or appropriately dealt with:

                     (a)  by the Ombudsman under the _Ombudsman Act 1976_; or

                     (b)  by the Ombudsman under a particular Norfolk Island enactment.

Example 1: A complaint about the way in which the Information Commissioner has dealt with an IC review.

Example 2: A complaint relates to an action under this Act, but is part of a complaint that relates to other matters that can be more appropriately dealt with by the Ombudsman.

Transfer of complaints to Ombudsman

             (2)  The Information Commissioner:

                     (a)  must consult the Ombudsman about the complaint with a view to avoiding inquiries being conducted into that matter by both the Information Commissioner and the Ombudsman; and

                     (b)  may decide not to investigate the action, or not to continue to investigate the action.

             (3)  If the Information Commissioner decides not to investigate, or not to continue to investigate, the action under paragraph (2)(b), the Information Commissioner must:

                     (a)  transfer the complaint to the Ombudsman; and

                     (b)  give the Ombudsman any information or documents that relate to the complaint in the possession, or under the control, of the Information Commissioner; and

                     (c)  notify the complainant in writing that the complaint has been transferred.

             (4)  A notice under paragraph (3)(c) must state the reasons for the Information Commissioner’s decision.

             (5)  If paragraph (1)(a) applies, a complaint transferred under subsection (3) is taken to be a complaint made to the Ombudsman under the _Ombudsman Act 1976_.

             (6)  If paragraph (1)(b) applies, a complaint transferred under subsection (3) is taken to be a complaint made to the Ombudsman under the Norfolk Island enactment concerned.

Note:          The Information Commissioner may make a decision under this section to investigate only part of a complaint (see section 71).

##### <a id="75"></a>75  Information Commissioner investigations—notice requirements

Notice to respondent agency before commencing investigation

             (1)  Before beginning an investigation, the Information Commissioner must notify the respondent agency in writing.

Notice of decision not to investigate, or not to continue to investigate

             (2)  Subsection (3) applies if the Information Commissioner decides:

                     (a)  not to investigate, or not to continue to investigate, a complaint made under section 70; or

                     (b)  not to continue an investigation commenced at the Information Commissioner’s initiative.

#### Subdivision D—Investigation procedure

##### <a id="76"></a>76  Information Commissioner investigations—conduct of investigation

             (1)  An investigation must be conducted in private and in a way the Information Commissioner thinks fit.

_Tax Laws Amendment (Repeal of Inoperative Provisions) Act 2006 
 (No. 101, 2006)_

## Schedule 6

## 5  Application of Schedule 5 amendments

The repeals and amendments made by Schedule 5 apply to acts done or omitted to be done, or states of affairs existing, after the commencement of the amendments.

## 6  Object

The object of this Part is to ensure that, despite the repeals and amendments made by this Act, the full legal and administrative consequences of:

                     (a)  any act done or omitted to be done; or

                     (b)  any state of affairs existing; or

                     (c)  any period ending;

before such a repeal or amendment applies, can continue to arise and be carried out, directly or indirectly through an indefinite number of steps, even if some or all of those steps are taken after the repeal or amendment applies.

## 7  Making and amending assessments, and doing other things, in relation to past matters

Even though an Act is repealed or amended by this Act, the repeal or amendment is disregarded for the purpose of doing any of the following under any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_):

                     (a)  making or amending an assessment (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

                     (b)  exercising any right or power, performing any obligation or duty or doing any other thing (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

Example 1: On 31 July 1999, Greg Ltd lodged its annual return under former section 160ARE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The return stated that the company had a credit on its franking account and that no franking deficit tax was payable for the 1998‑99 franking year. Under former section 160ARH of that Act, the Commissioner was taken to have made an assessment consistent with the return.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of Part IIIAA of that Act, the Commissioner concludes that Greg Ltd fraudulently overfranked dividends it paid during the 1998‑99 franking year, and had a franking account deficit for that franking year. As a result, the Commissioner considers that franking deficit tax and a penalty by way of additional tax are payable.

                   The Commissioner can amend the assessment under former section 160ARN of that Act, because item 7 of this Schedule disregards the repeal of that section for the purposes of making an assessment in relation to the 1998‑99 franking year. Item 7 will also disregard the repeal of Division 11 of former Part IIIAA to the extent necessary for the Commissioner to assess Greg Ltd’s liability to a penalty by way of additional tax.

                   Despite the repeal of sections 160ARU and 160ARV, item 9 will ensure that the general interest charge will accrue on the unpaid franking deficit tax and penalty until they are paid.

                   Item 7 will also preserve Greg Ltd’s right, under former section 160ART of that Act, to object against the Commissioner’s amended assessment (including the penalty), since the objection is the exercise of a right in relation to a franking year that ended before the repeal of Part IIIAA.

Example 2: During the 1997‑98 income year, Duffy Property Ltd withheld amounts from its employees’ wages as required by former Divisions 1AAA and 2 of Part VI of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The company failed to notify the Commissioner of those amounts, and failed to remit them to the Commissioner.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of those Divisions, the Commissioner discovers that the withheld amounts have not been remitted. The company’s records are incomplete and the Commissioner is unable to completely ascertain the extent of its liability for the withheld amounts. Under section 222AGA of that Act, the Commissioner makes an estimate of the liability.

                   Item 7 will disregard the repeal of section 220AAZA of that Act (which empowered the Commissioner to recover the amount of the estimate). Even though the estimate is made after the repeal, it relates to amounts withheld before the repeal.

## 8  Saving of provisions about effect of assessments
