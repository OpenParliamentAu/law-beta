##### <a id="3"></a>3  Schedule(s)

                   Each Act that is specified in a Schedule to this Act is amended or repealed as set out in the applicable items in the Schedule concerned, and any other item in a Schedule to this Act has effect according to its terms.

###### Schedule 1—Shared parental responsibility

<h7 class="ActHead7">Part 1—Amendments</h7>

<h9 class="ActHead9">Family Law Act 1975</h9>

## 1  Subsection 4(1)

Insert:

                    <a name="aborigin-child"></a>**_Aboriginal child_** means a child who is a descendant of the Aboriginal people of Australia.

## 2  Subsection 4(1)

Insert:

                    <a name="aborigin-torr-strait-island-cultur"></a>**_Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander culture_** in relation to a child:

                     (a)  means the culture of the Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander community or communities to which the child belongs; and

                     (b)  includes Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander lifestyle and traditions of that community or communities.

## 3  Subsection 4(1)

Insert:

                    <a name="famili-violenc"></a>**_family violence_** means conduct, whether actual or threatened, by a person towards, or towards the property of, a member of the person’s family that causes that or any other member of the person’s family reasonably to fear for, or reasonably to be apprehensive about, his or her personal wellbeing or safety.

Note:          A person reasonably fears for, or reasonably is apprehensive about, his or her personal wellbeing or safety in particular circumstances if a reasonable person in those circumstances would fear for, or be apprehensive about, his or her personal wellbeing or safety.

## 4  Subsection 4(1)

Insert:

                    <a name="major-long-term-issu"></a>**_major long-term issues_**, in relation to a child, means issues about the care, welfare and development of the child of a long-term nature and includes (but is not limited to) issues of that nature about:

                     (a)  the child’s education (both current and future); and

                     (b)  the child’s religious and cultural upbringing; and

                     (c)  the child’s health; and

                     (d)  the child’s name; and

                     (e)  changes to the child’s living arrangements that make it significantly more difficult for the child to spend time with a parent.

To avoid doubt, a decision by a parent of a child to form a relationship with a new partner is not, of itself, a **_major long-term issue_** in relation to the child. However, the decision will involve a **_major long-term issue_** if, for example, the relationship with the new partner involves the parent moving to another area and the move will make it significantly more difficult for the child to spend time with the other parent.

## 5  Subsection 4(1)

Insert:

                    <a name="rel"></a>**_relative_** of a child:

                     (a)  in Part VII, means:

                              (i)  a step-parent of the child; or

                             (ii)  a brother, sister, half-brother, half-sister, step-brother or step-sister of the child; or

                            (iii)  a grandparent of the child; or

                            (iv)  an uncle or aunt of the child; or

                             (v)  a nephew or niece of the child; or

                            (vi)  a cousin of the child; and

                     (b)  in subsection (1AB), has the meaning given by subsection (1AC).

## 6  Subsection 4(1)

Insert:

                    <a name="torr-strait-island-child"></a>**_Torres Strait Islander child_** means a child who is a descendant of the Indigenous inhabitants of the Torres Strait Islands.

## 7  At the end of section 4

Add:

             (4)  A reference in this Act to a person who has parental responsibility for a child is a reference to a person who:

                     (a)  has some or all of that responsibility solely; or

                     (b)  shares some or all of that responsibility with another person.

             (5)  A reference in this Act to a person who shares parental responsibility for a child with another person is a reference to a person who shares some or all of the parental responsibility for the child with that other person.

## 8  Section 60B

Repeal the section, substitute:

##### <a id="60B"></a>60B  Objects of Part and principles underlying it

             (1)  The objects of this Part are to ensure that the best interests of children are met by:

                     (a)  ensuring that children have the benefit of both of their parents having a meaningful involvement in their lives, to the maximum extent consistent with the best interests of the child; and

                     (b)  protecting children from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence; and

                     (c)  ensuring that children receive adequate and proper parenting to help them achieve their full potential; and

                     (d)  ensuring that parents fulfil their duties, and meet their responsibilities, concerning the care, welfare and development of their children.

             (2)  The principles underlying these objects are that (except when it is or would be contrary to a child’s best interests):

                     (a)  children have the right to know and be cared for by both their parents, regardless of whether their parents are married, separated, have never married or have never lived together; and

                     (b)  children have a right to spend time on a regular basis with, and communicate on a regular basis with, both their parents and other people significant to their care, welfare and development (such as grandparents and other relatives); and

                     (c)  parents jointly share duties and responsibilities concerning the care, welfare and development of their children; and

                     (d)  parents should agree about the future parenting of their children; and

                     (e)  children have a right to enjoy their culture (including the right to enjoy that culture with other people who share that culture).

             (3)  For the purposes of subparagraph (2)(e), an Aboriginal child’s or Torres Strait Islander child’s right to enjoy his or her Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander culture includes the right:

                     (a)  to maintain a connection with that culture; and

                     (b)  to have the support, opportunity and encouragement necessary:

                              (i)  to explore the full extent of that culture, consistent with the child’s age and developmental level and the child’s views; and

                             (ii)  to develop a positive appreciation of that culture.

## 9  After Subdivision B of Division 1 of Part VII

#### Subdivision BA—Best interests of the child

##### <a id="60CA"></a>60CA  Child’s best interests paramount consideration in making a parenting order

                   In deciding whether to make a particular parenting order in relation to a child, a court must regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration.

##### <a id="60CB"></a>60CB  Proceedings to which Subdivision applies

             (1)  This Subdivision applies to any proceedings under this Part in which the best interests of a child are the paramount consideration.

Note:          Division 10 also allows a court to make an order for a child’s interests to be independently represented by a lawyer in proceedings under this Part in which the best interests of a child are the paramount consideration.

             (2)  This Subdivision also applies to proceedings, in relation to a child, to which subsection 60G(2), 63F(2) or 63F(6) or section 68R applies.

##### <a id="60CC"></a>60CC  How a court determines what is in a child’s best interests

Determining child’s best interests

Primary considerations

             (2)  The primary considerations are:

                     (a)  the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents; and

                     (b)  the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.

Note:          Making these considerations the primary ones is consistent with the objects of this Part set out in paragraphs 60B(1)(a) and (b).

Additional considerations

             (3)  Additional considerations are:

                     (a)  any views expressed by the child and any factors (such as the child’s maturity or level of understanding) that the court thinks are relevant to the weight it should give to the child’s views;

                     (b)  the nature of the relationship of the child with:

                              (i)  each of the child’s parents; and

                             (ii)  other persons (including any grandparent or other relative of the child);

                     (c)  the willingness and ability of each of the child’s parents to facilitate, and encourage, a close and continuing relationship between the child and the other parent;

                     (d)  the likely effect of any changes in the child’s circumstances, including the likely effect on the child of any separation from:

                              (i)  either of his or her parents; or

                             (ii)  any other child, or other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child), with whom he or she has been living;

                     (e)  the practical difficulty and expense of a child spending time with and communicating with a parent and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect the child’s right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis;

                      (f)  the capacity of:

                              (i)  each of the child’s parents; and

                             (ii)  any other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child);

                            to provide for the needs of the child, including emotional and intellectual needs;

                     (g)  the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of the child and of either of the child’s parents, and any other characteristics of the child that the court thinks are relevant;

                     (h)  if the child is an Aboriginal child or a Torres Strait Islander child:

                              (i)  the child’s right to enjoy his or her Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander culture (including the right to enjoy that culture with other people who share that culture); and

                             (ii)  the likely impact any proposed parenting order under this Part will have on that right;

                      (i)  the attitude to the child, and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of the child’s parents;

                      (j)  any family violence involving the child or a member of the child’s family;

                     (k)  any family violence order that applies to the child or a member of the child’s family, if:

                              (i)  the order is a final order; or

                             (ii)  the making of the order was contested by a person;

                      (l)  whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to the child;

                    (m)  any other fact or circumstance that the court thinks is relevant.

             (4)  Without limiting paragraphs (3)(c) and (i), the court must consider the extent to which each of the child’s parents has fulfilled, or failed to fulfil, his or her responsibilities as a parent and, in particular, the extent to which each of the child’s parents:

                     (a)  has taken, or failed to take, the opportunity:

                              (i)  to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to the child; and

                             (ii)  to spend time with the child; and

                            (iii)  to communicate with the child; and

                     (b)  has facilitated, or failed to facilitate, the other parent:

                              (i)  participating in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to the child; and

                             (ii)  spending time with the child; and

                            (iii)  communicating with the child; and

                     (c)  has fulfilled, or failed to fulfil, the parent’s obligation to maintain the child.

          (4A)  If the child’s parents have separated, the court must, in applying subsection (4), have regard, in particular, to events that have happened, and circumstances that have existed, since the separation occurred.

Consent orders

             (5)  If the court is considering whether to make an order with the consent of all the parties to the proceedings, the court may, but is not required to, have regard to all or any of the matters set out in subsection (2) or (3).

Right to enjoy Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander culture

             (6)  For the purposes of paragraph (3)(h), an Aboriginal child’s or a Torres Strait Islander child’s right to enjoy his or her Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander culture includes the right:

                     (a)  to maintain a connection with that culture; and

                     (b)  to have the support, opportunity and encouragement necessary:

                              (i)  to explore the full extent of that culture, consistent with the child’s age and developmental level and the child’s views; and

                             (ii)  to develop a positive appreciation of that culture.

##### <a id="60CD"></a>60CD  How the views of a child are expressed

             (1)  Paragraph 60CC(3)(a) requires the court to consider any views expressed by a child in deciding whether to make a particular parenting order in relation to the child. This section deals with how the court informs itself of views expressed by a child.

             (2)  The court may inform itself of views expressed by a child:

                     (a)  by having regard to anything contained in a report given to the court under subsection 62G(2); or

                     (b)  by making an order under section 68L for the child’s interests in the proceedings to be independently represented by a lawyer; or

                     (c)  subject to the applicable Rules of Court, by such other means as the court thinks appropriate.

Note 1:       Paragraph (a)—subsection 62G(3A) generally requires the person giving the report to ascertain the child’s views and include those views in the report.

Note 2:       Paragraph (b)—paragraph 68LA(5)(b) requires the independent children’s lawyer for the child to ensure that the child’s views are fully put before the court.

##### <a id="60CE"></a>60CE  Children not required to express views

                   Nothing in this Part permits the court or any person to require the child to express his or her views in relation to any matter.

##### <a id="60CF"></a>60CF  Informing court of relevant family violence orders

             (1)  If a party to the proceedings is aware that a family violence order applies to the child, or a member of the child’s family, that party must inform the court of the family violence order.

             (2)  If a person who is not a party to the proceedings is aware that a family violence order applies to the child, or a member of the child’s family, that person may inform the court of the family violence order.

             (3)  Failure to inform the court of the family violence order does not affect the validity of any order made by the court.

##### <a id="60CG"></a>60CG  Court to consider risk of family violence

             (1)  In considering what order to make, the court must, to the extent that it is possible to do so consistently with the child’s best interests being the paramount consideration, ensure that the order:

                     (a)  is consistent with any family violence order; and

                     (b)  does not expose a person to an unacceptable risk of family violence.

             (2)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), the court may include in the order any safeguards that it considers necessary for the safety of those affected by the order.

## 10  Subsection 60G(2) (note)

Omit “Division 10 deals”, substitute “Sections 60CB to 60CG deal”.

## 11  At the end of Division 1 of Part VII

Add:

#### Subdivision E—Family dispute resolution

##### <a id="60I"></a>60I  Attending family dispute resolution before applying for Part VII order

Object of this section

             (1)  The object of this section is to ensure that all persons who have a dispute about matters that may be dealt with by an order under this Part (a **_Part VII order_**) make a genuine effort to resolve that dispute by family dispute resolution before the Part VII order is applied for.

Phase 1 (from commencement to 30 June 2007)

             (2)  The dispute resolution provisions of the _Family Law Rules 2004_ impose the requirements for dispute resolution that must be complied with before an application is made to the Family Court of Australia for a parenting order.

             (3)  By force of this subsection, the dispute resolution provisions of the _Family Law Rules 2004_ also apply to an application to a court (other than the Family Court of Australia) for a parenting order. Those provisions apply to the application with such modifications as are necessary.

             (4)  Subsection (3) applies to an application for a parenting order if the application is made:

                     (a)  on or after the commencement of this section; and

                     (b)  before 1 July 2007.

Phase 2 (from 1 July 2007 to first proclaimed date)

             (5)  Subsections (7) to (12) apply to an application for a Part VII order in relation to a child if:

                     (a)  the application is made on or after 1 July 2007 and before the date fixed by Proclamation for the purposes of this paragraph; and

                     (b)  none of the parties to the proceedings on the application has applied, before 1 July 2007, for a Part VII order in relation to the child.

Phase 3 (from second proclaimed date)

             (6)  Subsections (7) to (12) apply to all applications for a Part VII order in relation to a child that are made on or after the date fixed by Proclamation for the purposes of this subsection.

Requirement to attempt to resolve dispute by family dispute resolution before applying for a parenting order

             (7)  Subject to subsection (9), a court exercising jurisdiction under this Act must not hear an application for a Part VII order in relation to a child unless the applicant files in the court a certificate given to the applicant by a family dispute resolution practitioner under subsection (8). The certificate must be filed with the application for the Part VII order.

Certificate by family dispute resolution practitioner

             (8)  A family dispute resolution practitioner may give one of these kinds of certificates to a person:

                     (a)  a certificate to the effect that the person did not attend family dispute resolution with the practitioner and the other party or parties to the proceedings in relation to the issue or issues that the order would deal with, but the person’s failure to do so was due to the refusal, or the failure, of the other party or parties to the proceedings to attend;

                    (aa)  a certificate to the effect that the person did not attend family dispute resolution with the practitioner and the other party or parties to the proceedings in relation to the issue or issues that the order would deal with, because the practitioner considers, having regard to the matters prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph, that it would not be appropriate to conduct the proposed family dispute resolution;

                     (b)  a certificate to the effect that the person attended family dispute resolution with the practitioner and the other party or parties to the proceedings in relation to the issue or issues that the order would deal with, and that all attendees made a genuine effort to resolve the issue or issues;

                     (c)  a certificate to the effect that the person attended family dispute resolution with the practitioner and the other party or parties to the proceedings in relation to the issue or issues that the order would deal with, but that the person, the other party or another of the parties did not make a genuine effort to resolve the issue or issues.

Note:          When an applicant files one of these certificates under subsection (7), the court may take the kind of certificate into account in considering whether to make an order referring to parties to family dispute resolution (see section 13C) and in determining whether to award costs against a party (see section 117).

Exception

             (9)  Subsection (7) does not apply to an application for a Part VII order in relation to a child if:

                     (a)  the applicant is applying for the order:

                              (i)  to be made with the consent of all the parties to the proceedings; or

                             (ii)  in response to an application that another party to the proceedings has made for a Part VII order; or

                     (b)  the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that:

                              (i)  there has been abuse of the child by one of the parties to the proceedings; or

                             (ii)  there would be a risk of abuse of the child if there were to be a delay in applying for the order; or

                            (iii)  there has been family violence by one of the parties to the proceedings; or

                            (iv)  there is a risk of family violence by one of the parties to the proceedings; or

                     (c)  all the following conditions are satisfied:

                              (i)  the application is made in relation to a particular issue;

                             (ii)  a Part VII order has been made in relation to that issue within the period of 12 months before the application is made;

                            (iii)  the application is made in relation to a contravention of the order by a person;

                            (iv)  the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person has behaved in a way that shows a serious disregard for his or her obligations under the order; or

                     (d)  the application is made in circumstances of urgency; or

                     (e)  one or more of the parties to the proceedings is unable to participate effectively in family dispute resolution (whether because of an incapacity of some kind, physical remoteness from dispute resolution services or for some other reason); or

                      (f)  other circumstances specified in the regulations are satisfied.

Referral to family dispute resolution when exception applies

           (10)  If:

                     (a)  a person applies for a Part VII order; and

                     (b)  the person does not, before applying for the order, attend family dispute resolution with a family dispute resolution practitioner and the other party or parties to the proceedings in relation to the issue or issues that the order would deal with; and

                     (c)  subsection (7) does not apply to the application because of subsection (9);

the court must consider making an order that the person attend family dispute resolution with a family dispute resolution practitioner and the other party or parties to the proceedings in relation to that issue or those issues.

           (11)  The validity of:

                     (a)  proceedings on an application for a Part VII order; or

                     (b)  any order made in those proceedings;

is not affected by a failure to comply with subsection (7) in relation to those proceedings.

           (12)  In this section:

                    <a name="disput-resolut-provision"></a>**_dispute resolution provisions_** of the _Family Law Rules 2004_ means:

                     (a)  Rule 1.05 of those Rules; and

                     (b)  Part 2 of Schedule 1 to those Rules;

to the extent to which they deal with dispute resolution.

##### <a id="60J"></a>60J  Family dispute resolution not attended because of child abuse or family violence

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  subsections 60I(7) to (12) apply to an application for a Part VII order (see subsections 60I(5) and (6)); and

                     (b)  subsection 60I(7) does not apply to the application because the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that:

                              (i)  there has been abuse of the child by one of the parties to the proceedings; or

                             (ii)  there has been family violence by one of the parties to the proceedings;

a court must not hear the application unless the applicant has indicated in writing that the applicant has received information from a family counsellor or family dispute resolution practitioner about the services and options (including alternatives to court action) available in circumstances of abuse or violence.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply if the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that:

                     (a)  there would be a risk of abuse of the child if there were to be a delay in applying for the order; or

                     (b)  there is a risk of family violence by one of the parties to the proceedings.

             (3)  The validity of:

                     (a)  proceedings on an application for a Part VII order; or

                     (b)  any order made in those proceedings;

is not affected by a failure to comply with subsection (1) in relation to those proceedings.

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  the applicant indicates in writing that the applicant has not received information about the services and options (including alternatives to court action) available in circumstances of abuse or violence; and

                     (b)  subsection (2) does not apply;

the principal executive officer of the court concerned must ensure that the applicant is referred to a family counsellor or family dispute resolution practitioner in order to obtain information about those matters.

##### <a id="60K"></a>60K  Court to take prompt action in relation to allegations of child abuse or family violence

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  an application is made to a court for a Part VII order in relation to a child; and

                     (b)  a document is filed in the court, on or after the commencement of this section, in relation to the proceedings for the order; and

                     (c)  the document alleges, as a consideration that is relevant to whether the court should grant or refuse the application, that:

                              (i)  there has been abuse of the child by one of the parties to the proceedings; or

                             (ii)  there would be a risk of abuse of the child if there were to be a delay in applying for the order; or

                            (iii)  there has been family violence by one of the parties to the proceedings; or

                            (iv)  there is a risk of family violence by one of the parties to the proceedings; and

                     (d)  the document is a document of the kind prescribed by the applicable Rules of Court for the purposes of this paragraph.

             (2)  The court must:

                     (a)  consider what interim or procedural orders (if any) should be made:

                              (i)  to enable appropriate evidence about the allegation to be obtained as expeditiously as possible; and

                             (ii)  to protect the child or any of the parties to the proceedings; and

                     (b)  make such orders of that kind as the court considers appropriate; and

                     (c)  deal with the issues raised by the allegation as expeditiously as possible.

          (2A)  The court must take the action required by paragraphs (2)(a) and (b):

                     (a)  as soon as practicable after the document is filed; and

                     (b)  if it is appropriate having regard to the circumstances of the case—within 8 weeks after the document is filed.

             (3)  Without limiting subparagraph (2)(a)(i), the court must consider whether orders should be made under section 69ZW to obtain reports from State and Territory agencies in relation to the allegations.

             (4)  Without limiting paragraph (2)(a)(ii), the court must consider whether orders should be made, or an injunction granted, under section 68B.

             (5)  A failure to comply with a provision of this section in relation to an application does not affect the validity of any order made in the proceedings in relation to the application.

## 12  At the end of subsection 61C(1)

Add:

Note 1:       This section states the legal position that prevails in relation to parental responsibility to the extent to which it is not displaced by a parenting order made by the court. See subsection (3) of this section and subsection 61D(2) for the effect of a parenting order.

Note 2:       This section does not establish a presumption to be applied by the court when making a parenting order. See section 61DA for the presumption that the court does apply when making a parenting order.

Note 3:       Under section 63C, the parents of a child may make a parenting plan that deals with the allocation of parental responsibility for the child.

## 13  After section 61D

Insert:

##### <a id="61DA"></a>61DA  Presumption of equal shared parental responsibility when making parenting orders

             (1)  When making a parenting order in relation to a child, the court must apply a presumption that it is in the best interests of the child for the child’s parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child.

Note:          The presumption provided for in this subsection is a presumption that relates solely to the allocation of parental responsibility for a child as defined in section 61B. It does not provide for a presumption about the amount of time the child spends with each of the parents (this issue is dealt with in section 65DAA).

             (2)  The presumption does not apply if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a parent of the child (or a person who lives with a parent of the child) has engaged in:

                     (a)  abuse of the child or another child who, at the time, was a member of the parent’s family (or that other person’s family); or

                     (b)  family violence.

             (3)  When the court is making an interim order, the presumption applies unless the court considers that it would not be appropriate in the circumstances for the presumption to be applied when making that order.

             (4)  The presumption may be rebutted by evidence that satisfies the court that it would not be in the best interests of the child for the child’s parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child.

##### <a id="61DB"></a>61DB  Application of presumption of equal shared parental responsibility after interim parenting order made

                   If there is an interim parenting order in relation to a child, the court must, in making a final parenting order in relation to the child, disregard the allocation of parental responsibility made in the interim order.

## 14  At the end of Division 2 of Part VII

Add:

##### <a id="61F"></a>61F  Application to Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander children

                   In:

                     (a)  applying this Part to the circumstances of an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander child; or

                     (b)  identifying a person or persons who have exercised, or who may exercise, parental responsibility for such a child;

the court must have regard to any kinship obligations, and child-rearing practices, of the child’s Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander culture.

## 15  After subsection 62G(3)

Insert:

          (3A)  A family consultant who is directed to give the court a report on a matter under subsection (2) must:

                     (a)  ascertain the views of the child in relation to that matter; and

                     (b)  include the views of the child on that matter in the report.

Note:          A person cannot require a child to express his or her views in relation to any matter (see section 60CE).

          (3B)  Subsection (3A) does not apply if complying with that subsection would be inappropriate because of:

                     (a)  the child’s age or maturity; or

                     (b)  some other special circumstance.

## 16  After paragraph 63C(1)(b)

Insert:

                    (ba)  is signed by the parents of the child; and

                    (bb)  is dated; and

## 16A  After subsection 63C(1)

Insert:

          (1A)  An agreement is not a **_parenting plan_** for the purposes of this Act unless it is made free from any threat, duress or coercion.

## 17  Subsection 63C(2)

Repeal the subsection, substitute:

             (2)  A parenting plan may deal with one or more of the following:

                     (a)  the person or persons with whom a child is to live;

                     (b)  the time a child is to spend with another person or other persons;

                     (c)  the allocation of parental responsibility for a child;

                     (d)  if 2 or more persons are to share parental responsibility for a child—the form of consultations those persons are to have with one another about decisions to be made in the exercise of that responsibility;

                     (e)  the communication a child is to have with another person or other persons;

                      (f)  maintenance of a child;

                     (g)  the process to be used for resolving disputes about the terms or operation of the plan;

                     (h)  the process to be used for changing the plan to take account of the changing needs or circumstances of the child or the parties to the plan;

                      (i)  any aspect of the care, welfare or development of the child or any other aspect of parental responsibility for a child.

Note:          Paragraph (f)—if the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989_ applies, provisions in a parenting plan dealing with the maintenance of a child (as distinct from child support under that Act) are unenforceable and of no effect unless the provisions in the plan are a child support agreement (see section 63CAA and subsection 63G(5) of this Act).

          (2A)  The person referred to in subsection (2) may be, or the persons referred to in that subsection may include, either a parent of the child or a person other than the parent of the child (including a grandparent or other relative of the child).

          (2B)  Without limiting paragraph (2)(c), the plan may deal with the allocation of responsibility for making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to the child.

          (2C)  The communication referred to in paragraph (2)(e) includes (but is not limited to) communication by:

                     (a)  letter; and

                     (b)  telephone, email or any other electronic means.

## 18  Section 63DA

Repeal the section, substitute:

##### <a id="63DA"></a>63DA  Obligations of advisers

             (1)  If an adviser gives advice or assistance to people in relation to parental responsibility for a child following the breakdown of the relationship between those people, the adviser must:

                     (a)  inform them that they could consider entering into a parenting plan in relation to the child; and

                     (b)  inform them about where they can get further assistance to develop a parenting plan and the content of the plan.

             (2)  If an adviser gives advice to people in connection with the making by those people of a parenting plan in relation to a child, the adviser must:

                     (a)  inform them that, if the child spending equal time with each of them is:

                              (i)  reasonably practicable; and

                             (ii)  in the best interests of the child;

                            they could consider the option of an arrangement of that kind; and

                     (b)  inform them that, if the child spending equal time with each of them is not reasonably practicable or is not in the best interests of the child but the child spending substantial and significant time with each of them is:

                              (i)  reasonably practicable; and

                             (ii)  in the best interests of the child;

                            they could consider the option of an arrangement of that kind; and

                     (d)  inform them of the matters that may be dealt with in a parenting plan in accordance with subsection 63C(2); and

                     (e)  inform them that, if there is a parenting order in force in relation to the child, the order may (because of section 64D) include a provision that the order is subject to a parenting plan they enter into; and

                      (f)  inform them about the desirability of including in the plan:

                              (i)  if they are to share parental responsibility for the child under the plan—provisions of the kind referred to in paragraph 63C(2)(d) (which deals with the form of consultations between the parties to the plan) as a way of avoiding future conflicts over, or misunderstandings about, the matters covered by that paragraph; and

                             (ii)  provisions of the kind referred to in paragraph 63C(2)(g) (which deals with the process for resolving disputes between the parties to the plan); and

                            (iii)  provisions of the kind referred to in paragraph 63C(2)(h) (which deals with the process for changing the plan to take account of the changing needs or circumstances of the child or the parties to the plan); and

                     (g)  explain to them, in language they are likely to readily understand, the availability of programs to help people who experience difficulties in complying with a parenting plan; and

                     (h)  inform them that section 65DAB requires the court to have regard to the terms of the most recent parenting plan in relation to the child when making a parenting order in relation to the child if it is in the best interests of the child to do so.

Note:          Paragraphs (a) and (b) only require the adviser to inform the people that they could consider the option of the child spending equal time, or substantial and significant time, with each of them. The adviser may, but is not obliged to, advise them as to whether that option would be appropriate in their particular circumstances.

             (3)  For the purposes of paragraph (2)(b), a child will be taken to spend **_substantial and significant time_** with a parent only if:

                     (a)  the time the child spends with the parent includes both:

                              (i)  days that fall on weekends and holidays; and

                             (ii)  days that do not fall on weekends or holidays; and

                     (b)  the time the child spends with the parent allows the parent to be involved in:

                              (i)  the child’s daily routine; and

                             (ii)  occasions and events that are of particular significance to the child; and

                     (c)  the time the child spends with the parent allows the child to be involved in occasions and events that are of special significance to the parent.

             (4)  Subsection (3) does not limit the other matters to which regard may be had in determining whether the time a child spends with a parent would be substantial and significant.

             (5)  In this section:

                    <a name="advis"></a>**_adviser_** means a person who is:

                     (a)  a legal practitioner; or

                     (b)  a family counsellor; or

## 25  At the end of Division 5 of Part VII

Add:

##### <a id="64D"></a>64D  Parenting orders subject to later parenting plans

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), a parenting order in relation to a child is taken to include a provision that the order is subject to a parenting plan that is:

                     (a)  entered into subsequently by the child’s parents; and

                     (b)  agreed to, in writing, by any other person (other than the child) to whom the parenting order applies.

             (2)  The court may, in exceptional circumstances, include in a parenting order a provision that the parenting order, or a specified provision of the parenting order, may only be varied by a subsequent order of the court (and not by a parenting plan).

             (3)  Without limiting subsection (2), exceptional circumstances for the purposes of that subsection include the following:

                     (a)  circumstances that give rise to a need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence;

                     (b)  the existence of substantial evidence that one of the child’s parents is likely to seek to use coercion or duress to gain the agreement of the other parent to a parenting plan.

## 26  Section 65A

Before “This”, insert “(1)”.

## 27  At the end of section 65A

Add:

Note:          Paragraph (a)—section 60I provides that people with disputes about matters that may be dealt with in a Part VII order (which includes a parenting order) should generally make use of family dispute resolution before applying for the order.

             (2)  Measures designed to improve communication between separated parents and to educate parents about their respective responsibilities in relation to their children are contained in this Division (see section 65DA).

Note:          Division 13A provides for the compliance regime for dealing with contraventions, and alleged contraventions, of parenting orders.

## 28  Section 65AA

Repeal the section, substitute:

##### <a id="65AA"></a>65AA  Child’s best interests paramount consideration in making a parenting order

                   Section 60CA provides that in deciding whether to make a particular parenting order in relation to a child, a court must regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration.

## 29  Subsection 65D(1)

After “subject to”, insert “sections 61DA (presumption of equal shared parental responsibility when making parenting orders) and 65DAB (parenting plans) and”.

## 30  Subsection 65D(2)

After “subject to”, insert “section 61DA (presumption of equal shared parental responsibility when making parenting orders) and 65DAB (parenting plans) and”.

## 31  After section 65D

Insert:

##### <a id="65DAA"></a>65DAA  Court to consider child spending equal time or substantial and significant time with each parent in certain circumstances

Equal time

             (1)  If a parenting order provides (or is to provide) that a child’s parents are to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child, the court must:

                     (a)  consider whether the child spending equal time with each of the parents would be in the best interests of the child; and

                     (b)  consider whether the child spending equal time with each of the parents is reasonably practicable; and

                     (c)  if it is, consider making an order to provide (or including a provision in the order) for the child to spend equal time with each of the parents.

Note 1:       The effect of section 60CA is that in deciding whether to go on to make a parenting order for the child to spend equal time with each of the parents, the court will regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration.

Note 2:       See subsection (5) for the factors the court takes into account in determining what is reasonably practicable.

Substantial and significant time

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  a parenting order provides (or is to provide) that a child’s parents are to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child; and

                     (b)  the court does not make an order (or include a provision in the order) for the child to spend equal time with each of the parents; and

the court must:

                     (c)  consider whether the child spending substantial and significant time with each of the parents would be in the best interests of the child; and

                     (d)  consider whether the child spending substantial and significant time with each of the parents is reasonably practicable; and

                     (e)  if it is, consider making an order to provide (or including a provision in the order) for the child to spend substantial and significant time with each of the parents.

Note 1:       The effect of section 60CA is that in deciding whether to go on to make a parenting order for the child to spend substantial time with each of the parents, the court will regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration.

Note 2:       See subsection (5) for the factors the court takes into account in determining what is reasonably practicable.

             (3)  For the purposes of subsection (2), a child will be taken to spend **_substantial and significant time_** with a parent only if:

                     (a)  the time the child spends with the parent includes both:

                              (i)  days that fall on weekends and holidays; and

                             (ii)  days that do not fall on weekends or holidays; and

                     (b)  the time the child spends with the parent allows the parent to be involved in:

                              (i)  the child’s daily routine; and

                             (ii)  occasions and events that are of particular significance to the child; and

                     (c)  the time the child spends with the parent allows the child to be involved in occasions and events that are of special significance to the parent.

             (4)  Subsection (3) does not limit the other matters to which a court can have regard in determining whether the time a child spends with a parent would be substantial and significant.

Reasonable practicality

             (5)  In determining for the purposes of subsections (1) and (2) whether it is reasonably practicable for a child to spend equal time, or substantial and significant time, with each of the child’s parents, the court must have regard to:

                     (a)  how far apart the parents live from each other; and

                     (b)  the parents’ current and future capacity to implement an arrangement for the child spending equal time, or substantial and significant time, with each of the parents; and

                     (c)  the parents’ current and future capacity to communicate with each other and resolve difficulties that might arise in implementing an arrangement of that kind; and

                     (d)  the impact that an arrangement of that kind would have on the child; and

                     (e)  such other matters as the court considers relevant.

Note 1:       Behaviour of a parent that is relevant for paragraph (c) may also be taken into account in determining what parenting order the court should make in the best interests of the child. Subsection 60CC(3) provides for considerations that are taken into account in determining what is in the best interests of the child. These include:

(a)           the willingness and ability of each of the child’s parents to facilitate, and encourage, a close and continuing relationship between the child and the other parent (paragraph 60CC(3)(c));

(b)           the attitude to the child, and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of the child’s parents (paragraph 60CC(3)(i)).

Note 2:       Paragraph (c) reference to future capacity—the court has power under section 13C to make orders for parties to attend family counselling or family dispute resolution or participate in courses, programs or services.

##### <a id="65DAB"></a>65DAB  Court to have regard to parenting plans

                   When making a parenting order in relation to a child, the court is to have regard to the terms of the most recent parenting plan (if any) that has been entered into between the child’s parents (to the extent to which that plan relates to the child) if doing so would be in the best interests of the child.

##### <a id="65DAC"></a>65DAC  Effect of parenting order that provides for shared parental responsibility

             (1)  This section applies if, under a parenting order:

                     (a)  2 or more persons are to share parental responsibility for a child; and

                     (b)  the exercise of that parental responsibility involves making a decision about a major long-term issue in relation to the child.

             (2)  The order is taken to require the decision to be made jointly by those persons.

Note:          Subject to any court orders, decisions about issues that are not major long-term issues are made by the person with whom the child is spending time without a need to consult the other person (see section 65DAE).

             (3)  The order is taken to require each of those persons:

                     (a)  to consult the other person in relation to the decision to be made about that issue; and

                     (b)  to make a genuine effort to come to a joint decision about that issue.

             (4)  To avoid doubt, this section does not require any other person to establish, before acting on a decision about the child communicated by one of those persons, that the decision has been made jointly.

##### <a id="65DAE"></a>65DAE  No need to consult on issues that are not major long-term issues

             (1)  If a child is spending time with a person at a particular time under a parenting order, the order is taken not to require the person to consult a person who:

                     (a)  has parental responsibility for the child; or

                     (b)  shares parental responsibility for the child with another person;

about decisions that are made in relation to the child during that time on issues that are not major-long term issues.

Note:          This will mean that the person with whom the child is spending time will usually not need to consult on decisions about such things as what the child eats or wears because these are usually not major long-term issues.

             (2)  Subsection (1) applies subject to any provision to the contrary made by a parenting order.

## 32  Section 65E

Repeal the section.

## 33  Paragraph 65G(2)(a)

##### <a id="117AB"></a>117AB  Costs where false allegation or statement made

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  proceedings under this Act are brought before a court; and

                     (b)  the court is satisfied that a party to the proceedings knowingly made a false allegation or statement in the proceedings.

             (2)  The court must order that party to pay some or all of the costs of another party, or other parties, to the proceedings.

### Division 13A—Consequences of failure to comply with orders, and other obligations, that affect children

#### Subdivision A—Preliminary

##### <a id="70NAA"></a>70NAA  Simplified outline of Division

             (1)  This Division deals with the powers that a court with jurisdiction under this Act has to make orders to enforce compliance with orders under this Act affecting children.

             (2)  The court always has the power to vary the order under Subdivision B. In doing so, the court will have regard to any parenting plan that has been entered into since the order was made (see section 70NBB).

             (3)  The other orders that the court can make depend on whether:

                     (a)  a contravention is alleged to have occurred but is not established (Subdivision C); or

                     (b)  the court finds that a contravention has occurred but there is a reasonable excuse for the contravention (Subdivision D); or

                     (c)  the court finds that there was a contravention and there is no reasonable excuse for the contravention (Subdivision E for less serious contraventions and Subdivision F for more serious contraventions).

##### <a id="70NAB"></a>70NAB  Application of Division

                   Despite anything contained in any other provision of this Division, this Division does not apply in respect of a contravention, committed before this Division commences, of an order under this Act affecting children if a court made an order, in respect of that contravention before this Division commences, under this Act as previously in force.

##### <a id="70NAC"></a>70NAC  Meaning of _contravened_ an order

                   A person is taken for the purposes of this Division to have **_contravened_** an order under this Act affecting children if, and only if:

                     (a)  where the person is bound by the order—he or she has:

                              (i)  intentionally failed to comply with the order; or

                             (ii)  made no reasonable attempt to comply with the order; or

                     (b)  otherwise—he or she has:

                              (i)  intentionally prevented compliance with the order by a person who is bound by it; or

                             (ii)  aided or abetted a contravention of the order by a person who is bound by it.

Note:          Parenting orders may be subject to any subsequent parenting plan (see section 64D). This means that an action that would otherwise contravene a parenting order may not be a contravention, because of a subsequent inconsistent parenting plan. Whether this is the case or not depends on the terms of the parenting order.

##### <a id="70NAD"></a>70NAD  Requirements taken to be included in certain orders

                   For the purposes of this Division:

                     (a)  a parenting order that deals with whom a child is to live with is taken to include a requirement that people act in accordance with section 65M in relation to the order; and

                     (b)  a parenting order that deals with whom a child is to spend time with is taken to include a requirement that people act in accordance with section 65N in relation to the order; and

                     (c)  a parenting order that deals with whom a child is to communicate with is taken to include a requirement that people act in accordance with section 65NA in relation to the order; and

                     (d)  a parenting order to which section 65P applies is taken to include a requirement that people act in accordance with that section in relation to the order.

##### <a id="70NAE"></a>70NAE  Meaning of _reasonable excuse for contravening_ an order

             (1)  The circumstances in which a person may be taken to have had, for the purposes of this Division, a **_reasonable excuse for contravening_** an order under this Act affecting children include, but are not limited to, the circumstances set out in subsections (2), (4), (5), (6) and (7).

             (2)  A person (the **_respondent_**) is taken to have had a **_reasonable excuse for contravening_** an order under this Act affecting children if:

                     (a)  the respondent contravened the order because, or substantially because, he or she did not, at the time of the contravention, understand the obligations imposed by the order on the person who was bound by it; and

                     (b)  the court is satisfied that the respondent ought to be excused in respect of the contravention.

             (3)  If a court decides that a person had a reasonable excuse for contravening an order under this Act for the reason referred to in paragraph (2)(a), it is the duty of the court to explain to the person, in language likely to be readily understood by the person, the obligations imposed on him or her by the order and the consequences that may follow if he or she again contravenes the order.

             (4)  A person (the **_respondent_**) is taken to have had a reasonable excuse for contravening a parenting order to the extent to which it deals with whom a child is to live with in a way that resulted in the child not living with a person in whose favour the order was made if:

                     (a)  the respondent believed on reasonable grounds that the actions constituting the contravention were necessary to protect the health or safety of a person (including the respondent or the child); and

                     (b)  the period during which, because of the contravention, the child did not live with the person in whose favour the order was made was not longer than was necessary to protect the health or safety of the person referred to in paragraph (a).

             (5)  A person (the **_respondent_**) is taken to have had a reasonable excuse for contravening a parenting order to the extent to which it deals with whom a child is to spend time with in a way that resulted in a person and a child not spending time together as provided for in the order if:

                     (a)  the respondent believed on reasonable grounds that not allowing the child and the person to spend time together was necessary to protect the health or safety of a person (including the respondent or the child); and

                     (b)  the period during which, because of the contravention, the child and the person did not spend time together was not longer than was necessary to protect the health or safety of the person referred to in paragraph (a).

             (6)  A person (the **_respondent_**) is taken to have had a reasonable excuse for contravening a parenting order to the extent to which it deals with whom a child is to communicate with in a way that resulted in a person and a child not having the communication provided for under the order if:

                     (a)  the respondent believed on reasonable grounds that not allowing the child and the person to communicate together was necessary to protect the health or safety of a person (including the respondent or the child); and

                     (b)  the period during which, because of the contravention, the child and the person did not communicate was not longer than was necessary to protect the health or safety of the person referred to in paragraph (a).

             (7)  A person (the **_respondent_**) is taken to have had a reasonable excuse for contravening a parenting order to which section 65P applies by acting contrary to section 65P if:

                     (a)  the respondent believed on reasonable grounds that the action constituting the contravention was necessary to protect the health or safety of a person (including the respondent or the child); and

                     (b)  the period during which, because of that action, a person in whose favour the order was made was hindered in or prevented from discharging responsibilities under the order was not for longer than was necessary to protect the health or safety of the person referred to in paragraph (a).

##### <a id="70NAF"></a>70NAF  Standard of proof

             (1)  Subject to subsection (3), the standard of proof to be applied in determining matters in proceedings under this Division is proof on the balance of probabilities.

             (2)  Without limiting subsection (1), that subsection applies to the determination of whether a person who contravened an order under this Act affecting children had a reasonable excuse for the contravention.

             (3)  The court may only make an order under:

                     (a)  paragraph 70NFB(2)(a), (d) or (e); or

                     (b)  paragraph 70NFF(3)(a);

if the court is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the grounds for making the order exist.

#### Subdivision B—Court’s power to vary parenting order

##### <a id="70NBA"></a>70NBA  Variation of parenting order

             (1)  A court having jurisdiction under this Act may make an order varying a primary order if:

                     (a)  proceedings in relation to the primary order are brought before a court having jurisdiction under this Act; and

                     (b)  it is alleged in those proceedings that a person committed a contravention of the primary order and either:

                              (i)  the court does not find that the person committed a contravention of the primary order; or

                             (ii)  the court finds that the person committed a contravention of the primary order.

             (2)  If Subdivision F applies to the contravention, when making an order under subsection (1) varying a primary order, the court, in addition to regarding, under section 60CA, the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration, must, if any of the following considerations is relevant, take that consideration into account:

                     (a)  the person who contravened the primary order did so after having attended, after having refused or failed to attend, or after having been found to be unsuitable to take any further part in, a post-separation parenting program or a part of such a program;

                     (b)  there was no post-separation parenting program that the person who contravened the primary order could attend;

                     (c)  because of the behaviour of the person who contravened the primary order, it was not appropriate, in the court’s opinion, for the person to attend a post-separation parenting program, or a part of such a program;

                     (d)  the primary order was a compensatory parenting order made under paragraph 70NEB(1)(b) or 70NFB(2)(c) after the person had contravened a previous order under this Act affecting children.

             (3)  This section does not limit the circumstances in which a court having jurisdiction under this Act may vary a primary order.

##### <a id="70NBB"></a>70NBB  Effect of parenting plan

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a parenting order has been made in relation to a child (whether before or after the commencement of this section); and

                     (b)  after the parenting order was made, the parents of the child made a parenting plan that dealt with a matter (the **_relevant matter_**) that was dealt with in the parenting order.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  section 70NBA applies to proceedings brought in relation to the parenting order in relation to the relevant matter; and

                     (b)  the parenting plan was in force when the contravention of the parenting order:

                              (i)  is alleged to have been committed; or

                             (ii)  occurred;

the court must, in exercising its powers under section 70NBA:

                     (c)  have regard to the terms of the parenting plan; and

                     (d)  consider whether to exercise its powers under section 70NBA to make an order varying the parenting order to include (with or without modification) some or all of the provisions of the parenting plan.

Note:          An action that would otherwise contravene a parenting order may not be a contravention because of a subsequent inconsistent parenting plan. Whether this is the case or not depends on the terms of the parenting order (see section 64D).

#### Subdivision C—Contravention alleged but not established

##### <a id="70NCA"></a>70NCA  Application of Subdivision

                   This Subdivision applies if:

                     (a)  a primary order has been made, whether before or after the commencement of this Subdivision; and

                     (b)  proceedings in relation to the primary order are brought before a court having jurisdiction under this Act; and

                     (c)  it is alleged in those proceedings that a person (the **_respondent_**) committed a contravention of the primary order; and

                     (d)  the court does not find that the respondent committed a contravention of the primary order.

Note:          The court may also vary the primary order under Subdivision B.

##### <a id="70NCB"></a>70NCB  Costs

             (1)  The court may make an order that the person who brought the proceedings (the **_applicant_**) pay some or all of the costs of another party, or other parties, to the proceedings.

             (2)  The court must consider making an order under subsection (1) if:

                     (a)  the applicant has previously brought proceedings in relation to the primary order or another primary order in which the applicant alleged that the respondent committed a contravention of the primary order or that other primary order; and

                     (b)  on the most recent occasion on which the applicant brought proceedings of the kind referred to in paragraph (a), the court before which the proceedings were brought:

                              (i)  was not satisfied that the respondent had committed a contravention of the primary order or that other primary order; or

                             (ii)  was satisfied that the respondent had committed a contravention of the primary order or that other primary order but did not make an order under section 70NBA, 70NDB, 70NDC, 70NEB or 70NFB in relation to the contravention.

#### Subdivision D—Contravention established but reasonable excuse for contravention

##### <a id="70NDA"></a>70NDA  Application of Subdivision

                   This Subdivision applies if:

                     (a)  a primary order has been made, whether before or after the commencement of this Subdivision; and

                     (b)  a court having jurisdiction under this Act is satisfied that a person (the **_respondent_**) has, whether before or after the commencement, committed a contravention (the **_current contravention_**) of the primary order; and

                     (c)  the respondent proves that he or she had a reasonable excuse for the current contravention.

Note:          The court may also vary the primary order under Subdivision B.

##### <a id="70NDB"></a>70NDB  Order compensating person for time lost

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  the primary order is a parenting order in relation to a child; and

                     (b)  the current contravention resulted in a person not spending time with the child (or the child not living with a person for a particular period);

the court:

                     (c)  may make a further parenting order that compensates the person for time the person did not spend with the child (or the time the child did not live with the person) as a result of the current contravention; and

                     (d)  must consider making that kind of order.

Note:          If the person does not have a reasonable excuse for a contravention, the court has the power to make an order compensating a person for time lost under paragraph 70NEB(1)(b) or 70NFB(2)(c).

             (2)  The court must not make an order under paragraph (1)(c) if it would not be in the best interests of the child for the court to do so.

##### <a id="70NDC"></a>70NDC  Costs

             (1)  If the court does not make an order under section 70NDB in relation to the current contravention, the court may make an order that the person who brought the proceedings (the **_applicant_**) pay some or all of the costs of another party, or other parties, to the proceedings.

             (2)  The court must consider making an order under subsection (1) if:

                     (a)  the applicant has previously brought proceedings in relation to the primary order or another primary order in which the applicant alleged that the respondent committed a contravention of the primary order or that other primary order; and

                     (b)  on the most recent occasion on which the applicant brought proceedings of the kind referred to in paragraph (a), the court before which the proceedings were brought:

                              (i)  was not satisfied that the respondent had committed a contravention of the primary order or that other primary order; or

                             (ii)  was satisfied that the respondent had committed a contravention of the primary order or that other primary order but did not make an order under section 70NBA, 70NDB, 70NEB or 70NFB in relation to the contravention.

#### Subdivision E—Contravention without reasonable excuse (less serious contravention)

##### <a id="70NEA"></a>70NEA  Application of Subdivision

             (1)  Subject to subsection (4), this Subdivision applies if:

                     (a)  a primary order has been made, whether before or after the commencement of this Division; and

                     (b)  a court having jurisdiction under this Act is satisfied that a person has, whether before or after that commencement, committed a contravention (the **_current contravention_**) of the primary order; and

                     (c)  the person does not prove that he or she had a reasonable excuse for the current contravention; and

                     (d)  either subsection (2) or (3) applies;

and, if the primary order is an order for the maintenance of a child, this Subdivision applies irrespective of the period since the current contravention occurred.

             (2)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(d), this subsection applies if no court has previously:

                     (a)  made an order imposing a sanction or taking an action in respect of a contravention by the person of the primary order; or

                     (b)  under paragraph 70NEB(1)(c), adjourned proceedings in respect of a contravention by the person of the primary order.

             (3)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(d), this subsection applies if:

                     (a)  a court has previously:

                              (i)  made an order imposing a sanction or taking an action in respect of a contravention by the person of the primary order; or

                             (ii)  under paragraph 70NEB(1)(c), adjourned proceedings in respect of a contravention by the person of the primary order; and

                     (b)  the court, in dealing with the current contravention, is satisfied that it is more appropriate for that contravention to be dealt with under this Subdivision.

             (4)  This Subdivision does not apply if, in circumstances mentioned in subsection (2), the court dealing with the current contravention is satisfied that the person who contravened the primary order has behaved in a way that showed a serious disregard for his or her obligations under the primary order.

##### <a id="70NEB"></a>70NEB  Powers of court

             (1)  If this Subdivision applies, the court may do any or all of the following:

                     (a)  make an order directing:

                              (i)  the person who committed the current contravention; or

                             (ii)  that person and another specified person;

                            to attend a post-separation parenting program;

                     (b)  if the current contravention is a contravention of a parenting order in relation to a child—make a further parenting order that compensates a person for time the person did not spend with the child (or time the child did not live with the person) as a result of the current contravention;

                     (c)  adjourn the proceedings to allow either or both of the parties to the primary order to apply for a further parenting order under Division 6 of Part VII that discharges, varies or suspends the primary order or revives some or all of an earlier parenting order;

                     (d)  make an order requiring the person who committed the current contravention to enter into a bond in accordance with section 70NEC;

                     (e)  if:

                              (i)  the current contravention is a contravention of a parenting order in relation to a child; and

                             (ii)  the current contravention resulted in a person not spending time with the child (or the child not living with a person for a particular period); and

                            (iii)  the person referred to in subparagraph (ii) reasonably incurs expenses as a result of the contravention;

                            make an order requiring the person who committed the current contravention to compensate the person referred to in subparagraph (ii) for some or all of the expenses referred to in subparagraph (iii);

                      (f)  make an order that the person who committed the current contravention pay some or all of the costs of another party, or other parties, to the proceedings under this Division; and

             (2)  The court must not make an order under paragraph (1)(a) directed to a person other than the person who committed the current contravention unless:

                     (a)  the person brought the proceedings before the court in relation to the current contravention or is otherwise a party to those proceedings; and

                     (b)  the court is satisfied that it is appropriate to direct the order to the person because of the connection between the current contravention and the carrying out by the person of his or her parental responsibilities in relation to the child or children to whom the primary order relates.

             (3)  If the court makes an order under paragraph (1)(a), the principal executive officer of the court must ensure that the provider of the program concerned is notified of the making of the order.

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  the current contravention is a contravention of a parenting order in relation to a child; and

                     (b)  the contravention resulted in a person not spending time with the child (or the child not living with a person for a particular period);

the court must consider making an order under paragraph (1)(b) to compensate the person for the time the person did not spend with the child (or the time the child did not live with the person) as a result of the contravention.

             (5)  The court must not make an order under paragraph (1)(b) if it would not be in the best interests of the child for the court to do so.

             (6)  In deciding whether to adjourn the proceedings as mentioned in paragraph (1)(c), the court must have regard to the following:

                     (a)  whether the primary order was made by consent;

                     (a)  the person (the **_applicant_**) who brought the proceedings in relation to the current contravention has previously brought proceedings in relation to the primary order or another primary order in which the applicant alleged that the person (the **_respondent_**) who committed the current contravention committed a contravention of the primary order or that other primary order; and

                     (b)  on the most recent occasion on which the applicant brought proceedings of the kind referred to in paragraph (a), the court before which the proceedings were brought:

                              (i)  was not satisfied that the respondent had committed a contravention of the primary order or that other primary order; or

                             (ii)  was satisfied that the respondent had committed a contravention of the primary order or that other primary order but did not make an order under section 70NDB, 70NDC, 70NEB, 70NFB or 70NBA in relation to the contravention.

##### <a id="70NEC"></a>70NEC  Bonds

##### <a id="70NFB"></a>70NFB  Powers of court

             (1)  If this Subdivision applies, the court must, in relation to the person who committed the current contravention:

             (3)  If a court varies or discharges under section 70NFD a community service order made under paragraph (2)(a), the court may give any directions as to the effect of the variation or discharge that the court considers appropriate.

             (4)  The court must not make an order imposing a sentence of imprisonment on a person under this section in respect of a contravention of a child maintenance order made under this Act unless the court is satisfied that the contravention was intentional or fraudulent.

             (5)  The court must not make an order imposing a sentence of imprisonment on a person under this section in respect of:

                     (a)  a contravention of an administrative assessment of child support made under the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989_; or

                     (b)  a breach of a child support agreement made under that Act; or

                     (c)  a contravention of an order made by a court under Division 4 of Part 7 of that Act for a departure from such an assessment (including such an order that contains matters mentioned in section 141 of that Act).

             (6)  An order under this section may be expressed to take effect immediately, at the end of a specified period or on the occurrence of a specified event.

             (7)  When a court makes an order under this section, the court may make any other orders that the court considers necessary to ensure compliance with the order that was contravened.

##### <a id="70NFC"></a>70NFC  When court is empowered to make a community service order

             (1)  Subject to this section, if, under the law of a participating State or a participating Territory, a court is empowered (whether generally or in particular cases) to make a community service order in respect of a person convicted of an offence against the law of the State or Territory, a court exercising jurisdiction in the State or Territory may, under paragraph 70NFB(2)(a) make a community service order.

             (2)  A community service order made under paragraph 70NFB(2)(a):

                     (a)  is to be such that the total number of hours during which the order regulates the conduct of the person in respect of whom it is made does not exceed the maximum period in relation to the State or Territory in which the order is made; and

                     (b)  ceases to have effect 2 years after it was made, or after such lesser period as is specified in the order.

             (3)  A community service order may be an order of any of the following kinds:

                     (a)  an order known as:

                              (i)  a community service order; or

                             (ii)  a work order; or

                            (iii)  an attendance centre order; or

                            (iv)  an attendance order; or

                             (v)  a community based order;

                     (b)  an order that is similar to an order referred to in paragraph (a);

                     (c)  an order prescribed for the purposes of this paragraph.

             (4)  If a court exercising jurisdiction under section 70NFB in a particular State or Territory makes a community service order under paragraph 70NFB(2)(a), the provisions of the laws of the State or Territory with respect to a community service order that is made under those laws are, to the extent provided by the regulations and subject to such modifications as are specified in the regulations, to apply in relation to the order.

             (5)  If a court proposes to make a community service order under paragraph 70NFB(2)(a), it must, before doing so, explain to the person in respect of whom it is made, in language likely to be readily understood by the person:

                     (a)  the purpose and effect of the proposed order; and

                     (b)  the consequences that may follow if the person fails to comply with the proposed order or with any requirements made in relation to the order by or under the applied provisions; and

                     (c)  if the proposed order may be revoked or varied under the applied provisions—that the proposed order may be so revoked or varied.

             (6)  In this section:

                    <a name="maximum-period"></a>**_maximum period_**, in relation to a State or Territory, means 500 hours or such lesser period as is prescribed in relation to the State or Territory.

                    <a name="particip-state"></a>**_participating State_** means a State in relation to which an agreement under section 70NFI is in force.

                    <a name="particip-territori"></a>**_participating Territory_** means a Territory in relation to which an agreement under section 70NFI is in force.

##### <a id="70NFD"></a>70NFD  Variation and discharge of community service orders

                   A community service order made under paragraph 70NFB(2)(a) may be varied or discharged:

                     (a)  if the court that made the order is the Family Court or the Federal Magistrates Court—by either of those Courts; or

                     (b)  otherwise—by the court that made the order or the Family Court.

##### <a id="70NFE"></a>70NFE  Bonds

             (1)  This section provides for bonds that a court may require a person to enter into under paragraph 70NFB(2)(b).

             (2)  A bond is to be for a specified period of up to 2 years.

             (3)  A bond may be:

                     (a)  with or without surety; and

                     (b)  with or without security.

             (4)  The conditions that may be imposed on a person by a bond include (without limitation) conditions that require the person:

                     (a)  to attend an appointment (or a series of appointments) with a family consultant; or

                     (b)  to attend family counselling; or

                     (c)  to attend family dispute resolution; or

                     (d)  to be of good behaviour.

Note:          Before imposing a condition under this subsection, the court must consider seeking the advice of a family consultant about the services appropriate to the person’s needs (see section 11E).

             (5)  If a court proposes to require a person to enter into a bond, it must, before making the requirement, explain to the person, in language likely to be readily understood by the person:

                     (a)  the purpose and effect of the proposed requirement; and

                     (b)  the consequences that may follow if the person:

                              (i)  fails to enter into the bond; or

                             (ii)  having entered into the bond—fails to act in accordance with the bond.

##### <a id="70NFF"></a>70NFF  Procedure for enforcing community service orders or bonds

             (1)  If a court makes a community service order under paragraph 70NFB(2)(a) in respect of a person, or an order under paragraph 70NFB(2)(b) requiring a person to enter into a bond in accordance with section 70NFE, the following provisions have effect.

             (2)  If the court (whether or not constituted by the judge or magistrate who made the community service order or required the bond to be entered into in accordance with section 70NFE) is satisfied that the person has, without reasonable excuse, failed to comply with the order or bond, the court may take action under subsection (3).

             (3)  The court may:

                     (a)  without prejudice to the continuance of the community service order or the bond entered into in accordance with section 70NFE, impose a fine not exceeding 10 penalty units on the person; or

                     (b)  revoke the community service order or the bond entered into in accordance with section 70NFE and, subject to subsection (4), deal with the person, for the contravention in respect of which the community service order was made or the bond was entered into, in any manner in which the person could have been dealt with for the contravention if:

                              (i)  the community service order had not been made or the bond had not been entered into; and

                             (ii)  the person was before the court under section 70NFB in respect of the contravention.

             (4)  In dealing with the person as mentioned in paragraph (3)(b), the court must, in addition to any other matters that it considers should be taken into account, take into account:

                     (a)  the fact that the community service order was made or the bond was entered into; and

                     (b)  anything done under the community service order or pursuant to the bond; and

                     (c)  any fine imposed, and any other order made, for or in respect of the contravention.

##### <a id="70NFG"></a>70NFG  Sentences of imprisonment

             (1)  A sentence of imprisonment imposed on a person under paragraph 70NFB(2)(e) is to be expressed to be:

                     (a)  for a specified period of 12 months or less; or

                     (b)  for a period ending when the person:

                              (i)  complies with the order concerned; or

                             (ii)  has been imprisoned under the sentence for 12 months or such lesser period as is specified by the court;

                            whichever happens first.

             (2)  A court must not sentence a person to imprisonment under paragraph 70NFB(2)(e) unless the court is satisfied that, in all the circumstances of the case, it would not be appropriate for the court to deal with the contravention under any of the other paragraphs of subsection 70NFB(2).

             (3)  If a court sentences a person to imprisonment under paragraph 70NFB(2)(e), the court must:

                     (a)  state the reasons why it is satisfied as mentioned in subsection (2); and

                     (b)  cause those reasons to be entered in the records of the court.

             (4)  The failure of a court to comply with subsection (3) does not invalidate a sentence.

             (5)  A court that sentences a person to imprisonment under paragraph 70NFB(2)(e) may:

                     (a)  suspend the sentence upon the terms and conditions determined by the court; and

                     (b)  terminate a suspension made under paragraph (a).

             (6)  A court, when sentencing a person to imprisonment under paragraph 70NFB(2)(e), may, if it considers it appropriate to do so, direct that the person be released upon the person entering into a bond described in subsection (7) after he or she has served a specified part of the term of imprisonment.

             (7)  A bond for the purposes of subsection (6) is a bond (with or without surety or security) that the person will be of good behaviour for a specified period of up to 2 years.

             (8)  A court that has sentenced a person to imprisonment for a period expressed as provided by paragraph (1)(b) may order the release of the person if it is satisfied that the person will, if he or she is released, comply with the order concerned.

             (9)  To avoid doubt, the serving by a person of a period of imprisonment under a sentence imposed on the person under paragraph 70NFB(2)(e) for failure to make a payment under a child maintenance order does not affect the person’s liability to make the payment.

##### <a id="70NFH"></a>70NFH  Relationship between Subdivision and other laws

             (1)  This section applies where an act or omission by a person:

                     (a)  constitutes a contravention of an order under this Act affecting children; and

                     (b)  is also an offence against any law.

             (2)  If the person is prosecuted in respect of the offence, a court in which proceedings have been brought under section 70NFB in respect of the contravention of the order must:

                     (a)  adjourn those proceedings until the prosecution has been completed; or

                     (b)  dismiss those proceedings.

             (3)  The person may be prosecuted for, and convicted of, the offence.

             (4)  Nothing in this section renders the person liable to be punished twice in respect of the same act or omission.

##### <a id="70NFI"></a>70NFI  Arrangements with States and Territories for carrying out of sentences and orders

                   An arrangement made under section 112AN for or in relation to the carrying out of sentences imposed, or orders made, under Division 2 of Part XIIIA is taken to extend to the carrying out of sentences imposed, or orders made, under this Subdivision.

##### <a id="70NFJ"></a>70NFJ  Subdivision does not limit operation of section 105

                   Nothing in this Subdivision is intended to limit the operation of section 105.

### Division 12A—Principles for conducting child-related proceedings

#### Subdivision A—Proceedings to which this Division applies

##### <a id="69ZM"></a>69ZM  Proceedings to which this Division applies

             (1)  This Division applies to proceedings that are wholly under this Part.

             (2)  This Division also applies to proceedings that are partly under this Part:

                     (a)  to the extent that they are proceedings under this Part; and

                     (b)  if the parties to the proceedings consent—to the extent that they are not proceedings under this Part.

             (3)  This Division also applies to any other proceedings between the parties that involve the court exercising jurisdiction under this Act and that arise from the breakdown of the parties’ marital relationship, if the parties to the proceedings consent.

             (4)  Proceedings to which this Division applies are **_child-related proceedings_**.

             (5)  Consent given for the purposes of paragraph (2)(b) or subsection (3) must be:

                     (a)  free from coercion; and

                     (b)  given in the form prescribed by the applicable Rules of Court.

             (6)  A party to proceedings may, with the leave of the court, revoke a consent given for the purposes of paragraph (2)(b) or subsection (3).

#### Subdivision B—Principles for conducting child-related proceedings

##### <a id="69ZN"></a>69ZN  Principles for conducting child-related proceedings

Application of the principles

             (1)  The court must give effect to the principles in this section:

                     (a)  in performing duties and exercising powers (whether under this Division or otherwise) in relation to child-related proceedings; and

                     (b)  in making other decisions about the conduct of child-related proceedings.

Failure to do so does not invalidate the proceedings or any order made in them.

             (2)  Regard is to be had to the principles in interpreting this Division.

Principle 1

             (3)  The first principle is that the court is to consider the needs of the child concerned and the impact that the conduct of the proceedings may have on the child in determining the conduct of the proceedings.

Principle 2

             (4)  The second principle is that the court is to actively direct, control and manage the conduct of the proceedings.

Principle 3

             (5)  The third principle is that the proceedings are to be conducted in a way that will safeguard:

                     (a)  the child concerned against family violence, child abuse and child neglect; and

                     (b)  the parties to the proceedings against family violence.

Principle 4

             (6)  The fourth principle is that the proceedings are, as far as possible, to be conducted in a way that will promote cooperative and child-focused parenting by the parties.

Principle 5

             (7)  The fifth principle is that the proceedings are to be conducted without undue delay and with as little formality, and legal technicality and form, as possible.

##### <a id="69ZO"></a>69ZO  This Division also applies to proceedings in Chambers

                   A judge, Judicial Registrar, Registrar, Federal Magistrate or magistrate, who is hearing child-related proceedings in Chambers, has all of the duties and powers that a court has under this Division.

Note:          An order made in Chambers has the same effect as an order made in open court.

##### <a id="69ZP"></a>69ZP  Powers under this Division may be exercised on court’s own initiative

                   The court may exercise a power under this Division:

                     (a)  on the court’s own initiative; or

                     (b)  at the request of one or more of the parties to the proceedings.

#### Subdivision C—Duties and powers related to giving effect to the principles

##### <a id="69ZQ"></a>69ZQ  General duties

             (1)  In giving effect to the principles in section 69ZN, the court must:

                     (a)  decide which of the issues in the proceedings require full investigation and hearing and which may be disposed of summarily; and

                     (b)  decide the order in which the issues are to be decided; and

                     (c)  give directions or make orders about the timing of steps that are to be taken in the proceedings; and

                     (d)  in deciding whether a particular step is to be taken—consider whether the likely benefits of taking the step justify the costs of taking it; and

                     (e)  make appropriate use of technology; and

                      (f)  if the court considers it appropriate—encourage the parties to use family dispute resolution or family counselling; and

                     (g)  deal with as many aspects of the matter as it can on a single occasion; and

                     (h)  deal with the matter, where appropriate, without requiring the parties’ physical attendance at court.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not limit subsection 69ZN(1).

             (3)  A failure to comply with subsection (1) does not invalidate an order.

##### <a id="69ZR"></a>69ZR  Power to make determinations, findings and orders at any stage of proceedings

             (1)  If, at any time after the commencement of child-related proceedings and before making final orders, the court considers that it may assist in the determination of the dispute between the parties, the court may do any or all of the following:

                     (a)  make a finding of fact in relation to the proceedings;

                     (b)  determine a matter arising out of the proceedings;

                     (c)  make an order in relation to an issue arising out of the proceedings.

Note:          For example, the court may choose to use this power if the court considers that making a finding of fact at a particular point in the proceedings will help to focus the proceedings.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not prevent the court doing something mentioned in paragraph (1)(a), (b) or (c) at the same time as making final orders.

             (3)  To avoid doubt, a judge, Judicial Registrar, Registrar, Federal Magistrate or magistrate who exercises a power under subsection (1) in relation to proceedings is not, merely because of having exercised the power, required to disqualify himself or herself from a further hearing of the proceedings.

##### <a id="69ZS"></a>69ZS  Use of family consultants

                   At any time during child-related proceedings, the court may designate a family consultant as the family consultant in relation to the proceedings.

Note 1:       Family consultants have the functions described in section 11A. These include assisting and advising people involved in proceedings, and this assistance and advice may involve helping people to better understand the effect of things on the child concerned. Family consultants can also inform people about other services available to help them.

Note 2:       The court may also order parties to proceedings to attend appointments with a family consultant. See section 11F.

#### Subdivision D—Matters relating to evidence

##### <a id="69ZT"></a>69ZT  Rules of evidence not to apply unless court decides

             (1)  These provisions of the _Evidence Act 1995_ do not apply to child-related proceedings:

                     (a)  Divisions 3, 4 and 5 of Part 2.1 (which deal with general rules about giving evidence, examination in chief, re-examination and cross-examination), other than sections 26, 30, 36 and 41;

Note:       Section 26 is about the court’s control over questioning of witnesses. Section 30 is about interpreters. Section 36 relates to examination of a person without subpoena or other process. Section 41 is about improper questions.

                     (b)  Parts 2.2 and 2.3 (which deal with documents and other evidence including demonstrations, experiments and inspections);

                     (c)  Parts 3.2 to 3.8 (which deal with hearsay, opinion, admissions, evidence of judgments and convictions, tendency and coincidence, credibility and character).

             (2)  The court may give such weight (if any) as it thinks fit to evidence admitted as a consequence of a provision of the _Evidence Act 1995_ not applying because of subsection (1).

             (3)  Despite subsection (1), the court may decide to apply one or more of the provisions of a Division or Part mentioned in that subsection to an issue in the proceedings, if:

                     (a)  the court is satisfied that the circumstances are exceptional; and

                     (b)  the court has taken into account (in addition to any other matters the court thinks relevant):

                              (i)  the importance of the evidence in the proceedings; and

                             (ii)  the nature of the subject matter of the proceedings; and

                            (iii)  the probative value of the evidence; and

                            (iv)  the powers of the court (if any) to adjourn the hearing, to make another order or to give a direction in relation to the evidence.

             (4)  If the court decides to apply a provision of a Division or Part mentioned in subsection (1) to an issue in the proceedings, the court may give such weight (if any) as it thinks fit to evidence admitted as a consequence of the provision applying.

             (5)  Subsection (1) does not revive the operation of:

                     (a)  a rule of common law; or

                     (b)  a law of a State or a Territory;

that, but for subsection (1), would have been prevented from operating because of a provision of a Division or Part mentioned in that subsection.

##### <a id="69ZU"></a>69ZU  Evidence of family consultants

                   The court must not, without the consent of the parties to the proceedings, take into account an opinion expressed by a family consultant, unless the consultant gave the opinion as sworn evidence.

##### <a id="69ZV"></a>69ZV  Evidence of children

#### Division 10—Independent representation of child’s interests

##### <a id="68L"></a>68L  Court order for independent representation of child’s interests

             (1)  This section applies to proceedings under this Act in which a child’s best interests are, or a child’s welfare is, the paramount, or a relevant, consideration.

             (2)  If it appears to the court that the child’s interests in the proceedings ought to be independently represented by a lawyer, the court:

                     (a)  may order that the child’s interests in the proceedings are to be independently represented by a lawyer; and

                     (b)  may make such other orders as it considers necessary to secure that independent representation of the child’s interests.

             (3)  However, if the proceedings arise under regulations made for the purposes of section 111B, the court:

                     (a)  may order that the child’s interests in the proceedings be independently represented by a lawyer only if the court considers there are exceptional circumstances that justify doing so; and

                     (b)  must specify those circumstances in making the order.

Note:          Section 111B is about the Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction.

             (4)  A court may make an order for the independent representation of the child’s interests in the proceedings by a lawyer:

                     (a)  on its own initiative; or

                     (b)  on the application of:

                              (i)  the child; or

                             (ii)  an organisation concerned with the welfare of children; or

                            (iii)  any other person.

             (5)  Without limiting paragraph (2)(b), the court may make an order under that paragraph for the purpose of allowing the lawyer who is to represent the child’s interests to find out what the child’s views are on the matters to which the proceedings relate.

Note:          A person cannot require a child to express his or her views in relation to any matter, see section 60CE.

             (6)  Subsection (5) does not apply if complying with that subsection would be inappropriate because of:

                     (a)  the child’s age or maturity; or

                     (b)  some other special circumstance.

                    (aa)  to ensure that orders, injunctions and arrangements of the kind referred to in subparagraph (a)(ii) do not expose people to family violence; and

                     (b)  to achieve the objects and principles in section 60B.

Note:          Other provisions dealing with family violence and family violence orders are section 4 (definitions), paragraphs 60B(1)(b) and 60CC(2)(i) and (j), sections 60CF and 60CG, subsection 60I(9), section 60K, subsection 61DA(2), paragraph 65F(2)(b) and section 65P.

##### <a id="68P"></a>68P  Obligations of court making an order or granting an injunction under this Act that is inconsistent with an existing family violence order

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a court:

                              (i)  makes a parenting order that provides for a child to spend time with a person, or expressly or impliedly requires or authorises a person to spend time with a child; or

                             (ii)  makes a recovery order (as defined in section 67Q) or any other order under this Act that expressly or impliedly requires or authorises a person to spend time with a child; or

                            (iii)  grants an injunction under section 68B or 114 that expressly or impliedly requires or authorises a person to spend time with a child; and

                     (b)  the order made or injunction granted is inconsistent with an existing family violence order.

             (2)  The court must, to the extent to which the order or injunction provides for the child to spend time with a person, or expressly or impliedly requires or authorises a person to spend time with the child:

                     (a)  specify in the order or injunction that it is inconsistent with an existing family violence order; and

                     (b)  give a detailed explanation in the order or injunction of how the contact that it provides for is to take place; and

                     (c)  explain (or arrange for someone else to explain) the order or injunction to:

                              (i)  the applicant and respondent in the proceedings for the order or injunction; and

                             (ii)  the person against whom the family violence order is directed (if that person is not the applicant or respondent); and

                            (iii)  the person protected by the family violence order (if that person is not the applicant or respondent); and

                     (d)  include (or arrange to be included) in the explanation, in language those persons are likely to readily understand:

                              (i)  the purpose of the order or injunction; and

                             (ii)  the obligations created by the order or injunction, including how the contact that it provides for is to take place; and

                            (iii)  the consequences that may follow if a person fails to comply with the order or injunction; and

                             (v)  the circumstances in which a person may apply for variation or revocation of the order or injunction.

             (3)  As soon as practicable after making the order or granting the injunction (and no later than 14 days after making or granting it), the court must give a copy to:

                     (a)  the applicant and respondent in the proceedings for the order or injunction; and

                     (b)  the person against whom the family violence order is directed (if that person is not the applicant or respondent); and

                     (c)  the person protected by the family violence order (if that person is not the applicant or respondent); and

                     (d)  the Registrar, Principal Officer or other appropriate officer of the court that last made or varied the family violence order; and

                     (e)  the Commissioner or head (however described) of the police force of the State or Territory in which the person protected by the family violence order resides; and

                      (f)  a child welfare officer in relation to the State or Territory in which the person protected by the family violence order resides.

             (4)  Failure to comply with this section does not affect the validity of the order or injunction.

##### <a id="68Q"></a>68Q  Relationship of order or injunction made under this Act with existing inconsistent family violence order

             (1)  To the extent to which:

                     (a)  an order or injunction mentioned in paragraph 68P(1)(a) is made or granted that provides for a child to spend time with a person, or expressly or impliedly requires or authorises a person to spend time with a child; and

                     (b)  the order or injunction is inconsistent with an existing family violence order;

the family violence order is invalid.

             (2)  An application for a declaration that the order or injunction is inconsistent with the family violence order may be made, to a court that has jurisdiction under this Part, by:

                     (a)  the applicant or respondent in the proceedings for the order or injunction mentioned in paragraph 68P(1)(a); or

                     (b)  the person against whom the family violence order is directed (if that person is not the applicant or respondent); or

                     (c)  the person protected by the family violence order (if that person is not the applicant or respondent).

             (3)  The court must hear and determine the application and make such declarations as it considers appropriate.

##### <a id="68R"></a>68R  Power of court making a family violence order to revive, vary, discharge or suspend an existing order, injunction or arrangement under this Act

Power

             (1)  In proceedings to make or vary a family violence order, a court of a State or Territory that has jurisdiction in relation to this Part may revive, vary, discharge or suspend:

                     (a)  a parenting order, to the extent to which it provides for a child to spend time with a person, or expressly or impliedly requires or authorises a person to spend time with the child; or

                     (b)  a recovery order (as defined in section 67Q) or any other order under this Act, to the extent to which it expressly or impliedly requires or authorises a person to spend time with a child; or

                     (c)  an injunction granted under section 68B or 114, to the extent to which it expressly or impliedly requires or authorises a person to spend time with a child; or

                     (d)  to the extent to which it expressly or impliedly requires or authorises a person to spend time with a child:

                              (i)  an undertaking given to, and accepted by, a court exercising jurisdiction under this Act; or

                             (ii)  a registered parenting plan within the meaning of subsection 63C(6); or

                            (iii)  a recognisance entered into under an order under this Act.

             (2)  The court may do so:

                     (a)  on its own initiative; or

                     (b)  on application by any person.

Limits on power

             (3)  The court must not do so unless:

                     (a)  it also makes or varies a family violence order in the proceedings (whether or not by interim order); and

                     (b)  if the court proposes to revive, vary, discharge or suspend an order or injunction mentioned in paragraph (1)(a), (b) or (c)—the court has before it material that was not before the court that made that order or injunction.

             (4)  The court must not exercise its power under subsection (1) to discharge an order, injunction or arrangement in proceedings to make an interim family violence order or an interim variation of a family violence order.

Relevant considerations

             (5)  In exercising its power under subsection (1), the court must:

                     (a)  have regard to the purposes of this Division (stated in section 68N); and

                     (b)  have regard to whether contact with both parents is in the best interests of the child concerned; and

                     (c)  if varying, discharging or suspending an order or injunction mentioned in paragraph (1)(a), (b) or (c) that, when made or granted, was inconsistent with an existing family violence order—be satisfied that it is appropriate to do so because a person has been exposed, or is likely to be exposed, to family violence as a result of the operation of that order or injunction.

Note:          Sections 60CB to 60CG deal with how a court determines a child’s best interests.

Registration of revival, variation, discharge or suspension of orders and other arrangements

             (6)  The regulations may require a copy of the court’s decision to revive, vary, discharge or suspend an order, injunction or arrangement to be registered in accordance with the regulations. Failure to comply with the requirement does not affect the validity of the court’s decision.

##### <a id="68S"></a>68S  Application of Act and Rules when exercising section 68R power

             (1)  The following provisions do not apply to a court exercising the power under section 68R:

                     (a)  section 65C (who may apply for a parenting order);

                     (b)  subsection 65F(2) (parenting order not to be made unless parties attend family counselling);

                     (c)  section 60CG (court to consider risk of family violence);

                     (d)  section 69N (requirement to transfer certain proceedings);

                     (e)  any provisions (for example, section 60CA) that would otherwise make the best interests of the child the paramount consideration;

Note:       Even though the best interests of the child are not paramount, they must still be taken into account under paragraph 68R(5)(b).

                      (f)  any provisions of this Act or the applicable Rules of Court specified in the regulations.

             (2)  If a court is exercising the power under section 68R in proceedings to make an interim family violence order or an interim variation of a family violence order:

                     (a)  the court has a discretion about whether to apply paragraph 60CC(3)(a) (about taking into account a child’s views etc.); and

                     (b)  any provisions of this Act or the applicable Rules of Court specified in the regulations do not apply.

             (3)  A court exercising the power under section 68R may, as it thinks appropriate, dispense with any otherwise applicable Rules of Court.

##### <a id="68T"></a>68T  Special provisions relating to proceedings to make an interim (or interim variation of) family violence order

             (1)  If, in proceedings to make an interim family violence order or an interim variation of a family violence order, the court revives, varies or suspends an order, injunction or arrangement under section 68R, that revival, variation or suspension ceases to have effect at the earlier of:

                     (a)  the time the interim order stops being in force; and

                     (b)  the end of the period of 21 days starting when the interim order was made.

             (2)  No appeal lies in relation to the revival, variation or suspension.

##### <a id="114MJ"></a>114MJ  Effect of declared rights and liabilities

                     (b)  is to be regarded as always having had the same effect, and given rise to the same consequences, for the purposes of any written or other law;

as if it were done or omitted to be done to give effect to, or under the authority of, or in reliance on, an order made by that court, in the exercise of its federal family jurisdiction, in or in relation to the proceedings for the order.

             (2)  Subject to subsection (3), for the purposes of an enforcement law (see subsection (4)), any act or thing done or omitted to be done before or after the commencement of this Part:

                     (a)  gives rise to the same consequences; and

                     (b)  is to be regarded as always having given rise to the same consequences;

as if each ineffective order of a court of summary jurisdiction were an order made by that court, in the exercise of its federal family jurisdiction, in or in relation to the proceedings for the order.

##### <a id="114ML"></a>114ML  Powers of courts in relation to declared rights and liabilities

             (1)  A court may vary, revoke, set aside, revive or suspend a right or liability conferred, imposed or affected by section 114MI in relation to an ineffective order of a court of summary jurisdiction as if it were a right or liability conferred, imposed or affected by an order made by that court of summary jurisdiction, in the exercise of its federal family jurisdiction, in or in relation to the proceedings for the order.

             (2)  In addition to its powers under subsection (1), a court (the **_review court_**) also has power to make an order achieving any other result that could have been achieved if:

                     (a)  the ineffective order had been an order made by a court of summary jurisdiction, in the exercise of its federal family jurisdiction, in or in relation to the proceedings for the order; and

                     (b)  the review court had been considering whether:

                              (i)  to vary, revoke, set aside, revive or suspend that order; or

                             (ii)  to extend the time for the doing of anything in relation to the proceedings for the order; or

##### <a id="114MN"></a>114MN  Evidence

                   The court record, or a copy of the court record, of an ineffective order may be adduced in evidence to show the existence, nature and extent of each right or liability conferred, imposed or affected by section 114MI.
