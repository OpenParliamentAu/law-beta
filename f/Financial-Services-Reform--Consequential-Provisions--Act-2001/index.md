                              (i)  any intended conduct of the supplier that might affect the interests of the service recipient; and

#### Subdivision B—Treatment of existing markets

##### <a id="1411"></a>1411  When is a market being operated immediately before the FSR commencement?

                   Subject to section 1412, in this Subdivision, a reference to a market **_being operated immediately before the FSR commencement_** is a reference to a market that had not permanently ceased to operate before the FSR commencement, even if trading on the market was not actually occurring immediately before the FSR commencement (for example, because of a routine temporary closure of the market).

##### <a id="1412"></a>1412  Treatment of proposed markets that have not started to operate by the FSR commencement

             (1)  This section applies in relation to the following proposed markets, other than any such market that starts to operate before the FSR commencement:

                     (a)  a market proposed to be operated by Bendigo Stock Exchange Ltd, or by ASX Futures Exchange Pty Limited, that is identified in writing by the Minister as being a proposed market to which this section applies;

                     (b)  any other proposed market identified in, or in accordance with, regulations made for the purposes of this paragraph.

For this purpose, a **_proposed market_** is a market that a person has, before the FSR commencement, indicated an intention that they propose to operate.

             (2)  This Subdivision applies in relation to a proposed market to which this section applies subject to the following paragraphs:

                     (a)  subject to paragraphs (b), (c) and (d), this Subdivision applies in relation to the proposed market as if the market, as proposed to be operated, were in fact being operated immediately before the FSR commencement;

                     (b)  if, taking account of the effect of paragraph (a), section 1413 applies in relation to the proposed market, that section applies in relation to the proposed market:

                              (i)  as if the Minister’s obligation to grant a licence, and impose conditions, under subsection 1413(2) in relation to the market does not arise unless and until the market operator lodges with ASIC a notice in relation to the market under subsection (3) of this section, and does not arise at all if no such notice is given to ASIC by the end of 6 months after the FSR commencement; and

                             (ii)  as if subsection 1413(3) provided for a licence so granted under subsection 1413(2) in relation to the market, and the conditions subject to which it is granted, to be taken to have had effect from the day (the **_start day_**) specified in the subsection (3) notice as the day on which the market started to operate; and

                            (iii)  as if subsection 1413(6) were omitted; and

                            (iv)  as if the references in subsection 1413(8) to the FSR commencement were instead references to the start day;

                     (c)  if:

                              (i)  taking account of the effect of paragraph (a), section 1418, 1420, 1421 or 1422 applies to the proposed market; and

                             (ii)  the market operator does not lodge with ASIC a notice in relation to the market under subsection (3) of this section by the end of 6 months after the FSR commencement;

                            that section ceases to apply in relation to the proposed market at the end of that period;

                     (d)  if a provision of this Subdivision provides for a provision of the old Corporations Act to continue to apply in relation to the proposed market, then (without limiting the generality of subsection 1410(3)), while the proposed market remains non-operational, the provision of the old Corporations Act only applies in relation to the proposed market to the extent (if any) to which it would, disregarding the effect of paragraph (a), apply in relation to the proposed market.

             (3)  If a proposed market to which this section applies starts to operate on a day during the period of 6 months starting on the FSR commencement, the operator must, as soon as practicable, and in any event within 7 days, lodge with ASIC written notice of the fact that the market started to operate on that day.

Note:          Failure to comply with this subsection is an offence (see subsection 1311(1)).

             (4)  ASIC must, within a reasonable time, give the Minister a notice it receives under subsection (3).

##### <a id="1413"></a>1413  Obligation of Minister to grant licences covering main existing markets

             (1)  This section applies to each market being operated immediately before the FSR commencement in relation to which any of the following paragraphs applies:

                     (a)  the market was a stock market operated by the Australian Stock Exchange Limited;

                     (b)  the market was a stock market operated by a body corporate covered by an approval in force under subsection 769(2) of the old Corporations Act;

                     (c)  the market was a futures market operated by a body corporate covered by an approval in force under subsection 1126(2) of the old Corporations Act.

             (2)  Subject to subsections (3) and (4), the Minister must, in relation to each market to which this section applies, grant the operator of the market a licence, and impose conditions on that licence, in accordance with the following requirements:

                     (a)  the licence must be described as an Australian market licence;

                     (b)  the licence must be granted subject to the following conditions:

                              (i)  a condition specifying the market as the market that the licence authorises the licensee to operate;

                             (ii)  a condition specifying, as the classes of financial products that can be dealt with on the market, the classes that are appropriate for the market under subsection (5);

                            (iii)  if the Minister considers that the licensee should have clearing and settlement arrangements for transactions effected through the market—a condition specifying the type of clearing and settlement arrangements that are adequate.

             (3)  Subject to subsection (6), a licence that subsection (2) requires to be granted must be granted on, or as soon as practicable after, the FSR commencement. If it is granted after the FSR commencement, it, and the conditions subject to which it is granted, are taken to have had effect from that commencement.

             (4)  Sections 795D (more than one licence in the same document) and 795E (more than one market covered by the same licence) of the amended Corporations Act apply in relation to the granting of licences, and licences granted, under this section as if the licences were, or were being, granted under section 795B of that Act. If, pursuant to section 795E, a single licence is granted under this section in respect of several separate markets, paragraph (2)(b) of this section must be complied with separately in the licence document in relation to each of those markets.

             (5)  For the purposes of subparagraph (2)(b)(ii), the classes of financial products that are **_appropriate_** for a market to which this section applies are as follows:

                     (a)  for a market described in paragraph (1)(a) or (b)—securities, within the meaning of section 92 of the old Corporations Act as applying for the purposes of Part 7.2 of the old Corporations Act, and agreements of a kind to which section 92A of the old Corporations Act applied immediately before the FSR commencement (or would have applied after the FSR commencement if that section, and any associated provisions, had continued to have effect);

                     (b)  for a market described in paragraph (1)(c)—futures contracts, within the meaning of section 72 of the old Corporations Act, and agreements of a kind to which section 72A of the old Corporations Act applied immediately before the FSR commencement (or would have applied after the FSR commencement if that section, and any associated provisions, had continued to have effect).

             (6)  Despite anything in subsection (3), the Minister may, under this section, grant a licence, and impose conditions on the licence, at any time during the period starting on the commencement of this section and ending on the FSR commencement on the basis that matters known to the Minister in relation to the market concerned will continue to be the case up to the FSR commencement. If the Minister does so:

                     (a)  the licence and conditions come into effect on the FSR commencement, and not before; and

                     (b)  the Minister may vary or revoke the licence, or any of the conditions, before the FSR commencement if the Minister considers it appropriate to do so having regard to the provisions of this section concerning the granting of licences and the imposition of conditions; and

                     (c)  the licence and conditions do not come into effect on the FSR commencement if, immediately before the FSR commencement, the market is not a market to which this section applies.

             (7)  If the Minister grants a licence under this section, the Minister must give the operator of the market written notice of:

                     (a)  the grant of the licence, and the conditions imposed on the licence; and

                     (b)  any subsequent revocation or variation under subsection (6) of the licence or conditions.

             (8)  A notice advising of the grant of a licence under this section must contain a statement to the effect that the licence and conditions will not take effect until the FSR commencement, or will be taken to have had effect from the FSR commencement, as the case requires.

##### <a id="1414"></a>1414  Section 1413 markets—effect of licences and conditions

             (1)  Subject to subsections (2) to (4):

                     (a)  a licence granted under section 1413 that authorises the operation of a market is, for the purposes of the amended Corporations Act (other than this section), taken to have been granted (and to have been properly granted) under section 795B of the amended Corporations Act; and

                     (b)  conditions imposed under section 1413 on the licence are, for the purposes of the amended Corporations Act (other than this section), taken to have been imposed (and to have been properly imposed) under section 796A of the amended Corporations Act.

Note 1:       Section 795C of the amended Corporations Act (publication of notice of licence grant) applies to the grant of the licence.

Note 2:       The conditions may be varied or revoked, and additional conditions may be imposed, under section 796A of the amended Corporations Act.

             (2)  Subject to subsection (4), the relevant new legislation (see subsection (6)) does not apply in relation to the market during the period (the **_transition period_**) starting on the FSR commencement and ending on whichever of the following first occurs:

                     (a)  the end of the period of 2 years starting on the FSR commencement;

                     (b)  the licensee applies, under subsection 796A(2) of the amended Corporations Act, to have the conditions on the licence varied or revoked, or to have additional conditions imposed on the licence;

                     (c)  the licensee has lodged with ASIC notice in writing that it wants to take advantage of the compensation arrangements under Division 3 of Part 7.5 of the amended Corporations Act:

                              (i)  from a specified date, being a date that is after the notice is given to ASIC and that is after compensation arrangements for the market have been approved under Division 3 of Part 7.5 of the amended Corporations Act (see also subsection (4)); or

                             (ii)  from the end of a specified period, being a period that is described as starting when compensation arrangements for the market are approved under Division 3 of Part 7.5 of the amended Corporations Act (see also subsection (4)) and that ends after the notice is given to ASIC;

                            and that date arrives or period ends.

             (3)  A notice (the **_original notice_**) given for the purposes of paragraph (2)(c) may, before the date, or the end of the period, specified in the original notice as mentioned in that paragraph:

                     (a)  be varied to specify another date or period, being a date or period that would satisfy the requirements of subparagraph (2)(c)(i) or (ii) if the reference in that subparagraph to when the notice (being the original notice) is given to ASIC were instead a reference to when the notice of variation is given to ASIC under this subsection; or

                     (b)  be revoked.

The variation or revocation must be made by notice in writing lodged with ASIC.

             (4)  If the relevant new legislation in relation to a market includes Part 7.5 of the amended Corporations Act, then, despite subsection (2), Division 3 of that Part applies to the market during the transition period to the extent necessary for the operator to apply to have compensation arrangements for the market approved before the end of the transition period, and for that application to be determined. However, any approval of the arrangements under that Division does not take effect until immediately after the end of the transition period.

             (5)  The annual report of the licensee (see section 792F of the amended Corporations Act) for a financial year in which part of the transition period occurs, other than a financial year in which the transition period ends, must include information about:

                     (a)  the steps taken in the year; and

                     (b)  the steps proposed to be taken in the next year;

to ensure that the relevant new legislation will be complied with by the time the transition period ends.

             (6)  In this section:

                    <a name="relev-new-legisl"></a>**_relevant new legislation_**, in relation to a market, means:

                     (a)  section 793A of the amended Corporations Act; and

                     (b)  unless the market is a market to which Division 4 of Part 7.5 of the amended Corporations Act applies—Part 7.5 of the amended Corporations Act.

##### <a id="1415"></a>1415  Section 1413 markets—preservation of old Corporations Act provisions during transition period

Preservation of compensation regimes

             (1)  If, during the transition period  in relation to a market the operation of which is authorised by a licence granted under section 1413, Part 7.5 of the amended Corporations Act does not apply in relation to the market (except as provided in subsection 1414(4)) because of subsection 1414(2), Part 7.9, or Part 8.6, as the case requires, of the old Corporations Act, and any associated provisions, continue to apply in relation to the market during the transition period.

Preservation of certain ongoing requirements

             (2)  During the transition period  in relation to a market:

                     (a)  the operation of which is authorised by a licence granted under section 1413; and

                     (b)  that, immediately before the FSR commencement, was a securities exchange to which section 769A of the old Corporations Act applied;

the following provisions continue to apply in relation to the market:

                     (c)  paragraphs 769A(1)(c) and (e) of the old Corporations Act, and any associated provisions;

                     (d)  section 769B of the old Corporations Act (but only as applying in relation to paragraphs 769A(1)(c) and (e) of the old Corporations Act), and any associated provisions.

##### <a id="1416"></a>1416  Section 1413 markets—powers for regulations to change how the old and new Corporations Act apply during the transition period

             (1)  The regulations may do all or any of the following in relation to a market the operation of which is authorised by a licence granted under section 1413:

                     (a)  provide that some or all of the provisions (the **_relevant old legislation_**) that would otherwise continue to apply in relation to the market because of section 1415 do not apply in relation to the market;

                     (b)  provide that some or all of the relevant old legislation applies in relation to the market with specified modifications during some or all of the transition period for the market;

                     (c)  provide that some or all of the relevant new legislation (within the meaning of section 1414) in relation to the market applies in relation to the market during some or all of the transition period for the market;

                     (d)  provide that specified provisions of the amended Corporations Act (including relevant new legislation), and any associated provisions, apply in relation to the market during some or all of the transition period for the market with specified modifications.

             (2)  Regulations made for the purposes of subsection (1) have effect despite anything in sections 1414 and 1415.

             (1)  This section applies to a financial market in relation to which the following paragraphs are satisfied:

                     (a)  a licence is granted under section 1413 to the operator of the market; and

                     (b)  the conditions on the licence specify, as the classes of financial products that can be dealt with on the market, the classes of financial products specified in whichever of paragraphs 1413(5)(a) and (b) is applicable; and

                     (c)  immediately before the commencement, other financial products (the **_additional products_**) were also dealt with on the market, and the fact that the market dealt with those products did not constitute a contravention of a provision of the old Corporations Act.

             (2)  Subject to subsection (3), section 791 of the amended Corporations Act does not apply in relation to the market in so far as all or any of the additional products are dealt with on the market during the period (the **_transition period_**) starting on the FSR commencement and ending on whichever of the following first occurs:

                     (a)  the end of the period of 2 years starting on the FSR commencement;

                     (b)  the licensee applies, under subsection 796A(2) of the amended Corporations Act, to have the conditions on the licence varied or revoked, or to have additional conditions imposed on the licence.

             (3)  The regulations may, in relation to a market to which this section applies and the additional products, provide that specified provisions (including section 791A) of the amended Corporations Act, and any associated provisions, apply in relation to a market to which this section applies and the additional products during some or all of the transition period for the market and the products with specified modifications.

##### <a id="1418"></a>1418  Treatment of exempt stock markets and exempt futures markets (other than markets with no identifiable single operator)

             (1)  This section applies to the following markets:

                     (a)  stock markets being operated immediately before the FSR commencement that were, at that time, covered by a declaration (the **_declaration of exemption_**) in force immediately before the FSR commencement under subsection 771(1) of the old Corporations Act;

                     (b)  futures markets being operated immediately before the FSR commencement that were, at that time, covered by a declaration (the **_declaration of exemption_**) in force immediately before the FSR commencement under subsection 1127(1) of the old Corporations Act.

However it does not apply to any market to which section 1419 applies.

             (2)  Subject to subsection (5), section 791A of the amended Corporations Act does not apply in relation to a stock market or futures market to which this section applies during the period (the **_transition period_**) starting on the FSR commencement and ending on whichever of the following first occurs:

                     (a)  the end of the period of 2 years starting on the FSR commencement;

             (4)  The declaration of exemption (including any conditions specified in the declaration) for a stock market or futures market to which this section applies cannot be varied during the transition period for the market so as to cover the market providing services that were not covered by the declaration as in force immediately before the FSR commencement. However, it may be varied in other ways, or revoked, by the Minister in writing.

             (5)  The regulations may do all or any of the following:

                     (a)  provide that some or all of the relevant old legislation does not apply in relation to a stock market or futures market to which this section applies during some or all of the transition period for the market;

                     (b)  provide that some or all of the relevant old legislation applies in relation to a stock market or futures market to which this section applies with specified modifications during some or all of the transition period for the market;

                     (c)  provide that specified provisions of the amended Corporations Act (including section 791A), and any associated provisions, apply in relation to a stock market or futures market to which this section applies during some or all of the transition period for the market with specified modifications.

             (4)  The declaration of exemption (including any conditions specified in the declaration) for a stock market or futures market to which this section applies cannot:

                     (a)  be varied during the transition period for an exempted participant and the market so as to cover the market providing services that were not covered by the declaration as in force immediately before the FSR commencement; or

However it may be varied in other ways, or revoked, by the Minister in writing.

             (5)  The regulations may do all or any of the following:

#### Subdivision C—Treatment of existing clearing and settlement facilities

##### <a id="1423"></a>1423  When is a clearing and settlement facility being operated immediately before the FSR commencement?

                   Subject to section 1424, in this Subdivision, a reference to a clearing and settlement facility **_being operated immediately before the FSR commencement_** is a reference to a clearing and settlement facility that had not permanently ceased to operate before the FSR commencement, even if the clearing and settlement of transactions by means of the facility was not actually occurring immediately before the FSR commencement (for example, because of a routine temporary closure of the facility).

##### <a id="1424"></a>1424  Treatment of proposed clearing and settlement facilities that have not started to operate by the FSR commencement

             (1)  This section applies in relation to any proposed clearing and settlement facilities identified in, or in accordance with, regulations made for the purposes of this subsection. For this purpose, a **_proposed clearing and settlement facility_** is a clearing and settlement facility that a person has, before the FSR commencement, indicated an intention that they propose to operate.

             (2)  This Subdivision applies in relation to a proposed clearing and settlement facility to which this section applies subject to the following paragraphs:

                     (a)  subject to paragraphs (b), (c) and (d), this Subdivision applies in relation to the proposed facility as if the facility, as proposed to be operated, were in fact being operated immediately before the FSR commencement;

                     (b)  if, taking account of the effect of paragraph (a), section 1425 applies in relation to the proposed facility, that section applies in relation to the proposed facility:

                              (i)  as if the Minister’s obligation to grant a licence, and impose conditions, under subsection 1425(2) in relation to the proposed facility does not arise unless and until the facility operator lodges with ASIC a notice in relation to the facility under subsection (3) of this section, and does not arise at all if no such notice is given to ASIC by the end of 6 months after the FSR commencement; and

                             (ii)  as if subsection 1425(3) provided for a licence so granted under subsection 1425(2) in relation to the facility, and the conditions subject to which it is granted, to be taken to have had effect from the day (the **_start day_**) specified in the subsection (3) notice as the day on which the facility started to operate; and

                            (iii)  as if subsection 1425(6) were omitted; and

                            (iv)  as if the references in subsection 1425(8) to the FSR commencement were instead references to the start day;

                     (c)  if:

                              (i)  taking account of the effect of paragraph (a), section 1429 applies to the proposed facility; and

                             (ii)  the facility operator does not lodge with ASIC a notice in relation to the facility under subsection (3) of this section by the end of 6 months after the FSR commencement;

                            that section ceases to apply in relation to the proposed facility at the end of that period;

                     (d)  if a provision of this Subdivision provides for a provision of the old Corporations Act to continue to apply in relation to the proposed facility, then (without limiting the generality of subsection 1410(3)), while the proposed facility remains non-operational, the provision of the old Corporations Act only applies in relation to the proposed facility to the extent (if any) to which it would, disregarding the effect of paragraph (a), apply in relation to the proposed facility.

             (3)  If a proposed clearing and settlement facility to which this section applies starts to operate on a day during the period of 6 months starting on the FSR commencement, the operator must, as soon as practicable, and in any event within 7 days, lodge with ASIC written notice of the fact that the facility started to operate on that day.

Note:          Failure to comply with this subsection is an offence (see subsection 1311(1)).

             (4)  ASIC must, within a reasonable time, give the Minister a notice it receives under subsection (3).

##### <a id="1424A"></a>1424A  Treatment of unregulated clearing and settlement facilities operated by holders of old Corporations Act approvals

             (1)  This section applies in relation to a clearing and settlement facility if:

                     (a)  the facility was being operated immediately before the FSR commencement by a body corporate in relation to which an approval under section 1131 of the old Corporations Act was in force at that time; but

                     (b)  the services provided by the facility as so operated were not such that section 1128 of the old Corporations Act required the operator to be so approved.

             (2)  In this section:

                     (a)  a reference to the **_unregulated services_** is a reference to the services referred to in paragraph (1)(b); and

                     (b)  a reference to **_regulated services_** is a reference to services that, if they had been provided by the facility immediately before the commencement, would have been services to which section 1128 of the old Corporations Act applied.

             (3)  For the purposes of section 1425 (as it operates of its own force, rather than because of section 1424), the facility is not to be regarded as a facility that was being operated immediately before the FSR commencement.

             (4)  If the operator has, before the FSR commencement, indicated an intention that they propose to extend the services provided by the facility so that they also cover regulated services:

                     (a)  regulations made for the purposes of subsection 1424(1) may identify the facility as a proposed clearing and settlement facility, but only in relation to those regulated services; and

                     (b)  if they do so, section 1424, and section 1425 as it applies because of section 1424, apply in relation to the facility and those regulated services as if the facility did not already provide the unregulated services.

##### <a id="1425"></a>1425  Obligation of Minister to grant licences covering main existing facilities

             (1)  This section applies to each clearing and settlement facility being operated immediately before the FSR commencement in relation to which either of the following paragraphs applies:

                     (a)  the facility was being operated by the body corporate that was, for the purposes of the old Corporations Act, the securities clearing house;

                     (b)  the facility was being operated by a body corporate in relation to which an approval (the **_section 1131 approval_**) under section 1131 of the old Corporations Act was in force at that time.

             (2)  Subject to subsections (3) and (4), the Minister must, in relation to each clearing and settlement facility to which this section applies, grant the operator of the facility a licence, and impose conditions on that licence, in accordance with the following requirements:

                     (a)  the licence must be described as an Australian CS facility licence;

                     (b)  the licence must be granted subject to the following conditions:

                              (i)  a condition specifying the facility as the facility that the licence authorises the licensee to operate;

                             (ii)  a condition specifying, as the classes of financial products in respect of which the facility can provide services, the classes that are appropriate for the facility under subsection (5);

                            (iii)  in the case of a facility to which paragraph (1)(b) applies—a condition to the effect that the licence only covers the facility providing services for the market or markets that were covered by the section 1131 approval.

             (3)  Subject to subsection (6), a licence that subsection (2) requires to be granted must be granted on, or as soon as practicable after, the FSR commencement. If it is granted after the FSR commencement, it, and the conditions subject to which it is granted, are taken to have had effect from that commencement.

             (4)  Sections 824D (more than one licence in the same document) and 824E (more than one CS facility covered by the same licence) of the amended Corporations Act apply in relation to the granting of licences, and licences granted, under this section as if the licences were, or were being, granted under section 824B of that Act. If, pursuant to section 824E, a single licence is granted under this section in respect of several separate facilities, paragraph (2)(b) of this section must be complied with separately in the licence document in relation to each of those facilities.

             (5)  For the purposes of subparagraph (2)(b)(ii), the classes of financial products that are **_appropriate_** for a facility to which this section applies are as follows:

                     (a)  for a facility described in paragraph (1)(a)—securities, within the meaning of section 92 of the old Corporations Act as applying for the purposes of Part 7.2 of the old Corporations Act, and agreements of a kind to which section 92A of the old Corporations Act applied immediately before the FSR commencement (or would have applied after the FSR commencement if that section, and any associated provisions, had continued to have effect);

                     (b)  for a facility described in paragraph (1)(b)—futures contracts, within the meaning of section 72 of the old Corporations Act, and agreements of a kind to which section 72A of the old Corporations Act applied immediately before the FSR commencement (or would have applied after the FSR commencement if that section, and any associated provisions, had continued to have effect).

             (6)  Despite anything in subsection (3), the Minister may, under this section, grant a licence, and impose conditions on the licence, at any time during the period starting on the commencement of this section and ending on the FSR commencement on the basis that matters known to the Minister in relation to the clearing and settlement facility concerned will continue to be the case up to the FSR commencement. If the Minister does so:

                     (a)  the licence and conditions come into effect on the FSR commencement, and not before; and

                     (b)  the Minister may vary or revoke the licence, or any of the conditions, before the FSR commencement if the Minister considers it appropriate to do so having regard to the provisions of this section concerning the granting of licences and the imposition of conditions; and

                     (c)  the licence and conditions do not come into effect on the FSR commencement if, immediately before the FSR commencement, the facility is not a clearing and settlement facility to which this section applies.

             (7)  If the Minister grants a licence under this section, the Minister must give the operator of the clearing and settlement facility written notice of:

                     (a)  the grant of the licence, and the conditions imposed on the licence; and

                     (b)  any subsequent revocation or variation under subsection (6) of the licence or conditions.

             (8)  A notice advising of the grant of a licence under this section must contain a statement to the effect that the licence and conditions will not take effect until the FSR commencement, or will be taken to have had effect from the FSR commencement, as the case requires.

##### <a id="1426"></a>1426  Section 1425 facilities—effect of licences and conditions

             (1)  Subject to subsections (2) to (4):

                     (a)  a licence granted under section 1425 that authorises the operation of a facility is, for the purposes of the amended Corporations Act (other than this section), taken to have been granted (and to have been properly granted) under section 824B of the amended Corporations Act; and

                     (b)  conditions imposed under section 1425 on the licence are, for the purposes of the amended Corporations Act (other than this section), taken to have been imposed (and to have been properly imposed) under section 825A of the amended Corporations Act.

Note 1:       Section 824C of the amended Corporations Act (publication of notice of licence grant) applies to the grant of the licence.

Note 2:       The conditions may be varied or revoked, and additional conditions may be imposed, under section 825A of the amended Corporations Act.

             (2)  Section 822A of the amended Corporations Act does not apply in relation to the facility during the period (the **_transition period_**) starting on the FSR commencement and ending on whichever of the following first occurs:

                     (a)  the end of the period of 2 years starting on the FSR commencement;

                     (b)  the licensee applies, under subsection 825A(2) of the amended Corporations Act, to have the conditions on the licence varied or revoked, or to have additional conditions imposed on the licence.

             (3)  The annual report of the licensee (see section 821E of the amended Corporations Act) for a financial year in which part of the transition period occurs, other than a financial year in which the transition period ends, must include information about:

                     (a)  the steps taken in the year; and

                     (b)  the steps proposed to be taken in the next year;

to ensure that section 822A of the amended Corporations Act will be complied with by the time the transition period ends.

##### <a id="1427"></a>1427  Section 1425 facilities—powers for regulations to change how the old and new Corporations Act apply during the transition period

                     (a)  provide that section 822A of the amended Corporations Act, and any associated provisions, apply in relation to the facility during some or all the transition period for the facility;

                     (b)  provide that specified provisions of the amended Corporations Act (including section 822A), and any associated provisions, apply in relation to the facility during some or all of the transition period for the facility with specified modifications.

             (2)  Regulations made for the purposes of subsection (1) have effect despite anything in section 1426.

                     (b)  the conditions on the licence specify, as the classes of financial products in respect of which the facility can provide services, the classes of financial products specified in whichever of paragraphs 1425(5)(a) and (b) is applicable; and

                     (c)  the facility also, immediately before the commencement, provided services in respect of one or more other classes of financial products (the **_additional products_**) and the fact that it did so did not constitute a contravention of a provision of the old Corporations Act.

             (2)  Subject to subsection (3), section 820A of the amended Corporations Act does not apply in relation to the facility in so far as it provides services in respect of all or any of the additional products during the period (the **_transition period_**) starting on the FSR commencement and ending on whichever of the following first occurs:

                     (a)  the end of the period of 2 years starting on the FSR commencement;

                     (b)  the licensee applies, under subsection 825A(2) of the amended Corporations Act, to have the conditions on the licence varied or revoked, or to have additional conditions imposed on the licence.

             (3)  The regulations may provide that specified provisions of the amended Corporations Act (including section 820A), and any associated provisions, apply in relation to a clearing and settlement facility to which this section applies, and its provision of services in respect of all or any of the additional products, during some or all of the transition period for the facility and the products with specified modifications.

             (2)  Item 10 of the table in subsection (1) does not apply to a person and activities they carry on to the extent that the person’s carrying on of any of those activities is in contravention of any of the provisions of the relevant old legislation for any of the other categories of regulated principals.

             (3)  If a person is a regulated principal of 2 or more different kinds, this Subdivision applies separately in relation to the person in their capacity as a regulated principal of each of those kinds.

Note:          This may result (depending on what action the regulated principal takes) in a regulated principal having to comply with the relevant new legislation (within the meaning of subsection 1431(1)) in respect of their activities as a regulated principal of one kind, but, at the same time, having to comply with the relevant old legislation in respect of their activities as a regulated principal of another kind.

##### <a id="1431"></a>1431  Parts 7.6, 7.7 and 7.8 of the amended Corporations Act generally do not apply to a regulated principal during the transition period

             (1)  Subject to subsections (2) and (3), Parts 7.6 (other than Subdivisions A and B of Division 4, and Division 5), 7.7 and 7.8 (other than section 992A) of the amended Corporations Act (the **_relevant new legislation_**) do not apply to a regulated principal and their regulated activities during the period (the **_transition period_**) starting on the FSR commencement and ending when the first of the following events occurs:

                     (a)  the period of 2 years starting on the FSR commencement ends;

                     (b)  the regulated principal is granted a licence under section 913B of the amended Corporations Act that covers their regulated activities;

                     (c)  the regulated principal starts to be covered by an exemption under subsection 911A(2) of the amended Corporations Act (or would start to be so covered if that subsection applied) in respect of their regulated activities;

                     (d)  the regulated principal ceases (for whatever reason) to have the status that made them a regulated principal.

For the purposes of paragraph (d), **_having a status_** includes holding a licence, registration, approval or other similar thing, or carrying on particular activities.

Note 1:       Because of section 1441, a regulated principal whose transition period has not ended (and so who is not required to comply with the relevant new legislation) may nonetheless be required to comply with obligations under Part 7.9 of the amended Corporations Act.

Note 2:       For the treatment of representatives, see section 1436.

             (2)  Division 5 of Part 7.6 of the amended Corporations Act has effect in relation to a regulated principal during the transition period subject to the following paragraphs:

                     (a)  the regulated principal may give and revoke authorisations under section 916A or consents under subsection 916B(3) as if the regulated principal were a financial services licensee, however, for the purposes of the provisions of the amended Corporations Act outside that Division, such an authorisation or consent is taken not to have effect unless and until the regulated principal is granted a licence under section 913B of the amended Corporations Act that covers the activities to which the authorisation or consent relates (whether or not it also covers other activities);

                     (b)  a person authorised by a section 916A authorisation so made by the regulated principal may give and revoke authorisations under subsection 916B(3) as if they were an authorised representative and the regulated principal were the authorising financial services licensee, however, for the purposes of the provisions of the amended Corporations Act outside that Division, such an authorisation is taken not to have effect unless and until the regulated principal is granted a licence under section 913B of the amended Corporations Act that covers the activities to which the authorisation relates (whether or not it also covers other activities);

                     (c)  the regulated principal may give and revoke consents under section 916C as if they were a financial service licensee, however, any such consent does not take effect unless and until the regulated principal is granted a licence under section 913B of the amended Corporations Act;

                     (d)  section 916F applies in relation to an authorisation so made by the regulated principal during the transition period as if the period of 10 business days referred to in that section did not start unless and until the regulated principal is granted a licence under section 913B of the amended Corporations Act that covers the activities to which the authorisation relates (whether or not it also covers other activities), and section 916F does not apply at all in relation to revocations so made during the transition period.

             (3)  If, before paragraph (1)(a) or (d) occurs:

                     (a)  the regulated principal is granted a licence under section 913B of the amended Corporations Act that covers some only (the **_relevant part_**) of their regulated activities; or

                     (b)  the regulated principal starts to be covered by an exemption under subsection 911A(2) of the amended Corporations Act in respect of some only (the **_relevant part_**) of their regulated activities;

the relevant new legislation starts applying, from that time, to the relevant part of the regulated principal’s regulated activities, and subsection (1) continues to apply to the person as if the regulated principal’s regulated activities did not include the relevant part.

             (4)  Subsection (3) has effect subject to subsection 1430(3).

##### <a id="1432"></a>1432  Continued application of relevant old legislation

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), during the transition period for a regulated principal, the relevant old legislation (if any) continues to apply, despite its repeal:

                     (a)  to, and in relation to, the regulated principal and their regulated activities; and

                     (b)  to any other person to whom it is expressed to apply, but only in relation to matters related to the regulated principal and their regulated activities.

Note:          So, for example, people may continue to be appointed as agents or representatives of the regulated principal (or to have those appointments varied or revoked) during the transition period under provisions of the relevant old legislation that deal with such matters.

             (2)  If, because of subsection 1431(2), the relevant new legislation (within the meaning of subsection 1431(1)) starts to apply to part of a person’s regulated activities from a particular time, the relevant old legislation (if any) stops applying, from that time, in relation to that part of those activities.

##### <a id="1433"></a>1433  Streamlined licensing procedure for certain regulated principals

             (1)  This section applies to the following regulated principals:

                     (a)  a regulated principal of a kind referred to in any of items 1 to 5 of the table in subsection 1430(1), but not including anyone who is:

                              (i)  an exempted participant for the purposes of section 1419; or

                             (ii)  in a class of persons specified in, or identified in accordance with, regulations made for the purposes of subsection (3);

                     (b)  a regulated principal of a kind referred to in item 9 of that table who:

                              (i)  is in a class of persons specified in regulations made for the purposes of this subparagraph; and

                             (ii)  is not in a class of persons specified in, or identified in accordance with, regulations made for the purposes of subsection (3).

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  a regulated principal to whom this section applies, before the end of their transition period, applies (in accordance with section 913A of the amended Corporations Act) for a licence covering some or all of their regulated activities (but no other activities); and

                     (b)  their application includes a statement (in accordance with the requirements of the application form) to the effect that they will, if granted the licence, comply with their obligations as a financial services licensee;

the following provisions apply:

                     (c)  section 913B of the amended Corporations Act applies to their application as if paragraphs 913B(1)(b), (c), (ca) and (d), and subsections 913B(2) to (5), were omitted; and

                     (d)  the licence condition required by subsection 914A(6) of the amended Corporations Act in relation to a licence granted pursuant to their application must specify, as the financial services that the licensee is authorised to provide, financial services that equate (as closely as possible) to the regulated activities in respect of which the application was made.

Note 1:       Paragraph (c) does not limit the matters that can be taken into account under section 915C (suspension or cancellation after offering a hearing) in relation to a licence that has been granted under section 913B as it applies because of this section.

Note 2:       The condition referred to in paragraph (d), as with any other conditions imposed on the licence under section 914A of the amended Corporations Act, is subject to variation or revocation in accordance with that section.

             (3)  The regulations may identify classes of persons, or provide for the identification of classes of persons, who are not to be covered by this section.

##### <a id="1434"></a>1434  Special licences for insurance multi-agents during first 2 years after FSR commencement

             (1)  For the purposes of this section, a person is an **_insurance multi-agent_** at a particular time if, at that time:

                     (a)  the person is an insurance intermediary (but not an insurance broker), within the meaning of the _Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984_ as then in force; and

                     (b)  the person has agreements with 2 or more different insurers under section 10 of that Act.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  a person who, immediately before the FSR commencement, is an insurance multi-agent applies in accordance with section 913A of the amended Corporations Act for a licence, during the period of 2 years starting on the FSR commencement; and

                     (b)  the application is lodged at a time:

                              (i)  when the person is still carrying on activities as agent for one or more of the insurers with whom, immediately before the FSR commencement, they had agreements as mentioned in paragraph (1)(b); or

                             (ii)  that is not more than 6 months after the person ceased to so carry on activities as agent for any of those insurers; and

                     (c)  their application includes a statement (in accordance with the requirements of the application form) to the effect that they want this section to apply to their application;

the following provisions apply:

                     (d)  section 913B of the amended Corporations Act applies to their application as if the reference in paragraph 913B(1)(b) to section 912A did not include the obligations under paragraphs 912A(e) and (f);

                     (e)  the licence condition required by subsection 914A(6) of the amended Corporations Act in relation to a licence granted pursuant to their application must specify, as the financial services that the licensee is authorised to provide:

                              (i)  providing financial product advice in relation to risk insurance products and investment life insurance products; and

                             (ii)  dealing in risk insurance products and investment life insurance products.

             (3)  If the application is granted, then:

                     (a)  while the licence remains in force:

                              (i)  paragraphs 912A(e) and (f) of the amended Corporations Act do not apply to the licensee and the financial services covered by the licence; and

                             (ii)  sections 942B and 942C apply in relation to any Financial Services Guide provided by the licensee or an authorised representative of the licensee as if they included a requirement to include in the Guide a statement that the licensee is not bound by the obligations in paragraphs 912A(e) and (f) and that sets out what those obligations are; and

                     (b)  the licence conditions cannot be varied so that the licence covers the licensee providing financial services other than those referred to in paragraph (2)(e); and

                     (c)  the licence ceases to be in force (unless earlier revoked) at the end of the period of 2 years starting on the FSR commencement.

##### <a id="1435"></a>1435  Licensing decisions made within the first 2 years of the FSR commencement—regard may be had to conduct and experience of applicant or related body corporate that currently provides same or similar services

             (1)  This section applies:

                     (a)  if a person applies, during the period of 2 years starting on the FSR commencement, under section 913A of the amended Corporations Act for the grant of a licence covering the provision of particular financial services (the **_relevant financial services_**); and

                     (b)  ASIC is aware that:

                              (i)  the applicant; or

                             (ii)  if the applicant is a body corporate—a related body corporate of the applicant;

                            is currently (as at the time the application is being considered by ASIC) providing services that are the same as, or similar to, all or any of the relevant financial services.

             (2)  In considering the matters it is required by section 913B of the amended Corporations Act to consider in deciding whether to grant the licence, ASIC may (but is not required to) have regard to the conduct and experience (including conduct and experience before the FSR commencement) of the applicant, or the related body corporate, in providing services that are the same as, or similar to, all or any of the relevant financial services (so far as ASIC is aware of such conduct and experience).

             (3)  Subsection (2) is not intended to limit, by implication, the matters that ASIC can take into account under section 913B of the amended Corporations Act when considering whether to grant a licence under that section (whether pursuant to an application to which this section applies or otherwise).

##### <a id="1436"></a>1436  Treatment of representatives—general

             (1)  This section applies to a person who is a representative of a regulated principal. For this purpose, a **_representative_** includes, but is not limited to:

                     (a)  an agent (however described) of the regulated principal; and

                     (b)  an employee or director of the regulated principal; and

                     (c)  any other person who, in accordance with the regulated principal’s relevant old legislation as it continues to have effect in relation to the regulated principal, is authorised to carry on activities for or on behalf of the regulated principal.

          (1A)  However, if a person who, under subsection (1), would be the representative of another person is a financial services licensee in their own right, the licensee, when engaged in activities covered by their licence, is taken not to be acting as representative of that other person.

             (2)  The following provisions apply in relation to a person who is a representative of a regulated principal:

                     (a)  during any period when, because of section 1431, the relevant new legislation (within the meaning of subsection 1431(1)) does not apply to the regulated principal and particular regulated activities, the relevant new legislation also does not apply to the representative when they are acting as a representative of the regulated principal in relation to any of those activities;

                     (b)  during any period when, because of section 1432, relevant old legislation continues to apply to the regulated principal and particular regulated activities, that legislation also continues to apply to the representative when they are acting as a representative of the regulated principal in relation to any of those activities.

Note 1:       If a person is a representative of 2 persons, this may result in the person having to comply with the relevant new legislation in respect of what they do as a representative of one of those persons but, at the same time, having to comply with relevant old legislation in respect of what they do as a representative of the other of those persons.

Note 2:       If a person is a representative of another person who carries on 2 different sets of activities, being sets of activities in relation to which there are separate applications of this Subdivision because of subsection 1430(3), this may result in the person having to comply with the relevant new legislation in respect of what they do in relation to one of those sets of activities but, at the same time, having to comply with relevant old legislation in respect of what they do in relation to the other set of activities.

Note 3:       Because of section 1441, a representative who is not required to comply with the relevant new legislation may nonetheless be required to comply with obligations under Part 7.9 of the amended Corporations Act.

##### <a id="1436A"></a>1436A  Treatment of representatives—insurance agents

             (1)  This section has effect despite anything else in this Subdivision, including sections 1436 and 1437.

             (2)  This section applies if, immediately before the FSR commencement, a person is an insurance intermediary (but not an insurance broker) within the meaning of the _Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984_ as then in force because of an agreement they have with an insurer under section 10 of that Act. For the purposes of this section:

                     (a)  the person is the **_insurance agent_**; and

                     (b)  the agreement is the **_authorising agreement_**; and

                     (c)  the matters dealt with in the provisions included in the agreement in compliance with section 10 of that Act, and any other matters included in the agreement that are related to those matters, are the **_relevant matters_**; and

                     (d)  the insurer is the **_principal_**.

If, immediately before the FSR commencement, the person has more than one such agreement, this section applies separately in relation to each of those agreements.

             (3)  For the purposes of this section, the **_transition period_** is the period starting on the FSR commencement and ending when the first of the following events occurs:

                     (a)  the period of 2 years starting on the FSR commencement ends;

                     (b)  the authorising agreement ceases to be in force;

                     (c)  the insurance agent has lodged with ASIC notice in writing that the agent no longer wants to be covered by the _Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984_:

                              (i)  from a specified date, being a date that is after the notice is given to ASIC; or

                             (ii)  from the end of a specified period, being a period that ends after the notice is given to ASIC;

                            and that date arrives or period ends;

                     (d)  the insurance agent is granted a licence under section 913B (including as it has effect because of section 1434) of the amended Corporations Act that covers the insurance agent engaging in (as licensee) the range of activities that they previously engaged in as agent under the authorising agreement.

             (4)  A notice (the **_original notice_**) given for the purposes of paragraph (3)(c) may before the date, or the end of the period, specified in the original notice as mentioned in that paragraph:

                     (a)  be varied to specify another date or period, being a date or period that would satisfy the requirements of subparagraph (3)(c)(i) or (ii) if the reference in that subparagraph to when the notice (being the original notice) is given to ASIC were instead a reference to when the notice of variation is given to ASIC under this subsection; or

                     (b)  be revoked.

The variation or revocation must be made by notice in writing lodged with ASIC.

             (5)  Subject to subsection (7), during the transition period, the _Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984_ as in force immediately before the FSR commencement, and any associated provisions, (the **_relevant old legislation_**) continue to apply (despite the repeal of that Act) to, and in relation to, the insurance agent, the principal and the relevant matters.

             (6)  Subject to subsection (7), during the transition period, the relevant new legislation (within the meaning of section 1431) does not apply to, or in relation to, the insurance agent, the principal and the relevant matters.

             (7)  Regulations made for the purposes of this subsection may do either or both of the following:

                     (a)  provide that specified provisions of the relevant old legislation apply (with or without specified modifications), or do not apply, to the insurance agent, the principal and some or all of the relevant matters;

                     (b)  provide that specified provisions of the relevant new legislation apply (with or without specified modifications), or do not apply, to the insurance agent, the principal and some or all of the relevant matters.

The regulations may provide as mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b) even after the end of the transition period.

             (8)  If:

                     (a)  before the end of the transition period, or such longer period during which regulations made for the purposes of subsection (7) provide for the application of some or all of the relevant old legislation, the insurance agent engages in conduct that, under the authorising agreement as then in force, creates a right to brokerage, commission or other remuneration (which may be a present right, or a future right that is dependent on matters specified in the authorising agreement); and

                     (b)  that right is still in existence immediately before the end of that period;

the right is not taken to be brought to an end merely because of the repeal of the relevant old legislation or the enactment of the relevant new legislation, or because under this section the relevant old legislation ceases to apply and the relevant new legislation starts to apply.

             (9)  Subsection (8) is not intended to affect, in any way, the determination of the question whether any other right (whether or not it is under an agreement under section 10 of the _Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984_) is in any way affected by the provisions of the _Financial Services Reform Act 2001_ or the _Financial Services Reform (Consequential Provisions) Act 2001_(including the amendments made by those Acts).

##### <a id="1437"></a>1437  Exemptions and modifications by ASIC

             (1)  This section applies to the following provisions:

                     (a)  the provisions of this Subdivision (other than section 1436A) and any associated provisions;

                     (b)  the provisions of legislation that continues to apply because of subsection 1432(1) or 1436(3).

             (2)  ASIC may, subject to subsection (3):

                     (a)  exempt a person or a class of persons from some or all of the provisions to which this section applies; or

                     (b)  declare that some or all of the provisions to which this section applies apply in relation to a person or a class of persons as if the provisions were modified or varied as specified in the declaration.

#### Subdivision E—Product disclosure requirements

##### <a id="1438"></a>1438  New product disclosure provisions do not apply to existing products during transition period

             (1)  This section applies to all financial products issued by a person, other than financial products in a class of products that are first issued by the person after the FSR commencement.

             (2)  For the purposes of this section, the **_new product disclosure provisions_** in relation to a financial product to which this section applies are the provisions of Part 7.9 of the amended Corporations Act that, apart from this section, would apply in relation to the financial product (whether those provisions apply to the issuer of the product or to another person or persons), other than the following provisions:

                     (a)  section 1017C (information for existing holders of superannuation products and RSA products);

                     (b)  section 1017DA (trustees of superannuation entities—regulations may specify additional obligations to provide information), and regulations made for the purposes of that section;

                     (c)  section 1017E (dealing with money received for financial product before the product is issued);

                     (d)  section 1017F (confirming transactions);

             (3)  Subject to subsection (4), the new product disclosure provisions do not apply in relation to a financial product to which this section applies during the period (the **_transition period_**) starting on the FSR commencement and ending on whichever of the following first occurs:

                     (a)  the end of the period of 2 years starting on the FSR commencement;

                     (b)  the date specified in a notice lodged with ASIC by the issuer of the product that relates to the product, or a class of financial products that includes the product, and that satisfies the following requirements:

                             (ii)  the date specified in the notice is the FSR commencement or a later date;

                            (iii)  the date specified in the notice is at least 28 days after the notice is lodged with ASIC.

Note 2:       Subject to Division 2, the provisions covered by paragraphs (2)(a) to (f) apply from the FSR commencement in relation to all financial products to which they purport to apply.

             (4)  If the date specified in a notice lodged with ASIC in accordance with paragraph (3)(b) is the FSR commencement, there is no transition period in relation to the financial product or products to which the notice relates.

             (5)  A notice (the **_first notice_**) lodged with ASIC in accordance with paragraph (3)(b):

                     (a)  may, by a further notice lodged with ASIC, be varied to specify a different date (the **_new date_**), but only if:

                              (i)  that further notice is lodged with ASIC at least 28 days before the date specified in the first notice; and

                             (ii)  the new date is at least 28 days after that further notice is lodged with ASIC; and

                     (b)  may, by a further notice lodged with ASIC, be revoked, but only if that further notice is lodged with ASIC at least 28 days before the date specified in the first notice.

A date that was specified in a notice before its variation or revocation in accordance with this subsection is to be disregarded for the purposes of the other provisions of this section.

             (6)  If the issuer of a financial product lodges a notice with ASIC in accordance with paragraph (3)(b) that covers the product, the issuer must comply with any applicable requirements determined in writing by ASIC for the purposes of this subsection in relation to the following matters:

                     (a)  informing people about the notice and its significance; and

                     (b)  informing people about any subsequent variation or revocation of the notice.

             (7)  A determination by ASIC for the purposes of subsection (6):

                     (a)  is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_; and

                     (b)  may cover all financial products or one or more classes of financial products; and

                     (c)  may make different provision in relation to different classes of financial products.

about notices that have been lodged in accordance with paragraph (3)(b). The information must be updated to take account of variations and revocations of such notices.

                     (b)  the new product disclosure provisions started to apply in relation to the product from the date specified in the notice;

the conduct constitutes an offence against that provision only if (in addition to the other elements of the offence), either:

                     (d)  the person did not know that, and was not reckless as to whether, the product issuer had lodged a notice under that paragraph that specified that date, but the conduct would have contravened the provisions referred to in section 1440 that would have applied to and in relation to the product if those provisions had still applied when the conduct occurred.

                    <a name="conduct"></a>**_conduct_** means an act, an omission to perform an act or a state of affairs.

             (2)  Regulations made for the purposes of this section are of no effect to the extent that they are inconsistent with:

                     (b)  may provide for a determination of a kind referred to in subsection (5) to take effect from a date before the determination is made (including a date before the regulations are notified in the _Gazette_).

             (7)  If a relevant amendment does not commence on the FSR commencement, this section applies in relation to that amendment as if references in the other provisions of this section, and in the definitions in section 1443, to “the FSR commencement” were instead references to the commencement of the relevant amendment.

             (1)  ASIC may, by determination in writing, deal with matters of a transitional, saving or application nature relating to the relevant amendments and the transition from the application of the old legislation to the application of the new legislation. Determinations for this purpose may make such provision as is necessary to take account of the fact that, because of Division 1, different provisions of the amended Corporations Act start applying (and different provisions of the old legislation stop applying) in relation to different people, things and matters at different times.

                            (iii)  a combination of provisions referred to in subparagraphs (i) and (ii);

                     (b)  by otherwise specifying rules for dealing with the matter;

                     (c)  by specifying a particular consequence of the matter, or of an outcome of the matter, for the purposes of a law of the Commonwealth.

             (5)  Without limiting subsections (1) and (4), a determination may provide for the continued effect after the FSR commencement, for the purposes of the new legislation, of a thing done or instrument made, or a class of things done or instruments made, before the FSR commencement, under or for the purposes of the old legislation. In the case of an instrument, or class of instruments, a determination may (either when providing for the continued effect of the instrument or instruments or at a later time) provide for the instrument or instruments, as continuing to have effect, to have effect subject to modifications.

             (6)  Without limiting subsection (5), a determination for the purposes of that subsection may permit all or any of the following matters to be determined in writing by a specified person, or by a person included in a specified class of persons:
