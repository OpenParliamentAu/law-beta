##### <a id="53A"></a>53A  Delegation by Secretary: references to the Secretary and the Department

             (1)  If the Secretary delegates to the CEO or an employee of the Agency a power under this Act to require a person to produce or give to the Department any document or information, the delegate may, in exercising the power, require the person to produce or give the document or information to the Agency instead of the Department.

             (2)  A person who produces or gives a document or information to the Agency in compliance with a requirement by a delegate of the Secretary is to be treated for all purposes as if the person had produced or given the document to the Department in compliance with a requirement by the Secretary.

                     (b)  the delegation makes a reference to the Secretary or the Department in another provision of this Act inappropriate, whether for administrative reasons or any other reason;

the Secretary may direct that the provision is to have effect as if:

                     (c)  the reference to the Secretary were a reference to the CEO; or

                     (d)  a reference to the Department were a reference to the Agency;

as the case requires.

             (5)  If the Secretary gives a direction in relation to a provision, the provision has effect in accordance with the direction while the direction is in force.

             (6)  A direction comes into force on the day it is notified in the _Gazette_, or on such later day as is specified in it, and remains in force until it is revoked.

             (7)  A direction is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_. 

             (8)  In this section:

             (1)  The Secretary may require a person to give information, or produce a document that is in the person’s custody or under the person’s control, to the Department if the Secretary considers that the information or document may be relevant to:

                     (a)  the question whether a person who has made a claim for farm household support, exceptional circumstances relief payment or farm help income support under this Act is or was qualified for the support or the payment, as the case requires; or

                     (b)  the question whether farm household support, exceptional circumstances relief payment or farm help income support under this Act is payable to a person who is receiving it; or

                     (c)  the question whether farm household support, exceptional circumstances relief payment or farm help income support under this Act was payable to a person who has received it; or

                     (d)  the maximum fortnightly rate or applicable rate, at any time, in relation to a person to whom farm household support is, or was, payable; or 

                     (e)  the rate at which exceptional circumstances relief payment is, or was, payable; or

                      (f)  the rate at which farm help income support is, or was, payable; or

             (2)  A requirement under subsection (1) must be by notice in writing given to the person.

             (3)  The notice must specify:

                     (a)  how the person is to give the information or how the document is to be produced; and

                     (b)  the period within which the person is to give the information, or produce the document, to the Department; and

             (7)  A person must not refuse or fail to comply with a notice under this section.

                    Penalty:  Imprisonment for 6 months.

Note 1:       Subsection 4B(2) of the _Crimes Act 1914_ allows a court that convicts an individual of an offence to impose a fine instead of, or in addition to, a term of imprisonment. The maximum fine that a court can impose on the individual is worked out by multiplying the maximum term of imprisonment (in months) by 5, and then multiplying the resulting number by the amount of a penalty unit. The amount of a penalty unit is stated in section 4AA of that Act.

Note 2:       If a body corporate is convicted of the offence, subsection 4B(3) of the _Crimes Act 1914_ allows a court to impose a maximum fine of an amount that is 5 times the maximum fine that could be imposed on an individual convicted of the same offence.

          (7A)  Subsection (7) does not apply if the person has a reasonable excuse.

Note:          The defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in subsection (7A). See subsection 13.3(3) of the _Criminal Code_.

          (7B)  An offence under subsection (7) is an offence of strict liability.

Note:          For strict liability, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

             (9)  This section binds the Crown in right of the Commonwealth, of each of the States, of the Australian Capital Territory, of the Northern Territory and of Norfolk Island, but nothing in this section renders the Crown liable to be prosecuted for an offence.

           (10)  This section does not require a person to give information or produce a document to the extent that in doing so the person would contravene a law of the Commonwealth (other than a law of a Territory).

           (11)  This section extends to:

                     (a)  acts, omissions, matters and things outside Australia, whether or not in a foreign country; and

                     (b)  all persons, irrespective of their nationality, who are making or who have made a claim under this Act; and

                     (c)  all persons, irrespective of their nationality, who are receiving, or have received, a payment under this Act.

##### <a id="54A"></a>54A  Conversion of farm household support payments into grants

             (1)  The total amount of farm household support paid to a person by way of loan before the commencement of this section, to the extent that it had not already been repaid to the Commonwealth or converted into a grant before that commencement, is converted into a grant by force of this section.

             (2)  This section does not affect the operation of section 56.

##### <a id="55"></a>55  Farm household support, exceptional circumstances relief payment, dairy exit payments and farm help scheme payments to be inalienable

                     (b)  instalments of farm household support, exceptional circumstances relief payment or farm help income support (the **_relevant payment type_**) payable to the person are being paid to the credit of the account; and

                     (c)  a court order in the nature of a garnishee order comes into force in respect of the account;

the court order does not apply to the saved amount (if any) in the account.

             (2)  The saved amount is worked out as follows:

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.   Work out the total amount payable to the person in respect of the relevant payment type that has been paid to the credit of the account during the 4 week period immediately before the court order came into force.

Step 2.   Subtract from that amount the total amount withdrawn from the account during the same 4 week period: the result is the saved amount.

                     (c)  in the case of an amount purporting to be an amount of farm household support—the amount was part of payment made because the farm household support payable to the person in respect of that period was calculated at a rate that was higher than the applicable rate in respect of the person; or

                     (d)  in the case of an amount purporting to be an amount of exceptional circumstances relief payment—the amount was part of a payment made because the exceptional circumstances relief payment payable to the person in respect of that period was calculated at a rate higher than the rate at which it should have been calculated; or

                     (e)  in the case of an amount purporting to be an amount of farm help income support—the amount was part of a payment made because the farm help income support payable to the person in respect of that period was calculated at a rate higher than the rate at which it should have been calculated;

the amount so paid may be recovered by the Commonwealth as a debt due to the Commonwealth.

                     (c)  the excess amount (the **_paid amount_**) is greater than the excess amount (the **_payable amount_**) that would have been paid as, or as part of, the payment in respect of that period had the error not been made;

an amount equal to the difference between the paid amount and the payable amount may be recovered by the Commonwealth from the person as a debt due to the Commonwealth.

(8)       A debt that is recoverable under subitem (6) or (7) is, for the purposes of sections 1227A and 1231A of the _Social Security Act 1991_, taken to be a debt that is recoverable under section 56 of the Principal Act in respect of an amount of exceptional circumstances relief payment.

(9)       Subitems (6) and (7) do not, by implication, affect the recovery or set‑off of overpayments of exceptional circumstances relief payment under the Principal Act.

(10)     Despite subitems (2) and (3), if, before the commencing day, an amount was disregarded for the 2007‑08 financial year in a calculation that used a formula that is the same as that in subsection 24A(5) or (6) or subsection 24AA(6) or (8) of the Principal Act as amended by this Schedule, then the amount is to be treated, after the commencing day, as if it had been disregarded for that financial year under that subsection.

## 28  Ancillary benefits relating to the _Social Security Act 1991_ and the _Social Security (Administration) Act 1999_

(1)       If, before the commencing day, a thing (other than the payment of money) was done:

                     (a)  as if a pre‑commencement payment or an excess amount were exceptional circumstances relief payment under the Principal Act; and

                     (b)  as if either or both of the _Social Security Act 1991_ and the _Social Security (Administration) Act 1999_ operated in relation to the payment;

then the thing is, for all purposes, taken to be as valid, and always to have been as valid, as it would have been if the pre‑commencement payment or excess amount had been exceptional circumstances relief payment under the Principal Act as amended by this Schedule and the _Social Security Act 1991_ and the _Social Security (Administration) Act 1999_ had operated.

(2)       If an amount of money has been paid by the Commonwealth because a thing referred to in subitem (1) was done, the amount may be recovered by the Commonwealth from the person to whom the amount was paid as a debt due to the Commonwealth.

(3)       A person to whom an amount referred to in subitem (2) was paid is entitled, on the commencement of this item, to be paid by the Commonwealth an amount equal to the amount of the debt due to it by the person under subitem (2).

(4)       The Commonwealth may set‑off the amount of a debt due to it by a person under subitem (2) against an amount that is payable to that person under subitem (3).

(5)       The Commonwealth may set‑off classes of debt under subsection (4).
