##### <a id="1061EM"></a>1061EM  Qualification for special employment advance

             (1)  Subject to section 1061EO, a person is qualified for a special employment advance at a particular time (the **_relevant time_**) only if:

                     (a)  the person is qualified for a special employment advance qualifying entitlement at the relevant time; and

                     (b)  the person has been receiving an income support payment for a continuous period of 3 months immediately before the day on which the person’s application for the special employment advance is made; and

                     (c)  either of the following applies:

                              (i)  the person or, if the person is a member of a couple, the person’s partner has earned from casual work in Australia, but has not received, income (the **_unreceived income_**);

                             (ii)  the Secretary is satisfied that the person has received a definite offer of employment in Australia (the **_offered employment_**) for a period of not less than 6 weeks and needs financial assistance from the Commonwealth to enable him or her to take up the employment; and

                     (d)  subsection (2) or (3), as the case requires, applies for the purpose of determining whether the person is qualified for a special employment advance at the relevant time; and

                     (e)  where subparagraph (c)(i) applies—the person is in severe financial hardship; and

                      (f)  the Secretary is satisfied that the person will not suffer financial hardship as a result of the recovery by the Commonwealth of the special employment advance.

             (2)  This subsection applies for the purpose of determining whether a person is qualified for a special employment advance at the relevant time only where:

                     (a)  the person’s application for the advance was based on the effect of the unreceived income on the person’s special employment advance qualifying entitlement; and

                     (b)  the person is not a CDEP Scheme participant; and

                     (c)  either of the following subparagraphs applies:

                              (i)  if the person were qualified for the special employment qualifying entitlement on the next payday for the entitlement at a rate equal to the maximum basic rate of the entitlement, the rate of the entitlement on that payday would be reduced by at least 50% as a result of the person or the person’s partner having earned the unreceived income;

                             (ii)  subparagraph (i) does not apply in respect of the person but, if the person were qualified for the special employment qualifying entitlement on 2 or more paydays for the entitlement at a rate equal to the maximum basic rate of the entitlement, the average of the rates of the entitlement on those paydays would be reduced by at least 50% as a result of the person or the person’s partner having earned the unreceived income.

             (3)  This subsection applies for the purpose of determining whether a person is qualified for a special employment advance at the relevant time only where the person’s application for the advance was based on the person’s need for financial assistance from the Commonwealth to enable him or her to take up the offered employment and:

                     (a)  if the person were qualified for the special employment qualifying entitlement on each of the paydays for the entitlement that occur in the period of 6 weeks referred to in subparagraph (1)(c)(ii) at a rate equal to the maximum basic rate of the entitlement, the average of the rates of the entitlement on those paydays:

                              (i)  would be reduced by at least 50% as a result of the person having taken up the offered employment; or

                             (ii)  would be so reduced if Module J of the Youth Allowance Rate Calculator in section 1067G or Module E of the Austudy Payment Rate Calculator were disregarded; or

                     (b)  the person would cease to be qualified for the special employment advance qualification upon his or her taking up the offered employment.

             (1)  For the purposes of paragraph 1061EM(1)(e) as it applies to a person who makes a claim for special employment advance, the person is **_in severe financial hardship_** if:

                     (b)  where the person is a member of a couple—the value of the person’s liquid assets (within the meaning of subsection 14A(2)) is less than twice the fortnightly amount of the maximum payment rate of the special employment advance qualifying entitlement that is payable to the person.

             (2)  If the person referred to in subsection (1) is a CDEP Scheme participant, then, in determining for the purposes of that subsection the fortnightly amount of the maximum payment rate of the special employment advance qualifying entitlement payable to the person, the person’s maximum basic rate is taken to be the rate that would be that maximum basic rate if sections 408CG, 500W, 552C, 614A, 660YCH and 771HK had not been enacted.

             (2)  A special employment advance deduction may be made from a person’s rate on:

                     (a)  if the special employment advance is paid as a lump sum—the payday next following the day on which the lump sum is paid; or

                     (b)  if the special employment advance is paid by instalments—the payday next following the day on which the last instalment of the special employment advance is paid;

or on any later payday.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade now has the honour to propose the following amendment to the Agreement:

If the foregoing proposal is acceptable to the Government of New Zealand, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has the honour to propose that this Note and the New Zealand High Commission’s reply to that effect, shall constitute an Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of New Zealand which shall enter into force on the first day of September 1998 provided that prior to that date the Government of Australia and the Government of New Zealand have exchanged further notes through the diplomatic channel notifying each other that all other matters as are necessary to give effect to this Agreement have been finalised or if that notification has not been completed prior to 1 September 1998, on the first day of the second month after that notification has been completed.
