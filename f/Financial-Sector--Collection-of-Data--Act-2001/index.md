## An Act to provide for the collection of information from bodies in the financial sector, and for related purposes

## Part 1—Preliminary

##### <a id="1"></a>1  Short title [_see_ Note 1]

                   This Act may be cited as the _Financial Sector (Collection of Data) Act 2001_.

##### <a id="2"></a>2  Commencement [_see_ Note 1]

             (1)  Parts 1 and 5 commence on the day on which this Act receives the Royal Assent.

             (2)  Parts 2, 3 and 4 commence on a day to be fixed by Proclamation.

             (3)  If Parts 2, 3 and 4 do not commence under subsection (2) within the period of 12 months beginning on the day on which this Act receives the Royal Assent, those Parts commence on the first day after the end of that period.

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Object of Act

             (1)  The object of this Act is to enable the collection by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (**_APRA_**) of information to assist it in the prudential regulation of bodies in the financial sector and to facilitate the formulation by the Reserve Bank of monetary policy.

             (2)  In order to achieve that object, this Act:

                     (a)  provides for certain corporations to be registered, and divided into categories, by APRA; and

                     (b)  authorises APRA to determine reporting standards for corporations that are so registered and for certain other bodies that it regulates and to require them to provide APRA with information about their businesses and activities.

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Extension to external Territories

                   This Act extends to every external Territory.

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Entities covered by the Act

             (1)  This Act deals with financial sector entities.

             (2)  A **_financial sector entity_** is:

                     (a)  a registered entity; or

                     (b)  a regulated entity; or

                     (c)  a corporation to which section 5A applies.

             (3)  A **_registered entity_** is a corporation whose name is entered in the Register of Entities kept by APRA under section 8.

             (4)  A **_regulated entity_** is any of the following:

                     (a)  a body regulated by APRA (within the meaning of subsection 3(2) of the _Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998_);

                     (c)  a subsidiary of an ADI, or a subsidiary of an authorised NOHC, within the meaning of the _Banking Act 1959_.

##### <a id="5A"></a>5A  Medical indemnity entities

                   This section applies to a corporation at a particular time if:

                     (a)  the corporation is a financial corporation formed within the limits of Australia; and

                     (b)  an arrangement under which medical indemnity cover is provided for a health care professional was entered into before 1 July 2003; and

                     (c)  the arrangement was not effected by means of a contract of insurance; and

                     (d)  the corporation may pay, or may have to pay, an amount under the arrangement at some time after that time.

Expressions used in paragraph (b) have the same meaning as they have in the _Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Act 2003_.

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Application of _Criminal Code_

                   Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ applies to all offences against this Act.

Note:          Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.

## Part 2—Registration of corporations

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Registrable corporations

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), a corporation is a registrable corporation if, and only if, the corporation is a foreign corporation, a trading corporation formed within the limits of Australia or a financial corporation so formed and:

                     (a)  the sole or principal business activities in Australia of the corporation are the borrowing of money and the provision of finance; or

                     (b)  the sum of the values of such of the assets in Australia of the corporation as consist of debts due to the corporation, being debts resulting from transactions entered into in the course of the provision of finance by the corporation, exceeds:

                              (i)  50%; or

                             (ii)  if a greater or lesser percentage is prescribed by the regulations—the percentage so prescribed;

                            of the sum of the values of all the assets in Australia of the corporation; or

                     (c)  the corporation engages in the provision of finance in the course of carrying on in Australia a business (whether or not that business is its sole or principal business) of selling goods by retail and the sum of the values of such of the assets of the corporation and of any corporation that is related to the corporation as consist of debts due to the corporation concerned, being debts resulting from transactions entered into in the course of the provision of finance by that corporation, exceeds:

                              (i)  $25,000,000; or

                             (ii)  if a greater or lesser amount is prescribed by the regulations—the amount so prescribed.

             (2)  A corporation is not a registrable corporation if:

                     (a)  the corporation, not being a company, society or association, is established for a public purpose by a law of the Commonwealth, of a State or of a Territory; or

                     (b)  the corporation is an ADI for the purposes of the _Banking Act 1959_; or

                     (c)  the corporation is a benefit society registered under a law of a State or of a Territory providing for the registration of benefit societies; or

                     (d)  the corporation is a private health insurer within the meaning of the _Private Health Insurance Act 2007_; or

                     (e)  the corporation is registered under the _Life Insurance Act 1995_; or

                      (f)  the sole or principal business in   Australia of the corporation is insurance business within the meaning of the _Insurance Act 1973_; or

                     (g)  the corporation is authorised by a law of a State or of a Territory to act as an executor, administrator and trustee; or

                     (h)  the sole or principal purpose for which the corporation borrows money is to lend money to a corporation or corporations that, because of subsection 34(2) or (3), is not or are not to be taken to be related to the first-mentioned corporation but would, but for that subsection, be treated as being so related because of subsection 34(1); or

                      (i)  the sum of the values of all the assets of the corporation and of every corporation that is related to the corporation does not exceed:

                              (i)  $5,000,000; or

                             (ii)  if a greater or lesser amount is prescribed by the regulations—the amount so prescribed; or

                      (j)  APRA has, by order in writing published in such manner and form as APRA determines to be appropriate, exempted the corporation from the obligation to register under this Act.

             (3)  The reference in paragraph (2)(h) to the lending of money to a corporation does not include a reference to the provision of finance to the corporation by way of acquiring debts due to the corporation or of purchasing securities other than securities issued by the corporation.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Register of entities

             (1)  APRA must cause a Register of Entities to be kept for the purposes of this Act.

             (2)  APRA must ensure that the Register of Entities is available for inspection by any member of the public at an office of APRA during normal business hours.

             (3)  A person may:

                     (a)  inspect the Register of Entities; or

                     (b)  take an extract from, or make a copy of, that Register;

if the person pays the fee (if any) prescribed by the regulations.

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Obligations of corporations

             (1)  If, on the commencement of this Part, a registrable corporation is not a registered entity, the corporation must, before the end of 60 days after the date of commencement of this Part, give to APRA the documents mentioned in subsection (5).

                    Penalty:  50 penalty units.

Note:          If a corporation to which subsection (1) applies fails to give the documents to APRA before the end of the period specified in that subsection, the obligation to give them to APRA continues after the end of that period with daily offences being committed until the obligation is complied with (see section 4K of the _Crimes Act 1914_).

             (2)  If, after the commencement of this Part, a corporation becomes a registrable corporation, whether at the time of its incorporation or at a later time and whether or not the corporation has previously been a registrable corporation, the corporation must, before the end of 60 days after the day on which it becomes a registrable corporation, give to APRA the documents mentioned in subsection (5).

                    Penalty:  50 penalty units.

Note:          If a corporation to which subsection (2) applies fails to give the documents to APRA before the end of the period specified in that subsection, the obligation to give them to APRA continues after the end of that period with daily offences being committed until the obligation is complied with (see section 4K of the _Crimes Act 1914_).

             (3)  APRA may, before the end of the period referred to in subsection (1) or (2) (including any period that is taken to be substituted for that period by any other application or applications of this subsection) allow a longer period for the giving by a particular corporation of documents in accordance with that subsection and, in that case, the longer period is taken, for the purposes of the application of that subsection in relation to that corporation, to be substituted for the period referred to in that subsection.

             (4)  Neither subsection (1) nor (2) applies to a corporation if, before the end of the period referred to in that subsection (including any period that is taken to be substituted for that period by any application or applications of subsection (3) in relation to that corporation), the corporation ceases to be a registrable corporation.

Note:          A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to matters in subsection (4) (see subsection 13.3(3) of the _Criminal Code_).

             (5)  The documents referred to in subsections (1) and (2) are:

                     (a)  a statement in writing setting out:

                              (i)  the name, the place and date of incorporation and the address of the registered office of the corporation; and

                             (ii)  the name, and the address of the registered office, of every corporation that is related to the corporation; and

                            (iii)  particulars of the principal methods by which the corporation ordinarily borrows moneys; and

                            (iv)  particulars of the principal kinds of finance ordinarily provided by the corporation; and

                     (b)  a copy of the last audited balance-sheet of the corporation; and

                     (c)  if there is no such balance-sheet or the balance-sheet includes both assets and liabilities in Australia and assets and liabilities outside Australia but does not show the assets and liabilities in Australia separately from the assets and liabilities outside Australia—a statement showing the assets and liabilities in Australia of the corporation.

             (6)  If:

                     (a)  a registered entity changes its name or the address of its registered office; or

                     (b)  a change takes place in the principal methods by which a registered entity ordinarily borrows moneys or in the principal kinds of finance ordinarily provided by a registered entity; or

                     (c)  a corporation that is related to a registered entity ceases to be so related; or

                     (d)  a corporation becomes related to a registered entity;

the registered entity must, before the end of the period of 60 days after the occurrence of the event concerned, notify APRA in writing accordingly.

                    Penalty:  10 penalty units.

Note:          If a financial sector entity to which subsection (6) applies fails to notify APRA before the end of the period specified in that subsection, the obligation to notify APRA continues after the end of that period with daily offences being committed until the obligation is complied with (see section 4K of the _Crimes Act 1914_).

             (7)  A corporation is not required by this section to give to APRA a statement or notification in relation to a matter if a statement or notification in relation to that matter has already been given to APRA by another corporation.

Note:          A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to matters in subsection (7) (see subsection 13.3(3) of the _Criminal Code_).

             (8)  A statement or notification by a corporation to APRA under this section must be signed by a senior officer of the corporation.

             (9)  APRA must, if requested to do so by the Secretary to the Department, give the Secretary a copy of a document received by APRA under this section.

           (10)  An offence for a contravention of subsection (1), (2) or (6) is an offence of strict liability.

##### <a id="10"></a>10  Matters to be included in Register of Entities

                   APRA must:

                     (a)  cause to be entered in the Register of Entities the name, the address of the registered office, and any other particulars that it considers appropriate to be entered, of every corporation that gives to APRA the documents mentioned in subsection 9(5); and

                     (b)  if a registered entity notifies APRA in accordance with subsection 9(6), or APRA otherwise becomes aware, of a change in the name or the address of the registered office of the entity, or of a change in any other particulars relating to the entity that are entered in the Register—cause the Register to be altered accordingly; and

                     (c)  if a corporation whose name is entered in the Register ceases to exist, or ceases to be a registrable corporation—cause the corporation’s name, the address of its registered office, and any other particulars relating to it, to be removed from the Register.

##### <a id="11"></a>11  List of names and categories of registered entities

             (1)  APRA must keep a list of the names of registered entities, divided into categories as APRA determines.

             (2)  APRA may at any time vary the list for the purpose of adding to it the names of corporations that become registered entities, or removing from it the names of corporations that are found not to be or cease to be registered entities, or for the purpose of transferring a corporation from one category to another category.

             (3)  In determining the category in which a corporation is to be included or in determining whether a corporation should be transferred from one category to another category, APRA must have regard to:

                     (a)  the assets and liabilities of the corporation; and

                     (b)  the principal methods by which the corporation ordinarily borrows moneys; and

                     (c)  the principal kinds of finance ordinarily provided by the corporation;

and must try to ensure that, as far as practicable, corporations carrying on the same or similar kinds of business are included in the same category.

             (4)  APRA must cause a copy of the list, and, if a variation of the list is made, a copy of the variation, to be published in the _Gazette_.

             (5)  If APRA prepares a new list in substitution for the existing list and any variations made to that list, subsection (4) applies in respect of the new list and any variation made to that list.

             (6)  As soon as practicable after a corporation is included in a category or is transferred from one category to another category, APRA must notify the corporation of the category in which it has been included or to which it has been transferred.

             (7)  If:

                     (a)  after a corporation has been included in a category, the corporation requests APRA to transfer the corporation to another category; or

                     (b)  after a corporation has been transferred from one category to another category, the corporation requests APRA to re-transfer the corporation to the former category or to transfer the corporation to a third category;

and the corporation gives information or makes submissions to APRA in support of the request, APRA must, after taking into account the information or submissions:

                     (c)  reconsider the question of the category in which the corporation should be included; and

                     (d)  if APRA thinks that the corporation should be transferred to a different category, vary the list accordingly.

## Part 3—Provision of documents to APRA

### Division 1—Deferred application of this Part in relation to registered entities

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Application

             (1)  This Part does not apply in respect of registered entities until the date of commencement of Part 2.

             (2)  Until that date, a reference in this Part to a financial sector entity is taken to be a reference only to such an entity that is a regulated entity.

### Division 2—Determination of reporting standards and requirement to provide documents

##### <a id="13"></a>13  APRA may determine reporting standards for, and require provision of, certain documents

             (1)  APRA may:

                     (a)  by writing, determine reporting standards that are required to be complied with by financial sector entities with respect to any of the following documents (**_reporting documents_**):

                              (i)  statements, reports, returns, certificates or other documents containing information of a financial or accounting nature relating to the business or activities of the entities;

                             (ii)  surveys, reports, returns, certificates or other documents containing other information relating to the business or activities of the entities; and

                     (b)  publish those reporting standards in any way that it considers appropriate.

Note:          When APRA has determined a reporting standard, it has power at any time to revoke or vary the standard (see subsection 33(3) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_).

             (2)  The reporting standards may include matters relating to:

                     (a)  the forms of reporting documents; and

                     (b)  the information to be contained in reporting documents; and

                     (c)  the persons who are to sign reporting documents; and

                     (d)  the times as at which, or the periods to which, the information in reporting documents is to relate; and

                     (e)  the giving of reporting documents to APRA, and the specifying of, or the authorising of APRA to specify, the times before which, or the periods within which, those documents are to be so given; and

                      (f)  the discretion of APRA, in particular cases, to vary reporting standards, including, but not limited to, the discretion to vary any times or periods specified in or under the standards as mentioned in paragraph (e).

             (3)  The reporting standards may impose:

                     (a)  different requirements to be complied with by different financial sector entities or classes of financial sector entities, including (to avoid doubt) requirements to be complied with only by a particular entity or particular entities; and

                     (b)  different requirements to be complied with in different situations and in respect of different businesses or activities.

             (4)  A reporting standard that is determined for a particular financial sector entity may, in addition to, or instead of, a reporting standard that would apply to the entity apart from this subsection, require the entity to provide information relating to the consolidated position of the entity and its subsidiaries other than subsidiaries (if any) excluded from the requirement by that reporting standard.

             (5)  When preparing proposed reporting standards, subject to subsection (6), APRA must consult:

                     (a)  if the standards would affect a class or classes of financial sector entities—the entities concerned or such associations or other bodies representing them as APRA thinks appropriate; or

                     (b)  if the standards would affect only a particular financial sector entity or particular financial sector entities—the entity or entities concerned.

             (6)  Subsection (5) does not apply if APRA is satisfied that the delay that would be involved in holding the consultations would prejudice the interests of depositors, policy holders or members of the financial sector entity or financial sector entities concerned.

             (7)  The validity of a reporting standard is not affected by any failure of APRA to hold consultations as required by subsection (5).

             (8)  Instruments made by APRA under paragraph (1)(a) are disallowable instruments for the purposes of section 46A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

             (9)  If a financial sector entity is required by or under a reporting standard to give a reporting document to APRA before a particular time or within a particular period, the entity must comply with the requirement.

                    Penalty:  50 penalty units.

           (10)  To avoid doubt, section 4K of the _Crimes Act 1914_ applies to an obligation imposed by subsection (9).

Note:          The effect of section 4K of the _Crimes Act 1914_ is that, if a financial sector entity to which subsection (9) applies refuses or fails to comply with a requirement before the time, or within the period, specified in the requirement, the obligation to comply with the requirement continues after that time or that period with daily offences being committed until the requirement is complied with.

           (11)  An offence for a contravention of subsection (9) is an offence of strict liability.

##### <a id="14"></a>14  Principal executive officer of financial sector entity (other than a superannuation entity) to notify the entity’s governing body of a failure to provide reporting documents to APRA

             (1)  This section applies if a financial sector entity (other than a superannuation entity) that is required by or under a reporting standard to give a reporting document to APRA before a particular time or within a particular period fails to comply with the requirement.

             (2)  It is the duty of the principal executive officer of the entity, as soon as practicable after that time or the end of that period, as the case may be, to notify the governing body of the entity in writing that the failure has occurred.

             (3)  The principal executive officer of a financial sector entity must not refuse or fail to notify the governing body of the entity as required by subsection (2).

                    Penalty:  50 penalty units.

             (4)  An offence for a contravention of subsection (3) is an offence of strict liability.

##### <a id="15"></a>15  When reporting standards begin to apply to particular financial sector entities

             (1)  The reporting standards apply to a financial sector entity only on and after the day declared by APRA to be the day on which the standards begin to apply to the entity or to the class or kind of financial sector entities in which the entity is included.

             (2)  APRA may, by writing published in the _Gazette_, make declarations for the purposes of subsection (1).

##### <a id="16"></a>16  Exemptions

             (1)  APRA may, by writing, exempt a financial sector entity, or a class or kind of financial sector entities, from the requirement to comply with:

                     (a)  all the requirements contained in any one or more applicable reporting standards; or

                     (b)  a specified requirement or requirements contained in an applicable reporting standard or applicable reporting standards.

             (2)  An exemption may be unconditional or subject to conditions and may be of indefinite duration or limited in the time of its operation.

             (3)  An instrument under subsection (1) is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

##### <a id="17"></a>17  APRA may require the variation of a reporting document or the provision of financial information

             (1)  If APRA thinks that a reporting document given to APRA by a financial sector entity:

                     (a)  is incorrect, incomplete or misleading; or

                     (b)  does not comply with a reporting standard that applies to it; or

                     (c)  does not contain information, or adequate information, about a matter;

APRA may give the entity written notice requesting it to give APRA in writing such explanation or information as is specified in the notice.

             (2)  The notice must specify the period within which the explanation or information is to be given. The period specified must be not less than 14 days beginning on the day on which the notice is given.

             (3)  If the notice requested the giving of an explanation and:

                     (a)  the entity fails to give the explanation; or

                     (b)  after considering the explanation given by the entity, APRA still thinks that the document is incorrect, incomplete or misleading or does not comply with the reporting standard;

APRA may give the entity such written directions as APRA thinks necessary for the variation of the document so that it will cease to be incorrect, incomplete or misleading or will comply with the reporting standard, as the case may be.

             (4)  If the notice requested the giving of information and:

                     (a)  the entity fails to give the information; or

                     (b)  APRA thinks that the information given is inadequate;

APRA may give the entity such written directions as APRA thinks necessary for the giving of the information or the giving of adequate information.

             (5)  Directions under subsection (3) or (4) must specify a period within which they are to be complied with. The period specified must not be less than 14 days beginning on the day on which the directions are given.
