             (2)  If legislation introduced into the Parliament before the commencing day but commencing on or after that day:

                     (e)  it had provided for such modifications of the operation of that section as are necessary to ensure that the effect of the applied provisions of Part XII of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ is preserved.

             (5)  In this section:
