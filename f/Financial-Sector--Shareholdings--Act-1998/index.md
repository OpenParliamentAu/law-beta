Note:	These people cease to hold office on the commencement of the amendments because of the repeal of the provisions under which they were appointed.

**4  Continued effect of certain delegations**

(1)	A delegation in force, immediately before the commencement of the amendments, under subsection 15(1) or (2) of the old Act continues to have effect after that commencement as if it were a delegation under APRA's seal under that subsection of the amended Act. If the delegation was to one or more members of APRA's Board, it continues to have effect as if it were a delegation to any APRA member.
 (2)	A direction in force, immediately before the commencement of the amendments, under subsection 15(3) of the old Act continues to have effect after that commencement, in relation to a delegation to which subitem&#160;(1) applies, as if it were a direction given by APRA under that subsection of the amended Act.
 (3)	A delegation to one or more members of APRA's Board in force, immediately before the commencement of the amendments, under a provision amended by Schedule&#160;2 continues to have effect after that commencement as if it were a delegation under the amended provision to any APRA member.

**5  Continued effect of determinations of terms and conditions for staff and consultants**

A determination of terms and conditions in force, immediately before the commencement of the amendments, under subsection 45(2) or 47(2) of the old Act continues to have effect after that commencement as if it were a determination by APRA under that subsection of the amended Act.

**6  Continued effect of approvals under paragraph 56(5)(b)**

An approval in force, immediately before the commencement of the amendments, under paragraph 56(5)(b) of the old Act continues to have effect after that commencement as if it were an approval by APRA under that paragraph of the amended Act.

**7  Continued or extended effect of certain regulations**

(1)	Regulations in force, immediately before the commencement of the amendments, under paragraph&#160;(k) of the definition of **_Act covered by this section_** in subsection 56(1) of the old Act continue to have effect after that commencement as if they were made under paragraph&#160;(o) of the definition of **_prudential regulation framework law_** in subsection 3(1) of the amended Act, but only as that paragraph applies for the purposes of section&#160;56 of the amended Act.
 (2)	Regulations in force, immediately before the commencement of the amendments, under paragraph 56(5)(a) of the old Act have effect after that commencement (in addition to the effect they continue to have for that paragraph of the amended Act) as if they were also made under subsection 10A(1) of the amended Act.

**8  Delegations by ASIC to APRA staff members**

(1)	Subsection 102(2A) of the _Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001_ has effect after the commencement of the amendments as if the reference in that subsection to the Chief Executive Officer of APRA were instead a reference to APRA.
 (2)	For the purposes of that subsection as it continues to have effect, an agreement to a delegation, in force under that subsection immediately before the commencement of the amendments, continues to have effect after that commencement as if it were given by APRA.
