<h7 class="ActHead7">Part 1—Amendments</h7>

<h9 class="ActHead9">A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999</h9>

## 1  Before section 57EA

Insert:

##### <a id="57EAA"></a>57EAA  Eligibility for child care rebate—for a week

             (1)  An individual is eligible for child care rebate for a week in respect of a child if:

                     (a)  a determination is in force under section 50F of the Family Assistance Administration Act during the week to the effect that the individual is conditionally eligible for child care benefit by fee reduction in respect of the child; and

                     (b)  one or more sessions of care are provided by one or more approved child care services to the child during the week; and

                     (c)  under Subdivision G of Division 4, one or more of the following is the weekly limit of hours applicable to the individual in the week:

                              (i)  the 50 hour limit (see section 54);

                             (ii)  the more than 50 hour limit (see section 55);

                            (iii)  the 24 hour care limit under section 56; and

                     (d)  the Secretary has calculated an amount of fee reduction under subsection 50Z(1) of the Family Assistance Administration Act in respect of the individual and the child for at least one of those sessions of care provided in the week; and

                     (e)  the amount referred to in paragraph (d) is:

                              (i)  an amount greater than a nil amount; or

                             (ii)  a nil amount because the CCB % applicable to the individual is zero %; and

                      (f)  the individual has made an election, under paragraph 65EAAAA(1)(a) or (b) of the Family Assistance Administration Act, to have child care rebate paid weekly and the election is in effect for the week.

Note 1:       If one of the paragraph (c) limits applies, the individual satisfies the paragraph (c) condition, even if the individual has not used child care for the child during the week up to the full extent of the limit.

Note 2:       For the purposes of paragraph (d), it does not matter if the amount is later recalculated under subsection 50ZA(1) of the Family Assistance Administration Act.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  a limit mentioned in paragraph (1)(c) does not apply under a determination in force under section 50H of the Family Assistance Administration Act for the individual and the child in the week; but

                     (b)  the circumstances in which such a limit applies were applicable to the individual in that week;

then that limit is taken, for the purposes of that paragraph, to be the weekly limit of hours applicable to the individual in the week.

Note:          If the only limit applicable to the individual in the week was the limit of 24 hours under subsection 53(3), then the condition in paragraph (1)(c) will not be satisfied.

             (3)  The 50 hour limit is taken, for the purposes of paragraph (1)(c), to be applicable to the individual in the week if it would have been applicable to the individual in the week but for the fact that the individual failed to meet the requirements of paragraph 17A(1)(b) in relation to the week.

## 2  At the end of subsection 57EA(1)

Add:

             ; and (f)  the individual has made an election, under paragraph 65EAAAA(1)(c) of the Family Assistance Administration Act, to have child care rebate paid quarterly and the election is in effect for the quarter.

## 3  Before Subdivision A of Division 4A of Part 4

Insert:

#### Subdivision AA—Child care rebate for a week

##### <a id="84AAA"></a>84AAA  Amount of the child care rebate—for a week

                   If the Secretary calculates, under section 65EAAA of the Family Assistance Administration Act, the amount of child care rebate applicable in respect of an individual and a child for care provided for the child by an approved child care service in a week, the amount is worked out as follows:

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.   Work out the total amount of the individual’s approved child care fees for care provided for the child by the approved child care service in the week.

Step 2\. Work out the total amount (if any) of so much of the fee reductions:

               (a)     calculated under subsection 50Z(1) of the Family Assistance Administration Act; or

              (b)     recalculated under subsection 50ZA(1) of that Act;

              in respect of the individual and the child as are attributable to the care provided for the child by the approved child care service in the week.

Step 3\. Work out the total amount of Jobs Education and Training (JET) Child Care fee assistance (if any) that the individual is eligible to receive for the child that is attributable to the care provided for the child by the approved child care service in the week.

Step 4\. Work out the lesser of the following amounts for the child:

               (a)     the amount worked out using the formula:

              ![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00635/Html/a832ad93-313e-467d-92bc-6b01fbc8bf64_files/image002.gif)

              (b)     the amount worked out by subtracting from the child care rebate limit for the income year in which the week began, the total of the child care rebate (if any) applicable in respect of the individual and the child for each earlier week that falls wholly in that income year (whether paid weekly or quarterly).

Step 5\. The amount of child care rebate applicable in respect of the individual and the child for care provided for the child by the approved child care service in the week is:

               (a)     the step 4 amount reduced by the reduction percentage; or

              (b)     if the Secretary determines under section 84AAD that the step 4 amount is not to be reduced—the step 4 amount.

* * *

##### <a id="84AAB"></a>84AAB  Component of formula—_approved child care fees_

General rule—approved child care fees for care provided for a child in a week

             (1)  For the purposes of section 84AAA, the amount of an individual’s **_approved child care fees_** for care provided for a child by an approved child care service in a week is the amount of fees for which:

                     (a)  the individual; or

                     (b)  the individual’s partner during the week;

is liable for the care. For this purpose, disregard the weekly limit of hours applicable to the individual in the week.

Special rule if the week is also a week for the individual’s partner for the child

                     (a)  paragraphs 57EAA(1)(b) to (e) (as affected by subsections 57EAA(2) and (3)) are satisfied for the partner and the child for the week; or

                     (b)  the week is a base week for the individual’s partner and the child under section 84AC (partner receiving child care rebate quarterly).

The determination may apply to a week or weeks beginning before the determination is made.

             (3)  The Secretary may only make a determination under subsection (1) in respect of an individual and a child:

                     (a)  if the amount of fee reduction calculated by the Secretary under subsection 50Z(1) of the Family Assistance Administration Act in respect of the individual and the child for sessions of care provided in a week to which the determination applies is a nil amount because the CCB % applicable to the individual is zero %; or

## 13  Before Subdivision AA of Division 4AA of Part 3

Insert:

#### Subdivision AAA—Election to have child care rebate paid in various ways

##### <a id="65EAAAA"></a>65EAAAA  Individual may elect to have child care rebate paid in various ways

             (1)  An individual may give the Secretary notice in accordance with subsection (2) electing to have child care rebate in respect of the individual and a child for care provided for the child in an income year paid in one of the following ways:

                     (a)  weekly into a bank account maintained by the individual alone or jointly or in common with someone else;

                     (b)  weekly to one or more approved child care services;

                     (c)  quarterly into a bank account maintained by the individual alone or jointly or in common with someone else.

Note:          Child care rebate is calculated on the basis of reports given by approved child care services in relation to each week of care under section 219N. A report for care provided in one week may be given up to 2 weeks later. A service may therefore give a report for 2 weeks together. For this reason, payments of child care rebate to an individual for 2 successive weeks may be made together. The effective result is then a fortnightly payment.

             (2)  A notice under subsection (1):

                     (a)  must be given in the form, and in the manner or way, approved by the Secretary; and

                     (b)  must be given before the beginning of the income year to which the notice relates unless:

                              (i)  the individual makes a claim after the beginning of the income year for payment of child care benefit by fee reduction for care provided for the child by one or more approved child care services; or

                             (ii)  the Secretary makes a determination under subsection (4).

             (3)  If an individual gives notice under subsection (1) when making a claim after the beginning of an income year for payment of child care benefit by fee reduction, the election is taken to relate to the income year in which the claim is made.

             (4)  The Secretary may determine, in writing, that an individual may give notice under subsection (1) after the income year to which the notice relates has begun, if the Secretary is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances justifying the determination.

Note:          A determination of entitlement to child care rebate will be made for the income year under Subdivision A of this Division. So if a person is entitled to child care rebate, does not elect to have it paid weekly or quarterly and has not been receiving child care rebate weekly or quarterly as a result of a previous election (see section 65EAAAC), child care rebate will be paid after the end of the income year.

##### <a id="65EAAAB"></a>65EAAAB  Period in which election has effect

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a notice is given under paragraph 65EAAAA(1)(a) or (b) to have child care rebate paid weekly; and

                     (b)  the notice is given before the income year to which it relates has begun;

the election takes effect on the first Monday in the income year and continues in effect for each week all or part of which falls in the income year.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  a notice is given under paragraph 65EAAAA(1)(c) to have child care rebate paid quarterly; and

                     (b)  the notice is given before the income year to which it relates has begun;

the election takes effect on the first day of the first quarter in the income year and continues in effect for each quarter which falls in the income year.

             (3)  If notice is given under subsection 65EAAAA(1) after the income year to which it relates has begun:

                     (a)  the Secretary must determine in writing the day on which the election is to take effect; and

                     (b)  the election continues in effect:

                              (i)  if the notice is given under paragraph 65EAAAA(1)(a) or (b) to have child care rebate paid weekly—for each week all or part of which falls in the income year; and

                             (ii)  if the notice is given under paragraph 65EAAAA(1)(c) to have child care rebate paid quarterly—for each quarter which falls in the income year.

##### <a id="65EAAAC"></a>65EAAAC  Where no election made for an income year

                   If an individual does not give notice under subsection 65EAAAA(1) for an income year, child care rebate in respect of the individual and the child for care provided during the income year is to be paid:

                     (a)  if child care rebate was paid in respect of the individual and the child in relation to the immediately preceding income year—in the same way as it was paid in relation to that year; and

                     (b)  otherwise—for the income year.

#### Subdivision AAB—Weekly payments of child care rebate

##### <a id="65EAAA"></a>65EAAA  Weekly payments of child care rebate

                   If:

                     (b)  the Secretary has calculated an amount of fee reduction under subsection 50Z(1) in respect of the individual and the child for a session or sessions of care provided by an approved child care service in the week;

the Secretary must calculate the amount of the rebate which the Secretary considers is applicable in respect of the individual and the child for care provided for the child by the approved child care service in the week.

Note 1:       The individual will not be eligible to have child care rebate paid weekly unless the individual has made an election under paragraph 65EAAAA(1)(a) or (b) to have rebate paid weekly.

Note 2:       The calculation is made in accordance with section 84AAA of the Family Assistance Act.

Note 3:       The amount of fee reduction calculated under subsection 50Z(1) may be a nil amount (see section 4A).

##### <a id="65EAAB"></a>65EAAB  Where individual elects to have child care rebate paid weekly to approved child care service

             (1)  This section applies if:

             (2)  The Secretary must notify the approved child care service of the amount calculated.

             (3)  The notice must be given in the form, and in the manner or way, approved by the Secretary.

             (4)  Without limiting subsection (3), the Secretary may approve notification of the amount by making the information available to the approved child care service using an electronic interface. In that case, the approved child care service is taken to have been given the notice on the day on which the information is made available.

Note:          The amount is then paid to the approved child care service under subsection 219QC(1).

##### <a id="65EAAC"></a>65EAAC  Where individual elects to have child care rebate paid weekly into own bank account

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  the Secretary calculates an amount of child care rebate under section 65EAAA which the Secretary considers is applicable in respect of an individual and a child for care provided for the child by an approved child care service in a week; and

                     (b)  the individual has made an election under paragraph 65EAAAA(1)(a) that is in effect for the week to have child care rebate paid weekly into a bank account nominated and maintained by the individual.

             (2)  The Secretary must pay the amount of child care rebate calculated under section 65EAAA to the individual, at such time as the Secretary considers appropriate, by paying it to the credit of the bank account.

             (3)  The Secretary may direct that the whole or a part of an amount that is to be paid under this section is to be paid in a different way from that provided for by subsection (2). If the Secretary gives the direction, the amount is to be paid in accordance with the direction.

             (4)  The Secretary must give notice to the individual:

                     (a)  identifying the week or weeks to which the notice relates (the **_rebate period_**); and

                     (b)  stating:

                              (i)  the child’s name; and

                             (ii)  the amount of child care rebate calculated in respect of the rebate period (the **_rebate amount_**); and

                            (iii)  the total amount of the individual’s approved child care fees for care provided for the child by the approved child care service during the rebate period, worked out under step 1 of the method statement in section 84AAA of the Family Assistance Act when calculating the rebate amount; and

             (5)  The calculation and payment of an amount of child care rebate applicable under this section is not ineffective by reason only that any, or all, of the requirements of subsection (4) are not complied with.

             (6)  This section is subject to:

                     (a)  section 65EAAF; and

             (2)  Subject to subsection (3), the Secretary must notify the approved child care service of the recalculated amount.

             (3)  The Secretary need not notify the approved child care service of the recalculated amount if the amount is reduced, and the recalculation is for a reason other than the substitution or withdrawal by the service of a report given under section 219N.

             (4)  The notice must be given in the form, and in the manner or way, approved by the Secretary.

             (5)  Without limiting subsection (4), the Secretary may approve notification of the amount by making the information available to the approved child care service using an electronic interface.

             (3)  If the recalculation decreases the amount of child care rebate applicable in respect of the individual and the child for care provided for the child by the service in the week, the Secretary may set off all or a part of the decrease against an amount of child care rebate applicable under this Subdivision or Subdivision AA for that or any other approved child care service in respect of the individual and the child for a later period in the same income year.

#### Subdivision AAA—Election to have child care rebate paid in various ways

##### <a id="65EAAAA"></a>65EAAAA  Individual may elect to have child care rebate paid in various ways

             (1)  An individual may give the Secretary notice in accordance with subsection (2) electing to have child care rebate in respect of the individual and a child for care provided for the child in an income year paid in one of the following ways:

                     (a)  weekly into a bank account maintained by the individual alone or jointly or in common with someone else;

                     (b)  weekly to one or more approved child care services;

                     (c)  quarterly into a bank account maintained by the individual alone or jointly or in common with someone else.

Note:          Child care rebate is calculated on the basis of reports given by approved child care services in relation to each week of care under section 219N. A report for care provided in one week may be given up to 2 weeks later. A service may therefore give a report for 2 weeks together. For this reason, payments of child care rebate to an individual for 2 successive weeks may be made together. The effective result is then a fortnightly payment.

             (2)  A notice under subsection (1):

                     (a)  must be given in the form, and in the manner or way, approved by the Secretary; and

                     (b)  must be given before the beginning of the income year to which the notice relates unless:

                              (i)  the individual makes a claim after the beginning of the income year for payment of child care benefit by fee reduction for care provided for the child by one or more approved child care services; or

                             (ii)  the Secretary makes a determination under subsection (4).

             (3)  If an individual gives notice under subsection (1) when making a claim after the beginning of an income year for payment of child care benefit by fee reduction, the election is taken to relate to the income year in which the claim is made.

             (4)  The Secretary may determine, in writing, that an individual may give notice under subsection (1) after the income year to which the notice relates has begun, if the Secretary is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances justifying the determination.

Note:          A determination of entitlement to child care rebate will be made for the income year under Subdivision A of this Division. So if a person is entitled to child care rebate, does not elect to have it paid weekly or quarterly and has not been receiving child care rebate weekly or quarterly as a result of a previous election (see section 65EAAAC), child care rebate will be paid after the end of the income year.

##### <a id="65EAAAB"></a>65EAAAB  Period in which election has effect

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a notice is given under paragraph 65EAAAA(1)(a) or (b) to have child care rebate paid weekly; and

                     (b)  the notice is given before the income year to which it relates has begun;

the election takes effect on the first Monday in the income year and continues in effect for each week all or part of which falls in the income year.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  a notice is given under paragraph 65EAAAA(1)(c) to have child care rebate paid quarterly; and

                     (b)  the notice is given before the income year to which it relates has begun;

the election takes effect on the first day of the first quarter in the income year and continues in effect for each quarter which falls in the income year.

             (3)  If notice is given under subsection 65EAAAA(1) after the income year to which it relates has begun:

                     (a)  the Secretary must determine in writing the day on which the election is to take effect; and

                     (b)  the election continues in effect:

                              (i)  if the notice is given under paragraph 65EAAAA(1)(a) or (b) to have child care rebate paid weekly—for each week all or part of which falls in the income year; and

                             (ii)  if the notice is given under paragraph 65EAAAA(1)(c) to have child care rebate paid quarterly—for each quarter which falls in the income year.

##### <a id="65EAAAC"></a>65EAAAC  Where no election made for an income year

                   If an individual does not give notice under subsection 65EAAAA(1) for an income year, child care rebate in respect of the individual and the child for care provided during the income year is to be paid:

                     (a)  if child care rebate was paid in respect of the individual and the child in relation to the immediately preceding income year—in the same way as it was paid in relation to that year; and

                     (b)  otherwise—for the income year.

#### Subdivision AAB—Weekly payments of child care rebate

##### <a id="65EAAA"></a>65EAAA  Weekly payments of child care rebate

                   If:

                     (a)  the Secretary is satisfied that an individual is eligible under subsection 57EAA(1) of the Family Assistance Act for child care rebate for a week in respect of a child; and

                     (b)  the Secretary has calculated an amount of fee reduction under subsection 50Z(1) in respect of the individual and the child for a session or sessions of care provided by an approved child care service in the week;

the Secretary must calculate the amount of the rebate which the Secretary considers is applicable in respect of the individual and the child for care provided for the child by the approved child care service in the week.

Note 1:       The individual will not be eligible to have child care rebate paid weekly unless the individual has made an election under paragraph 65EAAAA(1)(a) or (b) to have rebate paid weekly.

Note 2:       The calculation is made in accordance with section 84AAA of the Family Assistance Act.

Note 3:       The amount of fee reduction calculated under subsection 50Z(1) may be a nil amount (see section 4A).

##### <a id="65EAAB"></a>65EAAB  Where individual elects to have child care rebate paid weekly to approved child care service

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  the Secretary calculates an amount of child care rebate under section 65EAAA which the Secretary considers is applicable in respect of an individual and a child for care provided for the child by an approved child care service in a week; and

                     (b)  the individual has made an election under paragraph 65EAAAA(1)(b) that is in effect for the week to have child care rebate paid weekly to the approved child care service.

             (2)  The Secretary must notify the approved child care service of the amount calculated.

             (3)  The notice must be given in the form, and in the manner or way, approved by the Secretary.

             (4)  Without limiting subsection (3), the Secretary may approve notification of the amount by making the information available to the approved child care service using an electronic interface. In that case, the approved child care service is taken to have been given the notice on the day on which the information is made available.

Note:          The amount is then paid to the approved child care service under subsection 219QC(1).

##### <a id="65EAAC"></a>65EAAC  Where individual elects to have child care rebate paid weekly into own bank account

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  the Secretary calculates an amount of child care rebate under section 65EAAA which the Secretary considers is applicable in respect of an individual and a child for care provided for the child by an approved child care service in a week; and

                     (b)  the individual has made an election under paragraph 65EAAAA(1)(a) that is in effect for the week to have child care rebate paid weekly into a bank account nominated and maintained by the individual.

             (2)  The Secretary must pay the amount of child care rebate calculated under section 65EAAA to the individual, at such time as the Secretary considers appropriate, by paying it to the credit of the bank account.

             (3)  The Secretary may direct that the whole or a part of an amount that is to be paid under this section is to be paid in a different way from that provided for by subsection (2). If the Secretary gives the direction, the amount is to be paid in accordance with the direction.

             (4)  The Secretary must give notice to the individual:

                     (a)  identifying the week or weeks to which the notice relates (the **_rebate period_**); and

                              (i)  the child’s name; and

                             (ii)  the amount of child care rebate calculated in respect of the rebate period (the **_rebate amount_**); and

                            (iii)  the total amount of the individual’s approved child care fees for care provided for the child by the approved child care service during the rebate period, worked out under step 1 of the method statement in section 84AAA of the Family Assistance Act when calculating the rebate amount; and

                            (iv)  the total amount (if any) of fee reductions for care provided for the child by the approved child care service during the rebate period, worked out under step 2 of the method statement in section 84AAA of the Family Assistance Act when calculating the rebate amount.

             (5)  The calculation and payment of an amount of child care rebate applicable under this section is not ineffective by reason only that any, or all, of the requirements of subsection (4) are not complied with.

             (6)  This section is subject to:

                     (a)  section 65EAAF; and

                     (b)  under a previous application of this section;

in respect of an individual and a child for care provided for the child by an approved child care service in a week, so long as a determination of entitlement has not been made under Subdivision A in respect of the individual and child for the income year in which all or part of the week falls.

##### <a id="65EAAE"></a>65EAAE  If weekly payment is to an approved child care service, notice of revised calculation must be given to the service

             (3)  If the recalculation decreases the amount of child care rebate applicable in respect of the individual and the child for care provided for the child by the service in the week, the Secretary may set off all or a part of the decrease against an amount of child care rebate applicable under this Subdivision or Subdivision AA for that or any other approved child care service in respect of the individual and the child for a later period in the same income year.
