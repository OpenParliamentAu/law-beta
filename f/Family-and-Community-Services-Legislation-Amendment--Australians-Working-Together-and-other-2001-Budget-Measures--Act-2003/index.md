_Method statement_

_Step 1._	Work out the person's _maximum payment rate_ as follows:

	(a)	if the person is not a member of a couple, the person's maximum payment rate will be the sum of the person's maximum basic rate of parenting payment as determined under Module B of the Parenting Payment Rate Calculator in section&#160;1068A and the person's pension supplement as determined under 
<center>Back to Top</center>
 Module BA of the Parenting Payment Rate Calculator in section&#160;1068A;
 	(b)	if the person is a member of a couple, the person's maximum payment rate is the rate worked out using Module C of the Parenting Payment Rate Calculator in section&#160;1068B.

_Step 2._	Work out the rate reduction amount as follows:

	(a)	if the participation agreement breach is the person's first breach in the 2 year period:

_Step 3._	Take the rate reduction amount away from the rate of parenting payment worked out in accordance with the Parenting Payment Rate Calculator in section&#160;1068A or 1068B, as the case may be. The result is the _participation agreement breach reduced rate_.

 </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>there is an accrual to the participant's working credit balance; or</dd>

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

and, if there is an accrual to, or a depletion from, the participant's working credit balance, the amount of that accrual or depletion.

_Method statement_

_Step 1._ Work out the amount of the participant's employment income earned, derived or received on the day. This could be a nil amount or it could be an amount that is taken, under section&#160;1073B, to have been earned, derived or received on the day.
 _Step 2_.	Multiply the amount determined under step 1 by 14\. This is the participant's rate of employment income on a fortnightly basis for the day.
 _Step 3_.	Add to the participant's rate of employment income on a fortnightly basis for the day the participant's rate of any other ordinary income on a fortnightly basis for the day. This is the participant's fortnightly rate of total ordinary income on a fortnightly basis for the day.
 _Step 4_.	If the participant's rate of total ordinary income on a fortnightly basis for the day is less than $48, there is an accrual to the participant's working credit balance for the day of an amount equal to one fourteenth of the amount by which $48 exceeds that rate. The maximum working credit balance is $1,000.
 _Step 5_.	If the participant's rate of total ordinary income on a fortnightly basis for the day is at least $48 but does not exceed the ordinary income free area applicable to the participant for the day under the income test module of the appropriate rate calculator, the participant's working credit balance for the day is neither increased nor reduced.
 _Step 6_.	If the participant's rate of total ordinary income on a fortnightly basis for the day is at least $48 and exceeds the participant's applicable ordinary income free area for the day, the participant's working credit balance, if it is greater than nil on the day, is depleted on that day by the least of:

	(a)	the amount of employment income determined under step 1; or
 	(b)	one fourteenth of the amount by which the participant's rate of total ordinary income on a fortnightly basis exceeds the participant's applicable ordinary income free area; or
 	(c)	the participant's available working credit balance.

 _Step 2_.	Multiply the amount determined under step 1 by 364\. This is the 
<center>Back to Top</center>
 participant's rate of employment income on a yearly basis for the day.
 _Step 3_.	Add to the participant's rate of employment income on a yearly basis for the day the participant's rate of any other ordinary income on a yearly basis for the day. This is the participant's rate of total ordinary income on a yearly basis for the day.
 _Step 4_.	Divide the participant's rate of total ordinary income on a yearly basis for the day by 26\. This is the participant's rate of total ordinary income, expressed on a fortnightly basis, for the day.
 _Step 5_.	Divide the yearly ordinary income free area applicable to the participant for the day under the ordinary income test module of the appropriate rate calculator by 26\. This is the participant's applicable ordinary income free area, expressed on a fortnightly basis, for the day.
 _Step 6_.	If the participant's rate of total ordinary income, expressed on a fortnightly basis, for the day, is less than $48, there is an accrual to the participant's working credit balance, for the day, of an amount equal to one fourteenth of the amount by which $48 exceeds that rate. The maximum working credit balance is $1,000.
 _Step 7_.	If the participant's rate of total ordinary income, expressed on a fortnightly basis, for the day, is at least $48 but does not exceed the participant's applicable ordinary income free area, expressed on a fortnightly basis for the day in accordance with step 5, the participant's working credit balance for the day is neither increased nor reduced.
 _Step 8_.	If the participant's rate of total ordinary income, expressed on a fortnightly basis, for the day, is at least $48 and exceeds the participant's applicable ordinary income free area, expressed on a fortnightly basis for the day in accordance with step 5, the participant's working credit balance, if it is greater than nil on the day, is depleted on that day by the least of:

	(a)	the amount of employment income determined under step 1; or
 	(b)	one fourteenth of the amount by which the participant's rate of total ordinary income, expressed on a fortnightly basis, exceeds the participant's applicable ordinary income free area, expressed on that basis; or
 	(c)	the participant's available working credit balance.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

		If, under section&#160;1073H, the working credit balance of a working credit

participant is depleted on a particular day, the participant's rate of ordinary

income on a yearly basis for that day is reduced by the working credit

depletion amount applicable to that day, determined under step 8 of the method

statement, multiplied by 364.
