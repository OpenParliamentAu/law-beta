### Division 2—Parenting Payment Participation Agreements

##### <a id="501"></a>501  General requirements relating to participation agreements

General

             (1)  The requirements that apply to a person in respect of parenting payment participation agreements are as follows:

                     (a)  the person must enter into a participation agreement when the person is required by the Secretary under section 501A to do so;

                     (b)  while the agreement is in force the person must take reasonable steps to comply with its terms;

                     (c)  at any time while the agreement is in force the person must be prepared to enter into another such agreement, instead of the existing agreement, if required to do so by the Secretary.

What are reasonable steps?

             (2)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), a person is to be regarded as taking reasonable steps to comply with the terms of a participation agreement if the Secretary is satisfied:

                     (a)  that the person has attempted in good faith and to the best of his or her ability to comply with those terms; or

                     (b)  that the terms:

                              (i)  have never been appropriate; or

                             (ii)  because of a change in the person’s circumstances since entry into the agreement, have become inappropriate;

                            for compliance by that person.

Appropriate terms

             (3)  In determining whether the terms of an agreement have always been, or have become, inappropriate for compliance by a person, the Secretary is to have regard to the person’s capacity to comply with the terms and to the person’s needs.

Capacity to comply with agreement, and person’s needs

             (4)  In having regard to a person’s capacity to comply with the terms of a participation agreement and the person’s needs, the Secretary is to take into account, but is not limited to, the following matters:

                     (a)  the person’s education, experience, skills, age, disability, illness, mental and physical condition; and

                     (b)  the state of the local labour market and the transport options available to the person in accessing that market; and

                     (c)  the participation opportunities available to the person; and

                     (d)  the family and caring responsibilities of the person, (including those arising from any significant adverse effect on a PP child of a person that would result from the person’s compliance with the terms of the agreement); and

                     (e)  current court proceedings in the Family Court or criminal courts or current child welfare concerns, such as drugs or school truanting; and

                      (f)  the length of travel time required for compliance with the agreement; and

                     (g)  the financial costs of compliance with the agreement, such as travel costs, and the capacity to pay for such compliance; and

                     (h)  any other matters that the Secretary or the person considers relevant in the circumstances.

Secretary must contact person before determining failure to comply with terms

             (5)  The Secretary must not determine that a person has failed to take reasonable steps to comply with the terms of a participation agreement unless the Secretary:

                     (a)  is satisfied that the terms of the agreement were intended to assist the person over time in gaining employment or undertaking study or training; and

                     (b)  has made reasonable attempts to contact the person in relation to the requirement to comply with the terms of the agreement (and has documented each attempt to contact); and

                     (c)  if contact was able to be made, has had regard to the reasons, if any, provided by the person for not complying with the terms of the agreement; and

                     (d)  has confirmed the adequacy of the support that the Secretary agreed to provide under the agreement.

##### <a id="501A"></a>501A  Parenting payment participation agreements—requirement

Requirement to enter into agreement

             (1)  Subject to this section, if:

                     (a)  a person is claiming or receiving parenting payment; and

                     (b)  the PP child or, if more than one, the youngest PP child, of the person has turned 13 years; and

                     (c)  the person is not an exempt person within the meaning of subsection (2) or (2A);

the Secretary may require the person to enter into a participation agreement.

Exempt persons

             (2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), a person is an exempt person if the person has:

                     (a)  a PP child who is a profoundly disabled child within the meaning of section 197; or

                     (b)  two or more PP children;

                              (i)  who are disabled children; and

                             (ii)  who, in the Secretary’s opinion, require a level of care at least equivalent to the level of care required by a profoundly disabled child; or

                     (c)  a PP child who suffers from a physical, intellectual or psychiatric disability that is specified in a determination made under subsection 38D(3) to be a recognised disability for the purposes of section 953.

Exempt persons-periodic exemptions

          (2A)  For the purposes of subsection (1), a person is an exempt person for a particular period determined by the Secretary under this subsection if:

                     (a)  the person has one or more PP children:

                              (i)  who suffer from a physical, intellectual or psychiatric disability or illness; and

                             (ii)  whose care needs are such that the person could not be reasonably expected at that time to comply with the terms of a participation agreement; or

                     (b)  a critical event occurs that was not within the person’s control (eg family or personal crisis, the Secretary is satisfied the person has separated from his or her partner on a permanent or indefinite basis in the past 26 weeks, person’s house burning down, evidence of domestic violence, serious illness of PP children or an accumulation of stressful personal circumstances which the Secretary is satisfied would, in combination, require full-time effort to address) and, as a result, the person is temporarily unable to comply with the terms of a participation agreement.

          (2B)  At any one time the maximum period for which the Secretary may determine that a person is an exempt person under subsection (2A) is:

                     (a)  if paragraph (2A)(a) applies to the person—12 months;

                     (b)  if paragraph (2A)(b) applies to the person—26 weeks.

Participation agreement breach reduced rate

             (1)  If a participation agreement breach rate reduction period applies to a person under this Part, the person’s rate of parenting payment for the reduction period is worked out as follows:

<div style="BORDER-RIGHT: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-RIGHT: 5pt; BORDER-TOP: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-LEFT: 5pt; PADDING-BOTTOM: 5pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 2cm; BORDER-LEFT: windowtext 1pt solid; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0cm; PADDING-TOP: 5pt; BORDER-BOTTOM: windowtext 1pt solid">

_Method statement_

_Step 1._   Work out the person’s **_maximum payment rate_** as follows:

               (a)     if the person is not a member of a couple, the person’s maximum payment rate will be the sum of the person’s maximum basic rate of parenting payment as determined under Module B of the Parenting Payment Rate Calculator in section 1068A and the person’s pension supplement as determined under Module BA of the Parenting Payment Rate Calculator in section 1068A;

               (b)     if the person is a member of a couple, the person’s maximum payment rate is the rate worked out using Module C of the Parenting Payment Rate Calculator in section 1068B.

_Step 2._   Work out the rate reduction amount as follows:

               (a)     if the participation agreement breach is the person’s first breach in the 2 year period:

                        ![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2005C00734/Html/FA0F6149736DACE3CA2570DF00245C86/$FILE/image002.gif)

               (b)     if the participation agreement breach is the person’s second breach in the 2 year period:

                        ![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2005C00734/Html/FA0F6149736DACE3CA2570DF00245C86/$FILE/image003.gif)

_Step 3._   Take the rate reduction amount away from the rate of parenting payment worked out in accordance with the Parenting Payment Rate Calculator in section 1068A or 1068B, as the case may be. The result is the **_participation agreement breach reduced rate_**.</div>

Meaning of 2 year period

             (2)  In this section:

                    <a name="year-period"></a>**_2 year period_** means the 2 years immediately before the day after the participation agreement breach.

_Method statement_

_Step 1._ Work out the amount of the participant’s employment income earned, derived or received on the day. This could be a nil amount or it could be an amount that is taken, under section 1073B, to have been earned, derived or received on the day.

_Step 2_.   Multiply the amount determined under step 1 by 14\. This is the participant’s rate of employment income on a fortnightly basis for the day.

_Step 3_.   Add to the participant’s rate of employment income on a fortnightly basis for the day the participant’s rate of any other ordinary income on a fortnightly basis for the day. This is the participant’s fortnightly rate of total ordinary income on a fortnightly basis for the day.

_Step 4_.   If the participant’s rate of total ordinary income on a fortnightly basis for the day is less than $48, there is an accrual to the participant’s working credit balance for the day of an amount equal to one fourteenth of the amount by which $48 exceeds that rate. The maximum working credit balance is $1,000.

_Step 5_.   If the participant’s rate of total ordinary income on a fortnightly basis for the day is at least $48 but does not exceed the ordinary income free area applicable to the participant for the day under the income test module of the appropriate rate calculator, the participant’s working credit balance for the day is neither increased nor reduced.

_Step 6_.   If the participant’s rate of total ordinary income on a fortnightly basis for the day is at least $48 and exceeds the participant’s applicable ordinary income free area for the day, the participant’s working credit balance, if it is greater than nil on the day, is depleted on that day by the least of:

                   If, under section 1073F, the working credit balance of a working credit participant is depleted on a particular day, the participant’s rate of ordinary income on a fortnightly basis for that day is reduced by the working credit depletion amount applicable to that day, determined under step 6 of the method statement, multiplied by 14.

_Method statement_

_Step 1._ Work out the amount of the participant’s employment income earned, derived or received on the day. This could be a nil amount or it could be an amount that is taken, under section 1073B, to have been earned, derived or received on the day.

_Step 2_.   Multiply the amount determined under step 1 by 364\. This is the participant’s rate of employment income on a yearly basis for the day.

_Step 3_.   Add to the participant’s rate of employment income on a yearly basis for the day the participant’s rate of any other ordinary income on a yearly basis for the day. This is the participant’s rate of total ordinary income on a yearly basis for the day.

_Step 4_.   Divide the participant’s rate of total ordinary income on a yearly basis for the day by 26\. This is the participant’s rate of total ordinary income, expressed on a fortnightly basis, for the day.

_Step 5_.   Divide the yearly ordinary income free area applicable to the participant for the day under the ordinary income test module of the appropriate rate calculator by 26\. This is the participant’s applicable ordinary income free area, expressed on a fortnightly basis, for the day.

_Step 6_.   If the participant’s rate of total ordinary income, expressed on a fortnightly basis, for the day, is less than $48, there is an accrual to the participant’s working credit balance, for the day, of an amount equal to one fourteenth of the amount by which $48 exceeds that rate. The maximum working credit balance is $1,000.

_Step 7_.   If the participant’s rate of total ordinary income, expressed on a fortnightly basis, for the day, is at least $48 but does not exceed the participant’s applicable ordinary income free area, expressed on a fortnightly basis for the day in accordance with step 5, the participant’s working credit balance for the day is neither increased nor reduced.

_Step 8_.   If the participant’s rate of total ordinary income, expressed on a fortnightly basis, for the day, is at least $48 and exceeds the participant’s applicable ordinary income free area, expressed on a fortnightly basis for the day in accordance with step 5, the participant’s working credit balance, if it is greater than nil on the day, is depleted on that day by the least of:

               (a)     the amount of employment income determined under step 1; or

               (b)     one fourteenth of the amount by which the participant’s rate of total ordinary income, expressed on a fortnightly basis, exceeds the participant’s applicable ordinary income free area, expressed on that basis; or

               (c)     the participant’s available working credit balance.</div>

##### <a id="1073I"></a>1073I  Working out the effect of a working credit depletion on the yearly rate of ordinary income for a social security pensioner

                   If, under section 1073H, the working credit balance of a working credit participant is depleted on a particular day, the participant’s rate of ordinary income on a yearly basis for that day is reduced by the working credit depletion amount applicable to that day, determined under step 8 of the method statement, multiplied by 364.
