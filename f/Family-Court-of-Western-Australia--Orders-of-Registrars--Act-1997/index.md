###  FAMILY COURT OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA (ORDERS OF REGISTRARS) ACT 1997- SECT 4  Meaning of _ineffective order_ 
**

 <dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>A reference in this Act to an _ineffective order_ is a

reference to a purported order described in subsection (2), or provisions of a

parenting plan described in subsection (3). This has effect subject to

subsections (4) and (5) as they affect the meaning of a reference to an

ineffective order in the context of a particular case.</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>An order that a Registrar has purported to make, before the commencement of the corresponding Western Australian Act, is an _ineffective order_ if it was made: </dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>in the exercise or purported exercise of the federal family jurisdiction

of the Family Court of Western Australia; and</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>by way of a judicial determination that was not reviewable (otherwise than

on appeal).

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(3)</dt><dd>Provisions of a parenting plan that a Registrar has purported to register

under section 63E of the _Family Law Act 1975_, before the commencement of

the corresponding Western Australian Act, are an _ineffective order_ if they would have had effect under section 63F or 63G of the

_Family Law Act 1975_ as a particular kind of order if the decision to

register the plan had been a decision made by the Family Court of Western

Australia.</dd> <dt>(4)</dt><dd>If a court or Registrar has purported to vary, revoke, set aside, revive or suspend an ineffective order, the reference is, subject to subsection (5), a reference to the order in the form in which, and to the extent to which, it purports or purported to have effect from time to time. </dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note 1:	In the case of an ineffective order of the kind referred

to in subsection 4(3), this subsection applies to a purported variation,

revocation, setting aside, revival or suspension of provisions of the parenting

plan as they had effect as an order (rather than a purported variation,

revocation, setting aside, revival or suspension of the provisions as

provisions of an agreement). Note 2:	This subsection applies if a court has proceeded on the basis that an ineffective order was valid. The situation where a court has proceeded on the basis that an ineffective order was or might have been invalid is dealt with in section 8\.  </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(5)</dt><dd>If clause 2 of Schedule 2 to the _Family Law Reform Act 1995_ would

have applied to an ineffective order if it had been an order made by the Family

Court of Western Australia in the exercise of its federal family jurisdiction,

then, so far as the reference relates to a time after the commencement of that

Schedule, it is, subject to subsection (4), a reference to the order as it

would have, or would have had, effect if that clause applied to it.

</dd> </dl></dl>
