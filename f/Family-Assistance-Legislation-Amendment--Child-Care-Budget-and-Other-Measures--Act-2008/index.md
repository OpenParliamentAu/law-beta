                              (i)  under section 50F of the Family Assistance Administration Act; and

                             (ii)  during at least one week that falls wholly or partly in the quarter;

                            to the effect that the individual is conditionally eligible for child care benefit by fee reduction in respect of the child; and

                     (b)  one or more sessions of care are provided by one or more approved child care services to the child during the week; and

                     (c)  under Subdivision G of Division 4, one or more of the following is the weekly limit of hours applicable to the individual in the week:

                              (i)  the 50 hour limit (see section 54);

                     (d)  the Secretary has calculated an amount of fee reduction under subsection 50Z(1) of the Family Assistance Administration Act in respect of the individual and the child for at least one of those sessions of care provided in the week; and

                     (e)  the amount referred to in paragraph (d) is:

                              (i)  an amount greater than a nil amount; or

                             (ii)  a nil amount because the CCB % applicable to the individual is zero %.

Note 1:       If one of the paragraph (c) limits applies, the individual satisfies the paragraph (c) condition, even if the individual has not used child care for the child during the week up to the full extent of the limit.

Note 2:       For the purposes of paragraph (d), it does not matter if the amount is later recalculated under subsection 50ZA(1) of the Family Assistance Administration Act.
