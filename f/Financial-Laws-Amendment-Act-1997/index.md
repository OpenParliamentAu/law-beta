##### <a id="49C"></a>49C  Bodies to which Part applies

             (1)  This Part applies to a body corporate (a **_supervised body corporate_**) that is connected with an authorised body corporate.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  this Part has begun to apply to a body corporate (the **_relevant body corporate_**) because it is a supervised body corporate; and

                     (b)  the relevant body corporate is a constitutional corporation;

this Part continues to apply to the relevant body corporate until the Commissioner certifies in writing that he or she is satisfied that:

                     (c)  the relevant body corporate has ceased to be a supervised body corporate; and

                     (d)  the authorised body corporate with which the relevant body corporate is connected is not subject to any action under this Act.

             (3)  A person must not intentionally give any information, or intentionally produce any document, to the Commissioner that is relevant to whether or not a body corporate that is a constitutional corporation is a supervised body corporate if the person knows that the information, or anything in the document, is false or misleading in a material particular.

                             (ii)  a director of another body corporate that is connected with the first body;

                            (iii)  if, because of subsection (10), this section applies in relation to a trust—a trustee in respect of the trust, or, if the trustee is a body corporate, a director of that body corporate; or

                      (f)  a debenture of, or a share in, another body corporate that is related to the first body except to the extent that the Commissioner has, under subsection (2), approved the debenture or share as an asset for the purposes of this Part;

                     (g)  the estimated value of a future benefit to the body that may arise, under a law of the Commonwealth, of a State or of a Territory, relating to taxation because of a loss or losses incurred by the body;

                     (h)  a guarantee given to or in relation to the body, except to the extent that the Commissioner has, under subsection (6), approved the guarantee as an asset for the purposes of this Part;

             (3)  In exercising the power of approval under subsection (2) in respect of a relevant asset (the **_relevant asset concerned_**) of the first body corporate in relation to the second body corporate, the Commissioner must have regard to all matters that he or she thinks relevant and, in particular, to the following matters:

                     (a)  the proportion that the sum of the values of the relevant asset concerned and of the values of all other relevant assets (whether approved under subsection (2) or not) of the first body corporate in relation to the second body corporate bears to the sum of the values of the assets of the first body corporate (other than the relevant assets of the first body corporate in relation to the second body corporate); 

                     (b)  the proportion that the value of the relevant asset concerned bears to the sum of the values of all the assets of the second body corporate;

                     (c)  the nature, and the degree of diversity, of the assets of the first body corporate; 

                     (d)  the nature, and the degree of diversity, of the assets of the second body corporate;

                     (e)  the nature of the business carried on by the second body corporate.

                     (a)  an amount due to the first body corporate by the second body corporate; or

                     (b)  a loan made by the first body corporate to the second body corporate; or

                     (c)  a debenture or share in the second body corporate held by the first body corporate.

             (5)  For the purposes of subsection (3), the value of an amount, loan, debenture or share that is not an asset within the meaning of this Part is to be determined as if it were such an asset.

             (6)  If a body corporate requests the Commissioner to approve, as an asset for the purposes of this Part, the whole or part of a guarantee given to or in relation to the body, the Commissioner may, by written notice given to the body, approve the guarantee, or such part of the guarantee as the Commissioner determines, accordingly.

             (7)  Without otherwise limiting the discretion of the Commissioner to refuse to approve, as an asset for the purposes of this Part, the whole or part of a guarantee given to or in relation to a body corporate, the Commissioner must not give such an approval unless:

                     (a)  the guarantor, or each of the guarantors, is a bank as defined by subsection 5(1) of the _Banking Act 1959_ or a State bank; and

                     (b)  the guarantee is in accordance with a prescribed form or a form approved by the Treasurer, being a form that includes provision to the effect that, in the event of the winding-up of the body, amounts due under the guarantee are to be available to meet the body’s liabilities; and

                     (c)  the guarantee is not revocable without the approval of the Commissioner.

             (8)  If an approval has been given, or a determination has been made, under subsection (2), (6) or (7), and it appears at any time to the Commissioner that the approval or determination is no longer necessary or should be varied, the Commissioner must, by written notice served on the body corporate concerned, revoke or vary the approval or determination, as the case may be.

                              (i)  the number of those units, or the sum of the number of those units and the number of units issued by the trust to a body corporate connected with the first-mentioned body corporate, exceeds 25% of the total number of units issued by the trust; or

                             (ii)  the value of those units, or the sum of the value of those units and the value of units issued by the trust to bodies corporate connected with the first-mentioned body corporate, exceeds 25% of the total value of units issued by the trust; or

                     (b)  a body corporate is connected with a body corporate that is a trustee in respect of a unit trust;

this section applies as if the trust were a body corporate connected  with the first-mentioned body corporate and as if a reference to a share in a body corporate were a reference to a unit issued by the trust.

##### <a id="49F"></a>49F  Liabilities

             (1)  In this Part, unless the contrary intention appears, a reference to liabilities of a body corporate includes a reference to provision for liabilities made in its statutory accounts, or directed in accordance with this section to be made, but does not include a liability in respect of share capital.
