The information (or details of how to access the information) must be published on a website. If there is a charge for accessing the information, the agency must publish details of the charge.

An agency must, in conjunction with the Information Commissioner, review the operation of the scheme in the agency every 5 years (if not earlier).

An agency must have regard to the objects of this Act, and guidelines issued by the Information Commissioner, in doing anything for the purposes of this Part.

If operational information is not published in accordance with this Part, a person must not be subjected to any prejudice as a result of not having access to the information.

                              (i)  a document of the agency; or

                             (ii)  an official document of the Minister; and

                     (b)  any charge that, under the regulations, is required to be paid before access is given has been paid.

Note:          Access may be given to an exempt document apart from under this Act, whether or not in response to a request (see section 3A (objects—information or documents otherwise accessible)).

             (5)  The agency or Minister must give the person access to the document if it is conditionally exempt at a particular time unless (in the circumstances) access to the document at that time would, on balance, be contrary to the public interest.

Note 1:       Division 3 of Part IV provides for when a document is conditionally exempt.

Note 2:       A conditionally exempt document is an exempt document if access to the document would, on balance, be contrary to the public interest (see section 31B (exempt documents for the purposes of Part IV)).

Note 3:       Section 11B deals with when it is contrary to the public interest to give a person access to the document.

             (6)  Despite subsection (5), the agency or Minister is not required to give access to the document at a particular time if, at that time, the document is both:

                     (a)  a conditionally exempt document; and

             (2)  This section does not limit subsection 11A(5).

Factors favouring access

             (3)  Factors favouring access to the document in the public interest include whether access to the document would do any of the following:

                     (c)  promote effective oversight of public expenditure;

                     (d)  allow a person to access his or her own personal information.

Irrelevant factors

                     (b)  information about the business, commercial, financial or professional affairs of any person, if it would be unreasonable to publish the information;

                     (c)  other information of a kind determined by the Information Commissioner under subsection (2), if it would be unreasonable to publish the information;

                     (d)  any information, if it is not reasonably practicable to publish the information under this section because of the extent of any modifications to a document (or documents) necessary to delete information mentioned in paragraphs (a) to (c).

             (4)  The agency may impose a charge on a person for accessing the information only if:

                     (a)  the person does not directly access the information by downloading it from the website (or another website); and

                     (b)  the charge is to reimburse the agency for a specific reproduction cost, or other specific incidental costs, incurred in giving the person access to that particular information.

             (5)  If there is a charge for accessing the information, the agency or Minister must publish details of the charge in the same way as the information is published under this section.

Time limit for publication

             (6)  The agency or Minister must comply with this section within 10 working days after the day the person is given access to the document.

                     (a)  the day the applicant pays the amount of the charge (or a deposit on account of the charge prescribed by the regulations), whether or not the decision to impose the charge has been considered under section 29, or is the subject of a review under this Act;

                     (c)  may hold a part of the hearing in the absence of a review party (or a review party’s representative) if it is necessary to do so to prevent disclosure to the review party (or the review party’s representative) of any evidence or matter relating to the proceeding that is of a confidential nature.

### Division 1—Guide to this Part

##### <a id="68"></a>68  Investigations and complaints—guide

* * *

This Part is about investigations by the Information Commissioner and by the Ombudsman.

Division 2 sets up a system for investigations by the Information Commissioner.

The Information Commissioner may investigate an action taken by an agency in the performance of functions or the exercise of powers under this Act on a complaint from a person, or on the Information Commissioner’s initiative.

If a person disputes the merits of an access refusal decision or an access grant decision, this Act provides elsewhere for the review of that decision (see Parts VI, VII and VIIA).

However, this does not prevent a person from making a complaint to the Information Commissioner about the way in which the agency has handled the decision.

The Information Commissioner has powers to obtain documents, to question persons and to enter premises (see Subdivision D of Division 2).

At the conclusion of the investigation, the Information Commissioner must give a notice to the complainant and to the respondent agency about the Information Commissioner’s findings, with any recommendations that the Information Commissioner believes the agency ought to implement (see section 86).

If the Information Commissioner is not satisfied that the agency has taken adequate and appropriate action to implement the recommendations, the Information Commissioner may take further steps (see sections 89, 89A and 89B).

Division 3 deals with the investigation of complaints by the Ombudsman about action taken under this Act.

##### <a id="24AA"></a>24AA  When does a _practical refusal reason_ exist?

             (1)  For the purposes of section 24, a **_practical refusal reason_** exists in relation to a request for a document if either (or both) of the following applies:

                     (a)  the work involved in processing the request:

                              (i)  in the case of an agency—would substantially and unreasonably divert the resources of the agency from its other operations; or

                             (ii)  in the case of a Minister—would substantially and unreasonably interfere with the performance of the Minister’s functions;

                     (b)  the request does not satisfy the requirement in paragraph 15(2)(b) (identification of documents).

             (2)  Subject to subsection (3), but without limiting the matters to which the agency or Minister may have regard, in deciding whether a practical refusal reason exists, the agency or Minister must have regard to the resources that would have to be used for the following:

                     (a)  identifying, locating or collating the documents within the filing system of the agency, or the office of the Minister;

                     (b)  deciding whether to grant, refuse or defer access to a document to which the request relates, or to grant access to an edited copy of such a document, including resources that would have to be used for:

                             (ii)  consulting with any person or body in relation to the request;

                     (c)  making a copy, or an edited copy, of the document;

                     (d)  notifying any interim or final decision on the request.

             (3)  In deciding whether a practical refusal reason exists, an agency or Minister must not have regard to:

                     (a)  any reasons that the applicant gives for requesting access; or

                     (b)  the agency’s or Minister’s belief as to what the applicant’s reasons are for requesting access; or

                     (c)  any maximum amount, specified in the regulations, payable as a charge for processing a request of that kind.

##### <a id="24AB"></a>24AB  What is a _request consultation process_?

Scope

             (1)  This section sets out what is a **_request consultation process_** for the purposes of section 24.

Requirement to notify

             (2)  The agency or Minister must give the applicant a written notice stating the following:

                     (a)  an intention to refuse access to a document in accordance with a request;

                     (b)  the practical refusal reason;

                     (c)  the name of an officer of the agency or member of staff of the Minister (the **_contact person_**) with whom the applicant may consult during a period;

                     (d)  details of how the applicant may contact the contact person;

                     (e)  that the period (the **_consultation period_**) during which the applicant may consult with the contact person is 14 days after the day the applicant is given the notice.

Assistance to revise request

             (3)  If the applicant contacts the contact person during the consultation period in accordance with the notice, the agency or Minister must take reasonable steps to assist the applicant to revise the request so that the practical refusal reason no longer exists.

             (4)  For the purposes of subsection (3), **_reasonable steps_** includes the following:

                     (a)  giving the applicant a reasonable opportunity to consult with the contact person;

                     (b)  providing the applicant with any information that would assist the applicant to revise the request.

Extension of consultation period

             (5)  The contact person may, with the applicant’s agreement, extend the consultation period by written notice to the applicant.

Outcome of request consultation process

             (6)  The applicant must, before the end of the consultation period, do one of the following, by written notice to the agency or Minister:

                     (a)  withdraw the request;

                     (b)  make a revised request;

                     (c)  indicate that the applicant does not wish to revise the request.

             (7)  The request is taken to have been withdrawn under subsection (6) at the end of the consultation period if:

                     (a)  the applicant does not consult the contact person during the consultation period in accordance with the notice; or

                     (b)  the applicant does not do one of the things mentioned in subsection (6) before the end of the consultation period.

Consultation period to be disregarded in calculating processing period

             (8)  The period starting on the day an applicant is given a notice under subsection (2) and ending on the day the applicant does one of the things mentioned in paragraph (6)(b) or (c) is to be disregarded in working out the 30 day period mentioned in paragraph 15(5)(b).

Note:          Paragraph 15(5)(b) requires that an agency or Minister take all reasonable steps to notify an applicant of a decision on the applicant’s request within 30 days after the request is made.

No more than one request consultation process required

             (9)  To avoid doubt, this section only obliges the agency or Minister to undertake a request consultation process once for any particular request.

## 33  Section 24A
