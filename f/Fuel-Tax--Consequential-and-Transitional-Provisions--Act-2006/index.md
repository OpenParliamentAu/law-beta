Note:          An assessment made under this section is a reviewable indirect tax decision: see Subdivision 105‑B.

##### <a id="105‑10"></a>105‑10  Request for assessment

##### <a id="105‑25"></a>105‑25  Amendment of assessment

                   Any unpaid * net amount, * net fuel amount or amount of * indirect tax (together with any relevant * general interest charge under section 105‑80) ceases to be payable 4 years after it became payable by you unless:

                     (a)  within those 4 years the Commissioner has required payment of the amount by giving a notice to you; or

                     (b)  the Commissioner is satisfied that the payment of the amount was avoided by fraud or evaded.

##### <a id="105‑55"></a>105‑55  Time limit on refunds and credits

             (1)  You are not entitled to a refund or credit to which this subsection applies in respect of a * tax period or importation unless:

                     (a)  within 4 years after:

                              (i)  the end of the tax period; or

                             (ii)  the importation;

                            as the case requires, you notify the Commissioner (in a * GST return or otherwise) that you are entitled to the refund or credit; or

                     (b)  within that period the Commissioner notifies you (in a notice of assessment or otherwise) that you are entitled to the refund or credit; or

                     (c)  in the case of a credit—the credit is taken into account in working out a * net amount or * net fuel amount that the Commissioner may recover from you only because of paragraph 105‑50(b).

             (2)  Subsection (1) applies to:

                     (a)  a refund under section 35‑5 of the * GST Act or section 61‑5 of the _Fuel Tax Act 2006_ in respect of a particular * tax period; or

                     (c)  a * wine tax credit the amount of which could have been included in a reduction of your * net amount for a tax period under section 21‑15 of the * Wine Tax Act; or

                     (d)  a refund of an amount of * indirect tax relating to an importation.

Fuel tax—non‑business taxpayers

             (3)  If you are neither * registered for GST nor * required to be registered for GST, you are not entitled to a refund or * fuel tax credit to which this subsection applies in respect of a * fuel tax return period, acquisition, manufacture or importation unless:

                     (a)  within 4 years after:

                              (i)  the end of the fuel tax return period; or

                             (ii)  the acquisition, manufacture or importation;

                            (as the case requires) you notify the Commissioner that you are entitled to the refund or credit; or

                     (b)  within that period the Commissioner notifies you (in a notice of assessment or otherwise) that you are entitled to the refund or credit; or

                     (c)  in the case of a fuel tax credit—the credit is taken into account in working out a * net fuel amount that the Commissioner may recover from you only because of paragraph 105‑50(b).

             (4)  Subsection (3) applies to:

                     (a)  a refund, under section 61‑5 of the _Fuel Tax Act 2006_, of a * net fuel amount attributable to a * fuel tax return period; or

                     (b)  a * fuel tax credit for * taxable fuel that you acquire, manufacture or import.

             (5)  To avoid doubt, if, under subsection (3), you are not entitled to a * fuel tax credit, then you are not entitled to a refund under section 61‑5 of the _Fuel Tax Act 2006_ in relation to the credit.

##### <a id="105‑60"></a>105‑60  Reliance on Commissioner’s interpretation of an indirect tax law (other than a fuel tax law)

             (1)  This section applies to you if:

                     (a)  the Commissioner alters a previous * indirect tax ruling that applied to you; and

                     (b)  relying on the previous ruling, you have underpaid a * net amount or an amount of * indirect tax, or the Commissioner has overpaid an amount under section 35‑5 of the * GST Act, in respect of one or more:

                              (i)  * taxable supplies or * taxable importations; or

                             (ii)  * wine taxable dealings; or

                            (iii)  * taxable supplies of luxury cars or * taxable importations of luxury cars; or

                            (iv)  * creditable acquisitions or * creditable importations;

                            that happened before the alteration.

Note:          For reliance on the Commissioner’s interpretation of a fuel tax law, see Division 357.

             (2)  Unless the Commissioner is satisfied that you contributed to the giving, or continuing in force, of the earlier ruling by a misstatement or by suppressing a material fact:

                     (a)  the underpaid * net amount or * indirect tax ceases to be payable; or

                     (b)  the overpaid amount under section 35‑5 of the * GST Act is taken to have been payable in full;

from when the previous ruling was made.

             (3)  In deciding whether an * indirect tax ruling applies to you, or whether a ruling has been altered:

                     (a)  a * private indirect tax ruling applies only to the entity to whom it was given; and

                     (b)  so far as a private indirect tax ruling conflicts with an earlier * public indirect tax ruling, the private indirect tax ruling prevails; and

                     (c)  so far as a public indirect tax ruling conflicts with an earlier private indirect tax ruling, the public indirect tax ruling prevails; and

                     (d)  an alteration that a later indirect tax ruling makes to an earlier indirect tax ruling is disregarded so far as the alteration results from a change in the law that came into operation after the earlier indirect tax ruling was given.

##### <a id="105‑65"></a>105‑65  Restriction on refunds

             (1)  The Commissioner need not give you a refund to which this section applies, or apply an amount under Division 3 or 3A of Part IIB to which this section applies, if:

                     (a)  you overpaid the amount, or the amount was not refunded to you, because a * supply was treated as a * taxable supply to any extent; and

                     (b)  the supply is not a taxable supply to that extent (for example, because it is * GST‑free); and

                     (c)  one of the following applies:

                              (i)  the Commissioner is not satisfied that you have reimbursed a corresponding amount to the recipient of the supply;

                             (ii)  the recipient is * registered or * required to be registered.

#### Subdivision 105‑D—General interest charge and penalties

**Table of sections**

105‑80      General interest charge

105‑85      Amending Acts cannot impose penalties or general interest charge earlier than 28 days after Royal Assent

##### <a id="105‑80"></a>105‑80  General interest charge

             (1)  If any of an amount (the **_liability_**) to which this section applies remains unpaid after the time by which it is due to be paid, you are liable to pay the * general interest charge on the unpaid amount of the liability for each day in the period that:

                     (a)  started at the beginning of the day by which the liability was due to be paid; and

                     (b)  finishes at the end of the last day on which, at the end of the day, any of the following remains unpaid:

                              (i)  the liability;

                             (ii)  general interest charge on any of the liability.

Note:          The general interest charge is worked out under Division 1 of Part IIA.

             (2)  This section applies to either of the following amounts that you are liable to pay:

                     (a)  a * net fuel amount;

                     (b)  an amount of * indirect tax.

##### <a id="105‑85"></a>105‑85  Amending Acts cannot impose penalties or general interest charge earlier than 28 days after Royal Assent

             (1)  An Act that amends an * indirect tax law does not have the effect of making you liable to:

                     (a)  a penalty for an offence against an indirect tax law; or

                     (b)  * general interest charge under section 105‑80;

for any act or omission that happens before the 28th day (the **_postponed day_**) after the day on which the amending Act receives the Royal Assent.

             (2)  If the amending Act would (apart from this section) have the effect of making you liable to such a penalty or charge because you contravened a requirement to do something:

                     (a)  within a specified period ending before the postponed day; or

                     (b)  before a specified time happening before the postponed day;

the requirement has effect instead by reference to a period ending at the start of the postponed day, or by reference to the start of the postponed day, as the case requires.

             (3)  This section does not relieve you from liability to such a penalty or charge to the extent to which the liability would have existed if the amending Act had not been enacted.

##### <a id="105‑105"></a>105‑105  Certificate of amount payable is prima facie evidence

                   The presentation of a certificate signed by the Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner certifying that, from the time specified in the certificate, an amount was payable under an * indirect tax law (whether to or by the Commissioner) is prima facie evidence:

                     (a)  that the amount is payable from that time; and
