##### <a id="6"></a>6  Exemption of certain benefits provided under the Defence Service Homes Act

##### <a id="6AA"></a>6AA  Exemption of benefits provided to certain people

                   For the purposes of the application of the Assessment Act in accordance with this Act, if a benefit (other than a benefit referred to in section 6) is provided, in respect of the employment of a Commonwealth employee, because of the employee being:

                     (a)  a veteran as defined by subsection 5C(1) of the Entitlements Act to whom, or in respect of whom, a pension is payable under Part II of that Act;  or

                     (b)  a veteran as defined by subsection 5C(1) of the Entitlements Act who is eligible to receive a service pension, or in respect of whom a service pension is payable, under Part III of that Act; or
