##### <a id="31"></a>31  Waiver of immunity from execution

             (1)  A foreign State may at any time by agreement waive the application of section 30 in relation to property, but it shall not be taken to have done so by reason only that it has submitted to the jurisdiction.

             (2)  The waiver may be subject to specified limitations.

             (2)  Where a foreign State is not immune in a proceeding against or in connection with a ship or cargo, section 30 does not prevent the arrest, detention or sale of the ship or cargo if, at the time of the arrest or detention:

                     (a)  the ship or cargo was commercial property; and

                     (b)  in the case of a cargo that was then being carried by a ship belonging to the same or to some other foreign State—the ship was commercial property.

             (3)  For the purposes of this section:

                     (a)  commercial property is property, other than diplomatic property or military property, that is in use by the foreign State concerned substantially for commercial purposes; and

                     (b)  property that is apparently vacant or apparently not in use shall be taken to be being used for commercial purposes unless the court is satisfied that it has been set aside otherwise than for commercial purposes.

##### <a id="33"></a>33  Execution against immovable property etc.

                   Where:

                     (a)  property:

                              (i)  has been acquired by succession or gift; or

                     (b)  a right in respect of the property has been established as against a foreign State by a judgment or order in a proceeding as mentioned in section 14;

                     (a)  the separate entity would, apart from the operation of section 10, have been immune from the jurisdiction; and

                     (b)  it has submitted to the jurisdiction.

## Part V—Miscellaneous

##### <a id="37"></a>37  Effect of agreements on separate entities

                   An agreement made by a foreign State and applicable to a separate entity of that State has effect, for the purposes of this Act, as though the separate entity were a party to the agreement.

##### <a id="38"></a>38  Power to set aside process etc.

                   Where, on the application of a foreign State or a separate entity of a foreign State, a court is satisfied that a judgment, order or process of the court made or issued in a proceeding with respect to the foreign State or entity is inconsistent with an immunity conferred by or under this Act, the court shall set aside the judgment, order or process so far as it is so inconsistent.

##### <a id="39"></a>39  Discovery

             (1)  A penalty by way of fine or committal shall not be imposed in relation to a failure or refusal by a foreign State or by a person on behalf of a foreign State to disclose or produce a document or to furnish information for the purposes of a proceeding.

             (1)  The Minister for Foreign Affairs may certify in writing that, for the purposes of this Act:

             (4)  A delegation under subsection (2) does not prevent the exercise of the power by the Minister.

             (5)  A certificate under this section is admissible as evidence of the facts and matters stated in it and is conclusive as to those facts and matters.

##### <a id="41"></a>41  Certificate as to use

                   For the purposes of this Act, a certificate in writing given by the person for the time being performing the functions of the head of a foreign State's diplomatic mission in Australia to the effect that property specified in the certificate, being property:

                     (a)  in which the foreign State or a separate entity of the foreign State has an interest; or

                     (b)  that is in the possession or under the control of the foreign State or of a separate entity of the foreign State;

is or was at a specified time in use for purposes specified in the certificate is admissible as evidence of the facts stated in the certificate.

##### <a id="42"></a>42  Restrictions and extensions of immunities and privileges—general

             (1)  Where the Minister is satisfied that an immunity or privilege conferred by this Act in relation to a foreign State is not accorded by the law of the foreign State in relation to Australia, the Governor‑General may make regulations modifying the operation of this Act with respect to those immunities and privileges in relation to the foreign State.

             (2)  Where the Minister is satisfied that the immunities and privileges conferred by this Act in relation to a foreign State differ from those required by a treaty, convention or other agreement to which the foreign State and Australia are parties, the Governor‑General may make regulations modifying the operation of this Act with respect to those immunities and privileges in relation to the foreign State so that this Act as so modified conforms with the treaty, convention or agreement.

             (3)  Regulations made under subsection (1) or (2) that are expressed to extend or restrict an immunity from the jurisdiction may be expressed to extend to a proceeding that was instituted before the commencement of the regulations and has not been finally disposed of.

             (4)  Regulations made under subsection (1) or (2) that are expressed to extend or restrict an immunity from execution or other relief may be expressed to extend to a proceeding that was instituted before the commencement of the regulations and in which procedures to give effect to orders for execution or other relief have not been completed.

             (6)  Regulations under this section have effect notwithstanding that they are inconsistent with an Act (other than this Act) as in force at the time when the regulations came into operation.

             (7)  Jurisdiction is conferred on the Federal Court of Australia and, to the extent that the Constitution permits, on the courts of the Territories, and the courts of the States are invested with federal jurisdiction, in respect of matters arising under the regulations but a court of a Territory shall not exercise any jurisdiction so conferred in respect of property that is not within that Territory or a Territory in which the court may exercise jurisdiction and a court of a State shall not exercise any jurisdiction so invested in respect of property that is not within that State.

##### <a id="42A"></a>42A  Extension of immunities—emergency prevention and management

                     (b)  for the purposes of preparing for, preventing or managing emergencies or disasters (whether natural or otherwise) in Australia.
