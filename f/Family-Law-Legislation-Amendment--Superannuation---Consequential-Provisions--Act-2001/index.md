<dt>(a)</dt><dd>a payment split applies to a splittable payment; and</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>as a result, a payment is made to the non-member spouse (or to his or her

new ETP
<dl compact="">

Example:	A has a superannuation interest that is subject to 2

payment splits in respect of A's marriages to B and C (in that order). The

first payment split provides for a 60% share to B and the second payment split

provides for a 50% share to C. 	Assume that any payment to B or C would have been an eligible termination payment for A (if the payment had been made to A). A becomes entitled to a splittable payment of $100\. 	By applying subsection&#160;(1) in relation to the first payment split, B gets an eligible termination payment of $60\. 	By applying subsection&#160;(1) in relation to the second payment split, C gets an eligible termination payment of $20\.  </dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

_corresponding amount_ means the amount that would have been that

component if the whole of the pre-split amount had been an eligible termination

payment in relation to the original payee. _pre-split amount_ means the amount to which the payment split was applied.  </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Example:	To continue the example in subsection&#160;(1), assume

A's undeducted contributions (one of the identified components) are $40\. 	In relation to B, the pre-split amount is $100 (the amount of the splittable payment). The undeducted contributions component of B's eligible termination payment is:  </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

	The other identified components of B's eligible termination

payment are worked out in a corresponding way. 	In relation to C, the pre-split amount is $40 (the original amount of $100 less the $60 paid to B under the first payment split).
