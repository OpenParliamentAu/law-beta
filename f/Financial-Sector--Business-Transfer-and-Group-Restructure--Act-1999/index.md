## Part 2—Overview of Act

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Overview of Act

             (1)  This Act provides for 2 kinds of transfers of business of regulated bodies or bodies corporate related to regulated bodies:

                     (a)  **_voluntary transfers_** (these are transfers under Part 3); and

                     (b)  **_compulsory transfers_** (these are transfers under Part 4).

Either kind of transfer may be a partial transfer or a total transfer.

             (2)  A transfer of business of a regulated body, or of a body corporate related to a regulated body, is a **_partial transfer_** if it relates to some, but not all, of the transferring body’s business (including any business that is not regulated business).

             (3)  A transfer of business of a regulated body, or of a body corporate related to a regulated body, is a **_total transfer_** if it relates to all of the transferring body’s business (including any business that is not regulated business).

             (4)  For a voluntary transfer of business to take effect, APRA must:

                     (a)  receive an application for the transfer from the regulated bodies concerned (the **_transferring body_** and the **_receiving body_**); and

                     (b)  approve the application in writing (the **_voluntary transfer approval_**); and

                     (c)  issue a certificate (the **_certificate of transfer_**) stating that the transfer is to take effect.

The transfer of business takes effect when the certificate of transfer comes into force. 

             (5)  For a compulsory transfer of business to take effect, APRA must:

                     (a)  make a determination (the **_compulsory transfer determination_**) that there is to be a transfer of business between the bodies concerned (the **_transferring body_** and the **_receiving body_**); and

                     (b)  issue a certificate (the **_certificate of transfer_**) stating that the transfer is to take effect.

The transfer of business takes effect when the certificate of transfer comes into force. 

             (6)  Business of regulated bodies may also be transferred otherwise than under this Act, for example in accordance with section 63 of the _Banking Act 1959_ or Part 9 of the _Life Insurance Act 1995_.

             (7)  Part 4A deals with proposals by ADI, general insurer or life insurance company groups to restructure the group (under Part 5.1 of the _Corporations Act 2001_).

Note:          For an overview of Part 4A, see section 36A.

## Part 3—Voluntary transfers

### Division 1—Outline of Part

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Outline of Part

             (1)  For a voluntary transfer of business to take effect, APRA must:

                     (a)  receive an application for the transfer from the regulated bodies concerned (the **_transferring body_** and the **_receiving body_**) (see section 10); and

                     (b)  approve the application in writing (the **_voluntary transfer approval_**) (see section 11); and

                     (c)  issue a certificate (the **_certificate of transfer_**) stating that the transfer is to take effect (see section 18).

             (2)  APRA must make the voluntary transfer approval if specified criteria are met (see section 11).

             (3)  The voluntary transfer approval may impose conditions to be complied with by the transferring body or the receiving body either before or after the certificate of transfer is issued (see section 16).

             (4)  APRA may only issue the certificate of transfer if specified criteria are met. The certificate must specify when it comes into force (see section 18).

             (5)  The transfer of business takes effect when the certificate of transfer comes into force (see section 22).

### Division 2—Approval of voluntary transfers

##### <a id="10"></a>10  Application for approval of voluntary transfer

             (1)  2 regulated bodies of the same kind may apply in writing to APRA for approval of a transfer of business from one of the bodies to the other body. The transfer cannot relate only to business of the transferring body that is not regulated business.

             (2)  The application must be in the form prescribed by the transfer rules and must contain or be accompanied by the information required by the transfer rules.

Note:          APRA may impose a charge in respect of the application—see section 51 of the _Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998_.

             (3)  For the purposes of this section, 2 regulated bodies are of the same kind if:

                     (a)  they are both ADIs; or

                     (b)  they are both life insurance companies.

##### <a id="11"></a>11  Approval of applications

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), APRA must, in writing (the **_voluntary transfer approval_**), approve a transfer of business if APRA  considers that:

                     (a)  application for approval of the transfer has been made in accordance with section 10; and

                     (b)  the transfer has been adequately adopted (see section 13) by:

                              (i)  the transferring body; and

                             (ii)  the receiving body; and

                     (c)  the transfer should be approved, having regard to:

                              (i)  the interests of the depositors or policy owners of the transferring body when viewed as a group; and

                             (ii)  the interests of the depositors or policy owners of the receiving body when viewed as a group; and

                            (iii)  the interests of the financial sector as a whole; and

                            (iv)  any other matters that APRA considers relevant; and

                     (d)  legislation to facilitate the transfer that satisfies the requirements of section 14 has been enacted in the State or Territory in which the transferring body is established and the State or Territory in which the receiving body is established; and

                     (e)  either:

                              (i)  the Minister has consented to the transfer; or

                             (ii)  the Minister’s consent to the transfer is not required (see section 15).

             (2)  APRA must not approve the transfer of business if it considers that the transfer should not be approved, having regard to provisions of another Act:

                     (a)  that are prescribed for the purposes of subsection 43(4); or

                     (b)  referred to in subsection 43(5), (6), (7) or (8).

             (3)  The voluntary transfer approval must be signed by an authorised APRA officer.

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Consultation about approving the application

             (1)  In deciding whether to approve the transfer of business, APRA may consult with any or all of the following:

                     (a)  officers or employees of the States and Territories;

                     (b)  the Reserve Bank of Australia;

                     (c)  any other person or body that APRA considers should be consulted.

             (2)  Subject to subsections (3) and (4), in deciding whether to approve the transfer of business, APRA must consult with:

                     (a)  the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission; and 

                     (b)  the Australian Securities and Investments Commission; and

                     (c)  the Commissioner of Taxation.

             (3)  APRA does not have to consult with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission in relation to the transfer of business if the Commission has notified APRA, in writing, that it does not wish to be consulted about:

                     (a)  the transfer; or

                     (b)  a class of transfers that includes the transfer.

             (4)  APRA does not have to consult with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in relation to the transfer of business if the Commission has notified APRA, in writing, that it does not wish to be consulted about:

                     (a)  the transfer; or

                     (b)  a class of transfers that includes the transfer.

             (5)  APRA does not have to consult with the Commissioner of Taxation in relation to the transfer of business if the Commissioner has notified APRA, in writing, that he or she does not wish to be consulted about:

                     (a)  the transfer; or

                     (b)  a class of transfers that includes the transfer.

##### <a id="13"></a>13  Adequate adoption

                   For the purposes of paragraph 11(1)(b), the transfer of business has been **_adequately adopted_** by a body if:

                     (a)  the transfer has been adopted by or on behalf of the body, or by or on behalf of the members or a class of the members of the body, in a way prescribed by the transfer rules; and

                     (b)  APRA considers that adoption of the transfer in that way adequately takes into account the interests of members of the body.

##### <a id="14"></a>14  Complementary State or Territory legislation

                   State or Territory legislation referred to in paragraph 11(1)(d) must include provision to ensure that, when a certificate of transfer comes into force under Division 3, the receiving body is taken to be the successor in law to the transferring body, to the extent of the transfer. In particular, the legislation must provide that:

                     (a)  assets of the transferring body vest in the receiving body, to the extent of the transfer; and

                     (b)  liabilities of the transferring body become liabilities of the receiving body, to the extent of the transfer; and

                     (c)  the duties, obligations, immunities, rights and privileges applying to the transferring body apply to the receiving body, to the extent of the transfer; and

                     (d)  if there is an approved section 20 statement in relation to the transfer that specifies:

                              (i)  that particular things are to happen or are taken to be the case—those things are taken to happen, or to be the case, in accordance with the statement; or

                             (ii)  a mechanism for determining things that are to happen or are taken to be the case—things determined in accordance with that mechanism are taken to happen, or to be the case, as determined in accordance with that mechanism.

##### <a id="15"></a>15  Minister’s power to decide that his or her consent is not required

                   The Minister’s consent to the transfer of business (see paragraph 11(1)(e)) is not required if the Minister has, in writing, determined that his or her consent is not required in relation to:

                     (a)  the transfer; or

                     (b)  a class of transfers that includes the transfer.

##### <a id="16"></a>16  Approval may impose conditions

             (1)  The voluntary transfer approval may impose conditions of either or both of the following kinds:

                     (a)  conditions to be complied with by the transferring body or the receiving body before a certificate of transfer is issued in relation to the transfer of business;

                     (b)  conditions to be complied with by the transferring body or the receiving body after a certificate of transfer has been issued or has come into force in relation to the transfer of business.

Note 1:       Failure to comply with a condition referred to in paragraph (a) will mean that a certificate of transfer cannot be issued (see subsection 18(1)).

Note 2:       Failure to comply with a condition referred to in paragraph (b) will not prevent the issue of a certificate of transfer, but will be an offence under subsection (4).

             (2)  The transferring body or the receiving body may apply in writing to APRA to have a condition that applies to it varied or revoked.

             (3)  APRA may, by notice in writing given to the body that made the application, approve the variation or revocation if it is satisfied that the variation or revocation is appropriate. A variation or revocation that is approved by APRA has effect accordingly.

             (4)  The transferring body or the receiving body is guilty of an offence if:

                     (a)  a condition of a kind referred to in paragraph (1)(b) applies to that body; and

                     (b)  that body fails to comply with the condition.

                    Maximum penalty for contravention of this subsection: 200 penalty units.

Note 1:       Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.

Note 2:       If a body corporate is convicted of an offence against this subsection, subsection 4B(3) of the _Crimes Act 1914_ allows a court to impose a fine of up to 5 times the penalty stated above.

##### <a id="17"></a>17  Notice of decision

             (1)  If APRA approves the transfer of business, APRA must give a copy of the voluntary transfer approval to the transferring body and the receiving body.

             (2)  If APRA refuses to approve the transfer of business, APRA must give written notice of the refusal to the transferring body and the receiving body. The notice must include a statement of the reasons why the approval was refused.

### Division 3—Process by which voluntary transfers take effect

##### <a id="18"></a>18  Certificate of transfer

                     (a)  has made a voluntary transfer approval; and

                     (b)  considers that all conditions of a kind referred to in paragraph 16(1)(a) that are imposed by the approval have been complied with; and

                     (c)  if the transfer is a partial transfer—has been given a statement of detail in relation to the partial transfer (see section 19); and

                     (d)  is not aware of any reason why the transfer should not go ahead;

             (2)  The certificate must:

                     (a)  include the names of the transferring body and the receiving body; and

                     (b)  state whether the transfer is a total transfer or a partial transfer; and

                             (ii)  any approved section 20 statement; and

                     (d)  subject to subsection (3), state when the certificate is to come into force (either by specifying a date as the date it comes into force, or by specifying that the date it comes into force is a date worked out in accordance with provisions of the certificate); and

                     (e)  be signed by an authorised APRA officer.

             (3)  APRA must, in deciding when the certificate is to come into force, take into account the wishes of the transferring body and the receiving body.

             (4)  The certificate comes into force in accordance with the statement included in the certificate as required by paragraph (2)(d).

##### <a id="19"></a>19  Partial transfer—statement of detail to be provided

                   If the transfer is a partial transfer, before APRA issues a certificate of transfer in relation to the transfer, APRA must be provided with a written statement:

                     (a)  that lists, in detail, the assets and liabilities of the transferring body that are to be transferred to the receiving body; and

                     (b)  that APRA is satisfied has been agreed to by the transferring body and the receiving body.

##### <a id="20"></a>20  Agreements about matters connected with the transfer

             (1)  The transferring body or the receiving body, or both of those bodies, may provide APRA with a written statement specifying, or specifying a mechanism for determining, things that are to happen, or that are taken to be the case, in relation to assets and liabilities that are to be transferred, or in relation to the transfer of business that is to be effected.

Note:          If the transfer is a partial transfer, the statement may be included with the statement of detail under section 19.

             (2)  APRA may, in writing, approve the statement before issuing the certificate of transfer if APRA is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the statement has been agreed to by the transferring body and the receiving body; and

                     (b)  the matters specified in the statement are appropriate.

##### <a id="21"></a>21  Notice of decision

             (1)  If APRA issues the certificate of transfer, APRA must give a copy of the certificate to the transferring body and the receiving body.

             (2)  If APRA refuses to issue the certificate of transfer, APRA must give written notice of the refusal to the transferring body and the receiving body. The notice must include a statement of the reasons why the certificate was not issued.

##### <a id="22"></a>22  Time and effect of voluntary transfer

             (1)  When the certificate of transfer comes into force, the receiving body becomes the successor in law of the transferring body, to the extent of the transfer. In particular:

                     (a)  if the transfer is a total transfer—all the assets and liabilities of the transferring body, wherever those assets and liabilities are located, become (respectively) assets and liabilities of the receiving body without any transfer, conveyance or assignment; and

                     (b)  if the transfer is a partial transfer—all the assets and liabilities of the transferring body that are included in the list of assets and liabilities specified in the statement of detail, wherever those assets and liabilities are located, become (respectively) assets and liabilities of the receiving body without any transfer conveyance or assignment; and

                     (c)  to the extent of the transfer, the duties, obligations, immunities, rights and privileges applying to the transferring body apply to the receiving body.

             (2)  If there is an approved section 20 statement in relation to the transfer, then:

                     (a)  if the statement specifies that particular things are to happen or are taken to be the case—those things are, by force of this section, taken to happen, or to be the case, in accordance with the statement; and

                     (b)  if the statement specifies a mechanism for determining things that are to happen or are taken to be the case—things determined in accordance with that mechanism are, by force of this section, taken to happen, or to be the case, as determined in accordance with that mechanism.

             (3)  Subject to subsection (2), if:

                     (a)  the transfer is a total transfer; and

                     (b)  immediately before the certificate comes into force, proceedings (including arbitration proceedings) to which the transferring body was a party were pending or existing in any court or tribunal;

the receiving body is, on and after the day when the certificate comes into force, substituted for the transferring body as a party to the proceedings and has the same rights in the proceedings as the transferring body had.

Note:          An alternative way of dealing with substitution of parties (which is available for total or partial transfers) is to deal with the matter in an approved section 20 statement (see subsection (2)).

             (4)  Subject to subsection (2), if:

                     (a)  the transfer is a total transfer; and

                     (b)  on the day when the certificate comes into force, documentary or other evidence would (disregarding the transfer) have been admissible for or against the interests of the transferring body;

that evidence is admissible, on or at any time after that day, for or against the interests of the receiving body.

Note:          An alternative way of dealing with admissibility of evidence (which is available for total or partial transfers) is to deal with the matter in an approved section 20 statement (see subsection (2)).

             (5)  Subject to subsection (2), if the transfer is a total transfer, on and after the day when the certificate comes into force, each translated instrument continues to have effect, according to its tenor, as if a reference in the instrument to the transferring body were a reference to the receiving body. For this purpose:

                    <a name="translat-instrum"></a>**_translated instrument_** means an instrument (including an Act or other legislative instrument) subsisting immediately before the day when the certificate comes into force:

                     (a)  to which the transferring body is a party; or

                     (b)  that was given to, by or in favour of, the transferring body; or

                     (c)  that refers to the transferring body; or

                     (d)  under which money is, or may become, payable, or other property is, or may become, liable to be transferred, to or by the transferring body.

Note:          An alternative way of dealing with references in instruments (which is available for total or partial transfers) is to deal with the matter in an approved section 20 statement (see subsection (2)).

             (6)  Subject to subsection (2), on and after the day when the certificate comes into force, a place that, immediately before that day, was a place of business for the transferring body in relation to business that was transferred to the receiving body is taken to be a place of business for the receiving body.

Note:          An alternative way of dealing with places of business is to deal with the matter in an approved section 20 statement (see subsection (2)).

##### <a id="23"></a>23  Employment unaffected

             (1)  This section applies to every person who, immediately before the day when the certificate of transfer comes into force, was performing duty in the transferring body.

             (2)  The terms and conditions of employment (including any accrued entitlement to employment benefits) of each person to whom this section applies are not affected by the operation or effect of this Part or of any State or Territory legislation referred to in paragraph 11(1)(d).

##### <a id="35"></a>35  Time and effect of compulsory  transfer

             (1)  When the certificate of transfer comes into force, the receiving body becomes the successor in law of the transferring body, to the extent of the transfer. In particular:

                     (a)  if the transfer is a total transfer—all the assets and liabilities of the transferring body, wherever those assets and liabilities are located, become (respectively) assets and liabilities of the receiving body without any transfer, conveyance or assignment; and

                     (b)  if the transfer is a partial transfer—all the assets and liabilities of the transferring body that are included in the list referred to in paragraph 33(2)(c), wherever those assets and liabilities are located, become (respectively) assets and liabilities of the receiving body without any transfer conveyance or assignment; and

                     (c)  to the extent of the transfer, the duties, obligations, immunities, rights and privileges applying to the transferring body apply to the receiving body.

             (2)  If the certificate includes provisions of a kind referred to in subsection 33(3):

                     (a)  if the provisions specify that particular things are to happen or are taken to be the case—those things are, by force of this section, taken to happen, or to be the case, in accordance with those provisions; and

                     (b)  if the provisions specify a mechanism for determining things that are to happen or are taken to be the case—things determined in accordance with that mechanism are, by force of this section, taken to happen, or to be the case, as determined in accordance with that mechanism.

             (3)  If there is an approved section 30 statement in relation to the transfer, then:

                     (a)  if the statement specifies that particular things are to happen or are taken to be the case—those things are, by force of this section, taken to happen, or to be the case, in accordance with the statement; and

                     (b)  immediately before the certificate comes into force, proceedings (including arbitration proceedings) to which the transferring body was a party were pending or existing in any court or tribunal;

the receiving body is, on and after the day when the certificate comes into force, substituted for the transferring body as a party to the proceedings and has the same rights in the proceedings as the transferring body had.

Note:          Alternative ways of dealing with substitution of parties (which are available for total or partial transfers) are:

(a)           to deal with the matter in the certificate of transfer (see subsection (2)); or

(b)           to deal with the matter in an approved section 30 statement (see subsection (3)).

             (5)  Subject to subsections (2) and (3), if:

                     (a)  the transfer is a total transfer; and

                     (b)  on the day when the certificate comes into force, documentary or other evidence would (disregarding the transfer) have been admissible for or against the interests of the transferring body;

that evidence is admissible, on or at any time after that day, for or against the interests of the receiving body.

Note:          Alternative ways of dealing with admissibility of evidence (which are available for total or partial transfers) are:

(a)           to deal with the matter in the certificate of transfer (see subsection (2)); or

(b)           to deal with the matter in an approved section 30 statement (see subsection (3)).

             (6)  Subject to subsections (2) and (3), if the transfer is a total transfer, on and after the day when the certificate comes into force, each translated instrument continues to have effect, according to its tenor, as if a reference in the instrument to the transferring body were a reference to the receiving body. For this purpose:

                    <a name="translat-instrum"></a>**_translated instrument_** means an instrument (including a legislative instrument other than this Act) subsisting immediately before the day when the certificate comes into force:

                     (a)  to which the transferring body is a party; or

                     (b)  that was given to, by or in favour of, the transferring body; or

                     (c)  that refers to the transferring body; or

                     (d)  under which money is, or may become, payable, or other property is, or may become, liable to be transferred, to or by the transferring body.

Note:          Alternative ways of dealing with references in instruments (which are available for total or partial transfers) are:

(a)           to deal with the matter in the certificate of transfer (see subsection (2)); or

(b)           to deal with the matter in an approved section 30 statement (see subsection (3)).

             (7)  Subject to subsections (2) and (3), on and after the day when the certificate comes into force, a place that, immediately before that day, was a place of business for the transferring body in relation to business that was transferred to the receiving body is taken to be a place of business for the receiving body.

Note:          Alternative ways of dealing with places of business are:

(a)           to deal with the matter in the certificate of transfer (see subsection (2)); or

(b)           to deal with the matter in an approved section 30 statement (see subsection (3)).

##### <a id="36AA"></a>36AA  Compulsory transfer not ground for denying obligation

             (1)  This section applies if a body corporate that is, or is proposed to become, a transferring body is or was party to a contract, whether the proper law of the contract is Australian law (including the law of a State or Territory) or law of a foreign country (including the law of part of a foreign country).

             (2)  The fact that an act is done for the purposes of Division 2 or 3, or that a certificate of transfer comes into force under Division 3, in connection with the body does not allow the contract, or any other party to the contract, to do any of the following:

                     (a)  deny any obligations under that contract;

             (1)  Subject to subsections (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (9A) and (10), this Act has effect in spite of anything in any law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory, or in any contract, deed, undertaking, agreement or other instrument.

Note:          For the effect of a certificate of transfer, see sections 22 and 35.

             (2)  Subject to subsections (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (9A) and (10), nothing done by or under this Act:

                     (a)  places a receiving body, a transferring body or another person in breach of contract or confidence or otherwise makes any of them guilty of a civil wrong; or

                     (b)  places a receiving body, a transferring body or another person in breach of:

                              (i)  any law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory; or

                             (ii)  any contractual provision prohibiting, restricting or regulating the assignment or transfer of any asset or liability or the disclosure of any information; or

                     (c)  releases any surety, wholly or partly, from all or any of the surety’s obligations.

             (4)  The regulations may provide that some or all of the provisions of another Act (not being provisions referred to in subsection (5), (6), (7) or (8)) apply in relation to a transfer of business that takes effect or may take effect under this Act, or in relation to a restructure that takes effect or may take effect under this Act, with the modifications (if any) specified in the regulations. The regulations have effect accordingly. Nothing in this section limits the operation of those provisions (as they have effect subject to any modifications specified in the regulations).

             (5)  Nothing in this Act limits the operation of any of the provisions of the _Privacy Act 1988_.

             (6)  Subject to subsection (9A), nothing in this Act limits the operation of any of the provisions of the _Trade Practices Act 1974_.

             (8)  Nothing in this Act limits the operation of section 63 of the _Banking Act 1959_.

             (9)  For the purposes of section 50 and related provisions of the _Trade Practices Act 1974_ a transfer of business (whether voluntary or compulsory), or a transfer pursuant to an internal transfer certificate, that takes effect under this Act is taken to be:

                     (a)  to the extent that the transfer is of shares in the capital of a body corporate—an acquisition of the shares by the receiving body; and

                     (b)  to the extent that the transfer is of other assets—an acquisition of those assets by the receiving body.

          (9A)  For the purposes of subsection 51(1) of the _Trade Practices Act 1974_, the following things are specified and specifically authorised:

                     (a)  a transfer of business under Part 4;

                     (b)  anything done to enable or facilitate a transfer of business under Part 4 (including an agreement referred to in section 30).

                     (b)  referred to in subsection (5), (6), (7) or (8);

          (1B)  If the operation of Part 3 or 4A would result in an acquisition of property from a person otherwise than on just terms, the receiving body is liable to pay a reasonable amount of compensation to the person.

          (1C)  If the receiving body and the person do not agree on the amount of the compensation under subsection (1B), the person may institute proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia for the recovery from the receiving body of such reasonable amount of compensation as the court determines.

             (2)  Any damages or compensation recovered or other remedy given in a proceeding that is commenced otherwise than under this section is to be taken into account in assessing compensation payable in a proceeding that is commenced under this section and that arises out of the same event or transaction.

             (3)  In this section:

                    <a name="just-term"></a><a name="acquisit-properti"></a>**_acquisition of property_** and **_just terms_** have the same respective meanings as in paragraph 51(xxxi) of the Constitution.

                     (k)  a decision under subsection 36Q(3) to refuse to approve a later time for an internal transfer certificate to come into force.

## Table A

### Application, saving or transitional provisions

_Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Amendment Act 2003
 (No. 42, 2003)_

## Schedule 3

## 1  Definitions

In this Schedule:

**_amended Act_** means the _Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998_ as in force after the commencement of the amendments.

**_commencement of the amendments_** means the commencement of the amendments made by Schedule 1.

**_old Act_** means the _Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998_ as in force immediately before the commencement of the amendments.

## 2  APRA’s corporate existence is continued

(1)        The body corporate that was, immediately before the commencement of the amendments, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (**_APRA_**) continues in existence after that commencement by force of this item under the corporate structure provided for by the amended Act.

_Note:       Rights, liabilities and obligations as between APRA and other people, and things done by or on behalf of APRA, or in relation to APRA, are therefore not affected by the restructure of APRA._

(2)        However, this does not imply that any person who, immediately before the commencement of the amendments, was a member of APRA’s Board, or was APRA’s Chief Executive Officer, continues to hold office after that commencement.

_Note:       These people cease to hold office on the commencement of the amendments because of the repeal of the provisions under which they were appointed._

## 3  Continued protection from liability

Section 58 of the old Act continues to apply in relation to conduct, before the commencement of the amendments, of APRA’s Board, a member of APRA’s Board or an agent of a member of APRA’s Board.

_Note:       The reference to a member of APRA’s Board covers APRA’s Chief Executive Officer._

## 4  Continued effect of certain delegations

(1)        A delegation in force, immediately before the commencement of the amendments, under subsection 15(1) or (2) of the old Act continues to have effect after that commencement as if it were a delegation under APRA’s seal under that subsection of the amended Act. If the delegation was to one or more members of APRA’s Board, it continues to have effect as if it were a delegation to any APRA member.

(2)        A direction in force, immediately before the commencement of the amendments, under subsection 15(3) of the old Act continues to have effect after that commencement, in relation to a delegation to which subitem (1) applies, as if it were a direction given by APRA under that subsection of the amended Act.

(3)        A delegation to one or more members of APRA’s Board in force, immediately before the commencement of the amendments, under a provision amended by Schedule 2 continues to have effect after that commencement as if it were a delegation under the amended provision to any APRA member.

_Note:       Delegations in favour of APRA, or APRA staff members, are not affected by the Schedule 2 amendments._

## 5  Continued effect of determinations of terms and conditions for staff and consultants

A determination of terms and conditions in force, immediately before the commencement of the amendments, under subsection 45(2) or 47(2) of the old Act continues to have effect after that commencement as if it were a determination by APRA under that subsection of the amended Act.

## 6  Continued effect of approvals under paragraph 56(5)(b)

An approval in force, immediately before the commencement of the amendments, under paragraph 56(5)(b) of the old Act continues to have effect after that commencement as if it were an approval by APRA under that paragraph of the amended Act.

## 7  Continued or extended effect of certain regulations

(1)        Regulations in force, immediately before the commencement of the amendments, under paragraph (k) of the definition of **_Act covered by this section_** in subsection 56(1) of the old Act continue to have effect after that commencement as if they were made under paragraph (o) of the definition of **_prudential regulation framework law_** in subsection 3(1) of the amended Act, but only as that paragraph applies for the purposes of section 56 of the amended Act.

(2)        Regulations in force, immediately before the commencement of the amendments, under paragraph 56(5)(a) of the old Act have effect after that commencement (in addition to the effect they continue to have for that paragraph of the amended Act) as if they were also made under subsection 10A(1) of the amended Act.

## 8  Delegations by ASIC to APRA staff members

(1)        Subsection 102(2A) of the _Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001_ has effect after the commencement of the amendments as if the reference in that subsection to the Chief Executive Officer of APRA were instead a reference to APRA.

(2)        For the purposes of that subsection as it continues to have effect, an agreement to a delegation, in force under that subsection immediately before the commencement of the amendments, continues to have effect after that commencement as if it were given by APRA.

_Tax Laws Amendment (Repeal of Inoperative Provisions) Act 2006 
 (No. 101, 2006)_

## Schedule 6

## 1  Application of Schedule 1 and 2 amendments

Except as mentioned in items 2 and 3, the repeals and amendments made by Schedules 1 and 2 apply:

                     (a)  so far as they affect assessments—to assessments for the 2006-07 income year and all later income years; and

                     (b)  otherwise—to acts done or omitted to be done, or states of affairs existing, after the commencement of the repeals and amendments.

## 6  Object

The object of this Part is to ensure that, despite the repeals and amendments made by this Act, the full legal and administrative consequences of:

                     (a)  any act done or omitted to be done; or

                     (b)  any state of affairs existing; or

                     (c)  any period ending;

before such a repeal or amendment applies, can continue to arise and be carried out, directly or indirectly through an indefinite number of steps, even if some or all of those steps are taken after the repeal or amendment applies.

## 7  Making and amending assessments, and doing other things, in relation to past matters

Even though an Act is repealed or amended by this Act, the repeal or amendment is disregarded for the purpose of doing any of the following under any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_):

                     (a)  making or amending an assessment (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

                     (b)  exercising any right or power, performing any obligation or duty or doing any other thing (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

Example 1: On 31 July 1999, Greg Ltd lodged its annual return under former section 160ARE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The return stated that the company had a credit on its franking account and that no franking deficit tax was payable for the 1998-99 franking year. Under former section 160ARH of that Act, the Commissioner was taken to have made an assessment consistent with the return.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of Part IIIAA of that Act, the Commissioner concludes that Greg Ltd fraudulently overfranked dividends it paid during the 1998-99 franking year, and had a franking account deficit for that franking year. As a result, the Commissioner considers that franking deficit tax and a penalty by way of additional tax are payable.

                   The Commissioner can amend the assessment under former section 160ARN of that Act, because item 7 of this Schedule disregards the repeal of that section for the purposes of making an assessment in relation to the 1998-99 franking year. Item 7 will also disregard the repeal of Division 11 of former Part IIIAA to the extent necessary for the Commissioner to assess Greg Ltd’s liability to a penalty by way of additional tax.

                   Despite the repeal of sections 160ARU and 160ARV, item 9 will ensure that the general interest charge will accrue on the unpaid franking deficit tax and penalty until they are paid.

                   Item 7 will also preserve Greg Ltd’s right, under former section 160ART of that Act, to object against the Commissioner’s amended assessment (including the penalty), since the objection is the exercise of a right in relation to a franking year that ended before the repeal of Part IIIAA.

Example 2: During the 1997-98 income year, Duffy Property Ltd withheld amounts from its employees’ wages as required by former Divisions 1AAA and 2 of Part VI of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The company failed to notify the Commissioner of those amounts, and failed to remit them to the Commissioner.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of those Divisions, the Commissioner discovers that the withheld amounts have not been remitted. The company’s records are incomplete and the Commissioner is unable to completely ascertain the extent of its liability for the withheld amounts. Under section 222AGA of that Act, the Commissioner makes an estimate of the liability.

                   Item 7 will disregard the repeal of section 220AAZA of that Act (which empowered the Commissioner to recover the amount of the estimate). Even though the estimate is made after the repeal, it relates to amounts withheld before the repeal.

## 8  Saving of provisions about effect of assessments

If a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act deals with the effect of an assessment, the repeal or amendment is disregarded in relation to assessments made, before or after the repeal or amendment applies, in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

## 9  Saving of provisions about general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty

If:

                     (a)  a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act provides for the payment of:

                              (i)  general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty (all within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_); or

                             (ii)  interest under the _Taxation (Interest on Overpayments and Early Payments) Act 1983_; and

                     (b)  in a particular case, the period in respect of which the charge, penalty or interest is payable (whether under the provision or under the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_) has not begun, or has begun but not ended, when the provision is repealed or amended;

then, despite the repeal or amendment, the provision or part continues to apply in the particular case until the end of the period.

## 10  Repeals disregarded for the purposes of dependent provisions

If the operation of a provision (the **_subject provision_**) of any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_) made under any Act depends to any extent on an Act, or a provision of an Act, that is repealed by this Act, the repeal is disregarded so far as it affects the operation of the subject provision.

## 11  Schedule does not limit operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_

This Schedule does not limit the operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

* * *

_Financial System Legislation Amendment (Financial Claims Scheme and Other Measures) Act 2008 (No. 105, 2008)_

## Schedule 5

## 19  Application

(1)        The amendments of sections 8, 24 and 25 of the _Financial Sector (Business Transfer and Group Restructure) Act 1999_ made by this Schedule apply to the making of determinations on or after the commencement of this Schedule.

(2)        Section 36AA of that Act applies in relation to contracts made after the commencement of this Schedule.

(3)        The amendments of section 43 of that Act made by this Schedule apply in relation to transfers occurring on or after the commencement of this Schedule.

(4)        The amendment of section 44 of that Act made by this Schedule applies to acquisitions of property occurring on or after the commencement of this Schedule.
