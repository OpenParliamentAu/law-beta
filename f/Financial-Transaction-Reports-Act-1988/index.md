          (1A)  Strict liability applies to paragraph (1)(c).

Note:          For **_strict liability_**, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

          (1B)  Subsection (1) does not apply if the transfer occurred after the commencement of Division 1 of Part 4 of the _Anti‑Money Laundering and Counter‑Terrorism Financing Act 2006_.

Note:          A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in subsection (1B) (see subsection 13.3(3) of the _Criminal Code_).

             (2)  A commercial passenger carrier need not make a report in respect of currency in the possession of the carrier’s passengers.

             (5)  Where:

                     (b)  the amount of currency received is not less than $10,000 in value; and

                     (d)  a report in respect of the receipt of currency is not given in accordance with this section before the end of the period of 30 days commencing on the day of the receipt of the currency;

The maximum fine that a court can impose on an individual is worked out by multiplying the maximum term of imprisonment (in months) by 5, and then multiplying the resulting number by the amount of a penalty unit. The amount of a penalty unit is stated in section 4AA of that Act. If a body corporate is convicted of an offence, subsection 4B(3) of that Act allows a court to impose a fine that is not greater than 5 times the maximum fine that could be imposed by the court on an individual convicted of the same offence.

                            when the person is at the place in that area at which customs officers examine passports; or

                     (b)  in any other case—as soon as the person reaches the customs officer who is to examine the person’s passport in relation to the person leaving Australia or, if there is no such examination, the last opportunity before leaving Australia that the person has to give the report under this section.

                             (ii)  becomes a signatory of such an account with a cash dealer;

                            and either of the following subparagraphs applies:

                            (iii)  on a day (in this section called the **_infringement day_**), being the transaction day or a later day, the credit balance of the account exceeds $1,000;

                            (iv)  on a day (in this section also called the **_infringement day_**), being at least 30 days after the transaction day, the aggregate of the amounts credited to the account within the last 30 days exceeds $2,000; or

                     (b)  on a day after the commencement of this section (in this section also called the **_infringement day_**) a person:

                              (i)  opens an account with a cash dealer, being a facility or arrangement for a safety deposit box or for any other form of safe deposit; or

                             (ii)  becomes a signatory of such an account with a cash dealer.

          (1A)  Subparagraphs (1)(a)(i) and (b)(i) do not apply if the account is opened after the commencement of Division 1 of Part 2 of the _Anti‑Money Laundering and Counter‑Terrorism Financing Act 2006_ in circumstances that amount to the provision of a designated service.

          (1B)  Subparagraphs (1)(a)(ii) and (b)(ii) do not apply if:

                     (a)  the person becomes a signatory of the account after the commencement of Division 1 of Part 2 of the _Anti‑Money Laundering and Counter‑Terrorism Financing Act 2006_; and

                     (b)  either:

                              (i)  the account is opened after the commencement of Division 1 of Part 2 of the _Anti‑Money Laundering and Counter‑Terrorism Financing Act 2006_ in circumstances that amount to the provision of a designated service; or

                             (ii)  the account was opened before the commencement of that Division in circumstances that would have amounted to the provision of a designated service if all the provisions of Parts 1 and 2 of that Act had been in force at the relevant time.

             (2)  If, at the end of the infringement day, the cash dealer does not have the account information about the account, the account is blocked with respect to each signatory until the cash dealer has the information or the AUSTRAC CEO gives a notice under subsection 19(2).

Note:          a cash dealer is not required to obtain any information that has already been obtained in relation to another account.

          (2A)  If, at the end of the infringement day, the cash dealer does not have the signatory information about the person (**_unverified signatory_**), the account is blocked with respect to that signatory until the cash dealer has that information or the AUSTRAC CEO gives a notice under subsection 19(2).

Note:          a cash dealer is not required to obtain any information that has already been obtained in relation to another account.

             (3)  At the end of the infringement day, the cash dealer commits an offence against this subsection unless it has made reasonable efforts, on or before that day, to obtain the account information and the signatory information.

          (3A)  Subsection (3) does not apply in relation to accounts that are RSAs.

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  a signatory, knowing that the account is blocked, makes a withdrawal from the account at any time when the account is blocked under subsection (2); or

                     (b)  the unverified signatory, knowing that the account is blocked, makes a withdrawal from the account at any time when the account is blocked under subsection (2A);

the signatory commits an offence against this subsection.

          (4A)  If:

                     (a)  a signatory makes a withdrawal from the account at any time when the account is blocked under subsection (2); or

                     (b)  the unverified signatory makes a withdrawal from the account at any time when the account is blocked under subsection (2A);

the cash dealer commits an offence against this subsection.

          (4B)  Subsections (2), (2A), (4) and (4A) do not apply in relation to withdrawals:

                     (a)  made as a result of a request under paragraph 50(1)(a) of the _Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997_; or

                     (b)  made as a result of the death of the person who is the holder of the account for the purposes of the _Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997_; or

                     (c)  made under section 89, 195 or 196 of the _Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997_; or

                    (ca)  made in accordance with Part 3, 3A or 4A of the _Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999_; or

                     (d)  that are used to make payments of insurance premiums in accordance with the terms and conditions of the account.

             (6)  An offence against subsection (3), (4) or (4A) is punishable, upon conviction, by imprisonment for not more than 2 years.

Note:          Subsection 4B(2) of the _Crimes Act 1914_ allows a court to impose in respect of an offence an appropriate fine instead of, or in addition to, a term of imprisonment. The maximum fine that a court can impose on an individual is worked out by multiplying the maximum term of imprisonment (in months) by 5, and then multiplying the resulting number by the amount of a penalty unit. The amount of a penalty unit is stated in section 4AA of that Act. If a body corporate is convicted of an offence, subsection 4B(3) of that Act allows a court to impose a fine that is not greater than 5 times the maximum fine that could be imposed by the court on an individual convicted of the same offence.

             (8)  Where an account other than an RSA has been blocked for 12 months after the infringement day, the cash dealer shall, within 14 days after the end of that period, give the AUSTRAC CEO written notice of that fact, setting out the balance of an account and such other particulars as are prescribed.

          (8A)  If:

                     (a)  an account other than an RSA has been blocked for 12 months after the infringement day; and

                     (b)  as a result of the cash dealer’s obtaining account information or signatory information after the commencement of this subsection, the account ceases to be blocked with respect to a signatory with respect to whom it had been blocked;

the cash dealer must, within 14 days after the day on which the dealer obtained the information, give the AUSTRAC CEO written notice that the account has become unblocked to that extent and for that reason.

             (9)  A cash dealer who contravenes subsection (8) or (8A) is guilty of an offence against this subsection punishable, upon conviction, by a fine of not more than 10 penalty units.

Note:          If a body corporate is convicted of an offence, subsection 4B(3) of the _Crimes Act 1914_ allows a court to impose a fine that is not greater than 5 times the maximum fine that could be imposed by the court on an individual convicted of the same offence. The amount of a penalty unit is stated in section 4AA of that Act.

          (9A)  Subsection (9) is an offence of strict liability.

Note:          For **_strict liability_**, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

           (10)  The regulations may prescribe:

                     (a)  an amount instead of an amount specified in subparagraph (1)(a)(iii) or (iv); or

                     (b)  a period instead of the period of 30 days last referred to in subparagraph (1)(a)(iv).

##### <a id="19"></a>19  Unblocking or forfeiture of account

             (1)  The AUSTRAC CEO shall, as soon as practicable after receiving a notice under subsection 18(8), give notice in writing to the signatory or signatories to the account at the address or addresses given to the cash dealer in relation to the account, stating the effect of this section.

             (2)  If, within 3 months after the notice, or the last of the notices, is given under subsection (1), the AUSTRAC CEO is satisfied that:

                     (a)  there are reasonable grounds to believe that section 18 did not apply to the account; or

                     (b)  the cash dealer has the account and signatory information and the account should not, as a result, be blocked; or

                     (c)  if the account was blocked only because of subsection 18(2A)—the unverified signatory has ceased to be a signatory of the account;

the AUSTRAC CEO shall give written notice of that fact to the cash dealer and the signatory or signatories to the account.

             (3)  If, at the end of the period referred to in subsection (2), the AUSTRAC CEO is not satisfied that paragraph (2)(a), (b) or (c) applies, the AUSTRAC CEO shall:

                     (a)  give written notice of that fact to the cash dealer and the signatory or signatories to the account, setting out the effect of subsections (4) and (5); and

                     (b)  give a copy of the notice to the Minister.

             (4)  If the AUSTRAC CEO gives a notice under subsection (3), all rights and interests in relation to the account held by the unverified signatory are forfeited to the Commonwealth, and the Minister, the AUSTRAC CEO or an officer of AUSTRAC authorised by the AUSTRAC CEO may, on behalf of the Commonwealth, do whatever is necessary to realise those rights and interests (including closing the account).

             (5)  If:

                     (a)  the AUSTRAC CEO’s decision under subsection (3) is set aside by a court; or

                     (b)  a person satisfies the court that:

                              (i)  immediately before the time when subsection (4) had effect in relation to the account, the person had a beneficial interest in a right or interest in relation to the account held by the unverified signatory; and

                             (ii)  an amount standing to the credit of the account immediately before that time had not been derived from unlawful activities;

the court may make such orders as it thinks fit in relation to that amount, including directions to the Commonwealth to make restitution of so much of that amount as has been recovered by the Commonwealth under subsection (4).

             (6)  An expression used in this section has the same meaning as in section 18.

##### <a id="20"></a>20  Cash dealers to hold information

             (1)  A cash dealer must maintain, in relation to each account, in a way that can be audited:

                     (a)  any account information obtained by the cash dealer for the purposes of compliance with this Part; and

                     (b)  any signatory information obtained by the cash dealer for the purposes of compliance with this Part in relation to each signatory to the account;

(whether or not subsection 18(1) has applied to the account).

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply to information obtained by the cash dealer before the commencement of Part 2 of the _Crimes Legislation Amendment Act 1992_.

##### <a id="20A"></a>20A  Identification record

             (1)  For the purposes of this Act, a cash dealer has an identification record for a signatory to an account if, and only if:

                     (a)  the cash dealer has an identification reference for the signatory (whether or not the reference was obtained in connection with that account); or

                     (b)  the cash dealer is an identifying cash dealer and:

                              (i)  the cash dealer has carried out, and has a record of, the prescribed verification procedure to identify the signatory; or

                             (ii)  the cash dealer has carried out, and has a record of, a verification procedure to identify the signatory, being a procedure approved by the AUSTRAC CEO for the cash dealer;

                            (whether or not the verification procedure was carried out in connection with that account).

Example:    A solicitor administered the estate of a deceased person who held an account with an identifying cash dealer. The cash dealer carried out the prescribed verification procedure to identify the solicitor when the solicitor closed the deceased person’s account.

The solicitor is now administering the estate of another deceased person who also held an account with the cash dealer. If the cash dealer has a record of the verification procedure used to identify the solicitor in relation to the first deceased person’s account, it also has an identification record for the solicitor in relation to the other deceased person’s account.

             (2)  A verification procedure that was prescribed for the purposes of subsection 20(8) before the commencement of this section is taken to have been prescribed for the purposes of subparagraph (1)(b)(i).

##### <a id="21"></a>21  Identification references

             (1)  An identification reference for a signatory to an account is a written reference by an acceptable referee, signed by the referee and setting out the name to be used by the signatory in relation to the account and stating that:

                     (a)  the referee has known the signatory for the period specified in the reference;

                     (b)  during the whole of that period, or for so much of that period as is specified in the reference, the signatory has been commonly known by that name; and

                     (c)  the referee has examined:

                              (i)  a specified primary identification document for the signatory in that name;

                             (ii)  a specified secondary identification document for the signatory in that name and a specified primary identification document for the signatory in a former name of the person; or

                            (iii)  only a specified secondary identification document for the signatory in that name.

             (2)  An identification reference for a person by an acceptable referee shall also set out:

                     (a)  the name, address and occupation of the referee and the basis on which the referee claims to be an acceptable referee;

                     (b)  if the reference states that the referee examined a primary identification document for the person in a name different from the name to be used by the person in relation to the account—the explanation that the person gave the referee for the difference in names;

                     (c)  if the reference states that the referee examined only a secondary identification document for the person—the explanation that the person gave the referee for the failure to produce a primary identification document; and

                     (d)  the required details of the identification document or documents examined by the referee.

             (3)  An identification reference for a person by an acceptable referee shall be signed by the person in the presence of the referee and shall contain a statement by the referee to the effect that the reference was so signed.

          (3A)  An acceptable referee, or any other person, must not:

                     (a)  intentionally make a statement in an identification reference, reckless as to the fact that the statement is false or misleading in a material particular; or

                     (b)  intentionally omit from an identification reference any matter or thing, reckless as to the fact that without the matter or thing the reference is misleading in a material particular.

                    Penalty:  Imprisonment for 4 years.

Note:          Subsection 4B(2) of the _Crimes Act 1914_ allows a court to impose in respect of an offence an appropriate fine instead of, or in addition to, a term of imprisonment. The maximum fine that a court can impose on an individual is worked out by multiplying the maximum term of imprisonment (in months) by 5, and then multiplying the resulting number by the amount of a penalty unit. The amount of a penalty unit is stated in section 4AA of that Act.

             (4)  For the purposes of this Act, a failure by a person to produce a primary identification document shall not be taken to be sufficiently explained merely by the assertion that a primary identification document is not presently available to the person if the person could obtain a primary identification document within a reasonable time if the person took reasonable steps to obtain it.

             (5)  Nothing in subsection (4) shall be taken to require a person to apply for the issue of a citizenship certificate or a passport.

##### <a id="21A"></a>21A  Change of name

             (1)  Subject to subsections (1A) and (1B), this section applies to an individual (**_signatory_**) who wishes to open, or become a signatory to, an account with an identifying cash dealer in a name by which the signatory intends to be commonly known (**_new name_**), being a name:

                     (a)  which the signatory has adopted by marriage; or

                     (b)  by which the signatory, being a woman who has previously changed the surname by which she is known to that of her spouse or de facto spouse, was formerly known; or

                     (c)  which the signatory, being a person who has been the victim of violence or threats of violence, or the dependent child of such a person, has adopted or intends to adopt to ensure his or her personal safety; or

                     (d)  if the signatory is an Aborigine or Torres Strait Islander—which is a traditional name of the signatory.

          (1A)  This section does not apply to an individual who wishes to open an account if the account is opened after the commencement of Division 1 of Part 2 of the _Anti‑Money Laundering and Counter‑Terrorism Financing Act 2006_ in circumstances that amount to the provision of a designated service.

          (1B)  This section does not apply to an individual who wishes to become a signatory to an account with an identifying cash dealer in a name by which the individual intends to be commonly known if:

                     (a)  the individual wishes to become a signatory to the account in that name after the commencement of Division 1 of Part 2 of the _Anti‑Money Laundering and Counter‑Terrorism Financing Act 2006_; and

                              (i)  the account is opened after the commencement of Division 1 of Part 2 of the _Anti‑Money Laundering and Counter‑Terrorism Financing Act 2006_ in circumstances that amount to the provision of a designated service; or

                             (ii)  the account was opened before the commencement of that Division in circumstances that would have amounted to the provision of a designated service if all the provisions of Parts 1 and 2 of that Act had been in force at the relevant time.

             (2)  If the signatory gives to the identifying cash dealer change of name statements signed by the signatory and by a prescribed person:

                     (a)  the new name is taken to be a name by which the signatory is commonly known; and

                     (b)  the statements are taken to constitute an identification reference for the signatory in the new name.

             (3)  A person must not:

                     (a)  intentionally make a statement in a change of name statement, reckless as to the fact that it is false or misleading in a material particular; or

                     (b)  intentionally omit from a change of name statement any matter or thing, reckless as to the fact that without the matter or thing the change of name statement is misleading in a material particular.

                    Penalty:  Imprisonment for 4 years.

Note:          Subsection 4B(2) of the _Crimes Act 1914_ allows a court to impose in respect of an offence an appropriate fine instead of, or in addition to, a term of imprisonment. The maximum fine that a court can impose on an individual is worked out by multiplying the maximum term of imprisonment (in months) by 5, and then multiplying the resulting number by the amount of a penalty unit. The amount of a penalty unit is stated in section 4AA of that Act.

             (4)  For the purposes of this section:

                    <a name="chang-name-statem"></a>**_change of name statement_**, in relation to a signatory, means a statement that:

                     (a)  sets out the name or names by which the signatory has been commonly known; and

                     (d)  sets out the new name; and

                     (e)  states that the new name is one by which the signatory will be commonly known.

##### <a id="22"></a>22  Notice to AUSTRAC CEO if no primary identification document examined

             (1)  If an identification reference for a signatory to an account is given to a cash dealer for the purposes of compliance with this Part and the reference states that the referee examined only a secondary identification document for the signatory, the cash dealer must give the AUSTRAC CEO written notice:

                     (c)  setting out sufficient details of the account for the account to be identified;

                     (d)  setting out the name used by the signatory in relation to the account; and

                     (e)  stating that the identification reference for the signatory was not supported by a primary identification document.

             (2)  A cash dealer who contravenes subsection (1) is guilty of an offence against this subsection punishable, upon conviction, by imprisonment for a period of not more than 2 years.

Note:          Subsection 4B(2) of the _Crimes Act 1914_ allows a court to impose in respect of an offence an appropriate fine instead of, or in addition to, a term of imprisonment. The maximum fine that a court can impose on an individual is worked out by multiplying the maximum term of imprisonment (in months) by 5, and then multiplying the resulting number by the amount of a penalty unit. The amount of a penalty unit is stated in section 4AA of that Act. If a body corporate is convicted of an offence, subsection 4B(3) of that Act allows a court to impose a fine that is not greater than 5 times the maximum fine that could be imposed by the court on an individual convicted of the same offence.

##### <a id="23"></a>23  Cash dealer to keep documents

             (4)  If any information is part of the account information or signatory information of more than one account with the cash dealer, subsection (1) applies as if the reference to the day on which the account is closed were a reference to the day on which the last of those accounts is closed.

             (5)  A cash dealer required to retain documents under subsection (1) shall retain and store them in a way that makes retrieval of the documents reasonably practical.

             (6)  Subsection (1) does not limit any other obligation of a cash dealer to retain documents.

             (7)  Where a cash dealer is required by law to release a document to which subsection (1) applies before the end of the period referred to in that subsection, the cash dealer shall retain a complete copy of the document until the period has ended or the document is returned, whichever occurs first.

             (8)  The cash dealer shall maintain a register of documents released under subsection (7).

                    Penalty:  Imprisonment for 1 year.

The maximum fine that a court can impose on an individual is worked out by multiplying the maximum term of imprisonment (in months) by 5, and then multiplying the resulting number by the amount of a penalty unit. The amount of a penalty unit is stated in section 4AA of that Act. If a body corporate is convicted of an offence, subsection 4B(3) of that Act allows a court to impose a fine that is not greater than 5 times the maximum fine that could be imposed by the court on an individual convicted of the same offence.

                    <a name="record"></a>**_record_** includes a copy of a record.

##### <a id="24"></a>24  Opening account etc. in false name

             (1)  A person shall not open an account with a cash dealer in a false name.

             (2)  A person shall not operate an account with a cash dealer in a false name.

          (2A)  A person must not operate, or authorise the operation of, an account with a cash dealer if the account is in a false name.

             (3)  Where a person is commonly known by 2 or more different names, the person shall not use one of those names in opening an account with a cash dealer unless the person has previously disclosed the other name or names to the cash dealer.

             (4)  Where a person is commonly known by 2 or more different names, the person shall not use one of those names in operating an account with a cash dealer unless the person has previously disclosed the other name or names to the cash dealer.

             (5)  Where a person using a particular name in dealings with a cash dealer discloses to the dealer a different name or different names by which the person is commonly known, the dealer shall make a record of the disclosure and shall, upon request in writing from the AUSTRAC CEO, give the AUSTRAC CEO a copy of that record.

             (6)  A person who contravenes subsection (1), (2), (2A), (3), (4) or (5) is guilty of an offence against this subsection punishable, upon conviction, by imprisonment for not more than 2 years.

Note:          Subsection 4B(2) of the _Crimes Act 1914_ allows a court to impose in respect of an offence an appropriate fine instead of, or in addition to, a term of imprisonment. The maximum fine that a court can impose on an individual is worked out by multiplying the maximum term of imprisonment (in months) by 5, and then multiplying the resulting number by the amount of a penalty unit. The amount of a penalty unit is stated in section 4AA of that Act. If a body corporate is convicted of an offence, subsection 4B(3) of that Act allows a court to impose a fine that is not greater than 5 times the maximum fine that could be imposed by the court on an individual convicted of the same offence.

             (7)  For the purposes of this section:

                     (b)  a person operates an account in a false name if the person does any act or thing in relation to the account (whether by way of making a deposit or withdrawal or by way of communication with the cash dealer concerned or otherwise) and, in doing so, uses a name other than a name by which the person is commonly known; and

                     (c)  an account is in a false name if it was opened in a false name, whether before or after the commencement of this paragraph.

             (8)  This section does not apply in relation to a person and an account that is an RSA within the meaning of the _Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997_ if:

                     (a)  the person (the **_employer_**) is an employer, within the meaning of that Act, of another person (the **_employee_**); and

                     (b)  the employer made the application for the account on behalf of the employee.

             (9)  This section does not apply in relation to the opening of an account if the account is opened after the commencement of Division 1 of Part 2 of the _Anti‑Money Laundering and Counter‑Terrorism Financing Act 2006_ in circumstances that amount to the provision of a designated service.

##### <a id="24C"></a>24C  Bullion seller to hold identification record for other parties to bullion transaction

             (1)  A bullion seller must not, before the commencement of Division 1 of Part 2 of the _Anti‑Money Laundering and Counter‑Terrorism Financing Act 2006_, enter into a bullion transaction unless the seller has an identification record for the other party, or for each other party, to the transaction.

                    Penalty:  Imprisonment for 2 years.

Note:          Subsection 4B(2) of the _Crimes Act 1914_ allows a court to impose in respect of an offence an appropriate fine instead of, or in addition to, a term of imprisonment. The maximum fine that a court can impose on an individual is worked out by multiplying the maximum term of imprisonment (in months) by 5, and then multiplying the resulting number by the amount of a penalty unit. The amount of a penalty unit is stated in section 4AA of that Act. If a body corporate is convicted of an offence, subsection 4B(3) of that Act allows a court to impose a fine that is not greater than 5 times the maximum fine that could be imposed by the court on an individual convicted of the same offence.

             (2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), a bullion seller has an identification record for a party to a bullion transaction if, and only if, the seller is an identifying cash dealer and:

                     (b)  has carried out, and has a record of, a verification procedure to identify the party, being a procedure approved by the AUSTRAC CEO for the seller;

             (2)  If any information is part of information identifying a party to 2 or more bullion transactions entered into by the bullion seller, subsection (1) applies as if the reference to the day on which the transaction occurs were a reference to the day on which the last of those transactions occurs.

             (3)  A bullion seller who is required to retain documents under subsection (1) must retain and store them in a way that makes retrieval of the documents reasonably practicable.

             (4)  Subsection (1) does not limit any other obligation of a bullion seller to retain documents.

             (5)  If a bullion seller is required by law to release a document to which subsection (1) applies before the end of the period referred to in that subsection, the seller must retain a complete copy of the document until the period has ended or the document is returned, whichever occurs first.

             (6)  The bullion seller must keep a register of documents released under subsection (5).

                    Penalty:  Imprisonment for 1 year.

Note:          Subsection 4B(2) of the _Crimes Act 1914_ allows a court to impose in respect of an offence an appropriate fine instead of, or in addition to, a term of imprisonment. The maximum fine that a court can impose on an individual is worked out by multiplying the maximum term of imprisonment (in months) by 5, and then multiplying the resulting number by the amount of a penalty unit. The amount of a penalty unit is stated in section 4AA of that Act. If a body corporate is convicted of an offence, subsection 4B(3) of that Act allows a court to impose a fine that is not greater than 5 times the maximum fine that could be imposed by the court on an individual convicted of the same offence.

Note:          Subsection 4B(2) of the _Crimes Act 1914_ allows a court to impose in respect of an offence an appropriate fine instead of, or in addition to, a term of imprisonment. The maximum fine that a court can impose on an individual is worked out by multiplying the maximum term of imprisonment (in months) by 5, and then multiplying the resulting number by the amount of a penalty unit.

                            (iii)  would not give rise to a significant cash transaction; or

                            (iv)  would give rise to exempt cash transactions.

             (2)  A person commits an offence against this section if:

                     (a)  the person conducts 2 or more non‑reportable transfers of currency; and

                             (ii)  any explanation made by the person as to the manner or form in which the transfers were conducted;

             (3)  A person who commits an offence against this section is punishable, upon conviction, by imprisonment for not more than 5 years.

Note:          Subsection 4B(2) of the _Crimes Act 1914_ allows a court to impose in respect of an offence an appropriate fine instead of, or in addition to, a term of imprisonment. The maximum fine that a court can impose on an individual is worked out by multiplying the maximum term of imprisonment (in months) by 5, and then multiplying the resulting number by the amount of a penalty unit. The amount of a penalty unit is stated in section 4AA of that Act. If a body corporate is convicted of an offence, subsection 4B(3) of that Act allows a court to impose a fine that is not greater than 5 times the maximum fine that could be imposed by the court on an individual convicted of the same offence.
