Overview of this Act

                   The main purpose of this Act is to provide a framework for the proper management of public money and public property. **_Public money_** and **_public property_** are defined in section 5\. Broadly, those terms refer to money or property that is owned or held by the Commonwealth, including money or property held on trust.

                   This Act contains rules about how public money and property are to be dealt with. Many of the detailed rules are in regulations made under section 65.

                   Many of the rules in this Act apply to officials of Agencies and to Chief Executives of Agencies. **_Agency_**, **_official_** and **_Chief Executive_** are defined in section 5.

                   If:

                     (a)  either:

                              (i)  an Agency makes a notional payment to another Agency; or

                     (d)  this Act applies in relation to the notional receipt of the notional payment as if it were a real receipt.

Note:          This section applies to transactions that do not actually involve payments or receipts, because the parties to the transaction are merely parts of the Commonwealth, or acting as agents for the Commonwealth. For example, Agency 1 “pays” Agency 2 for services provided by Agency 2\. One of the effects of this section is that a drawing right under section 27 will be required for the transaction.

## Part 3—Collection, custody etc. of public money

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Agreements with banks about receipt, transmission etc. of public money

             (1)  The Finance Minister may, on behalf of the Commonwealth, enter into an agreement with any bank:

Section 38 deals with overdrafts that arise in respect of **_advances_**that are paid to the Commonwealth.

             (4)  An agreement for an overdraft on an official account must not be made except under this section.

             (5)  An agreement under this section may not be made for a period of more than one year unless the agreement can be terminated by the Commonwealth at any time after giving notice of not more than 6 months.

                   An official or Minister who receives public money (including money that becomes public money upon receipt) must bank it as required by the regulations or otherwise deal with it as required by the regulations. For this purpose, **_money_** includes cheques and similar instruments.

                    Penalty:  Imprisonment for 2 years.

Note:          Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.

##### <a id="11"></a>11  Public money not to be paid into non-official account

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Receipt and spending of public money by outsiders

             (1)  An official or Minister must not enter into an agreement or arrangement for the receipt, custody or payment of public money by an outsider unless:

                     (a)  the Finance Minister has first given a written authorisation for the agreement or arrangement; or

                     (b)  the agreement or arrangement is expressly authorised by this Act or by another Act.

                    Penalty:  Imprisonment for 7 years.

Note:          Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.

             (2)  An outsider commits an offence if:

                     (a)  the outsider receives or has custody of public money under an agreement or arrangement mentioned in subsection (1); and

                     (b)  the outsider makes a payment of the public money; and

                     (c)  that payment is not authorised by the agreement or arrangement.

                    Penalty:  Imprisonment for 2 years.

Note:          Section 27 allows a drawing right to be issued to an official or a Minister to debit an amount against an appropriation (as a result of a payment of public money by an outsider).

             (3)  In this section:

                    <a name="outsid"></a>**_outsider_** means any person other than the Commonwealth, an official or a Minister.

##### <a id="13"></a>13  Money not to be withdrawn from official account without authority

                   An official must not withdraw money from an official account except as authorised by the regulations.

                    Penalty:  Imprisonment for 7 years.

Note:          Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.

##### <a id="15"></a>15  Liability for loss of public money

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a loss of public money occurs; and

                     (b)  at the time of the loss, an official or Minister had nominal custody of the money as described in subsection (2);

the official or Minister is liable to pay to the Commonwealth an amount equal to the loss. However, it is a defence if the person proves that he or she took reasonable steps in all the circumstances to prevent the loss.

             (2)  A person has nominal custody of public money if:

                     (a)  the person holds the money by way of a petty cash advance, “change float” or other advance; or

                     (b)  the person has received the money, but has not yet dealt with it as required by section 10.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  a loss of public money occurs; and 

                     (b)  an official or Minister caused or contributed to the loss by misconduct, or by a deliberate or serious disregard of reasonable standards of care;

the official or Minister is liable to pay to the Commonwealth an amount equal to the loss. However, if the person’s misconduct or disregard was not the sole cause of the loss, the person is liable to pay only so much of the loss as is just and equitable having regard to the person’s share of the responsibility for the loss.

             (4)  A person’s liability under this section that arises when the person is an official or Minister is not avoided merely because the person ceases to be an official or Minister.

             (5)  An amount payable to the Commonwealth under this section is recoverable as a debt in a court of competent jurisdiction.

             (6)  The Commonwealth is not entitled to recover amounts from the same person under both subsections (1) and (3) for the same loss.

             (7)  In this section:

                    <a name="loss"></a>**_loss_** includes a deficiency.

##### <a id="16"></a>16  Special Instructions by Finance Minister about handling etc. of special public money

                     (a)  the custody of special public money;

                     (b)  the investment of special public money;

                     (c)  the application of interest or other amounts derived from the investment of special public money;

                     (d)  the application of special public money in paying the expenses involved in dealing with special public money.

             (2)  In case of inconsistency, Special Instructions override this Act, the regulations and the Finance Minister’s Orders. However, Special Instructions cannot be inconsistent with the terms of any trust that applies to the money concerned.

             (3)  An official or Minister must not contravene any Special Instruction.

                    Penalty:  Imprisonment for 2 years.

Note:          Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.

             (4)  In this section:

                    <a name="special-public-monei"></a>**_special public money_** means public money that is not held on account of the Commonwealth or for the use or benefit of the Commonwealth.

Note:          Money held by the Commonwealth on trust for another person is an example of special public money.

## Part 4—Accounting, appropriations and payments

### Division 1—Accounts and records in relation to public money

##### <a id="19"></a>19  Accounts and records in relation to public money

                   The Finance Minister must cause proper accounts and records to be kept in relation to the receipt and expenditure of public money.

Note:          Section 48 requires Chief Executives of Agencies to keep accounts and records in accordance with the Finance Minister’s Orders.

### Division 1A—Special Accounts

##### <a id="20"></a>20  Establishment of Special Accounts by Finance Minister

             (1)  The Finance Minister may make a written determination that does all of the following:

                     (a)  establishes a Special Account;

                     (b)  allows or requires amounts to be credited to the Special Account;

                     (c)  specifies the purposes for which amounts are allowed or required to be debited from the Special Account.

Note:          See section 32A for when the crediting or debiting of an amount takes effect.

          (1A)  A determination under subsection (1) may specify that an amount may or must be debited from a Special Account established under subsection (1) otherwise than in relation to the making of a real or notional payment.

             (2)  The Finance Minister may make a determination that revokes or varies a determination made under subsection (1).

             (3)  The Finance Minister may make a determination that abolishes a Special Account established under subsection (1).

             (4)  The CRF is hereby appropriated for expenditure for the purposes of a Special Account established under subsection (1), up to the balance for the time being of the Special Account.

Note:          An Appropriation Act provides for amounts to be credited to a Special Account if any of the purposes of the Account is a purpose that is covered by an item in the Appropriation Act.

          (4A)  If the Finance Minister makes a determination that allows an amount standing to the credit of a Special Account to be expended in making payments for a particular purpose, then, unless the contrary intention appears, the amount may also be applied in making notional payments for that purpose.

Note:          This subsection applies to transactions that do not actually involve payments because the parties to the transaction are merely parts of the Commonwealth or acting as agents for the Commonwealth. For example, Agency 1 “pays” Agency 2 for services provided by Agency 2.

             (5)  Whenever an amount is debited against the appropriation in subsection (4), the amount is taken to be also debited from the Special Account.

##### <a id="21"></a>21  Special Accounts established by other Acts

             (1)  If another Act establishes a Special Account and identifies the purposes of the Special Account, then the CRF is hereby appropriated for expenditure for those purposes, up to the balance for the time being of the Special Account.

Note 1:       An Act that establishes a Special Account will identify the amounts that are to be credited to the Special Account.

Note 2:       An Appropriation Act provides for amounts to be credited to a Special Account if any of the purposes of the Account is a purpose that is covered by an item in the Appropriation Act.

Note 3:       See section 32A for when the crediting or debiting of an amount takes effect.

          (1A)  If an Act allows an amount standing to the credit of a Special Account to be applied, debited, paid or otherwise used for a particular purpose, then, unless the contrary intention appears, the amount may also be applied, paid or otherwise used in making a notional payment for that purpose.

Note:          This subsection applies to transactions that do not actually involve payments because the parties to the transaction are merely parts of the Commonwealth or acting as agents for the Commonwealth. For example, Agency 1 “pays” Agency 2 for services provided by Agency 2.

##### 5  Conversion of RMF components and CAF components

             (1)  This section applies to each old component that:

                     (a)  was in existence immediately before the commencing time; or

                     (b)  is established by a provision of an Act that comes into operation after the commencing time.

However, this section does not apply to the Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve.

Note:          Schedule 1 repeals the _Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve Act 1955_.

             (2)  The **_conversion time_** for the old component is:

                     (a)  the commencing time, if the component was in existence immediately before the commencing time; or

                     (b)  otherwise, the time when the component is established.

             (3)  At the conversion time:

                     (a)  a new account is established in respect of the old component; and

                     (b)  any balance of the old component is to be credited to the new account.

             (4)  The new account is a Special Account for the purposes of the _Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997_.

             (5)  The name of the new account is:

                     (a)  if the name of the old component ends with “Reserve”—a name that is the same as the name of the old component, but ends with “Account” instead of “Reserve”; or

                     (b)  if the name of the old component ends with “Fund”—a name that is the same as the name of the old component, but ends with “Account” instead of “Fund”; or

                     (c)  if the name of the old component ends with “Account”—a name that is the same as the name of the old component; or

                     (d)  in any other case—the name determined in writing by the Finance Minister for the purposes of this subsection.

             (6)  In relation to matters that happen after the commencing time, a reference in any instrument to the old component is to be read as a reference to the new account and, in particular:

                     (a)  a reference to:

                              (i)  transferring or paying an amount from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to the old component; or

                             (ii)  debiting an amount from the Consolidated Revenue Fund and crediting the amount to the old component; 

                            is to be read as a reference to crediting the amount to the new account; and

                     (b)  a reference to:

                              (i)  transferring or paying an amount to the Consolidated Revenue Fund from the old component; or

                             (ii)  debiting an amount from the old component and crediting the amount to the Consolidated Revenue Fund; 

                            is to be read as a reference to debiting the amount from the new account; and

                     (c)  a reference to paying an amount out of the old component is to be read as a reference to paying the amount out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund and debiting the amount from the new account.

             (7)  If the old component was established by the Finance Minister under the _Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997_, then:

                     (a)  the new account is taken to have been established by a determination under section 20 of that Act (as amended by this Act); and

                     (b)  that determination may be revoked or varied under that section; and

                     (c)  the new account may be abolished under that section.

##### 6  Transitional provisions for the Loan Fund

             (1)  In any instrument, a reference to the Loan Fund is to be read as a reference to the Consolidated Revenue Fund, in relation to matters occurring after the commencing time.

             (2)  Without limiting subsection (1):

                     (a)  after the commencing time, any appropriation that is expressed to be an appropriation of the Loan Fund has effect as an appropriation of the Consolidated Revenue Fund; and

                     (b)  after the commencing time, any provision of an instrument that is expressed to require or permit the payment of an amount from the Loan Fund has effect as if it required or permitted the payment of that amount from the Consolidated Revenue Fund.

##### 7  Instruments referring to payments into the Consolidated Revenue Fund

                   In any instrument, a reference to payment of an amount into the Consolidated Revenue Fund is to be read as a reference to payment of the amount to the Commonwealth (unless the amount is already public money).

Note:          **_Public money_** is defined in the _Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997_.

##### 8  Quarterly statements sufficient during transitional period

             (1)  Section 54 of the _Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997_ has effect in relation to the transitional period as if references to a month of a financial year were references to a quarter of a financial year.

             (2)  In this section:

                    <a name="transition-period"></a>**_transitional period_** means the period:

                     (a)  starting on the day on which this Act commences; and

                     (b)  ending at the end of the third quarter after the quarter in which this Act commences.

##### 9  Regulations

             (1)  The Governor-General may make regulations prescribing matters:

                     (a)  required or permitted by this Act to be prescribed; or

                     (b)  necessary or convenient to be prescribed for carrying out or giving effect to this Act.
