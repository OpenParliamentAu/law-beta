             (4)  Where:

                     (a)  a notice referred to in subsection (3) is given with respect to an instrument; and

                     (b)  at the expiration of the period during which a resolution disallowing the instrument could have been passed:

                     (b)  a resolution for the disallowance of the instrument has not been passed by the first-mentioned House;

the copy of the instrument shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed to have been laid before that first-mentioned House on the first sitting day of that first-mentioned House after the dissolution, expiry or prorogation, as the case may be.

             (7)  Where an instrument made under subsection (1) takes effect, the Minister shall cause a notice to that effect to be published in the _Gazette._

                     (b)  it would be appropriate to grant the land to the Council.

             (3)  If the Minister proposes to make a declaration under subsection (1), the Minister must publish a notice in the _Gazette_:

                     (a)  stating his or her intention to do so; and

             (1)  Where, on the vesting of land in the Council because of section 10, the land or part of the land is being occupied or used by the Commonwealth or by an Authority, the Commonwealth or the Authority, as the case may be, is entitled to continue that occupation or use for such period as the land or part of the land, as the case may be, is required by the Commonwealth or the Authority.

             (2)  During the period for which, because of subsection (1), the Commonwealth or an Authority is entitled to the occupation or use of land, or part of land, vested in the Council, any buildings or improvements on that land, or part of land, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be the property of the Commonwealth or the Authority, as the case may be.

             (3)  Nothing in this section prevents the granting by the Council under section 38 of a lease of land to which subsection (1) applies to the Commonwealth or an Authority and, if such a lease is granted, the land ceases to be land to which this section applies.

##### <a id="14"></a>14  Reservation of minerals

                   Any law in force in the Territory authorising mining or exploration for minerals (including any law providing for rights known as miner’s rights) does not apply in relation to Aboriginal Land so as to authorise the entry or remaining of a person on the land or the doing of any act by a person on the land.

##### <a id="44"></a>44  Mining operations

                   If minerals, in their natural state and capable of being exploited for commercial purposes, are discovered on or below the surface of Aboriginal Land, operations for the recovery of the minerals shall not be carried on by a person otherwise than in accordance with an agreement to which the Commonwealth, the Council and that person are parties.

##### <a id="45"></a>45  Exemption from rates etc.

##### <a id="46"></a>46  Application of laws of Territory to Aboriginal Land

             (2)  Where a declaration under subsection (1) is in force in relation to a place, the Council may cause signs to be displayed at or near the place identifying the place and stating that entry into it by persons other than Aboriginal members of the Community is prohibited by this Act.

             (3)  Except in the performance of functions under this Act or otherwise in accordance with this Act or a law in force in the Territory or with the consent of the Council, a person, other than an Aboriginal member of the Community, shall not enter or remain in any place in relation to which a sign is displayed under subsection (2).

                    Penalty:  $1,000.

             (5)  A person shall not be convicted of offences against subsections (3) and (4) in relation to the same act.

             (6)  Without limiting the generality of subsection (4), a person shall be taken, for the purposes of that subsection, to have damaged or disturbed a place in relation to which a sign is displayed under subsection (2) if, by reason of any act done by that person, the special significance of the place to Aboriginal members of the Community has been adversely affected.

             (7)  In any proceedings for the prosecution of a person for an offence against subsection (3) or (4), evidence that a sign stating that entry into the place by persons other than Aboriginal members of the Community is prohibited by this Act was displayed at or near that place at a particular time is evidence that the sign was so displayed at that time in accordance with subsection (2).

             (8)  Nothing in this section shall be read as extending the right of access to any Aboriginal Land to which this section does not apply.

##### <a id="49"></a>49  Public access

             (1)  Subject to this section, where the Minister is satisfied that:

                     (a)  a place that forms part of Aboriginal Land was, immediately before it became part of such land, a place to which the public had access; and

                     (b)  it is desirable that the public should continue to have access to that place;

the Minister may, by notice in writing published in the _Gazette_ specifying that place, declare that that place is a place to which this section applies.

             (2)  The Minister shall not make a declaration under subsection (1) in relation to:

                     (a)  a place to which a declaration under subsection 48(1) applies; or

             (3)  The public shall have right of access to a place in respect of which a declaration under subsection (1) is in force (other than a place that has become a place referred to in subsection (2)), but that access is subject to the regulations.

             (4)  In this section, **_place_** includes a road, a path and a trail.

##### <a id="50"></a>50  Registrar may inquire into grievances

                   Where a person who is or has been a registered member informs the Registrar that the person is aggrieved by action taken under this Act (other than action taken by the Minister or action taken in compliance with a judgment, order or decree of a court or of a person acting judicially) and requests the Registrar to inquire into that action, the Registrar may, in the Registrar’s discretion, comply with that request and, if the Registrar considers it appropriate to do so, may inform the Minister or the Council of the result of the inquiries.

##### <a id="52"></a>52  Annual report to be laid before meeting of Council

                   The executive committee must table a copy of the annual report on the Council at the next general meeting of the Council held after the deadline for the financial year to which the report relates.

             (4)  A by-law, in applying a regulation referred to in subsection (3) relating to an offence, must not change the penalty for that offence.

             (5)  A by-law must not be inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth or a law in force in the Territory, but a regulation referred to in subsection (3) may, in its application to Aboriginal Land, be inconsistent with a law in force in the Territory.

             (6)  The by-laws may provide that a contravention of a by-law is an offence.

             (7)  The regulations may provide, in respect of an offence against the by-laws, for the imposition of:
