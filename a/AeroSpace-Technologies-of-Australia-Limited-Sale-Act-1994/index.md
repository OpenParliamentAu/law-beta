##### <a id="14"></a>14  Continuing application of the _Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act 1989_

Continuing application of Act

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), if a person who was an employee of an ASTA body before the body’s sale day committed a corruption offence while such an employee, then, on and after the body’s sale day, the _Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act 1989_ continues to apply in relation to the person in respect of the offence as if the body continued to be a Commonwealth authority.

Limitation on superannuation orders

             (2)  A superannuation order may not be made under the _Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act 1989_ in relation to employer contributions or benefits paid or payable to a superannuation scheme by an ASTA body on or after the body’s sale day.

Superannuation schemes

             (3)  A superannuation scheme in relation to which employer contributions or benefits are paid or payable by an ASTA body on or after the body’s sale day is not a superannuation scheme for the purposes of the application of the _Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act 1989_ to a corruption offence committed by a person after the body’s sale day.

Paragraph 19(3)(d) orders

             (4)  Despite paragraph 19(3)(d) of the _Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act 1989_, for the purposes of the application of that Act to an ASTA body, an order made under that paragraph on or after the body’s sale day may only specify that an amount paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund before the body’s sale day by or on behalf of the body belongs to the Commonwealth.

Interpretation

             (6)  Unless the contrary intention appears, an expression used in this section that is also used in the _Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act 1989_ has the same meaning in this section as it has in that Act.

### Division 3—The Superannuation Benefits (Supervisory Mechanisms) Act 1990

                    <a name="minist"></a>**_Minister_** has the same meaning as in the _Superannuation Benefits (Supervisory Mechanisms) Act 1990_.

## Part 3—Prosecutions

##### <a id="16"></a>16  Continuing application of the _Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983_

If the _Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983_ ceases to apply to particular acts, omissions or proceedings in connection with an ASTA body on the body’s sale day because the body ceases to be an authority of the Commonwealth for the purposes of that Act on that day, then, despite that cessation, that Act continues to apply in relation to:
