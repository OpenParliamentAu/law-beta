             (4)  In relation to a body corporate that does not have a governing body, a reference in this section to a member of the governing body is a reference to a member of the body corporate.

##### <a id="26"></a>26  Injunctions

             (4)  The power of the Court to grant an injunction restraining a person from engaging in conduct may be exercised:

                     (b)  whether or not the person has previously engaged in conduct of that kind; and

                     (c)  whether or not there is a serious and immediate threat of injury to, or desecration of, the relevant area, place, object or objects, as the case may be, if the person engages in conduct of that kind.

##### <a id="28"></a>28  Compensation for acquisition of property

             (1)  Where, but for this section, the operation of a provision of this Act or of a declaration made under Part II would result in the acquisition of property from a person otherwise than on just terms, there is payable to the person by the Commonwealth such reasonable amount of compensation as is agreed upon between the person and the Commonwealth or, failing agreement, as is determined by the Federal Court.

             (2)  In subsection (1), **_acquisition of property_** and **_just terms_** have the same respective meanings as in paragraph 51(xxxi) of the Constitution.

## Part IV—Miscellaneous
