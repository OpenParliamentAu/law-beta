                     (a)  any provision of the _Archeological and Aboriginal Relics Preservation Act_ 1972 of Victoria in so far as it applies to or in relation to an entry made in a register, or a declaration made, under that Act before the commencement of the _Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Amendment Act 1987_; or

                     (b)  any other law of Victoria (other than a law for the preservation or protection of Aboriginal cultural property within the meaning of Part IIA) except as referred to in paragraph (a);

that is capable of operating concurrently with that Part.

             (2)  A law of a Territory has effect to the extent to which it is not inconsistent with a provision of the regulations, or of a declaration under this Act, having effect in that Territory, but such a law shall not be taken for the purposes of this subsection to be inconsistent with such a provision to the extent that it is capable of operating concurrently with that provision.

the person may be prosecuted and convicted under that law or under this Act or the _Crimes Act 1914_, as the case may be, but nothing in this subsection renders a person liable to be punished more than once in respect of the same act or omission.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Application of Act
