 Proceedings in camera

   (a) the interests of justice; and

   (b) the interests of Aboriginal tradition;

 order the exclusion of the public, or of persons specified in the order, from a sitting of the court and make such orders as it thinks fit for the purpose of preventing or limiting the disclosure of information with respect to the proceedings. 

 Compensation for acquisition of property

  28\. (1) Where, but for this section, the operation of a provision of this Act (except a provision of Part IIA) or of a declaration made under Part II would result in the acquisition of property from a person otherwise than on just terms, there is payable to the person by the Commonwealth such reasonable amount of compensation as is agreed upon between the person and the Commonwealth or, failing agreement, as is determined by the Federal Court. 

   (2) In subsection (1), &quot;acquisition of property&quot; and &quot;just terms&quot; have the same respective meanings as in paragraph 51 (xxxi) of the Constitution.

 Legal assistance

  30\. (1) A person:

   (a) who wishes to apply for a declaration under section 9, 10 or 12;

   (b) who considers that his or her proprietary or pecuniary interests:

     (ii) are adversely affected by a declaration so made; or

   (c) against whom proceedings have been instituted:

     (i) for an offence referred to in subsection 23 (1); or

     (ii) under section 26 (not being proceedings in relation to a declaration under Part IIA);

   (2) Where an application is made by a person under subsection (1), the Attorney-General, or an officer of the Australian Public Service authorized in writing by the Attorney-General, may, if he or she is satisfied that it would involve hardship to that person to refuse the application and that, in all the circumstances, it is reasonable that the application should be granted, authorize the grant by the Commonwealth to the person, either unconditionally or subject to such conditions as the Attorney-General or officer determines, of such legal or financial assistance as the Attorney-General or officer determines.
