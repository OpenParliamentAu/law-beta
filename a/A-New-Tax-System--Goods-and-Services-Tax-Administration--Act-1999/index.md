<dl compact="">

<dt>(2)</dt><dd>Other expressions in this Part have the same meaning as in the GST Act _._

</dd> </dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note:	An assessment made under this section is a reviewable GST

decision (see Division 7).

 </dl></dl>

23  Request for assessment

<dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>You may request the Commissioner in the approved form to make an

assessment of your net amount for a tax period or of an amount of GST payable

by you on an importation of goods.</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>The Commissioner must comply with the request if it is made within: </dd> </dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>4 years after the end of the tax period or the time of the importation;

or</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>such further period as the Commissioner allows.

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

24  GST liabilities do not depend on assessment

<dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>Your liability to pay GST, and the time by which a net amount or an amount

of GST must be paid, do not depend on, and are not in any way affected by, the

making of an assessment under this Division.</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>The Commissioner's obligation to pay a net amount under section 35-5 of the GST Act, and the time by which it must be paid, do not depend on, and are not in any way affected by, the making of an assessment under this Division. </dd> </dl>

<center>Back to Top</center>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note:	However, an assessment can be used as evidence of

liability: see section 59.

 </dl></dl>

25  Commissioner must give notice of the assessment

<dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>The Commissioner must give you notice of an assessment as soon as

practicable after the assessment is made. However, failing to do so does not

26  Amendment of assessment

<dl compact="">

		The Commissioner may at any time amend an assessment. An amended assessment

or underpaid GST: see sections 35 and 36.

 </dl></dl>

27  Later assessment prevails in case of inconsistency

<dl compact="">

<dt>(2)</dt><dd>The Commissioner may:

</dd> </dl>

<dt>(d)</dt><dd>an alteration that a later ruling makes to an earlier ruling is

subsection (2), if:
