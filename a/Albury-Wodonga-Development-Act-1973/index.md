**Application, saving or transitional provisions**

_Albury-Wodonga Development Amendment Act 2000_(No.&#160;46, 2000)

**Schedule&#160;1** **65  Application&#151;subsection 10(3) of the _Albury-Wodonga Development Act 1973_** Subsection 10(3) of the _Albury-Wodonga Development Act 1973_ as amended by this Act applies to appointments made after the commencement of this item.

**66  Application&#151;subsection 10(7) of the _Albury-Wodonga Development Act 1973_**

Despite the repeal of subsection 10(7) of the _Albury-Wodonga Development Act 1973_ by this Schedule, that subsection continues to apply, in relation to appointments made before the commencement of this item, as if that repeal had not happened.

**67  Transitional&#151;chief executive officer**

To avoid doubt, the amendments of the _Albury-Wodonga Development Act 1973_ made by this Schedule do not affect the continuity of anything done under section&#160;10A of that Act before the commencement of this item.
