## Part 5A—Civil penalty provisions

### Division 1—Obtaining a civil penalty order

##### <a id="22"></a>22  Civil penalty orders

Application for order

             (1)  The Minister may apply to a Court for an order that a person, who is alleged to have contravened a civil penalty provision, pay the Commonwealth a pecuniary penalty.

             (2)  The Minister must make the application within 6 years of the alleged contravention.

Court may order person to pay pecuniary penalty

             (3)  If the Court is satisfied that the person has contravened the civil penalty provision, the Court may order the person to pay to the Commonwealth such pecuniary penalty for the contravention as the Court determines to be appropriate.

Note:          Subsection (5) sets out the maximum penalty that the Court may order the person to pay.

             (4)  An order under subsection (3) is a **_civil penalty order_**.

Determining pecuniary penalty

             (5)  The pecuniary penalty must not be more than:

                     (a)  if the person is a body corporate—5 times the pecuniary penalty specified for the civil penalty provision; and

                     (b)  otherwise—the pecuniary penalty specified for the civil penalty provision.

             (6)  In determining the pecuniary penalty, the Court must take into account all relevant matters, including:

                     (a)  the nature and extent of the contravention; and

                     (b)  the nature and extent of any loss or damage suffered because of the contravention; and

                     (c)  the circumstances in which the contravention took place; and

                     (d)  whether the person has previously been found by a court  to have engaged in any similar conduct.

##### <a id="22A"></a>22A  Civil enforcement of penalty

             (1)  A pecuniary penalty is a debt payable to the Commonwealth.

             (2)  The Commonwealth may enforce a civil penalty order as if it were an order made in civil proceedings against the person to recover a debt due by the person. The debt arising from the order is taken to be a judgement debt.

##### <a id="22B"></a>22B  Conduct contravening more than one civil penalty provision

             (1)  If conduct constitutes a contravention of 2 or more civil penalty provisions, proceedings may be instituted under this Part against a person in relation to the contravention of any one or more of those provisions.

             (2)  However, the person is not liable to more than one pecuniary penalty under this Part in relation to the same conduct.

##### <a id="22C"></a>22C  Multiple contraventions

             (1)  A Court may make a single civil penalty order against a person for multiple contraventions of a civil penalty provision if proceedings for the contraventions are founded on the same facts, or if the contraventions form, or are part of, a series of contraventions of the same or a similar character.

             (2)  However, the penalty must not exceed the sum of the maximum penalties that could be ordered if a separate penalty were ordered for each of the contraventions.

##### <a id="22D"></a>22D  Proceedings may be heard together

                   A Court may direct that 2 or more proceedings for civil penalty orders are to be heard together.

##### <a id="22E"></a>22E  Civil evidence and procedure rules for civil penalty orders

                   A Court must apply the rules of evidence and procedure for civil matters when hearing proceedings for a civil penalty order.

##### <a id="22F"></a>22F  Contravening a civil penalty provision is not an offence

                   A contravention of a civil penalty provision is not an offence.

### Division 2—Civil proceedings and criminal proceedings

##### <a id="22G"></a>22G  Civil proceedings after criminal proceedings

                   A Court may not make a civil penalty order against a person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision if the person has been convicted of an offence constituted by conduct that is the same, or substantially the same, as the conduct constituting the contravention.

##### <a id="22H"></a>22H  Criminal proceedings during civil proceedings

             (1)  Proceedings for a civil penalty order against a person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision are stayed if:

                     (a)  criminal proceedings are commenced or have already been commenced against the person for an offence; and

                     (b)  the offence is constituted by conduct that is the same, or substantially the same, as the conduct alleged to constitute the contravention.

             (2)  The proceedings for the order (the **_civil proceedings_**) may be resumed if the person is not convicted of the offence. Otherwise:

                     (a)  the civil proceedings are dismissed; and

(b)  costs must not be awarded in relation to the civil proceedings.

##### <a id="22J"></a>22J  Criminal proceedings after civil proceedings

                   Criminal proceedings may be commenced against a person for conduct that is the same, or substantially the same, as conduct that would constitute a contravention of a civil penalty provision regardless of whether a civil penalty order has been made against the person in relation to the contravention.

##### <a id="22K"></a>22K  Evidence given in civil proceedings not admissible in criminal proceedings

             (1)  Evidence of information given, or evidence of production of documents by an individual, is not admissible in criminal proceedings against the individual if:

                     (a)  the individual previously gave the evidence or produced the documents in proceedings for a civil penalty order against the individual for an alleged contravention of a civil penalty provision (whether or not the order was made); and

                     (b)  the conduct alleged to constitute the offence is the same, or substantially the same, as the conduct alleged to constitute the contravention.

             (2)  However, subsection (1) does not apply to criminal proceedings in relation to the falsity of the evidence given by the individual in the proceedings for the civil penalty order.

### Division 3—Miscellaneous

##### <a id="22L"></a>22L  Ancillary contravention of civil penalty provisions

             (1)  A person must not:

                     (a)  attempt to contravene a civil penalty provision; or

                     (b)  aid, abet, counsel or procure a contravention of a civil penalty provision; or

                     (c)  induce (by threats, promises or otherwise) a contravention of a civil penalty provision; or

                     (d)  be in any way, directly or indirectly, knowingly concerned in, or party to, a contravention of a civil penalty provision; or

                     (e)  conspire with others to effect a contravention of a civil penalty provision.

Note:          Section 22N (which provides that a person’s state of mind does not need to be proven in relation to a civil penalty provision) does not apply to subsection (1) of this section.

Civil penalty

             (2)  A person who contravenes subsection (1) in relation to a civil penalty provision is taken to have contravened the provision.

##### <a id="22M"></a>22M  Mistake of fact

             (1)  A person is not liable to have a civil penalty order made against the person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision if:

                     (a)  at or before the time of the conduct constituting the contravention, the person:

                              (i)  considered whether or not facts existed; and

                             (ii)  was under a mistaken but reasonable belief about those facts; and

                     (b)  had those facts existed, the conduct would not have constituted a contravention of the civil penalty provision.

             (2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), a person may be regarded as having considered whether or not facts existed if:

                     (a)  the person had considered, on a previous occasion, whether those facts existed in the circumstances surrounding that occasion; and

                     (b)  the person honestly and reasonably believed that the circumstances surrounding the present occasion were the same, or substantially the same, as those surrounding the previous occasion.

             (3)  A person who wishes to rely on subsection (1) or (2) in proceedings for a civil penalty order bears an evidential burden in relation to the matters in that subsection.

##### <a id="22N"></a>22N  State of mind

             (1)  In proceedings for a civil penalty order against a person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision (other than subsection 22L(1)), it is not necessary to prove:

                     (a)  the person’s intention; or

                     (b)  the person’s knowledge; or

                     (c)  the person’s recklessness; or

                     (d)  the person’s negligence; or

                     (e)  any other state of mind of the person.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not affect the operation of section 22M (which is about mistake of fact).

## Part 6—Miscellaneous

##### <a id="25"></a>25  Officers and employees of governments and authorities

                   The Governor‑General may make arrangements with the Governor of a State or the Administrator of the Northern Territory for the performance of functions and the exercise of powers under this Act by officers or employees of that State or Territory or of an authority of that State or Territory, as the case may be.

##### <a id="26"></a>26  Programs etc. relating to the Antarctic

# Schedule 1—Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals

_Subsection 3(1)_

 The Contracting Parties.

_Recalling_ the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora, adopted under the Antarctic Treaty signed at Washington on 1 December 1959;

_Recognizing_ the general concern about the vulnerability of Antarctic seals to commercial exploitation and the consequent need for effective conservation measures;

_Recognizing_ that the stocks of Antarctic seals are an important living resource in the marine environment which requires an international agreement for its effective conservation;

_Recognizing_ that this resource should not be depleted by over‑exploitation, and hence that any harvesting should be regulated so as not to exceed the levels of the optimum sustainable yield;

_Recognizing_ that in order to improve scientific knowledge and so place exploitation on a rational basis, every effort should be made both to encourage biological and other research on Antarctic seal populations and to gain information from such research and from the statistics of future sealing operations, so that further suitable regulations may be formulated;

_Noting_ that the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research of the International Council of Scientific Unions (SCAR) is willing to carry out the tasks requested of it in this Convention;

_Desiring_ to promote and achieve the objectives of protection, scientific study and rational use of Antarctic seals, and to maintain a satisfactory balance within the ecological system,

ARTICLE 3

PROTECTION OF NATIVE FAUNA AND FLORA

              1.  Taking or harmful interference shall be prohibited, except in accordance with a permit.

              2.  Such permits shall specify the authorised activity, including when, where and by whom it is to be conducted and shall be issued only in the following circumstances:

                     (a)  to provide specimens for scientific study or scientific information;

                     (b)  to provide specimens for museums, herbaria and botanical gardens, or other educational institutions or uses;

                     (d)  to provide for unavoidable consequences of scientific activities not otherwise authorised under sub‑paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) above, or of the construction and operation of scientific support facilities.

              3.  The issue of such permits shall be limited so as to ensure that:

                     (a)  no more native mammals, birds, plants or invertebrates are taken than are strictly necessary to meet the purposes set forth in paragraph 2 above;

                     (b)  only small numbers of native mammals or birds are killed, and in no case more are killed from local populations than can, in combination with other permitted takings, normally be replaced by natural reproduction in the following season; and

                     (c)  the diversity of species, as well as the habitats essential to their existence, and the balance of the ecological systems existing within the Antarctic Treaty area are maintained.

              4.  Any species of native mammals, birds, plants and invertebrates listed in Appendix A to this Annex shall be designated “Specially Protected Species”, and shall be accorded special protection by the Parties.

              5.  Designation of a species as a Specially Protected Species shall be undertaken according to agreed procedures and criteria adopted by the ATCM.

              6.  The Committee shall review and provide advice on the criteria for proposing native mammals, birds, plants or invertebrates for designation as a Specially Protected Species.

              7.  Any Party, the Committee, the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research or the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources may propose a species for designation as a Specially Protected Species by submitting a proposal with justification to the ATCM.

              8.  A permit shall not be issued to take a Specially Protected Species unless the taking:

                     (a)  is for a compelling scientific purpose; and

                     (b)  will not jeopardise the survival or recovery of that species or local population;

              9.  The use of lethal techniques on Specially Protected Species shall only be permitted where there is no suitable alternative technique.

                     (b)  specify the species, numbers and, if appropriate, age and sex of the species to be introduced, along with a rationale, justifying the introduction and precautions to be taken to prevent escape or contact with fauna or flora.

              4.  Any species for which a permit has been issued in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 3 above shall, prior to expiration of the permit, be removed from the Antarctic Treaty area or be disposed of by incineration or equally effective means that eliminates risk to native fauna or flora. The permit shall specify this obligation.

              5.  Any species, including progeny, not native to the Antarctic Treaty area that is introduced into that area without a permit that has been issued in accordance with paragraph 1 and 3 above, shall be removed or disposed of whenever feasible, unless the removal or disposal would result in a greater adverse environmental impact. Such removal or disposal may include by incineration or by equally effective means, so as to be rendered sterile, unless it is determined that they pose no risk to native flora or fauna. In addition, all reasonable steps shall be taken to control the consequences of that introduction to avoid harm to native fauna or flora.

              6.  Nothing in this Article shall apply to the importation of food into the Antarctic Treaty area provided that no live animals are imported for this purpose and all plants and animal parts and products are kept under carefully controlled conditions and disposed of in accordance with Annex III to the Protocol.

              7.  Each Party shall require that precautions are taken to prevent the accidental introduction of micro‑organisms (e.g., viruses, bacteria, yeasts, fungi) not present naturally in the Antarctic Treaty area.

              8.  No live poultry or other living birds shall be brought into the Antarctic Treaty area. All appropriate efforts shall be made to ensure that poultry or avian products imported into Antarctica are free from contamination by diseases (such as Newcastle’s Disease, tuberculosis, and yeast infection) which might be harmful to native flora and fauna. Any poultry or avian products not consumed shall be removed from the Antarctic Treaty area or disposed of by incineration or equivalent means that eliminates the risks of introduction of micro‑organisms (e.g. viruses, bacteria, yeasts, fungi) to native flora and fauna.

              9.  The deliberate introduction of non‑sterile soil into the Antarctic Treaty area is prohibited. Parties should, to the maximum extent practicable, ensure that non‑sterile soil is not unintentionally imported into the Antarctic Treaty area.

ARTICLE 5

INFORMATION

                   Each Party shall make publicly available information on prohibited activities and Specially Protected Species to all those persons present in or intending to enter the Antarctic Treaty area with a view to ensuring that such persons understand and observe the provisions of this Annex.

ARTICLE 6

EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION

              1.  The Parties shall make arrangements for:

                     (a)  collecting and annually exchanging records (including records of permits) and statistics concerning the numbers or quantities of each species of native mammal, bird, plant or invertebrate taken in the Antarctic Treaty area; and

                     (b)  obtaining and exchanging information as to the status of native mammals, birds, plants, and invertebrates in the Antarctic Treaty area, and the extent to which any species or population needs protection.

              2.  As early as possible, after the end of each austral summer season, but in all cases before 1 October of each year, the Parties shall inform the other Parties as well as the Committee of any step taken pursuant to paragraph 1 above and of the number and nature of permits issued under this Annex in the preceding period of 1 April to 31 March.

ARTICLE 7

This Part deals with environmental protection approvals.

An operator may apply for an environmental protection approval in relation to an activity (other than a mining activity) to be carried on in the Antarctic.

The Minister may grant the approval if the Minister is satisfied that the operator meets certain requirements in relation to the activity.

Mandatory conditions relating to those requirements are imposed on all environmental protection approvals and those conditions cannot be varied or revoked. The Minister may also impose further conditions on an environmental protection approval, and may vary or revoke those conditions.

If the Minister is satisfied that it is necessary to do so, the Minister may vary an environmental protection approval on his or her own initiative or at the request of the holder of the approval.

The Minister may suspend or revoke an environmental protection approval if the Minister is satisfied that there has been non‑compliance with the conditions imposed on the approval or that the suspension or revocation is appropriate in all the circumstances.

The Minister must cause a register of environmental protection approvals to be kept.

**ANNEX VI TO THE PROTOCOL ON ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION TO THE ANTARCTIC TREATY**

**LIABILITY ARISING FROM ENVIRONMENTAL EMERGENCIES**

**_Preamble_**

The Parties,

_Recognising_ the importance of preventing, minimising and containing the impact of environmental emergencies on the Antarctic environment and dependent and associated ecosystems;

_Recalling_ Article 3 of the Protocol, in particular that activities shall be planned and conducted in the Antarctic Treaty area so as to accord priority to scientific research and to preserve the value of Antarctica as an area for the conduct of such research;

_Recalling_ the obligation in Article 15 of the Protocol to provide for prompt and effective response action to environmental emergencies, and to establish contingency plans for response to incidents with potential adverse effects on the Antarctic environment or dependent and associated ecosystems;

_Recalling_ Article 16 of the Protocol under which the Parties to the Protocol undertook consistent with the objectives of the Protocol for the comprehensive protection of the Antarctic environment and dependent and associated ecosystems to elaborate, in one or more Annexes to the Protocol, rules and procedures relating to liability for damage arising from activities taking place in the Antarctic Treaty area and covered by the Protocol;

_Noting_ further Decision 3 (2001) of the XXIVth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting regarding the elaboration of an Annex on the liability aspects of environmental emergencies, as a step in the establishment of a liability regime in accordance with Article 16 of the Protocol;

_Having regard to_ Article IV of the Antarctic Treaty and Article 8 of the Protocol;

**Have agreed** as follows:

**_Article 1_**

**Scope**

This Annex shall apply to environmental emergencies in the Antarctic Treaty area which relate to scientific research programmes, tourism and all other governmental and nongovernmental activities in the Antarctic Treaty area for which advance notice is required under Article VII(5) of the Antarctic Treaty, including associated logistic support activities. Measures and plans for preventing and responding to such emergencies are also included in this Annex. It shall apply to all tourist vessels that enter the Antarctic Treaty area. It shall also apply to environmental emergencies in the Antarctic Treaty area which relate to other vessels and activities as may be decided in accordance with Article 13.

**_Article 2_**

**Definitions**

For the purposes of this Annex:

(a)        “Decision” means a Decision adopted pursuant to the Rules of Procedure of Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings and referred to in Decision 1 (1995) of the XIXth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting;

(b)        “Environmental emergency” means any accidental event that has occurred, having taken place after the entry into force of this Annex, and that results in, or imminently threatens to result in, any significant and harmful impact on the Antarctic environment;

(c)        “Operator” means any natural or juridical person, whether governmental or nongovernmental, which organises activities to be carried out in the Antarctic Treaty area. An operator does not include a natural person who is an employee, contractor, subcontractor, or agent of, or who is in the service of, a natural or juridical person, whether governmental or non‑governmental, which organises activities to be carried out in the Antarctic Treaty area, and does not include a juridical person that is a contractor or subcontractor acting on behalf of a State operator;

(d)        “Operator of the Party” means an operator that organises, in that Party’s territory, activities to be carried out in the Antarctic Treaty area, and:

(i)         those activities are subject to authorisation by that Party for the Antarctic Treaty area; or

(ii)        in the case of a Party which does not formally authorise activities for the Antarctic Treaty area, those activities are subject to a comparable regulatory process by that Party.

The terms “its operator”, “Party of the operator”, and “Party of that operator” shall be interpreted in accordance with this definition;

(e)        “Reasonable”, as applied to preventative measures and response action, means measures or actions which are appropriate, practicable, proportionate and based on the availability of objective criteria and information, including:

(i)         risks to the Antarctic environment, and the rate of its natural recovery;

(ii)        risks to human life and safety; and

(iii)       technological and economic feasibility;

(f)        “Response action” means reasonable measures taken after an environmental emergency has occurred to avoid, minimise or contain the impact of that environmental emergency, which to that end may include clean‑up in appropriate circumstances, and includes determining the extent of that emergency and its impact;

(g)        “The Parties” means the States for which this Annex has become effective in accordance with Article 9 of the Protocol.

**_Article 3_**

**Preventative Measures**

1.         Each Party shall require its operators to undertake reasonable preventative measures that are designed to reduce the risk of environmental emergencies and their potential adverse impact.

2.         Preventative measures may include:

(a)         specialised structures or equipment incorporated into the design and construction of facilities and means of transportation;

(b)        specialised procedures incorporated into the operation or maintenance of facilities and means of transportation; and

(c)         specialised training of personnel.

**_Article 4_**

**Contingency Plans**

1.         Each Party shall require its operators to:

(a)         establish contingency plans for responses to incidents with potential adverse impacts on the Antarctic environment or dependent and associated ecosystems; and

(b)        co‑operate in the formulation and implementation of such contingency plans.

2.         Contingency plans shall include, when appropriate, the following components:

(a)         procedures for conducting an assessment of the nature of the incident;

(b)        notification procedures;

(c)         identification and mobilisation of resources;

(d)        response plans;

(e)         training;

(f)         record keeping; and

(g)         demobilisation.

3.         Each Party shall establish and implement procedures for immediate notification of, and co‑operative responses to, environmental emergencies, and shall promote the use of notification procedures and co‑operative response procedures by its operators that cause environmental emergencies.

**_Article 5_**

**Response Action**

1.         Each Party shall require each of its operators to take prompt and effective response action to environmental emergencies arising from the activities of that operator.

2.         In the event that an operator does not take prompt and effective response action, the Party of that operator and other Parties are encouraged to take such action, including through their agents and operators specifically authorised by them to take such action on their behalf.

3.         (a)         Other Parties wishing to take response action to an environmental emergency pursuant to paragraph 2 above shall notify their intention to the Party of the operator and the Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty beforehand with a view to the Party of the operator taking response action itself, except where a threat of significant and harmful impact to the Antarctic environment is imminent and it would be reasonable in all the circumstances to take immediate response action, in which case they shall notify the Party of the operator and the Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty as soon as possible.

(b)        Such other Parties shall not take response action to an environmental emergency pursuant to paragraph 2 above, unless a threat of significant and harmful impact to the Antarctic environment is imminent and it would be reasonable in all the circumstances to take immediate response action, or the Party of the operator has failed within a reasonable time to notify the Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty that it will take the response action itself, or where that response action has not been taken within a reasonable time after such notification.

(c)         In the case that the Party of the operator takes response action itself, but is willing to be assisted by another Party or Parties, the Party of the operator shall coordinate the response action.

4.         However, where it is unclear which, if any, Party is the Party of the operator or it appears that there may be more than one such Party, any Party taking response action shall make best endeavours to consult as appropriate and shall, where practicable, notify the Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty of the circumstances.

5.         Parties taking response action shall consult and coordinate their action with all other Parties taking response action, carrying out activities in the vicinity of the environmental emergency, or otherwise impacted by the environmental emergency, and shall, where practicable, take into account all relevant expert guidance which has been provided by permanent observer delegations to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, by other organisations, or by other relevant experts.

**_Article 6_**

**Liability**

1.         An operator that fails to take prompt and effective response action to environmental emergencies arising from its activities shall be liable to pay the costs of response action taken by Parties pursuant to Article 5(2) to such Parties.

2.         (a)         When a State operator should have taken prompt and effective response action but did not, and no response action was taken by any Party, the State operator shall be liable to pay the costs of the response action which should have been undertaken, into the fund referred to in Article 12.

(b)        When a non‑State operator should have taken prompt and effective response action but did not, and no response action was taken by any Party, the non‑State operator shall be liable to pay an amount of money that reflects as much as possible the costs of the response action that should have been taken. Such money is to be paid directly to the fund referred to in Article 12, to the Party of that operator or to the Party that enforces the mechanism referred to in Article 7(3). A Party receiving such money shall make best efforts to make a contribution to the fund referred to in Article 12 which at least equals the money received from the operator.

3.         Liability shall be strict.

4.         When an environmental emergency arises from the activities of two or more operators, they shall be jointly and severally liable, except that an operator which establishes that only part of the environmental emergency results from its activities shall be liable in respect of that part only.

5.         Notwithstanding that a Party is liable under this Article for its failure to provide for prompt and effective response action to environmental emergencies caused by its warships, naval auxiliaries, or other ships or aircraft owned or operated by it and used, for the time being, only on government non‑commercial service, nothing in this Annex is intended to affect the sovereign immunity under international law of such warships, naval auxiliaries, or other ships or aircraft.

**_Article 7_**

**Actions**

1.         Only a Party that has taken response action pursuant to Article 5(2) may bring an action against a non‑State operator for liability pursuant to Article 6(1) and such action may be brought in the courts of not more than one Party where the operator is incorporated or has its principal place of business or his or her habitual place of residence. However, should the operator not be incorporated in a Party or have its principal place of business or his or her habitual place of residence in a Party, the action may be brought in the courts of the Party of the operator within the meaning of Article 2(d). Such actions for compensation shall be brought within three years of the commencement of the response action or within three years of the date on which the Party bringing the action knew or ought reasonably to have known the identity of the operator, whichever is later. In no event shall an action against a non‑State operator be commenced later than 15 years after the commencement of the response action.

2.         Each Party shall ensure that its courts possess the necessary jurisdiction to entertain actions under paragraph 1 above.

3.         Each Party shall ensure that there is a mechanism in place under its domestic law for the enforcement of Article 6(2)(b) with respect to any of its non‑State operators within the meaning of Article 2(d), as well as where possible with respect to any non‑State operator that is incorporated or has its principal place of business or his or her habitual place of residence in that Party. Each Party shall inform all other Parties of this mechanism in accordance with Article 13(3) of the Protocol. Where there are multiple Parties that are capable of enforcing Article 6(2)(b) against any given non‑State operator under this paragraph, such Parties should consult amongst themselves as to which Party should take enforcement action. The mechanism referred to in this paragraph shall not be invoked later than 15 years after the date the Party seeking to invoke the mechanism became aware of the environmental emergency.

4.         The liability of a Party as a State operator under Article 6(1) shall be resolved only in accordance with any enquiry procedure which may be established by the Parties, the provisions of Articles 18, 19 and 20 of the Protocol and, as applicable, the Schedule to the Protocol on Arbitration.

5.         (a)         The liability of a Party as a State operator under Article 6(2)(a) shall be resolved only by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting and, should the question remain unresolved, only in accordance with any enquiry procedure which may be established by the Parties, the provisions of Articles 18, 19 and 20 of the Protocol and, as applicable, the Schedule to the Protocol on Arbitration.

(b)        The costs of the response action which should have been undertaken and was not, to be paid by a State operator into the fund referred to in Article 12, shall be approved by means of a Decision. The Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting should seek the advice of the Committee on Environmental Protection as appropriate.

6.         Under this Annex, the provisions of Articles 19(4), 19(5), and 20(1) of the Protocol, and, as applicable, the Schedule to the Protocol on Arbitration, are only applicable to liability of a Party as a State operator for compensation for response action that has been undertaken to an environmental emergency or for payment into the fund.

**_Article 8_**

**Exemptions from Liability**

1.         An operator shall not be liable pursuant to Article 6 if it proves that the environmental emergency was caused by:

(a)         an act or omission necessary to protect human life or safety;

(b)        an event constituting in the circumstances of Antarctica a natural disaster of an exceptional character, which could not have been reasonably foreseen, either generally or in the particular case, provided all reasonable preventative measures have been taken that are designed to reduce the risk of environmental emergencies and their potential adverse impact;

(c)         an act of terrorism; or

(d)        an act of belligerency against the activities of the operator.

2.         A Party, or its agents or operators specifically authorised by it to take such action on its behalf, shall not be liable for an environmental emergency resulting from response action taken by it pursuant to Article 5(2) to the extent that such response action was reasonable in all the circumstances.

**_Article 9_**

**Limits of Liability**

1.         The maximum amount for which each operator may be liable under Article 6(1) or Article 6(2), in respect of each environmental emergency, shall be as follows:

provided that the applicable limits are at least as high as the following: for a ship with a tonnage not exceeding 2,000 tons, one million SDR; and for a ship with a tonnage in excess thereof, in addition, for a ship with a tonnage between 2,001 and 30,000 tons, 400 SDR for each ton; for a ship with a tonnage from 30,001 to 70,000 tons, 300 SDR for each ton; and for each ton in excess of 70,000 tons, 200 SDR for each ton.

(b)        Nothing in subparagraph (a) above shall affect either the limits of liability set out in paragraph 1(a) above that apply to a Party as a State operator, or the rights and obligations of Parties that are not parties to any such treaty as mentioned above, or the application of Article 7(1) and Article 7(2).

3.         Liability shall not be limited if it is proved that the environmental emergency resulted from an act or omission of the operator, committed with the intent to cause such emergency, or recklessly and with knowledge that such emergency would probably result.

4.         The Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting shall review the limits in paragraphs 1(a) and 1(b) above every three years, or sooner at the request of any Party. Any amendments to these limits, which shall be determined after consultation amongst the Parties and on the basis of advice including scientific and technical advice, shall be made under the procedure set out in Article 13(2).

5.         For the purpose of this Article:

(a)         “ship” means a vessel of any type whatsoever operating in the marine environment and includes hydrofoil boats, air‑cushion vehicles, submersibles, floating craft and fixed or floating platforms;

(b)        “SDR” means the Special Drawing Rights as defined by the International Monetary Fund;

**_Article 11_**

**Insurance and Other Financial Security**

1.         Each Party shall require its operators to maintain adequate insurance or other financial security, such as the guarantee of a bank or similar financial institution, to cover liability under Article 6(1) up to the applicable limits set out in Article 9(1) and Article 9(2).

2.         Each Party may require its operators to maintain adequate insurance or other financial security, such as the guarantee of a bank or similar financial institution, to cover liability under Article 6(2) up to the applicable limits set out in Article 9(1) and Article 9(2).

3.         Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2 above, a Party may maintain self‑insurance in respect of its State operators, including those carrying out activities in the furtherance of scientific research.

**_Article 12_**

**The Fund**

1.         The Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty shall maintain and administer a fund, in accordance with Decisions including terms of reference to be adopted by the Parties, to provide, _inter alia_, for the reimbursement of the reasonable and justified costs incurred by a Party or Parties in taking response action pursuant to Article 5(2).

2.         Any Party or Parties may make a proposal to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting for reimbursement to be paid from the fund. Such a proposal may be approved by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, in which case it shall be approved by way of a Decision. The Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting may seek the advice of the Committee of Environmental Protection on such a proposal, as appropriate.

3.         Special circumstances and criteria, such as: the fact that the responsible operator was an operator of the Party seeking reimbursement; the identity of the responsible operator remaining unknown or not subject to the provisions of this Annex; the unforeseen failure of the relevant insurance company or financial institution; or an exemption in Article 8 applying, shall be duly taken into account by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting under paragraph 2 above.

4.         Any State or person may make voluntary contributions to the fund.

**_Article 13_**

**Amendment or Modification**

1.         This Annex may be amended or modified by a Measure adopted in accordance with Article IX(1) of the Antarctic Treaty.

2.         In the case of a Measure pursuant to Article 9(4), and in any other case unless the Measure in question specifies otherwise, the amendment or modification shall be deemed to have been approved, and shall become effective, one year after the close of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting at which it was adopted, unless one or more Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties notifies the Depositary, within that time period, that it wishes any extension of that period or that it is unable to approve the Measure.

This Part deals with environmental emergencies in the Antarctic.

If an environmental emergency is caused by an activity carried on by a person in the Antarctic, the operator who organised the activity must immediately notify the Minister, or an authorised officer, of the emergency.

The operator must also ensure that prompt and effective response action is taken in relation to the emergency.

The Minister may give the operator a direction in relation to the emergency. The operator must comply with the direction.

If the operator does not take prompt and effective response action in relation to the emergency, a Court may in certain circumstances make a costs order against the operator.

This Part also establishes the Antarctic Environmental Liability Special Account and deals with other miscellaneous matters.
