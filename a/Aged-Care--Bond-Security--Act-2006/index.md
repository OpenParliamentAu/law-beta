In certain circumstances, the Commonwealth will pay to a person an amount that the Secretary considers is equal to a bond balance, and interest, owed to the person by an approved provider or former approved provider (see sections 10, 12, 13 and 16).

Any rights that a person who is paid such an amount had to recover the amount from an approved provider or former approved provider are transferred to the Commonwealth (see section 15).

The Commonwealth may recoup certain costs it incurs from other approved providers (see sections 18 and 19 and the _Aged Care (Bond Security) Levy Act 2006_).

                     (b)  after the initial refund, the Secretary, under paragraph 12(2)(b), determines in respect of the outstanding bond balance of the **_approved provider or former approved provider_** in relation to the bond, the amount that the Secretary considers is equal to the amount of the bond balance that has not been refunded at the time the Secretary makes the determination; and

                     (c)  a refund declaration is made under section 13 in reliance on that determination; and

                     (d)  in a case where the approved provider or former approved provider is a corporation:

                     (e)  in a case where the approved provider or former approved provider is not a corporation:

                     (a)  determine the amount that the Secretary considers is equal to the amount of the value of the initial refund that has not been retained by the person to whom it was made; and

                     (b)  as soon as practicable after the Secretary has determined that matter, make another refund declaration relating to the outstanding bond balance.

             (3)  The refund declaration must:

                     (a)  be in writing; and

                     (b)  specify the approved provider or former approved provider who has not refunded all, or part, of the relevant outstanding bond balance; and
