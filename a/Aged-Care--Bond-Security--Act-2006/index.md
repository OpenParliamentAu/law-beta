In certain circumstances, the Commonwealth will pay to a person an amount that the Secretary considers is equal to a bond balance, and interest, owed to the person by an approved provider (see sections 10, 12, 13 and 16).

Any rights that a person who is paid such an amount had to recover the amount from an approved provider are transferred to the Commonwealth (see section 15).

The Commonwealth may recoup certain costs it incurs from other approved providers (see sections 18 and 19 and the _Aged Care (Bond Security) Levy Act 2006_).
