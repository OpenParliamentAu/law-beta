 1.	The authorized capital stock of the Bank shall be one billion dollars ($1,000,000,000) in terms of United States dollars of the weight and fineness in effect on 31&#160;January 1966\. The dollar wherever referred to in this Agreement shall be understood as being a United States dollar of the above value. The authorized capital stock shall be divided into one hundred thousand (100,000) shares having a par value of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) each, which shall be available for subscription only by members in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 of this Agreement.
 2.	The original authorized capital stock shall be divided into paid-in shares 
<center>Back to Top</center>
 and callable shares. Shares having an aggregate par value of five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000) shall be paid-in shares, and shares having an aggregate par value of five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000) shall be callable shares.

The authorized capital stock of the Bank may be increased by the Board of Governors, at such time and under such terms and conditions as it may deem advisable, by a vote of two-thirds of the total number of Governors, representing not less than three-fourths of the total voting power of the members.
 <center>_Article 5_</center>
 <center>SUBSCRIPTION OF SHARES</center>
 1.	Each member shall subscribe to shares of the capital stock of the Bank. Each subscription to the original authorized capital stock shall be for paid-in shares and callable shares in equal parts.

The initial number of shares to be subscribed by countries which are admitted to membership in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 3 of this Agreement shall be determined by the Board of Governors; provided, however, that no such subscription shall be authorized which would have the effect of reducing the percentage of capital stock held by regional members below sixty (60) per cent of the total subscribed capital stock.

In case of an increase in the authorized capital stock, each member shall have a reasonable opportunity to subscribe, under such terms and conditions as the Board of Governors shall determine, to a proportion of the increase of stock equivalent to the proportion which its stock theretofore subscribed bears to the total subscribed capital stock immediately prior to such increase; provided, however, that the foregoing provision shall not apply in respect of any increase or portion of an increase in the authorized capital stock intended solely to give effect to determinations of the Board of Governors under paragraphs 1 and 3 of this Article.

 3.	The Board of Governors may, at the request of a member, increase the subscription of such member on such terms and conditions as the Board may determine; provided, however, that no such increase in the subscription of any member shall be authorized which would have the effect of reducing the percentage of capital stock held by regional members below sixty (60) per cent of the total subscribed capital stock. The Board of Governors shall pay special regard to the request of any regional member having less than six (6) per cent of the subscribed capital stock to increase its proportionate share thereof.
 4.	Shares of stock initially subscribed by members shall be issued at par. Other shares shall be issued at par unless the Board of Governors by a vote of a majority of the total number of Governors, representing a majority of the total voting power of the members, decides in special circumstances to issue them on other terms.
 5.	Shares of stock shall not be pledged or encumbered in any manner whatsoever, and they shall not be transferable except to the Bank in accordance with Chapter VII of this Agreement.
 6.	The liability of the members on shares shall be limited to the unpaid portion of their issue price.
 7.	No member shall be liable, by reason of its membership, for obligations of the Bank.
 <center>_Article 6_</center>

 1.	Payment of the amount initially subscribed by each Signatory to this Agreement which becomes a member in accordance with Article 64 to the paid-in capital stock of the Bank shall be made in five (5) instalments, of twenty (20) per cent each of such amount. The first instalment shall be paid by each member within thirty (30) days after entry into force of this Agreement, or on or before the date of deposit on its behalf of its instrument of ratification or acceptance in accordance with paragraph 1 of Article 64, whichever is later. The second instalment shall become due one (1) year from the entry into force of this Agreement.

Such notes or obligations shall be non-negotiable, non-interest-bearing, and payable to the Bank at par value upon demand. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2 (ii) of Article 24, demands upon such notes or obligations payable in convertible currencies shall, over reasonable periods of time, be uniform in percentage on all such notes or 
<center>Back to Top</center>
 obligations.
 4.	Each payment of a member in its own currency under paragraph 2 (b) of this Article shall be in such amount as the Bank, after such consultation with the International Monetary Fund as the Bank may consider necessary and utilizing the par value established with the International Monetary Fund, if any, determines to be equivalent to the full value in terms of dollars of the portion of the subscription being paid. The initial payment shall be in such amount as the member considers appropriate hereunder but shall be subject to such adjustment, to be effected within ninety (90) days of the date on which such payment was due, as the Bank shall determine to be necessary to constitute the full dollar equivalent of such payment.
 5.	Payment of the amount subscribed to the callable capital stock of the Bank shall be subject to call only as and when required by the Bank to meet its obligations incurred under sub-paragraphs&#160;(ii) and (iv) of Article 11 on borrowings of funds for inclusion in its ordinary capital resources or on guarantees chargeable to such resources.
 6.	In the event of the call referred to in paragraph 5 of this Article, payment may be made at the option of the member in gold, convertible currency or in the currency required to discharge the obligations of the Bank for the purpose of which the call is made.

 (x)	In the case of a direct loan made by the Bank, the borrower shall be permitted by the Bank to draw its funds only to meet expenditures in connexion with the project as they are actually incurred;

The third arbitrator shall be empowered to settle all questions of procedure in any case where the parties are in disagreement with respect thereto.
 <center>_Article 62_</center>

 _Section A. Election of Directors by Governors representing regional members._
 (1)	Each Governor representing a regional member shall cast all votes of the member he represents for a single person.
 (2)	The seven (7) persons receiving the highest number of votes shall be Directors, except that no person who receives less than ten (10) per cent of the total voting power of regional members shall be considered as elected.
 (3)	If seven (7) persons are not elected at the first ballot, a second ballot shall be held in which the person who received the lowest number of votes in the preceding ballot shall be ineligible and in which votes shall be cast only by:
 (a)	Governors who voted in the preceding ballot for a person who is not elected; and (b) Governors whose votes for a person who is elected are deemed, in accordance with paragraph 4 of this Section, to have raised the votes cast for that person above eleven (11) per cent of the total voting power of regional members.
 (4)	(a)	In determining whether the votes cast by a Governor shall be deemed to have raised the total number of votes for any person above eleven (11) per cent, the said eleven (11) per cent shall be deemed to include, first, the votes of the Governor casting the highest number of votes for that person, and then, in diminishing order, the votes of each Governor casting the next highest number until eleven (11) per cent is attained.
 (b)	Any Governor, part of whose votes must be counted in order to raise the votes cast for any person above ten (10) per cent, shall be considered as casting all his votes for that person even if the total number of votes cast for that person thereby exceeds eleven (11) per cent.
 (5)	If, after the second ballot, seven (7) persons are not elected, further ballots shall be held in conformity with the principles and procedures laid down in this Section, except that after six (6) persons are elected, the seventh may be elected&#151;notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph&#160;(2) of this Section&#151;by a simple majority of the remaining votes of regional members. All such remaining votes shall be deemed to have counted towards the election of the seventh Director.
 (6)	In case of an increase in the number of Directors to be elected by Governors representing regional members, the minimum and maximum percentages specified in paragraphs&#160;(2), (3), and (4) of Section A of this Annex shall be correspondingly adjusted by the Board of Governors.

 (1)	Each Governor representing a non-regional member shall cast all votes of the member he represents for a single person.
 (2)	The three (3) persons receiving the highest number of votes shall be Directors, except that no person who receives less than twenty-five (25) per cent of the total voting power of non-regional members shall be considered as elected.
 (3)	If three (3) persons are not elected at the first ballot, a second ballot shall be held in which the person who received the lowest number of votes in the preceding ballot shall be ineligible and in which votes shall be cast only by:
 (a)	Governors who voted in the preceding ballot for a person who is not elected; and
 (b)	Governors whose votes for a person who is elected are deemed, in accordance with paragraph&#160;(4) of this Section, to have raised the votes cast for that person above twenty-six (26) per cent of the total voting power of non-regional members.
 (4)	(a)	In determining whether the votes cast by a Governor shall be deemed to have raised the total number of votes for any person above twenty-six (26) per cent, the said twenty-six (26) per cent shall be deemed to include, first, the votes of the Governor casting the highest number of votes for that person, and then, in diminishing order, the votes of each Governor casting the next highest number until twenty-six (26) per cent is attained.
 (b)	Any Governor, part of whose votes must be counted in order to raise the votes cast for any person above twenty-six (26) per cent, shall be considered as casting all his votes for that person even if the total number of votes cast for that person thereby exceeds twenty-six (26) per cent.
 (5)	If, after the second ballot, three (3) persons are not elected, further ballots shall be held in conformity with the principles and procedures laid down in this Section, except that after two (2) persons are elected, a third may be elected&#151;provided that subscriptions from non-regional members shall have reached a minimum total of $345 million, and notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph&#160;(2) of this Section&#151;by a simple majority of the remaining votes. All such remaining votes shall be deemed to have counted towards the election of the third Director.
 (6)	In case of an increase in the number of directors to be elected by Governors representing non-regional members, the minimum and maximum percentages specified in paragraphs&#160;(2), (3) and (4) of Section B of this Annex shall be correspondingly adjusted by the Board of Governors.
