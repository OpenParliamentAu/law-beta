## SECT
<sect> RECOGNISING:<lf>   (a) that the protection of the health and safety of human beings, animals and the environment is essential to the well-being of society and can be enhanced by putting in place a system to regulate agricultural chemical products and veterinary chemical products; and<lf>   (b) that the principle of ecologically sustainable development requires a regulatory system that is designed to ensure that the use of such products today will not impair the prospects of future generations; and<lf>   (c) that the furthering of trade and commerce between Australia and places outside Australia, and the present and future economic viability and competitiveness of primary industry and of a domestic industry for manufacturing and formulating such products, are essential for the well-being of the economy and require a system for regulating such products that is cost-effective, efficient, predictable, adaptive and responsive; and<lf>   (d) that it is desirable to establish a regulatory system that is open and accountable and gives opportunity for public input with respect to the regulation of such products; and<lf>   (e) that the system should, so far as practicable, be uniform throughout Australia; and<lf>   (f) that uniformity could best be achieved by the enactment of legislation by the Parliament of the Commonwealth as a law for the government of the Australian Capital Territory and the adoption of that legislation by the Parliaments and legislatures of the States and the Northern Territory: </lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></sect>
