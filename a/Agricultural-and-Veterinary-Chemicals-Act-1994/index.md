**Notes** 

An Act to make a law for the government of certain Territories in relation to the evaluation, registration and control of agricultural and veterinary chemical products, and for related purposes

Recognising:

             (a)  that the protection of the health and safety of human beings, animals and the environment is essential to the well-being of society and can be enhanced by putting in place a system to regulate agricultural chemical products and veterinary chemical products; and

             (b)  that the principle of ecologically sustainable development requires a regulatory system that is designed to ensure that the use of such products today will not impair the prospects of future generations; and

             (c)  that the furthering of trade and commerce between Australia and places outside Australia, and the present and future economic viability and competitiveness of primary industry and of a domestic industry for manufacturing and formulating such products, are essential for the well-being of the economy and require a system for regulating such products that is cost-effective, efficient, predictable, adaptive and responsive; and

             (d)  that it is desirable to establish a regulatory system that is open and accountable and gives opportunity for public input with respect to the regulation of such products; and

             (e)  that the system should, so far as practicable, be uniform throughout Australia; and

             (f)  that uniformity could best be achieved by the enactment of legislation by the Parliament of the Commonwealth as a law for the government of the Australian Capital Territory and the adoption of that legislation by the Parliaments and legislatures of the States and the Northern Territory:

##### <a id="16"></a>16  This Part overrides the prerogative

                   If, because of this Part, a provision of a law of the Commonwealth or of a State binds the Crown in right of the Commonwealth, of the Australian Capital Territory or of Norfolk Island, the Crown in that capacity is subject to that provision despite any prerogative right or privilege.

##### <a id="21"></a>21  Exercise of jurisdiction under cross-vesting provisions

                   This Act does not affect the operation of a provision of any other law of the Commonwealth, or any law of a State or of a participating Territory, relating to cross-vesting of jurisdiction.

## Part 7—Miscellaneous

##### <a id="22"></a>22  Orders

                   Orders in force for the time being under section 7 of the _Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act 1994_ have the same effect for the purposes of the Agvet Code of the participating Territories as they would have if they were provisions of the Agvet Regulations of those Territories.
