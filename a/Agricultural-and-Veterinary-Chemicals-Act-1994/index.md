## An Act to make a law for the government of certain Territories in relation to the evaluation, registration and control of agricultural and veterinary chemical products, and for related purposes

Recognising:

             (a)  that the protection of the health and safety of human beings, animals and the environment is essential to the well-being of society and can be enhanced by putting in place a system to regulate agricultural chemical products and veterinary chemical products; and

             (b)  that the principle of ecologically sustainable development requires a regulatory system that is designed to ensure that the use of such products today will not impair the prospects of future generations; and

             (c)  that the furthering of trade and commerce between Australia and places outside Australia, and the present and future economic viability and competitiveness of primary industry and of a domestic industry for manufacturing and formulating such products, are essential for the well-being of the economy and require a system for regulating such products that is cost-effective, efficient, predictable, adaptive and responsive; and

             (d)  that it is desirable to establish a regulatory system that is open and accountable and gives opportunity for public input with respect to the regulation of such products; and

             (e)  that the system should, so far as practicable, be uniform throughout Australia; and

             (f)  that uniformity could best be achieved by the enactment of legislation by the Parliament of the Commonwealth as a law for the government of the Australian Capital Territory and the adoption of that legislation by the Parliaments and legislatures of the States and the Northern Territory:

             (4)  Regulations under section 25 that take effect within 12 months after an external Territory becomes a participating Territory may amend or repeal laws of that Territory.

## Part 3—Citing the Agvet Code and the Agvet Regulations

##### <a id="11"></a>11  References to Agvet Code and Agvet Regulations of other jurisdictions

             (1)  This section has effect for the purposes of an Act, a law of a participating Territory, or an instrument made under an Act or such a law.

             (2)  If a law of a State provides that the Code set out in the Schedule to the _Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act 1994_ as in force for the time being applies as a law of that State, the Agvet Code of that State is the Code so set out, applying as a law of that State.

             (3)  If a law of a State provides that the regulations in force for the time being under section 6 of the _Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act 1994_ apply as regulations in force for the purposes of the Agvet Code of that State, the Agvet Regulations of that State are those regulations as so applying.

##### <a id="12"></a>12  References to Agvet Codes and Agvet Regulations

             (1)  The object of this section is to help ensure that the Agvet Code of the participating Territories can operate, in appropriate circumstances, as if that Code, together with the Agvet Code of each State, constituted a single national Agvet Code applying throughout Australia.

             (2)  Subject to this section, a reference in an instrument to the Agvet Codes, or to the Agvet Regulations, is taken, for the purposes of the laws of the Commonwealth and of the laws of the participating Territories:

                     (a)  to be a reference to the Agvet Code, or to the Agvet Regulations, as the case may be, of the participating Territories; and

                     (b)  to include a separate reference to the Agvet Code, or to the Agvet Regulations, as the case may be, of each State.

             (3)  Subsection (2) has effect except so far as the contrary intention appears in the instrument or the context of the reference otherwise requires.

## Part 4—Application of Agvet Codes to the Crown

##### <a id="13"></a>13  Agvet Code of the participating Territories

                   The Agvet Code of the participating Territories binds the Crown in all its capacities.

##### <a id="14"></a>14  Agvet Code of other jurisdictions

                   The Agvet Code of each State binds the Crown in right of the Commonwealth, of the Australian Capital Territory and of Norfolk Island.

##### <a id="15"></a>15  Crown not liable to prosecution

                   Nothing in this Part, or in the Agvet Code of any jurisdiction, renders the Crown liable to be prosecuted for an offence.

##### <a id="16"></a>16  This Part overrides the prerogative

                   If, because of this Part, a provision of a law of the Commonwealth or of a State binds the Crown in right of the Commonwealth, of the Australian Capital Territory or of Norfolk Island, the Crown in that capacity is subject to that provision despite any prerogative right or privilege.

## Part 5—Performance of functions that corresponding laws of States confer on Commonwealth authorities and officers

##### <a id="17"></a>17  Ministers

                   A corresponding law may confer prescribed functions and powers on a Minister.

##### <a id="18"></a>18  Commonwealth authorities and officers

             (1)  A corresponding law of a jurisdiction may confer duties, functions and powers in respect of any matter arising in relation to the applicable provisions of the jurisdiction:

                     (a)  upon the Administrative Appeals Tribunal; or

                     (b)  upon an inspector appointed under subsection 69F(1) of the _Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act 1992_; or

                     (c)  upon an analyst approved under section 69G of the _Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act 1992_.

Note:          Subsection 7(2) of the _Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act 1992_ deals with functions and powers conferred on the NRA by State laws.

             (2)  A corresponding law may confer such other duties, functions and powers as are prescribed upon authorities and officers of the Commonwealth.

             (3)  In enacting subsections (1) and (2), it is the intention of the Parliament to rely on all powers available to it under the Constitution.

##### <a id="18A"></a>18A  Conferral of duties, functions and powers

             (1)  To the extent that an authority or officer of the Commonwealth (including a Minister) has a duty, function or power that is conferred, or taken to be conferred, by a corresponding law:

                     (a)  that duty, function or power is not taken to be conferred by Commonwealth law; and

                     (b)  section 18 is not taken to authorise the conferral of the duty, function or power;

if the conferral or authorisation would contravene a constitutional doctrine restricting the duties that may be conferred on authorities or officers of the Commonwealth, or would otherwise exceed the legislative power of the Commonwealth.

             (2)  If, to ensure the validity of the conferral of a duty, function or power purportedly conferred on an authority or officer of the Commonwealth (including a Minister) by a corresponding law, it is necessary that the duty, function or power be conferred by a law of the Commonwealth, rather than by a law of a State, the duty, function or power is taken to be conferred by this Act to the extent necessary to ensure that validity.

             (3)  If, because of subsection (2), this Act is taken to confer a duty, function or power upon an authority or officer of the Commonwealth (including a Minister), it is the intention of the Parliament to rely on all powers available to it under the Constitution to support the conferral of the duty, function or power.

             (4)  Subsections (2) and (3) do not limit section 18.

##### <a id="19"></a>19  _Gazette_ notices under corresponding laws

                   A corresponding law may require or permit a document, or a copy of a document, to be published in the _Gazette_.

## Part 6—Jurisdiction of courts

##### <a id="20"></a>20  Jurisdiction of Federal Court and courts of Territories

             (1)  Jurisdiction is conferred on the Federal Court of Australia with respect to all civil matters arising under the Agvet Code of the participating Territories or the Agvet Regulations of the participating Territories.

             (2)  Subject to section 9 of the _Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977_, jurisdiction is conferred on the courts of the participating Territories with respect to all civil matters arising under the Agvet Code of the participating Territories or the Agvet Regulations of the participating Territories.

             (3)  Jurisdiction is conferred on the courts of the participating Territories with respect to all criminal matters arising under the Agvet Code of the participating Territories or the Agvet Regulations of the participating Territories.

             (4)  The Federal Court of Australia may exercise jurisdiction (whether original or appellate) conferred on that Court by a law of the Northern Territory corresponding to this Part with respect to matters arising under the Agvet Code or the Agvet Regulations of the Northern Territory.

##### <a id="21"></a>21  Exercise of jurisdiction under cross-vesting provisions

                   This Act does not affect the operation of a provision of any other law of the Commonwealth, or any law of a State or of a participating Territory, relating to cross-vesting of jurisdiction.

## Part 7—Miscellaneous

##### <a id="22"></a>22  Orders

                   Orders in force for the time being under section 7 of the _Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act 1994_ have the same effect for the purposes of the Agvet Code of the participating Territories as they would have if they were provisions of the Agvet Regulations of those Territories.

##### <a id="23"></a>23  Manufacturing principles

             (1)  The NRA may determine for the purposes of Part 8 of the Agvet Code of the participating Territories written principles to be observed in the manufacture of chemical products that are consistent with the Agvet Codes, the Agvet Regulations and the laws of any jurisdiction that relate to occupational health or safety.

             (2)  The manufacturing principles may relate to:

                     (a)  the standards to be maintained, and the equipment to be used, at premises used for the manufacture of chemical products; or

                     (b)  procedures for quality assurance and quality control to be employed in the manufacture of chemical products; or

                     (c)  the qualifications and experience required of persons employed in the manufacture of chemical products; or

                     (d)  the manufacturing practices to be employed in the manufacture of chemical products; or

                     (e)  other matters relevant to the quality, safety and efficacy of chemical products that are manufactured in this jurisdiction;

and may include codes of good manufacturing practice.

             (3)  Manufacturing principles are disallowable instruments for the purposes of section 46A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

##### <a id="24"></a>24  Repeal and transitional provisions

## Part 8—Imposition of fees and taxes
