##### <a id="14A"></a>14A  Powers of arrest

                   A protective service officer may, without warrant, arrest a person for a protective service offence if the protective service officer believes on reasonable grounds that:

                     (a)  the person has just committed, or is committing, the offence; and

                     (b)  the arrest of the person is necessary for the purpose of:

                              (i)  ensuring the appearance of the person before a court of competent jurisdiction for the offence; or

                             (ii)  preventing the continuation of, or a repetition of, the offence or the commission of a further protective service offence; or

                            (iii)  preventing the concealment, loss or destruction of evidence of, or relating to, the offence; or

                            (iv)  preserving the safety or welfare of the person; and

                     (c)  proceedings by way of summons against the person for the offence would not achieve such a purpose.

##### <a id="14B"></a>14B  Use of force in making arrest etc.

             (1)  A protective service officer must not, in arresting or attempting to arrest a person for an offence or in preventing a person who has been arrested for an offence from escaping, use more force, or subject the person to greater indignity, than is reasonable and necessary in order to make the arrest or prevent the escape of the person.

             (2)  Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), a protective service officer must not, in arresting or attempting to arrest a person for an offence or in preventing a person who has been arrested for an offence from escaping, do an act likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm to the person unless the officer believes on reasonable grounds that the doing of the act is necessary to protect life or prevent serious injury to the officer or any other person.

##### <a id="14C"></a>14C  Arrested person to be informed of grounds of arrest

             (1)  A protective service officer who arrests a person for an offence must inform the person, at the time of the arrest, of the offence for which the person is arrested.

             (2)  It is sufficient compliance with subsection (1) if the protective service officer informs the person of the substance of the offence, and it is not necessary to do so in language of a precise or technical nature.

             (3)  Subsection (1) does not apply to the arrest by a protective service officer of a person for an offence if the person, by his or her own actions, makes it impracticable for the protective service officer to inform the person of the offence.

             (4)  Where a protective service officer who arrests a person for an offence believes or has reasonable grounds for believing that the person is unable, by reason of inadequate knowledge of the English language or any physical or mental disability, to understand the substance of the offence for which the person is arrested, the protective service officer must, as soon as practicable, take all reasonable steps to ensure that the person is provided with an explanation of the substance of the offence that the person is able to understand.

##### <a id="14D"></a>14D  Search of arrested person

             (1)  A protective service officer may, upon lawfully arresting a person for an offence:

                     (a)  conduct an ordinary search or a frisk search of the person; and

                     (b)  search the clothing that the person is wearing and any vessel, vehicle or other property under the person’s immediate control if the officer believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary to do so;

for the purpose of:

                     (c)  ascertaining whether there is concealed on the person, in the clothing or in the property, a weapon or other thing capable of being used to inflict bodily injury or to assist the person to escape from custody; or

                     (d)  preventing the concealment, loss or destruction of evidence of, or relating to, the offence.

             (2)  If the protective service officer is not of the same sex as the arrested person, an ordinary search or a frisk search of the arrested person for the purposes of subsection (1) may be conducted by:

                     (a)  if a protective service officer, a member or a special member of the same sex as the arrested person is reasonably available to conduct the search—that protective service officer, member or special member; or

                     (b)  if paragraph (a) does not apply but a police officer or an officer of Customs (within the meaning of subsection 4(1) of the _Customs Act 1901_) who is of the same sex as the arrested person is reasonably available to conduct the search—that police officer or officer of Customs; or

                     (c)  otherwise—any other person who is of the same sex as the arrested person and who is requested by the protective service officer to conduct the search.

             (3)  An action or proceeding, whether civil or criminal, does not lie against a person who, at the request of a protective service officer, conducts a search under this section if the person acts in good faith and does not contravene subsection (4).

             (4)  A protective service officer or other person who conducts a search under this section must not use more force, or subject an arrested person to greater indignity, than is reasonable and necessary in order to conduct the search.

             (5)  A protective service officer or other person who lawfully conducts a search under this section may seize:

                     (a)  any weapon or thing mentioned in paragraph (1)(a); or

                     (b)  anything that the officer or other person has reasonable grounds to believe is a thing:

                              (i)  with respect to which an offence has been committed; or

                             (ii)  that will afford evidence of the commission of an offence; or

                     (a)  they potentially fall within Commonwealth legislative power because of the elements of the State offence; or

                     (b)  they potentially fall within Commonwealth legislative power because of the circumstances in which the State offence was committed (whether or not those circumstances are expressed to be acts or omissions involved in committing the offence); or

                     (d)  both:

                              (i)  the Australian Federal Police is investigating a matter relating to a relevant criminal activity that relates to an offence against a law of the Commonwealth or a Territory; and

                             (ii)  if the Australian Federal Police is investigating, or were to investigate, a matter relating to a relevant criminal activity that relates to the State offence—that investigation is, or would be, incidental to the investigation mentioned in subparagraph (i).

Specificity of acts or omissions

             (2)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(c), the specificity of the acts or omissions involved in committing a State offence is to be determined having regard to the circumstances in which the offence was committed (whether or not those circumstances are expressed to be elements of the offence).
