##### <a id="4AA"></a>4AA   State offences that have a federal aspect

Object

          (1A)  The object of this section is to identify State offences that have a federal aspect because:

                     (a)  they potentially fall within Commonwealth legislative power because of the elements of the State offence; or

                     (b)  they potentially fall within Commonwealth legislative power because of the circumstances in which the State offence was committed (whether or not those circumstances are expressed to be acts or omissions involved in committing the offence); or

                     (c)  the Australian Federal Police investigating them is incidental to the Australian Federal Police investigating an offence against a law of the Commonwealth or a Territory.

State offences that have a federal aspect

             (1)  For the purposes of this Act, a State offence has a **_federal aspect_** if, and only if:

                     (a)  both:

                              (i)  the State offence is not an ancillary offence; and

                             (ii)  assuming that the provision creating the State offence had been enacted by the Parliament of the Commonwealth instead of by the Parliament of the State—the provision would have been a valid law of the Commonwealth; or

                     (b)  both:

                              (i)  the State offence is an ancillary offence that relates to a particular primary offence; and

                             (ii)  assuming that the provision creating the primary offence had been enacted by the Parliament of the Commonwealth instead of by the Parliament of the State—the provision would have been a valid law of the Commonwealth; or

                     (c)  assuming that the Parliament of the Commonwealth had enacted a provision that created an offence penalising the specific acts or omissions involved in committing the State offence—that provision would have been a valid law of the Commonwealth; or

                     (d)  both:

                              (i)  the Australian Federal Police is investigating an offence against a law of the Commonwealth or a Territory; and

                             (ii)  if the Australian Federal Police is investigating, or were to investigate, the State offence—that investigation is, or would be, incidental to the investigation mentioned in subparagraph (i).

Specificity of acts or omissions

             (2)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(c), the specificity of the acts or omissions involved in committing a State offence is to be determined having regard to the circumstances in which the offence was committed (whether or not those circumstances are expressed to be elements of the offence).

State offences covered by paragraph (1)(c)

             (3)  A State offence is taken to be covered by paragraph (1)(c) if the conduct constituting the State offence:

                     (a)  affects the interests of:

                              (i)  the Commonwealth; or

                             (ii)  an authority of the Commonwealth; or

                            (iii)  a constitutional corporation; or

                     (b)  was engaged in by a constitutional corporation; or

                     (c)  was engaged in in a Commonwealth place; or

                     (d)  involved the use of a postal service or other like service; or

                     (e)  involved an electronic communication; or

                      (f)  involved trade or commerce:

                              (i)  between Australia and places outside Australia; or

                             (ii)  among the States; or

                            (iii)  within a Territory, between a State and a Territory or between 2 Territories; or

                     (g)  involved:

                              (i)  banking (other than State banking not extending beyond the limits of the State concerned); or

                             (ii)  insurance (other than State insurance not extending beyond the limits of the State concerned); or

                     (h)  relates to a matter outside Australia; or

                      (i)  relates to a matter in respect of which an international agreement to which Australia is a party imposes obligations to which effect could be given by the creation of an offence against the domestic laws of the parties to the agreement; or

                      (j)  relates to a matter that affects the relations between Australia and another country or countries or is otherwise a subject of international concern.

### Division 1—Preliminary

#### Subdivision A—Objects and simplified outline of Part

##### <a id="40RA"></a>40RA  Object of this Part

                   The object of this Part is to establish the procedures by which:

                     (a)  AFP conduct issues and AFP practices issues; and

                     (b)  other issues related to the Australian Federal Police;

may be raised and dealt with.

##### <a id="40RB"></a>40RB  Simplified outline of this Part

             (1)  This Part deals with the handling of:

                     (a)  AFP conduct issues and AFP practices issues; and

                     (b)  other issues related to the Australian Federal Police.

             (2)  These issues may be:

                     (a)  issues that are raised by information given to the Australian Federal Police (see section 40SA); or

                     (b)  issues that the Commissioner decides, on his or her own initiative, are to be dealt with under this Part (see section 40SD); or

                     (c)  issues that are referred to the Australian Federal Police by the Integrity Commissioner under the _Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006_ or by the Ombudsman under the _Ombudsman Act 1976_; or

                     (d)  issues that the Minister directs are to be inquired into under Division 4.

             (3)  How a particular AFP conduct issue is dealt with depends on the category to which the issue belongs. Sections 40RK to 40RP deal with the categorisation of AFP conduct issues.

             (4)  AFP conduct issues that belong to the 2 less serious categories (categories 1 and 2) are dealt with managerially and may be addressed by training and development action (see section 40TC) or remedial action (see section 40TD).

             (5)  AFP conduct issues that belong to the 2 more serious categories (category 3 and corruption issues) are dealt with through more formal investigations and may be addressed not only by training and development action and remedial action but also by termination action (see section 40TE) and other action. The investigation may also give rise to a prosecution for an offence.

             (6)  Division 5 confers special investigative powers on people who conduct:

                     (a)  investigations under Division 3 of category 3 conduct issues or corruption issues; or

                     (b)  inquiries under Division 4.

             (7)  The Ombudsman plays a number of roles under this Part. The Ombudsman:

                     (a)  determines, jointly with the Commissioner, the particular kinds of conduct that are to belong to the various categories of conduct (see section 40RM); and

                     (b)  is consulted by the Commissioner on the appointment of investigators under section 40TO (see subsection 40TO(6)); and

                     (c)  is entitled under section 40WA to have access to the records that are kept in relation to AFP conduct issues and AFP practices issues under that section; and

             (2)  Where a person is, because of paragraph 42C(1)(b), to be taken to have been convicted of an offence, a court must not make a superannuation order in relation to the person unless the court is also satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the person has absconded and:

                     (a)  the person has been committed for trial for the offence; or

                     (b)  the court is satisfied, having regard to all the evidence before it, that a reasonable jury, properly instructed, could lawfully find the person guilty of the offence.

             (3)  Where:

                     (a)  employer contributions or benefits made or payable by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth organisation in respect of the person under any superannuation scheme for any period of employment (not just a period during which the offence was committed) have been paid into, and are held in, a fund under the scheme; and

                     (b)  the person would, but for subsection 47(1), become entitled, subject to and in accordance with the scheme, to the benefit, or to a benefit attributable to the employer contributions, as the case may be;

the court must:

                     (c)  work out, and specify in the superannuation order, the amount that it thinks reflects the value of the sum of those contributions or benefits as at the day on which the order is made, plus the interest on those contributions or benefits accrued under the scheme before that day; and

                     (d)  include in the superannuation order an order that the amount so specified be paid to the Commonwealth or Commonwealth organisation, whichever the court considers appropriate.

             (4)  Where any benefits have been paid to the person under any superannuation scheme (whether before, on or after the commencing day) the court must:

                     (a)  specify in the superannuation order the amount worked out using the formula:

                            where:

                    <a name="ab"></a>**_AB_**_(amount of benefits)_ is the amount that the court thinks reflects the value of the sum of the benefits paid by the Commonwealth or Commonwealth organisation to the person under the scheme for any period of employment (not just a period during which the offence was committed) as at the day on which the order is made.

                    <a name="ab"></a><a name="ec"></a>**_EC_**_(employee contributions)_ is an amount that the court thinks is equal to the part of **_AB_** that is attributable to the sum of the employee contributions paid under the scheme by the person as at that day plus the interest on those contributions accrued under the scheme before that day; and

                     (b)  include in the superannuation order an order that the person pay the amount so specified to the Commonwealth or Commonwealth organisation, whichever the court considers appropriate.

          (4A)  Where the person has received an adjustment payment, the court must:

                     (a)  work out, and specify in the superannuation order, the amount that it thinks reflects the value of the amount of the payment as at the day on which the order is made; and

                     (b)  include in the superannuation order an order that the person pay the amount so specified to the Commonwealth.

             (5)  For the purposes of subsection (4), the value of an amount of employer contributions or benefits, and of accrued interest, is their value worked out having regard to any decline in the purchasing power of money between the day on which the contributions or benefits were made or paid, or the interest accrued, as the case may be, and the day as at which their value must be worked out.

          (5A)  For the purposes of subsection (4A), the value of an amount of an adjustment payment is its value worked out having regard to any decline in the purchasing power of money between the day on which the amount was paid and the day as at which its value must be worked out.

             (6)  The DPP must give written notice of a superannuation order to the person’s superannuation authority.

##### <a id="46A"></a>46A  When does a superannuation order take effect?

             (1)  A superannuation order made in relation to a person who has absconded takes effect on the day on which it is made.

             (2)  A superannuation order made in relation to a person, other than a person who has absconded, does not take effect until:

                     (a)  the end of the period (if any) allowed for appealing against the conviction or sentence under the relevant Commonwealth, State or Territory law; or

                     (b)  if the person appeals against his or her conviction or sentence, or both—the appeal, and any proceedings resulting from it, are finally determined, withdrawn or otherwise disposed of.

##### <a id="47"></a>47  Effect of superannuation order

             (1)  Where a court makes a superannuation order in respect of a person:

                     (a)  all rights of, and benefits payable to or in respect of, the person or a dependant of the person (being rights or benefits arising out of the person’s membership of any superannuation scheme) cease, or cease to be payable, on the day on which the order takes effect and the person ceases to be a member of the scheme on that day; and

                    (aa)  any entitlement of the person to an adjustment payment ceases on that day and an adjustment payment is not payable to the person on or after that day; and

                     (b)  any amount of the kind mentioned in subsection 46(3) that is vested in the person ceases to be so vested on that day; and

                     (c)  the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth organisation is not liable to pay any employer contribution or benefit under the scheme in respect of the person on or after that day.

          (1A)  An amount payable by a person to the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth organisation under a superannuation order is a debt due by the person to the Commonwealth or the Commonwealth organisation, as the case may be.

          (1B)  An order under subsection 46(3), (4) or (4A) against a person may be enforced as if it were an order made in civil proceedings instituted by the Commonwealth or the relevant Commonwealth organisation against the person to recover a debt due by the person to the Commonwealth or the Commonwealth organisation, and the debt arising from the order is to be taken to be a judgment debt.

             (2)  Despite the Superannuation Act, or any other Act or any agreement, where subsection (1) applies to a person who is an AFP employee, the person is entitled, on the day on which he or she ceases to be a member of the relevant superannuation scheme, to payment of an amount equal to the sum of the employee contributions paid under the scheme by the person (being contributions that are held in a fund under the scheme) plus the amount of interest on those contributions accrued under the scheme.

             (3)  Despite the Superannuation Act, or any other Act or any agreement, where subsection (1) applies to a person:

                     (a)  who:

                              (i)  was an AFP employee at the time the relevant corruption offence was committed but was not such an employee when charged with that offence; or

                             (ii)  was an old law member or staff member at the time the relevant corruption offence was committed but was not such a member or an AFP employee when charged with that offence; and

                     (b)  who would, but for that subsection, have been entitled to payment of benefits under the relevant superannuation scheme on or after the day on which the superannuation order takes effect;

the person is entitled, on the day on which he or she ceases to be a member of the scheme, to payment of an amount worked out using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00885/Html/24915665-c6bb-4971-b344-d3d35e092688_files/image004.gif)

where:

                    <a name="ac"></a>**_AC_** is an amount equal to the sum of the employee contributions paid under the scheme by the person plus the amount of interest on those contributions accrued under the scheme; and

                    <a name="ac"></a><a name="ar"></a>**_AR_** is an amount equal to that part of the sum of all amounts paid to the person by way of benefit before the day on which the superannuation order takes effect that is attributable to **_AC_**.

##### <a id="47A"></a>47A  Superannuation orders: variation

             (1)  If a superannuation order made in respect of a person:

                     (a)  specifies an amount under subsection 46(3) or (4); and

                     (b)  takes effect on a day that is later than the day on which the order is made;

the DPP may, as soon as practicable after the order takes effect, apply to the court that made the order to vary the order by substituting for the specified amount an increased amount, having regard to any amount of employer contributions or benefits paid by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth organisation in respect of the person during the prescribed period.

             (2)  Where an application is made, the court must vary the superannuation order accordingly and, for the purposes of working out the increased amount to be specified in the superannuation order, as varied, subsections 46(3), (4) and (5) apply as if references in subsections 46(3) and (4) to the day on which the order is made were references to the day on which the variation is made.

             (3)  In this section:

                    <a name="prescrib-period"></a>**_prescribed period_** means the period starting on the day on which the superannuation order is made and ending on the day on which the variation is made.

##### <a id="47B"></a>47B  Superannuation orders: revocation

             (1)  A superannuation order made in relation to a person is to be taken to have been revoked if:

                     (a)  the person’s conviction is quashed; or

                     (b)  the person’s sentence is so reduced or otherwise changed that it would no longer support the making of an application for a superannuation order under subsection 45(1A); or

                     (c)  where the person is taken to be convicted because of paragraph 42C(1)(b)—the person is brought before a court in respect of the offence concerned and, having been convicted of that offence, does not receive a sentence that would support the making of an application for a superannuation order under subsection 45(1A).

             (2)  Where a superannuation order is taken to have been revoked, the DPP must give written notice of the fact to:

                     (a)  the person in respect of whom the order was made; and

                     (b)  the person’s superannuation authority.

             (3)  Where:

                     (a)  a superannuation order is made in relation to a person who is taken to be convicted because of paragraph 42C(1)(b); and

                     (b)  the superannuation order is to be taken to have been revoked;

there is payable to the person an amount determined by the Finance Minister, being an amount that the Minister considers to be a fair recompense to the person, having regard to:

                     (c)  any amount paid to the person under subsection 47(2) or (3); and

                     (d)  any amount recovered from the person under a recovery order against the person; and

                     (e)  any other financial loss sustained by the person as a result of the superannuation order; and

                      (f)  any other matters that the Minister thinks are relevant in the circumstances of the case.

### Division 3A—Restraining orders

##### <a id="49A"></a>49A  Application for restraining order

             (1)  Where a person (in this Division called **_the defendant_**):

                     (a)  has been convicted of an offence; or

                     (b)  has been, or is about to be, charged with an offence;

the DPP may apply to the appropriate court for a restraining order against specified property of the defendant or of another person, or both.

             (2)  For the purposes of an application, the DPP may, on behalf of the Commonwealth, give the court such undertakings with respect to the payment of damages or costs, or both, as the court requires.

##### <a id="49B"></a>49B  Making of restraining orders

             (1)  Subject to this Division, where an application is made for a restraining order against property and the appropriate court is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the offence concerned is, or may be, a corruption offence; and

                     (b)  if the defendant has been sentenced in respect of the offence—the sentence would support the making of an application for a superannuation order under subsection 45(1A); and

                     (c)  the defendant is, or has been, a member of a superannuation scheme;

the court may, by order, direct that the property, or such part of the property as is specified in the order, is not to be disposed of, or otherwise dealt with, by any person except in the manner and circumstances (if any) specified in the order.

             (2)  A restraining order must not be made against a person’s property to any extent greater than is necessary to ensure the recovery of any amount payable, or reasonably likely to be payable, by the defendant under a recovery order.

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not prevent the court from making a restraining order against a person’s property, being property whose value is more than the amount payable, or reasonably likely to be payable, by the defendant under a recovery order if there is no other property of sufficient value in respect of which the court can make a restraining order.

             (4)  A court may make a restraining order against property whether or not there is any risk of the property being disposed of, or otherwise dealt with, in a manner that would defeat the operation of this Part.

             (5)  Where the application is made in reliance on the proposed charging of the defendant with the offence concerned, the court must not make a restraining order unless satisfied that the defendant will be charged with the offence, or with a related corruption offence, within 48 hours.

             (6)  A court may refuse to make a restraining order if the Commonwealth refuses or fails to give the court such undertakings as the court considers appropriate with respect to the payment of damages or costs, or both, in relation to the making and operation of the order.

##### <a id="49C"></a>49C  Restraining order may be subject to conditions

             (1)  A restraining order against a person’s property may be made subject to such conditions as the court thinks fit, for example, conditions providing for meeting, out of the property or a specified part of the property, all or any of the following:

                     (a)  the person’s reasonable living expenses (including the reasonable living expenses of any dependants of the person) and reasonable business expenses;

                     (b)  the person’s taxed legal expenses in defending a criminal charge;

                     (c)  a specified debt incurred by the person in good faith (being a debt to which neither paragraph (a) or (b) applies).

             (2)  The court must not make provision of a kind mentioned in subsection (1) unless satisfied that the person cannot meet the expense or debt concerned out of property that is not subject to a restraining order.

##### <a id="49D"></a>49D  Affidavit of police officer needed in certain cases

             (1)  Where an application is made for a restraining order and the defendant has not been convicted of the offence concerned, the court must not make a restraining order unless:

                     (a)  the application for the order is supported by an affidavit of a police officer stating that the officer believes the defendant committed the offence; and

                     (b)  the court is satisfied, having regard to the matters contained in the affidavit, that there are reasonable grounds for so believing.

             (2)  Where an application for a restraining order is made against specified property of a person other than the defendant, the court must not make a restraining order against the property unless:

                     (a)  the application is supported by an affidavit of a police officer stating that the officer believes that the property is subject to the effective control of the defendant; and

                     (b)  the court is satisfied, having regard to the matters contained in the affidavit, that there are reasonable grounds for so believing.

             (3)  An affidavit made by a police officer for the purpose of this section stating that the officer believes a particular matter must set out the grounds on which the officer holds that belief.

             (4)  The court may, at any time before the final determination of an application for:

                     (a)  a restraining order; or

                     (b)  an extension of the period of effect of a restraining order;

direct the DPP to give or publish notice of the application to a specified person or class of persons in the manner and within the time the court thinks appropriate.

             (5)  In this section:

                    <a name="polic-offic"></a>**_police officer_** means a member of the Australian Federal Police or of the police force of a State or Territory.

                     (a)  the owner of the property; and

                     (b)  any other person the DPP has reason to believe may have an interest in the property.

             (2)  Where notice of an application has not been given, the court must consider the application if the DPP asks it to do so but, subject to section 49EA, a restraining order made by virtue of this subsection ceases to have effect at the end of the period (not exceeding 14 days) specified by the court in the restraining order.

##### <a id="49EA"></a>49EA  Extension of certain restraining orders

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), the court may, on application made by the DPP before the end of the period mentioned in subsection 49E(2), extend the period of operation of a restraining order made in reliance on that subsection.

             (2)  Subsections 49D(1), (2), (3) and (5) apply, with the necessary changes made, to the extension of the period of operation of a restraining order made in reliance on subsection 49E(2) in the same way as they apply to the making of a restraining order.

             (3)  The DPP must give written notice of an application under subsection (1) for the extension of a restraining order to:

                     (a)  the owner of the property against which the restraining order was made; and

                     (b)  any other person who the DPP has reason to believe may have an interest in the property.

             (2)  Where the DPP applies for the extension of the period of effect of a restraining order made in respect of property, any person who claims an interest in the property may appear and adduce evidence at the hearing of the application.

##### <a id="49G"></a>49G  Witnesses not required to answer questions etc. in certain cases

                   On the hearing of an application for a restraining order, a witness is not required to answer a question or to produce a document if the court is satisfied that the answering of the question or the production of the document may prejudice the investigation of, or the prosecution of a person for, an offence.

##### <a id="49H"></a>49H  Notice of restraining orders

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), where a restraining order is made against a person’s property, the DPP must give the person written notice of the order.

             (2)  Where:

                     (a)  a court makes a restraining order; and

                     (b)  the court is satisfied that it would be in the public interest to delay giving notice of the order to a person;

the court may include in the restraining order an order that giving the person notice of the restraining order be delayed for the specified period and the DPP must give the person notice of the restraining order as soon as practicable after the end of the specified period.

##### <a id="49J"></a>49J  Ancillary orders

             (1)  Where an appropriate court makes a restraining order, it may, at the same time or at any later time, make any ancillary orders that it thinks appropriate, for example:

                     (a)  an order varying the property to which the restraining order relates;

                     (b)  an order varying any condition to which the restraining order is subject; and

                     (c)  an order for the examination on oath before the court or the Registrar of the court of any person, including:

                              (i)  the owner of property subject to the restraining order (in this paragraph called the **_owner_**); or

                             (ii)  the defendant;

                            about the affairs (including the nature and location of any property) of:

                            (iii)  anyone else who is either the owner or the defendant, or both; and

                            (iv)  if the person to be examined is either the owner or the defendant, or both—that person; and

                     (d)  an order about carrying out any undertaking with respect to the payment of damages or costs given by the Commonwealth in connection with the making of the restraining order.

                     (c)  a person, other than the defendant, who has an interest in the property applies to the court for a variation of the order to exclude the person’s interest from the order;

the court must grant the application if satisfied that the applicant’s interest in the property is not subject to the effective control of the defendant.

             (4)  Where a person is examined before a court or a registrar under an order under subsection (1), the person is not excused from answering a question when required to do so by the court or registrar, as the case may be, on the ground that the answer to the question might tend to incriminate the person or make the person liable to forfeiture or a penalty.

             (5)  Where a person is examined before a court or registrar under an order under subsection (1), the statement or disclosure made by the person in answer to a question put in the course of the examination, and any information, document or thing obtained as a direct or indirect result of the statement or disclosure, is not admissible against the person in any criminal proceedings except a proceeding for giving false testimony in the course of the examination.

             (6)  For the purposes of subsection (5), proceedings on an application for a superannuation order or a restraining order are not criminal proceedings.

             (7)  On the hearing of an application for an order under subsection (1), a witness is not required to answer a question or to produce a document if the court is satisfied that the answering of the question or the production of the document may prejudice the investigation of, or the prosecution of the person for, an offence.

##### <a id="49K"></a>49K  Charge on property subject to restraining order

             (1)  Where:

                     (a)  a recovery order is made against a defendant; and

                     (b)  a restraining order is, or has been, made against:

                              (i)  property of the defendant; or

                             (ii)  property of another person in relation to which an order is, or has been, made under subsection 53A(1);

                            in reliance on the defendant’s conviction of a particular offence or a related corruption offence or on the charging, or proposed charging, of the defendant with a particular offence or a related corruption offence;

then, upon the making of the later of the orders, there is created, by force of this section, a charge on the property to secure the payment of the amount specified in the recovery order to the Commonwealth or the relevant Commonwealth organisation, as the case requires.

             (2)  A charge on property of a person ceases to have effect:

                     (a)  if the relevant recovery order ceases to have effect; or

                     (b)  upon payment to the Commonwealth, or the relevant Commonwealth organisation, of the amount specified in the order; or

                     (c)  upon the person becoming a bankrupt; or

whichever first occurs.

             (3)  A charge on property:

                     (a)  is subject to every encumbrance on the property that came into existence before the charge and that would, but for this subsection, have priority over the charge; and

                     (b)  has priority over all other encumbrances; and

                     (c)  subject to subsection (2), is not affected by any change of ownership of the property.

             (4)  Where:

                     (a)  a charge is created on property of a particular kind; and

                     (b)  the provisions of any law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory provide for the registration of title to, or charges over, property of that kind;

the DPP may cause the charge to be registered under the provisions of that law and, if the charge is so registered, a person who purchases, or otherwise acquires an interest in, the property after the registration is to be taken, for the purposes of paragraph (2)(e), to have notice of the charge at the time of the purchase or acquisition.

##### <a id="49L"></a>49L  Registration of restraining orders

             (1)  Where:

                     (a)  a restraining order applies to property of a particular kind; and

                     (b)  the provisions of any law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory provide for the registration of title to, or charges over, property of that kind;

the authority responsible for administering those provisions may, on application by the DPP, record on the register kept under those provisions particulars of the restraining order.

             (2)  Where particulars of a restraining order are recorded under subsection (1), a person who later deals with the property is to be taken, for the purposes of section 49M, to have notice of the restraining order at the time of the dealing.

##### <a id="49M"></a>49M  Contravention of restraining orders

             (1)  A person who intentionally contravenes a restraining order by disposing of, or otherwise dealing with, property that is subject to the restraining order is guilty of an offence punishable, upon conviction, by imprisonment for a period not exceeding 5 years.

             (2)  Where:

                     (a)  a restraining order is made against property; and

                     (b)  the property is disposed of, or otherwise dealt with, in contravention of the restraining order; and

                     (c)  the disposition or dealing was either not for sufficient consideration or not in favour of a person who acted in good faith;

the DPP may apply to the court that made the restraining order for an order that the disposition or dealing be set aside.

             (3)  Where the DPP makes an application under subsection (2) in relation to a disposition or dealing, the court may make an order:

                     (a)  setting the disposition or dealing aside as from the day on which it took place; or

Note:          At and after the commencing time, any reference to a staff member of the Australian Federal Police in such an award or a certified agreement will be taken to be a reference to an AFP employee who is not a member: see item 18 of this Schedule.

(2)       If, immediately before the commencing time, a provision of such an award or a certified agreement applied to a member of the Australian Federal Police at a particular rank, or to a staff member of the Australian Federal Police at a particular level, the provision continues to apply to the person at and after the commencing time until the earlier of the following days:

                     (a)  the day the person ceases to be an AFP employee;

                     (b)  any employment as an AFP employee that took place after the commencing time and before the alteration takes affect.

The amendment of section 52 of the _Australian Federal Police Act 1979_ made by Schedule 1 to this Act applies to proceedings started against a person whether before or after the commencing time, but does not apply where persons’ resignations or retirements from the Australian Federal Police would, but for subsection (1) of that section as in force immediately before the commencing time, have taken effect before the commencing time.

## 16  Continuation of secrecy obligations

Section 60A of the former Act continues to apply at and after the commencing time to a person who, immediately before the commencing time, was a person to whom that section applied as if the amendment to that section made by Schedule 1 to this Act had not been made.

## 17  Certificates under section 68 of the _Australian Federal Police Act 1979_

If a statutory instrument was in force immediately before the commencing time, for the purpose of applying the instrument to any thing done or any circumstance existing after the commencing time, references in the instrument to a staff member of the Australian Federal Police are, unless the contrary intention appears, taken to be references to an AFP employee who is not a member.
