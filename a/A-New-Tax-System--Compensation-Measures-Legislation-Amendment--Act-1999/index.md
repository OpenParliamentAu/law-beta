##### <a id="1206GB"></a>1206GB  Adjustment of amounts following 1 July 2000 increase

             (1)  If an amount (the **_affected amount_**) is:

                     (a)  an amount described in the table in section 1206GA or in the table in section 1206GAA that is indexed under Division 2 of this Part; or

                     (b)  a maximum basic rate provided for in point 1064-B1, 1065-B1, 1066-B1 or 1068A-B1; or

                     (c)  a pension supplement provided for in point 1064-BA2, 1065-BA2, 1066-BA2 or 1068A-BA2;

this section applies to modify the way the amount is indexed under Division 2 of this Part for a limited period after 19 March 2001.

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.    Work out the current figure for the affected amount on 19 March 2001.

Step 2.    Multiply the current figure by 0.02\. The result is the **_provisional overall adjustment amount_**.

Step 3 _._    Round off the provisional overall adjustment amount in accordance with subsections (3) to (5), using:

               (a)     for an affected amount described in the table in section 1206GA or in the table in section 1206GAA—the rounding base set out in that table for that amount; and

               (b)     for a maximum basic rate provided for in point 1064-B1, 1065-B1, 1066-B1 or 1068A-B1—the rounding base of $2.60; and

               (c)     for a pension supplement provided for in point 1064-BA2, 1065-BA2, 1066-BA2 or 1068A-BA2—the rounding base of $0.10.

              The result is the **_overall adjustment amount_**.

Step 4.    For the first indexation day for an affected amount that occurs after 19 March  2001, subtract the current figure from the indexed amount (arrived at using the method statement in subsection 1192(2)). The result (which could be zero) is the **_first indexation increase amount_**.

Step 5.    Compare the overall adjustment amount with the first indexation increase amount. If the overall adjustment amount is equal to or less than the first indexation increase amount, go to step 6\. If the overall adjustment amount is greater than the first indexation increase amount, go to step 9.

Step 6.    Subtract the overall adjustment amount from the indexed amount referred to in step 4.

Step 7 _._ If the indexed amount is a pension supplement, round off the result in accordance with subsections (3) to (5) (as if the amount were a provisional overall adjustment amount), using the rounding base of $2.60.

Step 8 _._ The result obtained under step 6 or step 7 (as the case requires) is taken to be the indexed amount for the purposes of step 4 of the method statement in subsection 1192(2) and this section has no further application in relation to the affected amount.

                   Note:             The indexed amount for the purposes of step 4 of the method statement in subsection 1192(2) may be increased under section 1195 in certain cases.

Step 9 _._    The indexed amount for the purposes of step 4 of the method statement in subsection 1192(2) is taken to be equal to the current figure worked out under step 2 of the method statement in subsection 1192(2). Go to step 10.

                   Note:             The indexed amount for the purposes of step 4 of the method statement in subsection 1192(2) may be increased under section 1195 in certain cases.

Step 10.  For the second indexation day for the affected amount that occurs after 19 March 2001, subtract the first indexation increase amount from the overall adjustment amount. The result is the **_remaining adjustment amount_**. 

Step 11.  Subtract the current figure from the indexed amount (arrived at using the method statement in subsection 1192(2)). The result (which could be zero) is the **_second indexation increase amount_**.

Step 12 _._  Compare the remaining adjustment amount with the second indexation increase amount. If the remaining adjustment amount is equal to or less than the second indexation increase amount, go to step 13\. If the remaining adjustment amount is greater than the second indexation increase amount, go to step 16.

Step 13.  Subtract the remaining adjustment amount from the indexed amount.

Step 14 _._ If the indexed amount is a pension supplement, round off the result in accordance with subsections (3) to (5) (as if the amount were a provisional overall adjustment amount), using the rounding base of $2.60.

Step 15 _._ The result obtained under step 13 or step 14 (as the case requires) is taken to be the indexed amount for the purposes of step 4 of the method statement in subsection 1192(2) and this section has no further application in relation to the affected amount.

                   Note:             The indexed amount for the purposes of step 4 of the method statement in subsection 1192(2) may be increased under section 1195 in certain cases.

Step 16 _._  The indexed amount for the purposes of step 4 of the method statement in subsection 1192(2) is taken to be equal to the current figure worked out under step 2 of the method statement in subsection 1192(2). Go to step 17.

                   Note:             The indexed amount for the purposes of step 4 of the method statement in subsection 1192(2) may be increased under section 1195 in certain cases.

Step 17 _._  Repeat the method set out in steps 10 to 16 in relation to the third indexation day and to subsequent indexation days until the remaining adjustment amount is zero.

* * *

Application of section 1195 to affected amounts

             (2)  Section 1195 does not apply at Step 4 or Step 11 of the Method statement in this section.

#### Module BA—Pension supplement

Pension supplement

 SCH6-BA1  The amount of a person’s pension supplement depends on the person’s maximum basic rate. There is a pension supplement amount for each maximum basic rate listed in the table in point SCH6-B1.

Amount of pension supplement

 SCH6-BA2  The amount of a person’s pension supplement is worked out by:

                     (a)  calculating the amount (the **_provisional supplement amount_**) that is 4% of the person’s 1 July 2000 maximum basic rate; and

                     (b)  rounding off the provisional supplement amount in accordance with points SCH6-BA4 to SCH6-BA6.

Note:          The pension supplement amounts are indexed 6 monthly in line with CPI increases (see sections 59B to 59E).

 SCH6-BA3  A person’s **_1 July 2000 maximum basic rate_** is the maximum basic rate that would have been the person’s maximum basic rate if the rate had not changed since 1 July 2000.

Rounding off of provisional supplement amount

 SCH6-BA4  If a provisional supplement amount is a multiple of $2.60, the amount of the pension supplement is the provisional supplement amount.

 SCH6-BA5  If a provisional supplement amount is not a multiple of $2.60, the amount of the pension supplement is the provisional supplement amount rounded up or down to the nearest multiple of $2.60.

 SCH6-BA6  If a provisional supplement amount is not a multiple of $2.60, but is a multiple of $1.30, the amount of the pension supplement is the provisional supplement amount rounded up to the nearest multiple of $2.60.

##### <a id="198GA"></a>198GA  1 July 2000 increase in rent assistance amounts

             (1)  This section applies to an amount (the **_base amount_**) of rent assistance that is provided for in column 4 of the table in subpoint SCH6-C8(1).

Note:          Amounts provided for in column 4 of the table in subpoint SCH6-C8 are amounts as altered from time to time under Division 18 of Part IIIB (CPI indexation).

             (2)  This Act has effect as if, on 1 July 2000, the base amount were replaced by an amount (the **_replacement amount_**) worked out by:

                     (a)  calculating the amount (the **_provisional replacement amount_**) that is 10% greater than the base amount; and

                     (b)  rounding off the provisional replacement amount in accordance with section 198M, using the rounding base of $5.20.

##### <a id="198H"></a>198H  Adjustment of amounts following 1 July 2000 increase

             (1)  If an amount (the **_affected amount_**) is:

                     (a)  an amount described in the table in section 198G that is indexed under Division 18 of Part IIIB or under section 198, 198A, 198D or 198F; or

                     (b)  the amount described in section 198GA; or

                     (c)  a maximum basic rate provided for in point SCH6-B1; or

                     (d)  a pension supplement provided for in point SCH6-BA2; or

                     (e)  an amount provided for in paragraph 30(1)(a); or

                      (f)  a pension supplement provided for in subsection 30(1A);

this section applies to modify the way the amount is indexed under that Division or section (as the case may be) for a limited period after 19 March 2001.

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.    Work out the current figure for the affected amount on 19 March 2001.

Step 2.    Multiply the current figure by 0.02\. The result is the **_provisional overall adjustment amount_**.

Step 3.    Round off the provisional overall adjustment amount in accordance with subsections (6) to (8), using:

               (a)     for an affected amount described in the table in section 198G—the rounding base set out in that table for that amount; and

               (b)     for the amount described in section 198GA—the rounding base of $5.20; and

               (c)     for a maximum basic rate provided for in point SCH6-B1—the rounding base of $2.60; and

               (d)     for a pension supplement provided for in point SCH6-BA2—the rounding base of $0.10; and

               (e)     for an amount provided for in paragraph 30(1)(a)—the rounding base of $0.10; and

               (f)     for a pension supplement provided for in subsection 30(1A)—the rounding base of $0.10.

              The result is the **_overall adjustment amount_**.

Step 4.    For the first indexation day for an affected amount that occurs after 19 March  2001, subtract the current figure from the indexed amount (arrived at using the method statement in subsection 59C(2)). The result (which could be zero) is the **_first indexation increase amount_**.

Step 5.    Compare the overall adjustment amount with the first indexation increase amount. If the overall adjustment amount is equal to or less than the first indexation increase amount, go to step 6\. If the overall adjustment amount is greater than the first indexation increase amount, go to step 9.

Step 6.    Subtract the overall adjustment amount from the indexed amount referred to in step 4.

Step 7\. If the indexed amount is a pension supplement, round off the result in accordance with subsections (6) to (8) (as if the amount were a provisional overall adjustment amount), using the rounding base of $2.60.

Step 8\. The result obtained under step 6 or step 7 (as the case requires) is taken to be the indexed amount for the purposes of step 5 of the method statement in subsection 59C(2) and this section has no further application in relation to the affected amount.

                   Note:             The indexed amount for the purposes of step 5 of the method statement in subsection 59C(2) may be increased under section 59EA in certain cases. Similarly, if the indexed amount is a rate worked out under section 198, that amount may be increased under subsection 198(6) or (7) in certain cases.

Step 9.    The indexed amount for the purposes of step 5 of the method statement in subsection 59C(2) is taken to be equal to the current figure worked out under step 2 of the method statement in subsection 59C(2). Go to step 10.

                   Note:             The indexed amount for the purposes of step 5 of the method statement in subsection 59C(2) may be increased under section 59EA in certain cases. Similarly, if the indexed amount is a rate worked out under section 198, that amount may be increased under subsection 198(6) or (7) in certain cases.

Step 10.  For the second indexation day for the affected amount that occurs after 19 March 2001, subtract the first indexation increase amount from the overall adjustment amount. The result is the **_remaining adjustment amount_**. 

Step 11.  Subtract the current figure from the indexed amount (arrived at using the method statement in subsection 59C(2)). The result (which could be zero) is the **_second indexation increase amount_**.

Step 12.  Compare the remaining adjustment amount with the second indexation increase amount. If the remaining adjustment amount is equal to or less than the second indexation increase amount, go to step 13\. If the remaining adjustment amount is greater than the second indexation increase amount, go to step 16.

Step 13.  Subtract the remaining adjustment amount from the indexed amount.

Step 14\. If the indexed amount is a pension supplement, round off the result in accordance with subsections (6) to (8) (as if the amount were a provisional overall adjustment amount), using the rounding base of $2.60.

Step 15\. The result obtained under step 13 or step 14 (as the case requires) is taken to be the indexed amount for the purposes of step 5 of the method statement in subsection 59C(2) and this section has no further application in relation to the affected amount.

                   Note:             The indexed amount for the purposes of step 5 of the method statement in subsection 59C(2) may be increased under section 59EA in certain cases. Similarly, if the indexed amount is a rate worked out under section 198, that amount may be increased under subsection 198(6) or (7) in certain cases.

Step 16 _._  The indexed amount for the purposes of step 5 of the method statement in subsection 59C(2) is taken to be equal to the current figure worked out under step 2 of the method statement in subsection 59C(2). Go to step 17.

                   Note:             The indexed amount for the purposes of step 5 of the method statement in subsection 59C(2) may be increased under section 59EA in certain cases. Similarly, if the indexed amount is a rate worked out under section 198, that amount may be increased under subsection 198(6) or (7) in certain cases.

Step 17.  Repeat the method set out in steps 10 to 16 in relation to the third indexation day and to subsequent indexation days until the remaining adjustment amount is zero.

Step 4.    For the first indexation day for the maximum rent assistance amount that occurs after 19 March 2001, subtract the current figure for the amount from the indexed amount (arrived at using the method statement in subclause 4(2)). The result (which could be zero) is the **_first indexation increase amount_**.

Step 5.    Compare the overall adjustment amount with the first indexation increase amount. If the overall adjustment amount is equal to or less than the first indexation increase amount, go to step 6\. If the overall adjustment amount is greater than the first indexation increase amount, go to step 7.

Step 6.    Subtract the overall adjustment amount from the indexed amount referred to in step 4\. The result is taken to be the indexed amount for the purposes of step 4 of the method statement in subclause 4(2) and this clause has no further application in relation to the maximum rent assistance amount.

Step 7 _._    The indexed amount for the purposes of step 4 of the method statement in subclause 4(2) is taken to be equal to the current figure worked out under step 2 of that method statement. Go to step 8.

Step 8 _._    For the second indexation day for the maximum rent assistance amount that occurs after 19 March 2001, subtract the first indexation increase amount from the overall adjustment amount. The result is the **_remaining adjustment amount_**.

Step 9.    Subtract the current figure for the maximum rent assistance amount from the indexed amount (arrived at using the method statement in subclause 4(2)). The result (which could be zero) is the **_second indexation increase amount_**.

Step 10 _._  Compare the remaining adjustment amount with the second indexation increase amount. If the remaining adjustment amount is equal to or less than the second indexation increase amount, go to step 11\. If the remaining adjustment amount is greater than the second indexation increase amount, go to step 12.

Step 11 _._  Subtract the remaining adjustment amount from the indexed amount. The result is taken to be the indexed amount for the purposes of step 4 of the method statement in subclause 4(2) and this clause has no further application in relation to the maximum rent assistance amount.

Step 12 _._  The indexed amount for the purposes of step 4 of the method statement in subclause 4(2) is taken to be equal to the current figure worked out under step 2 of that method statement. Go to step 13.

Step 13 _._  Repeat the method set out in steps 8 to 12 in relation to the third indexation day and to subsequent indexation days until the remaining adjustment amount is zero.

Rounding of provisional overall adjustment amounts

             (2)  If a provisional overall adjustment amount is a multiple of the rounding base for the maximum rent assistance amount (see column 5 of item 4 of the CPI Indexation Table in subclause 3(1)), the provisional overall adjustment amount is the overall adjustment amount.

             (3)  If a provisional overall adjustment amount is not a multiple of the rounding base, the overall adjustment amount is the provisional overall adjustment amount rounded up or down to the nearest multiple of the rounding base.

             (4)  If a provisional overall adjustment amount is not a multiple of the rounding base, but is a multiple of half the rounding base, the overall adjustment amount is the provisional overall adjustment amount rounded up to the nearest multiple of the rounding base.
