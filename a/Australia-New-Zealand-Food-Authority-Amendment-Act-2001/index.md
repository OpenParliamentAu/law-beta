*	The Authority may develop or vary a standard:

	(a)	in response to an _application_ that has been accepted by the Authority after an _initial_ _assessment_; or
 	(b)	by preparing a _proposal_ on its own initiative.

*	After conducting a _draft assessment_ of the application or proposal, the Authority must:

	(a)	prepare a draft; or
 	(b)	reject the application or abandon the proposal.

*	If the Authority prepares a draft, the Authority must conduct a _final assessment_ in relation to the draft, and then:

	(a)	approve the draft and notify the Council; or
 	(b)	reject the draft.

*	If a draft is notified to the Council, the Council may request the Authority to _review_ the draft.

*	If the Council does not request a review, the draft comes into effect in accordance with a _Gazette_ notice.

*	If a review is conducted and the Council still has concerns about the draft, the Council may request a _second review_.

*	If the Council does not request a second review, the draft comes into effect in accordance with a _Gazette_ notice.

*	If a second review is conducted and the Council still has concerns about the draft, the Council may _amend or reject_ the draft.

*	If the Council does not amend or reject the draft, the draft comes into effect in accordance with a _Gazette_ notice.

*	If the Council amends the draft, the amended draft comes into effect in accordance with a _Gazette_ notice.

*	Special rules apply to urgent applications and urgent proposals.
