             (2)  In this section (other than subsection (1)):

                     (a)  **_fee reduction claimant_** does not include an individual if the care the individual is eligible for is provided by an approved occasional care service; and

24 hour care certified by a service—if claimant is an individual

             (3)  Subject to subsection (5), a 24 hour care limit applies in the week to a fee reduction claimant who is an individual if the approved child care service providing care to the child certifies that the child needs, or needed, 24 hour care in the week for one or more 24 hour care periods specified in the certificate, because neither the claimant, nor the claimant’s partner (if any), is able to care for the child during those periods for the reason that:

                     (a)  both the claimant and the claimant’s partner (if any) have work related commitments during those periods; or

                     (b)  the service certifies that the child needs, or needed, 24 hour care in the week for one or more 24 hour care periods specified in the certificate, because neither the individual, nor the individual’s partner (if any), is able to care for the child during those periods for the reason that:

                              (i)  both the individual and that individual’s partner (if any) have work related commitments during those periods; or

                             (ii)  exceptional circumstances exist during those periods.

Limitation on service giving certificates under subsection (3) or (4)

             (5)  An approved child care service may only give a certificate under subsection (3) or (4) if the number of 24 hour care periods specified in the certificate in relation to a child, together with the number of 24 hour care periods specified in each other certificate (if any) given by the service, or any other approved child care service, in relation to the child and the same financial year, does not in total exceed 14.

24 hour care decided by the Secretary

             (6)  Subject to subsection (7), a 24 hour care limit applies in the week to a fee reduction claimant if:

                     (a)  the approved child care service providing care to the child has given a certificate under subsection (3) or (4) such that the total of the 24 hour care periods specified in that certificate and other certificates (if any) given by the service, or any other approved child care service, in respect of the child in the same financial year equals 14; and

                     (b)  the Secretary considers that, at some time after those 14 24 hour care periods, the child needs or needed 24 hour care for one or more specified 24 hour care periods in the week because:

                              (i)  in the case where the claimant is an individual—neither the claimant nor the claimant’s partner (if any); or

                             (ii)  in the case where the claimant is the approved child care service providing care to the child—neither the individual in whose care the child last was before the first session of care in the week nor the individual’s partner (if any);

                            is able to care for the child during those periods; and

                     (c)  the Secretary considers that the reason for that inability is:

                              (i)  because both the individual and the individual’s partner (if any) have work related commitments during those periods; or

                             (ii)  because exceptional circumstances exist during those periods.

Limitation on Secretary’s decision making under subsection (5)

                              (i)  in the case where the claimant is an individual—neither the claimant nor the claimant’s partner (if any); or

                             (ii)  in the case where the claimant is the approved child care service providing care to the child—neither the individual in whose care the child last was before the first session of care in the week nor the individual’s partner (if any);

                            is able to care for the child during those periods; and

                     (d)  the Secretary considers that the reason for that inability is:

                              (i)  because both the individual and the individual’s partner (if any) have work related commitments during those periods; or

                             (ii)  because exceptional circumstances exist during those periods.

                     (a)  if paragraph (b) or (c) does not apply (no child at risk or individual in hardship)—worked out using Schedule 2; or

                     (b)  if the service gave a certificate under subsection 76(1) in respect of the session while the individual was conditionally eligible—specified by the service in the certificate in respect of fee reductions; or

             (1)  If an approved child care service is eligible under section 47 for child care benefit by fee reduction for a session of care provided by the service to a child at risk, the service’s rate of child care benefit for the session is the hourly rate specified by the service in a certificate given under subsection 76(2), or determined by the Secretary under subsection 81(4), as the case may be.

             (2)  The rate is taken into account in setting the amount of the service’s entitlement to be paid child care benefit by fee reduction under section 54B of the Family Assistance Administration Act.

             (3)  Section 71 imposes a limit on the amount of child care benefit that may be paid for sessions of care provided to the child in a week.

##### <a id="48"></a>48  Overview of process if individual is conditionally eligible for child care benefit by fee reductions

             (2)  The amount by which the fees are reduced is referable to the amount of child care benefit that would be paid in respect of the sessions if entitlement to an amount of child care benefit was determined under section 51B on the day the fees are reduced. The amount of fee reduction is calculated by the service using the provisions of the Family Assistance Act.

             (3)  The fees are reduced in anticipation of a determination of entitlement to be paid child care benefit by fee reduction being made under section 51B in respect of the individual, the child, the sessions and the income year.

             (4)  When the determination of entitlement is made, if the amount of the entitlement is greater than the amount of the fee reductions already received by the individual in respect of the sessions in the income year, the amount of the entitlement consists of the amount of the difference together with the amount of fee reductions received by the individual.

             (5)  When the determination of entitlement is made, if the amount of the entitlement is less than the amount of the fee reductions already received by the individual in respect of the sessions in the income year, the amount of the entitlement is the amount of the fee reductions less the amount of the difference.

             (6)  To reimburse the service the amount of the fee reductions made for care provided by the service to the child, the service receives an advance (see Division 2 of Part 8A).

the claim is to be determined under the social security law as in force before 1 July 2000, as if:

                     (d)  the social security law as so in force had continued in force; and

                     (e)  the claim related only to the period preceding 1 July 2000.

(2)        If:

                     (a)  before 1 July 2000, a person lodged a claim for family benefit by way of family allowance or family tax payment in anticipation of becoming qualified for that benefit; and

                     (b)  the claim was not determined by that date; and

                     (c)  the person does not become qualified for the relevant family benefit before 1 July 2000;

                     (c)  the person was, at the time of the claim, or becomes, before 1 July 2000, qualified for family benefit of that kind;

                     (d)  the claim is to be determined under the social security law as in force before 1 July 2000 as if the law as so in force had continued: and

                     (e)  if parenting payment would be paid under the law as so in force at the rate applicable for non-benefit PP (partnered)—the claim is to be determined as if it related only to the period preceding 1 July 2000.

                     (a)  before 1 July 2000, a person lodged a claim for parenting payment in anticipation of becoming qualified for that payment; and

                     (b)  but for the amendment of the social security law with effect from 1 July 2000, if the person had made such a claim after that date, the backdated claim period would have extended back to the occurrence of a particular event before that date;

then:

                     (c)  the person may make such a claim on or after 1 July 2000 as if those amendments had not been made; and

                     (d)  the claim can be dealt with in so far as the backdated claim period would permit a claim in respect of a period before 1 July 2000.

                     (b)  the claim has not been determined as at that date;

the claim is to be treated as if it were a claim for MAT or MIA under Division 3 of Part 3 of the Family Assistance Administration Act as amended by this Act and not as such a claim for the corresponding allowance under the _Social Security Act 1991_.

(2)        If a person purports to claim maternity allowance or maternity immunisation allowance under the social security law on or after 1 July 2000, that claim is to be treated as if it were a claim for MAT or MIA, as the case requires, under Division 3 of Part 3 of the Family Assistance Administration Act as amended by this Act and not as such a claim for the corresponding allowance under the social security law.

(3)        A person who has been paid maternity allowance or maternity immunisation allowance under the social security law  in respect of a particular child cannot claim MAT or MIA for the same child under Division 3 of Part 3 of the Family Assistance Administration Act as amended by this Act.

                     (c)  another person applies, on or after 1 July 2000, to receive the amount; and

                     (d)  the application is made:

                              (i)  within 26 weeks after the first person’s death; or

                             (ii)  within such further period as is allowed by the Secretary in the special circumstances of the case;

the Secretary may pay the amount to the person who, in the Secretary’s opinion, is best entitled to it.

(2)        If:

                     (b)  the person dies before receiving that amount; and

                     (c)  another person applies, on or after 1 July 2000, to receive the amount; and

                     (d)  the application is made:

                              (i)  within 26 weeks after the first person’s death; or

                             (ii)  within such further period as is allowed by the Secretary in the special circumstances of the case;

the Secretary may pay the amount to the person who, in the Secretary’s opinion, is best entitled to it.

(3)        If the Secretary pays an amount under subitem (1) in respect of family benefit of a particular kind claimed under the social security law, the Commonwealth has no further liability to any person in respect of family benefit of that kind under the social security law or in respect of any family benefit of a like kind under the family assistance law.

                     (a)  an individual had, under section 864A of the _Social Security Act 1991_ as in force before 1 July 2000, requested a family allowance advance in respect of an advance period, within the meaning of that Act, that ended before 1 July 2000, and all subsequent advance periods; and

                     (b)  that request had been granted;

the grant has effect, in relation to the advance period commencing on 1 July 2000 and all subsequent advance periods as if:

                     (c)  it were a grant made under section 33 of the Family Assistance Administration Act as amended by this Act; and

                     (d)  it related not to qualification for family allowance advance but rather to an entitlement to family tax benefit advance in relation to the individual’s family tax benefit as determined by the Secretary in accordance with item 6.

(2)        For the avoidance of doubt, an individual who is treated, by virtue of the operation of subitem (1), as having made and been granted a request under section 33 of the Family Assistance Administration Act as amended by this Act, may on 1 July 2000, or at any time after that date, withdraw the request in so far as it is treated as relating to standard advance periods within the meaning of that Act as so amended for which the individual has not been paid a family tax benefit advance.

                     (b)  the Secretary decides, on or after 1 July 2000, to seek further information in relation to the benefit or allowance;

the Secretary may, under Division 1 of Part 5 of the _Social Security (Administration) Act 1999_, require the provision of information concerning that benefit or allowance, or concerning the person to whom it is payable, as if that benefit or allowance had continued, on and after 1 July 2000, to be a social security payment as defined for the purposes of the _Social Security (Administration) Act 1999_.

                             (ii)  having been born outside Australia, the child has not subsequently come to Australia before that date;

the child is not, if that absence extends for a period of 3 years beginning on the first day of the absence, an FTB child at any time after the period of 3 years ends.

(2)        In determining whether the period of absence of the child extends for 3 years beginning on the first day of the child’s absence:

                     (a)  any return or coming to Australia before 1 July 2000 that would have been disregarded under the _Social Security Act 1991_ as in force before that date had that Act as so in force continued unamended after that date is to be disregarded for the purposes of subitem (1); and

                     (b)  any return or coming to Australia on or after 1 July 2000 that would have been disregarded under section 24 of the Family Assistance Act as amended by this Act if that section were to have applied to the person is also to be disregarded for the purposes of that subitem.

Schedule 1 to the Family Assistance Act as so amended applies in relation to that entitlement during that part of the child’s absence that is referred to in paragraph (b) with the modifications set out in the table included in subsection 63(4) of that Act as so amended.

(4)        If:

                     (a)  the child referred to in paragraph (1)(b) is absent from Australia for a continuous period of more than 26 weeks (whether or not that 26 weeks ends before 1 July 2000); and
