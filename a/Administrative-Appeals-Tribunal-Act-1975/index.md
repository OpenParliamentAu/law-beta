          (1B)  Where an application that has been lodged with the Tribunal for a review of a decision was not lodged within the time within which it was required by section 29 to be lodged, the reference in subsection (1) to the period of 28 days after the person who made the decision receives notice of the application for a review shall be read as a reference to the period of 28 days after the day on which that person so receives notice or the day on which the Tribunal makes a determination extending the time for the making of the application for a review, whichever is the later.

          (1C)  The Tribunal may, upon request being made, as prescribed, by a party to a proceeding before the Tribunal for a review of a decision, direct, by order, that subsection (1B) shall have effect in relation to an application for a review of the decision as if the last reference in that subsection to a period of 28 days were a reference to such shorter period as is specified in the order.

          (1D)  Subsection (1B) does not apply in relation to an application for a review of a decision if the decision is the subject of another application to which subsection (1B) does not apply.

Tribunal may require other documents to be lodged

             (2)  Where the Tribunal is of the opinion that particular other documents or that other documents included in a particular class of documents may be relevant to the review of the decision by the Tribunal, the Tribunal may cause to be given to the person a notice in writing stating that the Tribunal is of that opinion and requiring the person to lodge with the Tribunal, within a time specified in the notice, the specified number of copies of each of those other documents that is in his or her possession or under his or her control, and a person to whom such a notice is given shall comply with the notice.

             (2)  This section does not apply to a proceeding in the Security Appeals Division to which section 39A applies.

##### <a id="39A"></a>39A  Procedure at certain hearings in Security Appeals Division

Review of security assessment

             (1)  If an application for a review of a security assessment is made to the Tribunal, the Tribunal is to review the assessment in accordance with this section.

Parties

             (2)  The parties to the proceeding are the Director-General of Security and the applicant, but the Commonwealth agency to which the assessment is given is entitled to adduce evidence and make submissions.

Director-General of Security must present all relevant information

             (3)  It is the duty of the Director-General of Security to present to the Tribunal all relevant information available to the Director-General, whether favourable or unfavourable to the applicant.

Member may require parties to attend etc.

             (4)  The presidential member who is to preside, or is presiding, at the hearing may, at any time, require either or both of the parties to attend or be represented before the member for the purpose of conferring with the member concerning the conduct of the review with a view to identifying the matters in issue or otherwise facilitating the conduct of the proceedings.

Proceedings to be in private

             (5)  The proceedings are to be in private and, subject to this section, the Tribunal is to determine what people may be present at any time.

Right of parties etc. to be present

             (6)  Subject to subsection (9), the applicant and a person representing the applicant may be present when the Tribunal is hearing submissions made or evidence adduced by the Director-General of Security or the Commonwealth agency to which the assessment was given.

Security/defence certificate

             (8)  The Minister administering the _Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979_(the **_responsible Minister_**) may, by signed writing, certify that evidence proposed to be adduced or submissions proposed to be made by or on behalf of the Director-General of Security or the Commonwealth agency to which the assessment was given are of such a nature that the disclosure of the evidence or submissions would be contrary to the public interest because it would prejudice security or the defence of Australia.

             (9)  If such a certificate is given:

                     (a)  the applicant must not be present when the evidence is adduced or the submissions are made; and

                     (b)  a person representing the applicant must not be present when the evidence is adduced or the submissions are made unless the responsible Minister consents.

           (10)  If a person representing the applicant is present when evidence to which a certificate given under subsection (8) relates is adduced or submissions to which such a certificate relates are made, the representative must not disclose any such evidence or submission to the applicant or to any other person.

                    Penalty:  Imprisonment for 2 years.

Note:          Subsection 4B(2) of the _Crimes Act 1914_ allows a court to impose an appropriate fine instead of, or in addition to, a term of imprisonment.

Protection of identity of person giving evidence

           (11)  If the Director-General of Security so requests, the Tribunal must do all things necessary to ensure that the identity of a person giving evidence on behalf of the Director-General of Security is not revealed.

Evidence and submissions

           (12)  The Tribunal must first hear evidence adduced, and submissions made, by or on behalf of the Director-General of Security and any evidence or submissions that the Commonwealth agency to which the assessment was given may wish to adduce or make.

           (13)  The Tribunal must next permit the applicant, if he or she so desires, to adduce evidence before, and make submissions to, the Tribunal.

           (14)  The Tribunal may, on its own initiative and at any stage of the proceedings, invite a person to give evidence, or cause a person to be summoned to give evidence.

           (15)  If a person invited or summoned to give evidence under subsection (14) is an officer or employee of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation or of the Commonwealth agency to which the assessment was given, subsection (8) applies as if any evidence to be given by the person were evidence proposed to be adduced by or on behalf of the Director-General of Security or that agency, as the case may be.

           (16)  If:

                     (a)  a party presents his or her case to the Tribunal; and

                     (b)  after that case has been presented, the other party adduces evidence; and

                     (c)  the Tribunal thinks that, because of evidence adduced by the other party, the first-mentioned party should be further heard;

the Tribunal must give the first-mentioned party an opportunity of adducing further evidence but must not give to the applicant any particulars of any evidence to which a certificate given under subsection (8) relates.

           (17)  A member of the Tribunal may ask questions of a witness before the Tribunal and the presidential member presiding may require a witness to answer any such question.

Scope

             (1)  This section applies to a proceeding in the Security Appeals Division to which section 39A applies.

Attorney-General may issue public interest certificate

             (2)  If the Attorney-General certifies, by signed writing, that the disclosure of information with respect to a matter stated in the certificate, or the disclosure of the contents of a document, would be contrary to the public interest:

                     (a)  because it would prejudice security or the defence or international relations of Australia; or

                     (b)  because it would involve the disclosure of deliberations or decisions of the Cabinet or a Committee of the Cabinet or of the Executive Council; or

                     (c)  for any other reason stated in the certificate that could form the basis for a claim by the Crown in right of the Commonwealth in a judicial proceeding that the information or the contents of the document should not be disclosed;

the following provisions of this section have effect.

Protection of information etc.

             (3)  A person who is required by or under this Act to disclose the information or to produce the document to the Tribunal for the purposes of a proceeding is not excused from the requirement, but the Tribunal must, subject to subsections (4), (5) and (7) and section 46, do all things necessary to ensure:

                     (a)  that the information or the contents of the document are not disclosed to anyone other than a member of the Tribunal as constituted for the purposes of the proceeding; and

                     (b)  in respect of a document produced to the Tribunal—that the document is returned to the person by whom it was produced.

             (4)  Subsection (3) does not apply in relation to disclosure to the Director-General of Security or his or her representative if the reason stated in the certificate is the reason referred to in paragraph (2)(a).

Disclosure of information etc.

             (5)  If:

                     (a)  the Attorney-General has certified in accordance with subsection (2) that the disclosure of information or of the contents of a document would be contrary to the public interest but the certificate does not state a reason referred to in paragraph (2)(a) or (b); and

                     (b)  the presidential member presiding is satisfied that the interests of justice outweigh the reason stated by the Attorney-General;

the presidential member may authorise the disclosure of the information, or of the contents of the document to, the applicant.

What presidential member must consider in deciding whether to authorise disclosure of information etc.

             (6)  In considering whether information or the contents of a document should be disclosed as mentioned in subsection (5):

                     (a)  the presidential member must take as the basis of his or her consideration the principle that it is desirable, in the interest of ensuring that the Tribunal performs its functions effectively, that the parties should be made aware of all relevant matters; but

                     (b)  the presidential member must pay due regard to any reason stated by the Attorney-General in the certificate as a reason why the disclosure of the information or of the contents of the document, as the case may be, would be contrary to the public interest.

Disclosure of information etc. to staff of Tribunal

             (7)  This section does not prevent the disclosure of information or of the contents of a document to a member of the Tribunal’s staff in the course of the performance of his or her duties as a member of the Tribunal’s staff.

Public interest

             (8)  This section excludes the operation, apart from this section, of any rules of law relating to the public interest that would otherwise apply in relation to the disclosure of information or of the contents of documents in a proceeding.

Copy of document

             (9)  If the Attorney-General has given a certificate under subsection (2) in respect of a document, this section applies in relation to a document that is a copy of the first-mentioned document as if the copy were the original document.

Certificate lodged under subsection 38A(1)

           (10)  For the purposes of this section, if the Director-General of Security, in accordance with subsection 38A(1), has lodged with the Tribunal a certificate of the Attorney-General given under subsection 38(2) of the _Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979_, the certificate is taken to be a certificate certifying to the Tribunal that the disclosure of the information to which the certificate relates would be contrary to the public interest because it would prejudice security.

Duty of Tribunal

           (11)  It is the duty of the Tribunal, even though there may be no relevant certificate under this section, to ensure, so far as it is able to do so, that, in or in connection with a proceeding, information is not communicated or made available to a person contrary to the requirements of security.

                     (a)  the person has, for the purpose of taking that evidence, all the powers of the Tribunal under subsection (1) and all the powers under subsection (2) of the member who is to preside at the hearing of the proceeding; and

                     (b)  for the purpose of the exercise of those powers by that person, this Act has effect (except where the context otherwise requires) as if a reference to the Tribunal or to the member who is to preside at the hearing of a proceeding included a reference to that person.

Incidental proceedings

             (7)  The application of this section extends to a directions hearing under this Act or an alternative dispute resolution process under Division 3 (an **_incidental proceeding_**) as if it were a proceeding before the Tribunal and a power that under this section is conferred on the Tribunal or a member of the Tribunal for the purpose of reviewing a decision may be exercised for the purposes of an incidental proceeding by the person holding the directions hearing or the person conducting the alternative dispute resolution process, as the case may be.

##### <a id="41"></a>41  Operation and implementation of a decision that is subject to review

             (1)  Subject to this section, the making of an application to the Tribunal for a review of a decision does not affect the operation of the decision or prevent the taking of action to implement the decision.

             (2)  The Tribunal may, on request being made, as prescribed, by a party to a proceeding before the Tribunal (in this section referred to as the **_relevant proceeding_**), if the Tribunal is of the opinion that it is desirable to do so after taking into account the interests of any persons who may be affected by the review, make such order or orders staying or otherwise affecting the operation or implementation of the decision to which the relevant proceeding relates or a part of that decision as the Tribunal considers appropriate for the purpose of securing the effectiveness of the hearing and determination of the application for review.

             (3)  Where an order is in force under subsection (2) (including an order that has previously been varied on one or more occasions under this subsection), the Tribunal may, on request being made, as prescribed, by a party to the relevant proceeding, make an order varying or revoking the first-mentioned order.

             (4)  Subject to subsection (5), the Tribunal shall not:

             (5)  Subsection (4) does not prohibit the Tribunal from making an order without giving to a person referred to in that subsection a reasonable opportunity to make a submission to the Tribunal in relation to a matter if the Tribunal is satisfied that, by reason of the urgency of the case or otherwise, it is not practicable to give that person such an opportunity but, where an order is so made without giving such an opportunity to the person who made the decision to which the relevant proceeding relates, the order does not come into operation until a notice setting out the terms of the order is given to that person.

             (6)  An order in force under subsection (2) (including an order that has previously been varied on one or more occasions under subsection (3)):

             (5)  Subsections (3) and (4) apply in relation to reasons given in writing by the Tribunal for its decision as they apply in relation to the decision.

When Tribunal’s decision comes into operation

                     (d)  if such an appeal is brought—the appeal is determined.

Tribunal’s decision taken to be decision of decision-maker

             (6)  A decision of a person as varied by the Tribunal, or a decision made by the Tribunal in substitution for the decision of a person, shall, for all purposes (other than the purposes of applications to the Tribunal for a review or of appeals in accordance with section 44), be deemed to be a decision of that person and, upon the coming into operation of the decision of the Tribunal, unless the Tribunal otherwise orders, has effect, or shall be deemed to have had effect, on and from the day on which the decision under review has or had effect.

                     (a)  there is an obvious clerical or typographical error in the text of the decision or statement of reasons; or

Federal Court may make findings of fact

             (7)  If a party to a proceeding before the Tribunal appeals to the Federal Court of Australia under subsection (1), the Court may make findings of fact if:

### Application, saving or transitional provisions

_Jurisdiction of Courts Legislation Amendment Act 2000 (No. 57, 2000)_

## Schedule 1

## 2  Effect of amended Act  in relation to appellable State or Territory decisions

Definitions

(1)        In this item:

**_amended Act_** means the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ as in force after the commencement.

**_appellable_****_State_****_decision_** means a decision of the Tribunal made in the exercise of power conferred on the Tribunal by or under a law of a State.

**_appellable_****_Territory_****_decision_** means a decision of the Tribunal made in the exercise of power conferred on the Tribunal by or under a law of the Australian Capital Territory or of the Northern Territory.

**_commencement_** means the commencement of the amendments of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ made by this Schedule.

**_State_** does not include the Northern Territory.

**_Tribunal_** has the same meaning as in the amended Act.

Appellable State decisions made before the commencement—situations in which period for appealing under amended Act is extended

(2)        In each of the following situations, the amended Act applies in relation to a person and an appellable State decision as if the 28 day period referred to in subsection 44(2A) of that Act began on the commencement:

                     (a)  the first situation—the decision was made before the commencement and that 28 day period would otherwise have begun during the period starting on 20 May 1999 and ending immediately before the commencement;

                     (b)  the second situation—before 17 June 1999, the Federal Court of Australia, purporting to Act under subsection 44(2A) of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ as purportedly applied as a law of a State, made an order allowing the person further time to make an appeal from that decision and that period of time had not expired by 17 June 1999;

                     (c)  the third situation—immediately before 17 June 1999, proceedings by way of an appeal by the person from the decision were before the Federal Court of Australia under section 44 of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ as purportedly applied as a law of a State.

_Note:       The power under subsection 44(2A) of the amended Act to extend the time for appealing from a decision of the Tribunal is available even if the decision is an appellable State decision and the 28 day time limit that would otherwise apply expired before the commencement._

Appellable Territory decisions—ACT and NT laws no longer operate to apply sections 44 to 46 of the AAT Act

(3)        A law of the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory that provides for the application of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ as a law of that Territory is of no effect after the commencement so far as that law purports to apply all or any of sections 44 to 46 of that Act in relation to an appellable Territory decision (whenever it was made).

_Note:       Part IVA of the amended Act applies to these decisions._

Appellable Territory decisions—proceedings under sections 44 to 46 continue after the commencement under the amended Act

(4)        If, immediately before the commencement, proceedings in relation to an appellable Territory decision were before a court under any of sections 44 to 46 of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ as applying as a law of the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory, then, from the commencement, those proceedings continue as if they had been commenced in that court under the amended Act.

Appellable Territory decisions—continued effect of orders made before the commencement under sections 44 to 46

(5)        An order made by a court before the commencement under any of sections 44 to 46 of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ as applying as a law of the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory has effect, from the commencement, as if it had been made by that court under the amended Act.
