                     (b)  that was leased to the Commonwealth.

(2)If the FAC’s right, title and interest in the land vests in the Commonwealth under this Part, the Commonwealth’s interest under the lease does not merge in the greater estate or interest that becomes vested in the Commonwealth under this Part.

             (2)  This clause does not apply in relation to an employee who dies while in the employment of an airport‑lessee company. Clause 6 covers such employees.

             (8)  For the purposes of this clause, the rate of salary to be used in working out the full salary of an employee is the rate that would be applicable to the employee under section 21 of the Long Service Leave Act if:

the company must make a payment to a dependant or to 2 or more dependants of the employee.

             (2)  The total amount of the payment or payments is the amount that would have been payable to the employee under clause 5 if, on the day of his or her death, the employee had stopped being an employee of the company on or after reaching the minimum retiring age.

             (3)  If subclause (1) applies, section 23 of the Long Service Leave Act has effect as if:

                     (a)  that section applied to an employee of an airport‑lessee company; and

                     (b)  a reference in that section to the approving authority were a reference to the company; and

                     (a)  starting when the employee started his or her period of service; and

                     (b)  ending at the employee’s transfer time;

if the employee had been retrenched at the employee’s transfer time.

             (2)  For the purposes of clause 5, an employee’s long service leave credit is the employee’s long service leave credit worked out under subclause (1) of this clause, reduced by any long service leave credit used under clause 4\. 

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Schedule not to affect an employee’s future long service leave rights

                   To avoid doubt, it is declared that this Schedule does not affect an employee’s future long service leave rights.

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Saving—Long Service Leave Act

             (1)  This clause applies to an employee who, immediately before the employee’s transfer time, was an employee of the FAC whose period of service under the Long Service Leave Act was at least 10 years.

             (2)  Even though the employee ceases to be employed in Government Service for the purposes of the Long Service Leave Act, the employee’s accrued rights under that Act continue if the employee becomes an employee of an airport‑lessee company at the employee’s transfer time. However, the employee is not entitled to receive any payment because he or she ceases to be in Government Service.

             (3)  The Long Service Leave Act has effect after the employee’s transfer time as if the company were an approving authority for the purposes of that Act.

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Deferred benefits under the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973

             (1)  This clause applies in relation to an employee of an airport‑lessee company that was granted an airport lease under section 22 if:

                     (b)  immediately before the employee’s transfer time, the employee was a person to whom deferred benefits were applicable under section 78 of the _Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973_.

             (2)  For the purposes of Division 3 of Part IX of the _Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973_, the employee is taken to continue in public employment, after the employee’s transfer time, while the employee continues to be employed by the company.

             (3)  This clause is subject to Division 3 of Part IX of the _Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973_.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Period of eligible employment for the purposes of Division 3 of Part IX of the _Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973_

## Part 3—The Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act 1989

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Continuing application of the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act 1989

Continuing application of Act

             (1)  Subject to subclause (2), if a person who was an employee of an airport‑lessee company before the company’s sale time committed a corruption offence while such an employee, then, after the company’s sale time, the _Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act 1989_ continues to apply in relation to the person in respect of the offence as if the company continued to be a Commonwealth authority.

Limitation on superannuation orders

             (2)  A superannuation order may not be made under the _Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act 1989_ in relation to employer contributions or benefits paid or payable to a superannuation scheme by an airport‑lessee company after the company’s sale time.

Superannuation schemes

(3)A superannuation scheme in relation to which employer contributions or benefits are paid or payable by an airport‑lessee company after the company’s sale time is not a superannuation scheme for the purposes of the application of the _Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act 1989_ to a corruption offence committed by a person after the company’s sale time.

Paragraph 19(3)(d) orders

             (4)  Despite paragraph 19(3)(d) of the _Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act 1989_, for the purposes of the application of that Act to an airport‑lessee company, an order made under that paragraph after the company’s sale time may only specify that an amount paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund before the company’s sale time by or on behalf of the company belongs to the Commonwealth.

Paragraph 19(4)(b) orders

             (5)  If:

                     (a)  a person who was an employee of an airport‑lessee company before the company’s sale time committed a corruption offence while such an employee; and

                     (b)  the person was paid benefits before or after the company’s sale time out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund;

then, despite paragraph 19(4)(b) of the _Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act 1989_, for the purposes of the application of that Act to the corruption offence, an order made under that paragraph after the company’s sale time may only specify that an amount equal to the total benefits paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund be paid to the Commonwealth.

Interpretation

             (6)  Unless the contrary intention appears, an expression used in this clause that is also used in the _Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act 1989_ has the same meaning in this clause as it has in that Act.

## Part 4—The Superannuation Benefits (Supervisory Mechanisms) Act 1990

                    <a name="minist"></a>**_Minister_** has the same meaning as in the _Superannuation Benefits (Supervisory Mechanisms) Act 1990_.

_Tax Laws Amendment (Repeal of Inoperative Provisions) Act 2006 
 (No. 101, 2006)_

## Schedule 6

## 1  Application of Schedule 1 and 2 amendments

Except as mentioned in items 2 and 3, the repeals and amendments made by Schedules 1 and 2 apply:

                     (a)  so far as they affect assessments—to assessments for the 2006‑07 income year and all later income years; and

                     (b)  otherwise—to acts done or omitted to be done, or states of affairs existing, after the commencement of the repeals and amendments.

## 6  Object

The object of this Part is to ensure that, despite the repeals and amendments made by this Act, the full legal and administrative consequences of:

                     (a)  any act done or omitted to be done; or

                     (b)  any state of affairs existing; or

                     (c)  any period ending;

before such a repeal or amendment applies, can continue to arise and be carried out, directly or indirectly through an indefinite number of steps, even if some or all of those steps are taken after the repeal or amendment applies.

## 7  Making and amending assessments, and doing other things, in relation to past matters

Even though an Act is repealed or amended by this Act, the repeal or amendment is disregarded for the purpose of doing any of the following under any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_):

                     (a)  making or amending an assessment (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

                     (b)  exercising any right or power, performing any obligation or duty or doing any other thing (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

Example 1: On 31 July 1999, Greg Ltd lodged its annual return under former section 160ARE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The return stated that the company had a credit on its franking account and that no franking deficit tax was payable for the 1998‑99 franking year. Under former section 160ARH of that Act, the Commissioner was taken to have made an assessment consistent with the return.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of Part IIIAA of that Act, the Commissioner concludes that Greg Ltd fraudulently overfranked dividends it paid during the 1998‑99 franking year, and had a franking account deficit for that franking year. As a result, the Commissioner considers that franking deficit tax and a penalty by way of additional tax are payable.

                   The Commissioner can amend the assessment under former section 160ARN of that Act, because item 7 of this Schedule disregards the repeal of that section for the purposes of making an assessment in relation to the 1998‑99 franking year. Item 7 will also disregard the repeal of Division 11 of former Part IIIAA to the extent necessary for the Commissioner to assess Greg Ltd’s liability to a penalty by way of additional tax.

                   Despite the repeal of sections 160ARU and 160ARV, item 9 will ensure that the general interest charge will accrue on the unpaid franking deficit tax and penalty until they are paid.

                   Item 7 will also preserve Greg Ltd’s right, under former section 160ART of that Act, to object against the Commissioner’s amended assessment (including the penalty), since the objection is the exercise of a right in relation to a franking year that ended before the repeal of Part IIIAA.

Example 2: During the 1997‑98 income year, Duffy Property Ltd withheld amounts from its employees’ wages as required by former Divisions 1AAA and 2 of Part VI of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The company failed to notify the Commissioner of those amounts, and failed to remit them to the Commissioner.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of those Divisions, the Commissioner discovers that the withheld amounts have not been remitted. The company’s records are incomplete and the Commissioner is unable to completely ascertain the extent of its liability for the withheld amounts. Under section 222AGA of that Act, the Commissioner makes an estimate of the liability.

                   Item 7 will disregard the repeal of section 220AAZA of that Act (which empowered the Commissioner to recover the amount of the estimate). Even though the estimate is made after the repeal, it relates to amounts withheld before the repeal.

## 8  Saving of provisions about effect of assessments

If a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act deals with the effect of an assessment, the repeal or amendment is disregarded in relation to assessments made, before or after the repeal or amendment applies, in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

## 9  Saving of provisions about general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty

If:

                     (a)  a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act provides for the payment of:

                              (i)  general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty (all within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_); or

                             (ii)  interest under the _Taxation (Interest on Overpayments and Early Payments) Act 1983_; and

                     (b)  in a particular case, the period in respect of which the charge, penalty or interest is payable (whether under the provision or under the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_) has not begun, or has begun but not ended, when the provision is repealed or amended;

then, despite the repeal or amendment, the provision or part continues to apply in the particular case until the end of the period.

## 10  Repeals disregarded for the purposes of dependent provisions

If the operation of a provision (the **_subject provision_**) of any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_) made under any Act depends to any extent on an Act, or a provision of an Act, that is repealed by this Act, the repeal is disregarded so far as it affects the operation of the subject provision.

## 11  Schedule does not limit operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_

This Schedule does not limit the operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

* * *

_Acts Interpretation Amendment Act 2011 (No. 46, 2011)_

The following provisions commence on 27 December 2011 unless proclaimed earlier:

## Schedule 3

## 10  Saving—appointments

The amendments made by Schedule 2 do not affect the validity of an appointment that was made under an Act before the commencement of this item and that was in force immediately before that commencement.

## 11  Transitional regulations

The Governor‑General may make regulations prescribing matters of a transitional nature (including prescribing any saving or application provisions) relating to the amendments and repeals made by Schedules 1 and 2.
