<sub>![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004C02401/Html/AviFueRevSpe88_image002.gif)</sub>

where:

                    <a name="statutori-rate"></a>**_Statutory rate_** means the statutory rate in relation to the amount paid to the Commonwealth.

             (2)  Where the whole or a part of an amount paid as duty of Excise or duty of Customs in relation to eligible aviation fuel is repaid by the Commonwealth to a person by way of rebate or otherwise, there shall be deducted from the sum of the amounts that would, but for this subsection, be paid under subsection (1) an amount calculated using the formula:

<sub>![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004C02401/Html/AviFueRevSpe88_image002.gif)</sub>

where:

                    <a name="statutori-rate"></a>**_Statutory rate_** means the statutory rate in relation to the amount paid to the Commonwealth.

             (3)  For the purposes of subsections (1) and (2), where 2 or more parts of an amount paid as duty were ascertained by reference to different rates of duty, each of the parts shall be taken to be a separate amount paid as duty.

             (4)  Amounts payable under subsection (1) are payable out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which is appropriated accordingly.

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Indexation of relevant rate

             (1)  If the factor ascertained under subsection 6A(5) of the _Excise Tariff Act 1921_ in relation to a relevant period commencing on or after 1 August 1992 is greater than one, then, subject to subsection (2), the relevant rate for the period is:

                     (a)  the rate, calculated to 3 decimal places, ascertained by multiplying the relevant rate at the end of the last preceding relevant period by the factor; or

                     (b)  if that rate would, if it were calculated to 4 decimal places, end in a number greater than 4—the rate increased by 0.001.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  an index number necessary for the calculation of the factor to be ascertained under subsection 6A(5) of the _Excise Tariff Act 1921_ in relation to a relevant period is not published by the Australian Statistician at least 5 days before the first day of the period; and

                     (b)  the factor ascertained in relation to the period is greater than one;

then:

                     (c)  subsection (1) applies only in relation to the part of the period commencing on the fifth day after the day on which the index number is published; and

                     (d)  the relevant rate for the part of the period to which subsection (1) does not apply is the relevant rate at the end of the last preceding period.

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Money to be paid to CASA in relation to aviation kerosene

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), there must be paid to CASA an amount equal to each amount of duty paid to the Commonwealth as duty of Excise or duty of Customs in relation to aviation kerosene entered for home consumption on or after 1 September 1993.

             (2)  If the whole or a part of an amount paid as duty of Excise or duty of Customs in relation to aviation kerosene is repaid by the Commonwealth to a person by way of rebate or otherwise, there must be deducted from an amount that would, but for this subsection, be paid to CASA an amount that equals the repaid amount.

             (3)  Amounts payable to CASA under subsection (1) are payable out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which is appropriated accordingly.
