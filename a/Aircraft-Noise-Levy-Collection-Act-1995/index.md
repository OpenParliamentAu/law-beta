##### <a id="5"></a>5  Act binds Crown

                   This Act binds the Crown in right of each of the States, of the Australian Capital Territory and of the Northern Territory.

## Part 2—Leviable airports

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Identification of qualifying airports

             (1)  If an airport is a qualifying airport at the commencement of this Act, the Minister must publish a notice in the _Gazette_ as soon as possible after the commencement, identifying the airport as a qualifying airport.

             (2)  If an airport becomes a qualifying airport after the commencement of this Act, the Minister must publish a notice in the _Gazette_ as soon as possible after the airport has become a qualifying airport, identifying the airport as a qualifying airport.

             (3)  A notice under this section cannot be revoked or amended.

             (4)  An airport is a **_qualifying airport_** at a particular time if:

                     (a)  at that time there is:

                              (i)  a public building within a 25-unit contour shown on an Australian Noise Exposure Forecast previously prepared for the area around the airport for a date after that time; or

                             (ii)  a residence within a 30-unit contour shown on an Australian Noise Exposure Forecast previously prepared for the area around the airport for a date after that time; and

                     (b)  the Commonwealth is funding at that time, or has funded before that time, a noise amelioration program for the airport.

             (5)  Once an airport has become a qualifying airport, it remains a qualifying airport even if it no longer meets the description in paragraph (4)(a).

             (6)  In this section:

                    <a name="australian-nois-exposur-forecast"></a>**_Australian Noise Exposure Forecast_** means an Australian Noise Exposure Forecast that has been endorsed by the Civil Aviation Authority established by the _Civil Aviation Act 1988_ or by Airservices Australia established by the _Air Services Act 1995_.

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Declaration of leviable airports

             (1)  The Minister may, by notice in the _Gazette_, declare that an airport that has been identified as a qualifying airport is a leviable airport for the period specified in the declaration.

             (2)  The Minister may, by notice in the _Gazette_:

                     (a)  amend a declaration to change the period for which the airport is a leviable airport; or

                     (b)  revoke a declaration.

             (3)  Subsection 33(3) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ does not apply in relation to this section.

             (4)  The Minister must exercise his or her powers under this section to ensure that:

                     (a)  each qualifying airport is declared a leviable airport as soon as practicable after it is identified as a qualifying airport; and

                     (b)  as far as practicable, the adjusted levy liability for an airport at any given time does not exceed the Commonwealth expenditure on the noise amelioration program for the airport up to that time; and

                     (c)  as far as practicable, the ratio of the adjusted levy liability for an airport to the Commonwealth expenditure on the noise amelioration program for the airport is ultimately the same for each leviable airport.

             (5)  The **_adjusted levy liability_** for an airport at a particular time is the sum of the amounts of levy for which operators of jet aircraft have incurred liability as a result of landings of those aircraft at the airport before that time (whether or not any of those amounts are due for payment and whether or not any of those amounts have been paid) minus the amount spent up to that time on collection of levy on landings at the airport.

             (6)  The **_Commonwealth expenditure_** on a noise amelioration program for an airport is the sum of:

                     (a)  amounts spent by the Commonwealth under one or more appropriations on the implementation (including administration) of a noise amelioration program for the airport; and

                     (b)  a reasonable allowance in the nature of interest on amounts spent as described in paragraph (a).

             (7)  The Minister is taken:

                     (a)  to have declared under subsection (1) that Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport is a leviable airport for the period from and including 1 July 1996 to and including 21 February 2001; and

                     (b)  to have made that declaration by notice published in the _Gazette_ before 1 July 1996.

             (8)  Subsection (4) does not apply to the making of the declaration mentioned in subsection (7).

## Part 3—Payment of levy and penalty for late payment of levy

##### <a id="8"></a>8  When levy becomes due for payment

                   Levy becomes due for payment in accordance with the regulations.

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Penalty for late payment of levy

             (1)  If levy payable by a person remains unpaid after it has become due for payment, the person is liable to pay (in addition to the levy) a prescribed penalty on the unpaid amount of levy, calculated from the day the levy became due for payment, and compounded.

             (2)  The regulations must not prescribe a penalty exceeding the equivalent of 1.5% of the amount of unpaid levy for each month or part of a month during which it is unpaid.

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not require the penalty to be calculated on a monthly basis.

             (4)  The fact that a judgment is entered or given in a court for the payment of levy, or of a composite amount that includes levy, does not of itself cause the levy to stop being unpaid for the purposes of subsection (1).

             (5)  If the judgment debt bears interest, the penalty payable under subsection (1) is reduced by the following amount:

                     (b)  the Secretary is satisfied that:

                              (i)  the operator contributed to the delay but has taken reasonable steps to mitigate the causes of the delay; and

                     (c)  the Secretary is satisfied that there are special circumstances that make it reasonable to remit some or all of the penalty.

             (2)  The operator may apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of a decision of the Secretary.
