             (2)  Subject to subsection (1) and any other contrary intention, an expression used in both this Act and Part VIIB of the Assessment Act has the same meaning in this Act as it has in that Part.

##### <a id="4"></a>4  When does a person have private patient hospital cover?

             (1)  For the purposes of this Act, a person is covered by an insurance policy that provides private patient hospital cover if:

                     (a)  the policy is a complying health insurance policy (within the meaning of the _Private Health Insurance Act 2007_) that covers hospital treatment (within the meaning of that Act); and

                     (b)  any excess payable in respect of benefits under the policy is no more than:

                              (i)  $500 in any 12 month period, in relation to a policy under which only one person is insured; and

                             (ii)  $1,000 in any 12 month period, in relation to any other policy.

             (2)  Paragraph (1)(b) does not apply in relation to an insurance policy under which a person has been insured continuously since the end of 24 May 2000, as long as the amount of any excess payable under the policy has not increased since that time.

             (4)  For the purposes of this Act, a person is also covered by an insurance policy that provides private patient hospital cover if:

                     (a)  the policy is issued by a person to whom subsection 67(3) of the _National Health Act 1953_ applied immediately before the commencement of the _Private Health Insurance Act 2007_; and

                     (b)  in a case where the person referred to in paragraph (a) had been, immediately before that commencement, a registered organization within the meaning of the _National Health Act 1953_—the policy would have been, immediately before that commencement, an applicable benefits arrangement, within the meaning of section 5A of that Act, to which paragraph 5A(1)(a) of that Act would apply.

             (5)  However, for the purposes of this Act a person is not covered by an insurance policy that provides private patient hospital cover if:

                     (a)  the person is covered by an insurance policy described in subsection (4); and

                     (b)  any excess payable in respect of benefits under the policy is more than:

                              (i)  $500 in any 12 month period, in relation to a policy under which only one person is insured; and

                             (ii)  $1,000 in any 12 month period, in relation to any other policy.

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Who is a _dependant_ of a person?

                   A person is a **_dependant_** of another person for a period if the person would be a dependant of the other person for the period for the purposes of Part VIIB of the Assessment Act, disregarding subsections 251R(4), (5), (6B), (6C) and (6D) of that Act.

##### <a id="5A"></a>5A  What is the _singles surcharge threshold_?

             (1)  The **_singles surcharge threshold_** for a person for the 2008-09 year of income is $70,000\. This amount is indexed annually.

Indexation of singles surcharge threshold

             (2)  The amount of the singles surcharge threshold is indexed annually by:

                     (a)  multiplying the singles surcharge threshold for the 2008-09 year of income by its indexation factor; and

                     (b)  rounding the result in paragraph (a) down to the nearest multiple of $1,000.

             (3)  The singles surcharge threshold is not indexed if its indexation factor is 1 or less.

             (4)  The **_indexation factor_** is:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00491/Html/ANTSMLSFB1999_WD02_image002.gif)

             (5)  The indexation factor mentioned in subsection (4) is calculated to 3 decimal places (rounding up if the fourth decimal place is 5 or more).

             (6)  The **_index number_** for a quarter is the estimate of full-time adult average weekly ordinary time earnings for the middle month of the quarter first published by the Australian Statistician for that month.

##### <a id="6"></a>6  What is the _family surcharge threshold_?

             (1)  The **_family surcharge threshold_** for a person for a year of income is an amount equal to double the singles surcharge threshold for the year of income.

             (2)  However, if the person has 2 or more dependants who are children, the **_family surcharge threshold_** for the person for the year of income is the sum of:

                     (a)  an amount equal to double the singles surcharge threshold for the year of income; and

                     (b)  the result of the following formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00491/Html/ANTSMLSFB1999_WD02_image003.gif)

Example:    If a person has 3 dependants who are children, the family surcharge threshold for the 2008-09 year of income is:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00491/Html/ANTSMLSFB1999_WD02_image004.gif)

##### <a id="7"></a>7  When are people _married_?

De facto couples treated as if married

             (1)  This Act applies to 2 persons (whether of the same sex or different sexes) as if they were married to each other for a period if:

                     (a)  their relationship is registered for the period under a law of a State or Territory prescribed for the purposes of section 22B of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ as a kind of relationship prescribed for the purposes of that section; or

                     (b)  they lived together in a relationship as a couple on a genuine domestic basis for the period, although not legally married to each other.

          (1A)  If, during the period, either or both of the persons was legally married to another person, or in a relationship mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) with another person, this Act applies as if the person or persons were not legally married to, or in a relationship mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) with, the other person.

Persons living separately taken not to be married

             (2)  A person is taken not to be married to another person if they are living separately and apart.

New widows and widowers taken to be married until end of year

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  the last person (the **_deceased_**) to whom another person was married during a year of income died during the year of income; and

                     (b)  the death occurred while they were married;

the living person is taken to be married to the deceased during the period starting on the day the deceased died and ending on 30 June of the year of income.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Who is a _prescribed person_?

                   A person is a **_prescribed person_** for a period if the person would be a prescribed person for the purposes of Part VIIB of the Assessment Act during the period, disregarding subsection 251U(3) of that Act.

## Part 2—Imposition of surcharge

##### <a id="10"></a>10  Imposition of Medicare levy surcharge

Surcharge imposed on reportable fringe benefits total

             (1)  Medicare levy surcharge is imposed on the reportable fringe benefits total for a year of income of a person who is a resident of Australia at any time during the year of income.

Note:          Subdivision 61-L (tax offset for Medicare levy surcharge (lump sum payments in arrears)) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ might provide a tax offset for a person if Medicare levy surcharge is payable by the person.

Who is a **resident of****Australia**—general rule

             (2)  A person is a **_resident of_****_Australia_** if he or she is a resident of Australia as defined in subsection 6(1) of the Assessment Act.

Exception for Norfolk Island

             (3)  However, a person is not a **_resident of Australia_** for the purposes of this Act if he or she is a resident of Australia as defined in subsection 6(1) of the Assessment Act merely because subsection 7A(2) of that Act treats Norfolk Island as part of Australia.
