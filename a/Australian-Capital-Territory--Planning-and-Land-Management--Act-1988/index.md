##### <a id="21"></a>21  Publication and commencement of approved Plan

##### <a id="22"></a>22  Parliamentary scrutiny of Plan

             (2)  If either House of the Parliament, in pursuance of a motion of which notice has been given within 6 sitting days after the Plan has been laid before that House, passes a resolution disallowing the Plan or a part of the Plan, the Plan or part so disallowed thereupon ceases to have effect.

             (3)  If, before the end of 6 sitting days after notice of a motion to disallow the Plan or part of the Plan has been given in a House of the Parliament:

                     (a)  the House of Representatives is dissolved or expires, or the Parliament is prorogued; and

                     (b)  at the time of the dissolution, expiry or prorogation, as the case may be:

                              (i)  the notice has not been withdrawn and the motion has not been called on; or

                             (ii)  the motion has been called on, moved and seconded and has not been withdrawn or otherwise disposed of;

             (4)  If:

                     (b)  the later part amended or revoked another part of the Plan (in this subsection called the **_earlier part_**) that was in effect immediately before the later part took effect;

the disallowance revives the earlier part from the date of the disallowance as if the later part had not taken effect.

##### <a id="23"></a>23  Amendments of Plan

                   Amendments of the Plan shall be prepared in the same way as the Plan, and sections 14 to 22 (both inclusive) apply to amendments as if references in those sections to the Plan were references to amendments.

_Legislative Instruments (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 2003 (No. 140, 2003)_

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Transitional provisions

             (1)  If legislation introduced into the Parliament before the commencing day but commencing on or after that day:

                     (a)  authorises an instrument to be made in the exercise of a power delegated by the Parliament; and

                     (b)  is expressed to require that instrument to be published as a statutory rule under the _Statutory Rules Publication Act 1903_;

any instrument so made is taken to be an instrument referred to in paragraph 6(b) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ despite the repeal by this  Act  of the _Statutory Rules Publication Act 1903_.

             (2)  If legislation introduced into the Parliament before the commencing day but commencing on or after that day:

                     (a)  authorises an instrument to be made in the exercise of a power delegated by the Parliament; and

                     (b)  is expressed to declare that instrument to be a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_;

any instrument so made is taken to be an instrument referred to in subparagraph 6(d)(i) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ despite the repeal by this Act of section 46A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

             (3)  If legislation that is in force immediately before the commencing day or that is introduced into the Parliament before that day but that commences on or after that day:

                     (a)  authorised or authorises an instrument to be made in the exercise of a power delegated by the Parliament that adversely affects the rights of a person, or results in the imposition of liabilities on a person; and

                     (b)  provided or provides that the instrument has effect, to the extent that it adversely affects those rights or results in the imposition of those liabilities, despite subsection 48(2) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_, before the date of its notification in the _Gazette_;

that legislation is to be construed, on and after the commencing day or the day of its commencement, whichever last occurs, as if it had provided instead that the instrument, to the extent that it adversely affects those rights or results in the imposition of those liabilities, has effect, despite subsection 12(2) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_, before its registration under that Act.

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  legislation (the **_enabling legislation_**) in force immediately before the commencing day:

                              (i)  authorises the making of an instrument; and

                             (ii)  does not declare such an instrument to be a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ but nonetheless makes provision for its disallowance by the application, with or without modification, of the provisions of Part XII of that Act; and

                     (b)  an instrument is made in the exercise of that authority on or after the commencing day; and

                     (c)  the instrument is not a legislative instrument for the purposes of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ or otherwise;

the enabling legislation has effect, on and after the commencing day, as if:

                     (d)  it had declared such instruments to be disallowable instruments for the purposes of section 46B of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_; and

                     (e)  it had provided for such modifications of the operation of that section as are necessary to ensure that the effect of the applied provisions of Part XII of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ is preserved.

             (5)  In this section:

                    <a name="commenc-dai"></a>**_commencing day_** means the commencing day within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003._
