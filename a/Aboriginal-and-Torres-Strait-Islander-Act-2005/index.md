## An Act to establish a Torres Strait Regional Authority, an Indigenous Land Corporation and a corporation to be known as Indigenous Business Australia, and for related purposes

WHEREAS the people of Australia voted overwhelmingly to amend the Constitution so that the Parliament of Australia would be able to make special laws for peoples of the aboriginal race;

AND WHEREAS the people whose descendants are now known as Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders were the inhabitants of Australia before European settlement;

AND WHEREAS they have been progressively dispossessed of their lands and this dispossession occurred largely without compensation, and successive governments have failed to reach a lasting and equitable agreement with Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders concerning the use of their lands;

AND WHEREAS it is the intention of the people of Australia to make provision for rectification, by such measures as are agreed by the Parliament from time to time, including the measures referred to in this Act, of the consequences of past injustices and to ensure that Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders receive that full recognition within the Australian nation to which history, their prior rights and interests, and their rich and diverse culture, fully entitle them to aspire;

AND WHEREAS it is also the wish of the people of Australia that there be reached with Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders a real and lasting reconciliation of these matters;

AND WHEREAS it is the firm objective of the people of Australia that policies be maintained and developed by the Australian Government that will overcome disadvantages of Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders to facilitate the enjoyment of their culture;

AND WHEREAS it is appropriate to further the aforementioned objective in a manner that is consistent with the aims of self‑management and self‑sufficiency for Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders;

AND WHEREAS it is also appropriate to establish structures to represent Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders to ensure maximum participation of Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders in the formulation and implementation of programs and to provide them with an effective voice within the Australian Government;

AND WHEREAS the Parliament seeks to enable Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders to increase their economic status, promote their social well‑being and improve the provision of community services;

AND WHEREAS the Australian Government has acted to protect the rights of all of its citizens, and in particular its indigenous peoples, by recognising international standards for the protection of universal human rights and fundamental freedoms through:

                 (a)  the ratification of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and other standard‑setting instruments such as the International Covenants on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and on Civil and Political Rights; and

             (b)  the acceptance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights:

                     (b)  to promote the development of self‑management and self‑sufficiency among Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders;

                     (c)  to further the economic, social and cultural development of Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders; and

                     (d)  to ensure co‑ordination in the formulation and implementation of policies affecting Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders by the Commonwealth, State, Territory and local governments, without detracting from the responsibilities of State, Territory and local governments to provide services to their Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander residents.

the rules may provide a maximum penalty for the TSRA election offence not exceeding the maximum pecuniary penalty for the corresponding Commonwealth election offence. However, nothing in this subsection enables the rules to provide penalties of imprisonment.

Rules may take account of special circumstances

7.                For the purposes of the application of paragraphs 4(a) and (b) in relation to a transfer under clause 5 or 12 of the surplus votes of an elected candidate, each ballot paper of the elected candidate that was obtained by him or her on a transfer under this section shall be dealt with as if any vote it expressed for the elected candidate were a first preference vote, as if the name of any other candidate previously elected or excluded had not been on the ballot paper and as if the numbers indicating subsequent preferences had been altered accordingly.

8.                Where, after the counting of first preference votes or the transfer of surplus votes (if any) of elected candidates, no candidate has, or fewer than the number of candidates required to be elected have, received a number of votes equal to the quota, the candidate who stands lowest in the poll shall be excluded or, if a bulk exclusion can be effected in accordance with clause 9, the candidates who may be excluded in accordance with that clause shall be excluded, and:

                     (a)  the total number of ballot papers expressing a first preference vote for an excluded candidate and the next available preference for a particular continuing candidate shall be transferred, each ballot paper at a transfer value of 1 vote, to the continuing candidate and added to the number of votes of the continuing candidate; and

                     (b)  the total number (if any) of other ballot papers obtained by an excluded candidate or candidates, as the case may be, shall be transferred beginning with the ballot papers received by that candidate or those candidates at the highest transfer value and ending with the ballot papers received at the lowest transfer value, as follows:

                              (i)  the total number of ballot papers received by the excluded candidate or candidates, as the case may be, at a particular transfer value and expressing the next available preference for a particular continuing candidate shall be multiplied by that transfer value;

                             (ii)  the number so obtained (disregarding any fraction) shall be added to the number of votes of the continuing candidate;

                            (iii)  all those ballot papers shall be transferred to the continuing candidate.

9.          (1)  The procedure for a bulk exclusion, and the circumstances in which such an exclusion may be made, are as provided by this clause.

             (2)  A continuing candidate (in this clause called **_Candidate A_**) shall be identified, if possible, who, of the continuing candidates who each have a number of notional votes equal to or greater than the vacancy shortfall, stands lower or lowest in the poll.

             (3)  A continuing candidate (in this clause called **_Candidate B_**) shall be identified, if possible, who:

                     (a)  stands lower in the poll than Candidate A, or if Candidate A cannot be identified, has a number of notional votes that is fewer than the vacancy shortfall;

                     (b)  has a number of notional votes that is fewer than the number of votes of the candidate standing immediately higher than him or her in the poll; and

                     (c)  if 2 or more candidates satisfy paragraphs (a) and (b)—is the candidate who of those candidates stands higher or highest in the poll.

             (4)  In a case where Candidate B has been identified and has a number of notional votes fewer than the leading shortfall, Candidate B and any other continuing candidates who stand lower in the poll than that candidate may be excluded in a bulk exclusion.

             (5)  In a case where Candidate B has been identified and has a number of notional votes equal to or greater than the leading shortfall:

                     (a)  a continuing candidate (in this clause called **_Candidate C_**) shall be identified who:

                              (i)  has a number of notional votes that is fewer than the leading shortfall; and

                             (ii)  if 2 or more candidates satisfy subparagraph (i)—is the candidate who of those candidates stands higher or highest in the poll; and

                     (b)  Candidate C and all other continuing candidates who stand lower in the poll than that candidate may be excluded in a bulk exclusion.

10.              Where, apart from this clause, the number of continuing candidates after a bulk exclusion under clause 9 would be fewer than the number of remaining unfilled vacancies, clause 9 shall operate to exclude only the number of candidates, beginning with the candidate who stands lowest in the poll, that would leave sufficient continuing candidates to fill the remaining unfilled vacancies.

11.              Notwithstanding any other provision of this Schedule (other than clause 16), where a candidate or candidates has or have been elected and there are surplus votes as a result of that election, subclauses 9(2), (3), (4) and (5) may be applied as if references in those paragraphs to notional votes were references to adjusted notional votes.

12.  Any continuing candidate who has received a number of votes equal to or greater than the quota on the completion of a transfer under clause 8 or 13 of ballot papers of an excluded candidate or candidates, as the case may be, shall be elected, and, unless all the vacancies have been filled, the surplus votes (if any) of the candidate so elected shall be transferred in accordance with paragraphs 4(a) and (b), except that, where the candidate so elected is elected before all the ballot papers of the excluded candidate or candidates, as the case may be, have been transferred, the surplus votes (if any) of the candidate so elected shall not be transferred until the remaining ballot papers of the excluded candidate or candidates, as the case may be, have been transferred in accordance with paragraphs 8(a) and (b) to continuing candidates.

13.  Subject to clause 15, where, after the transfer of all of the ballot papers of an excluded candidate or candidates, as the case may be, no continuing candidate has received a number of votes greater than the quota, the continuing candidate who stands lowest in the poll shall be excluded and his or her ballot papers transferred in accordance with paragraphs 8(a) and (b).

14.  Where a candidate is elected during a transfer of ballot papers under clause 8 or 13, no other ballot papers of an excluded candidate or candidates, as the case may be, shall be transferred to the candidate so elected.

15.  In respect of the last vacancy for which 2 continuing candidates remain, the continuing candidate who has the larger number of votes shall be elected notwithstanding that that number is below the quota, and if those candidates have an equal number of votes the authorised electoral officer shall decide by lot which candidate shall be elected.

16.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Schedule, where the number of continuing candidates is equal to the number of remaining unfilled vacancies, those candidates shall be elected.

17.  Subject to clauses 18 and 19, where, after any count under this Schedule, 2 or more candidates have surplus votes, the order of any transfers of the surplus votes of those candidates shall be in accordance with the relative sizes of the surpluses, the largest surplus being transferred first.

18.  Subject to clause 19, where, after any count under this Schedule, 2 or more candidates have equal surpluses, the order of any transfers of the surplus votes of those candidates shall be in accordance with the relative numbers of votes of those candidates at the last count at which each of those candidates had a different number of votes, the surplus of the candidate with the largest number of votes at that count being transferred first, but if there has been no such count the authorised electoral officer shall determine the order in which the surpluses shall be dealt with.

19.  Where, after any count under this section, a candidate obtains surplus votes, those surplus votes shall not be transferred before the transfer of any surplus votes obtained by any other candidate on an earlier count.

20.  Where a candidate is elected by reason that the number of first preference votes received by him or her, or the aggregate of first preference votes received by him or her and all other votes obtained by him or her, on transfers under this Schedule, is equal to the quota, all the ballot papers expressing those votes shall be set aside as finally dealt with.

21.  A ballot paper shall be set aside as exhausted where on a transfer it is found that the paper expresses no preference for any continuing candidate.

22.  Where a candidate dies before the scrutiny, a vote indicated on a ballot paper opposite the name of that candidate shall be counted to the candidate next in the order of the voter’s preference, and the numbers indicating subsequent preferences shall be deemed to be altered accordingly.

23.              For the purposes of this Schedule, each of the following is a separate transfer:

                     (a)  a transfer under clause 4, 5 or 12 of all the surplus votes of an elected candidate;

                     (b)  a transfer under paragraph 8(a) of all ballot papers expressing a first preference vote for an excluded candidate;

                     (c)  a transfer under paragraph 8(b) of all ballot papers received by the excluded candidate or candidates, as the case may be, at a particular transfer value.

24.  In this Schedule:

                    <a name="adjusted-notion-vote"></a>**_adjusted notional vote_**, in relation to a continuing candidate, means, in a case where a candidate or candidates has or have been elected, the sum of:

                     (a)  the number of notional votes of the continuing candidate; and

                    <a name="continu-candid"></a>**_continuing candidate_** means a candidate not already elected or excluded from the count.

                    <a name="lead-shortfal"></a>**_leading shortfall_**, in relation to a particular stage during the scrutiny in a TSRA ward election, means the shortfall of the continuing candidate standing highest in the poll at that stage.

                    <a name="notion-vote"></a>**_notional vote_**, in relation to a continuing candidate, means the aggregate of the votes obtained by that candidate and the votes obtained by each other candidate who stands lower in the poll than him or her.

                    <a name="vacanc-shortfal"></a>**_vacancy shortfall_**, in relation to a particular stage during the scrutiny in a TSRA ward election, means the aggregate of the shortfalls of that number of leading candidates equal to the number of remaining unfilled vacancies, the leading candidates being ascertained by taking the continuing candidate who stands highest in the poll, the continuing candidate who stands next highest in the poll, and so on in the order in which the continuing candidates stand in the poll.

25.  In this Schedule, a reference to votes or ballot papers, as the case may be, of or obtained or received by a candidate includes votes or ballot papers, as the case may be, obtained or received by the candidate on any transfer under this Schedule.

26.  For the purposes of this Schedule, at any time after the counting of first preference votes the order of standing of the continuing candidates in the poll shall be determined as follows:

                     (a)  subject to paragraph (b), the continuing candidates shall stand in the poll in the order of the relative number of votes of each continuing candidate, with the continuing candidate with the greatest number of votes standing highest in the poll and the continuing candidate with the fewest number of votes standing lowest in the poll;

                     (b)  if 2 or more continuing candidates have the same number of votes, those candidates shall stand in the poll in the order of the relative number of votes of each of those candidates at the last count at which each of them had a different number of votes, with the continuing candidate with the greater or greatest number of votes at that count standing higher in the poll and the continuing candidate with the fewer or fewest number of votes at that count standing lower in the poll, but if there has been no such count the authorised electoral officer shall determine the order of standing of those candidates in the poll.
