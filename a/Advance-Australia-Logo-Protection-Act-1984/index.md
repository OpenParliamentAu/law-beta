##### <a id="9"></a>9  Certain purported dispositions or charges relating to copyright in, or design of, the logo to be void

             (1)  A disposition, by assignment, declaration of trust or by any other means, purporting to be made by the Company of the whole or any part of its interest in the copyright in the logo or of its interest in the design of the logo to a person other than the Commonwealth is void.

             (2)  A charge purporting to be given by the Company with respect to an asset of the Company that consists of, or includes, the whole or any part of its interest in the copyright in the logo or the whole or any part of its interest in the design of the logo is void.

##### <a id="10"></a>10  Ownership of copyright in, and design of, the logo to vest in Commonwealth in certain circumstances

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  the Company passes a resolution for its winding up;

                     (b)  an order is made for the winding up of the Company; or

                     (c)  the Minister, by notice published in the _Gazette_, declares that he is satisfied that it is no longer in the public interest for the Company to own any interest in the copyright in the logo or any interest in the design of the logo by reason that:

                              (i)  the Company has refused or failed to comply with a direction under section 17;

                             (ii)  the Company has done, or is doing, an act or thing that the Company was or is without the capacity or power to do; or

                            (iii)  there has been a change in the objects, powers, constitution, management, membership, beneficial ownership or control of the Company;

then, by force of this subsection:

                     (d)  the interest of the Company in:

                              (i)  the copyright in the logo; and

                             (ii)  the design of the logo;

                            is assigned to the Commonwealth; and

                     (e)  the interest, rights and benefits of the Company under any licence granted by the Company in respect of the copyright in, and the design of, the logo are assigned to the Commonwealth.

             (2)  Where, whether by force of subsection (1) or otherwise, the Commonwealth acquires an interest in the copyright in the logo or an interest in the design of the logo, a purported assignment by the Commonwealth of the whole or any part of that interest to a person (in this section referred to as the **_assignee_**) is void unless:

                     (a)  the assignee is an incorporated company; and

                     (b)  the assignee agrees that, as a condition of the assignment, it is not entitled to compensation from the Commonwealth by reason of the operation of any provision of this Act.

             (3)  Where the Commonwealth assigns the whole or any part of its interest in the copyright in, or the design of, the logo to a company, section 9, subsection (1) of this section and sections 17 and 18 have effect as if a reference in those provisions to the Company were a reference to the assignee.

             (4)  A person is not entitled to compensation from the Commonwealth by reason of the operation of subsection (1) or (3).

##### <a id="11"></a>11  Infringement of monopoly in the design of the logo

             (1)  A person shall be deemed to infringe the monopoly in the design of the logo if, during the prescribed period, the person:

                     (a)  without the licence of the owner of the design, applies the design or any fraudulent or obvious imitation of it to any article;

                     (b)  without the licence of the owner of the design, sells, or offers or keeps for sale, or hires, or offers or keeps for hire, any article to which the design or any fraudulent or obvious imitation of it has been applied in infringement of the monopoly in the design;

                     (c)  imports into Australia for sale, or for use for the purposes of any trade or business, any article in respect of which the design or any fraudulent or obvious imitation of it has been applied outside Australia; or

                     (d)  sells, or offers or keeps for sale, or hires, or offers or keeps for hire, any article that has been imported into Australia and to which the design or any fraudulent or obvious imitation of it has been applied, whether in or outside Australia.

             (2)  Subject to subsection (3), if a person infringes the monopoly in the design of the logo:

                     (a)  the owner of the design; or

                     (b)  a holder of a licence in relation to the design whose interests have been, are or would be affected by the infringement;

may bring an action or proceeding against the person in the Federal Court of Australia or the Supreme Court of a State or a Territory for infringement of the monopoly in the design.

             (3)  An action or proceeding for infringement of the monopoly in the design of the logo shall not be instituted by the holder of a licence in relation to the design without the consent of the owner of the design.

             (4)  Where:

                     (a)  a person, being the holder of a licence in relation to the design of the logo, applies, by notice in writing served on the owner of the design, for the consent of the owner under subsection (3) to the institution by the person of an action or proceeding for infringement of the monopoly in the design of the logo; and

                     (b)  the owner of the design does not grant or refuse that consent before the expiration of the period of 7 days after the day on which the notice was served;

the owner of the design shall, upon the expiration of that period, be deemed to have granted that consent under subsection (3).

             (5)  Consent under subsection (3) to the institution of an action or proceeding shall not be unreasonably refused.

             (6)  Subsection (3) does not affect the granting of an interlocutory injunction on the application of a holder of a licence in relation to the design of the logo.

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Remedies for infringement of monopoly in the design of the logo

                   The relief that a court may grant in an action or proceeding for the infringement of the monopoly in the design of the logo includes an injunction (subject to such terms, if any, as the court thinks fit) and, at the option of the plaintiff, either damages or an account of profits.

##### <a id="13"></a>13  Jurisdiction of courts

             (1)  The Supreme Court of each State is invested with federal jurisdiction, and to the extent that the Constitution permits, jurisdiction is conferred on the Supreme Court of each Territory, with respect to all matters arising under section 11 or 16.

          (1A)  The Federal Court of Australia has jurisdiction with respect to all matters arising under section 11 or 16.

             (6)  Except as provided in subsection (4) or (5), no appeal lies from a judgment or order referred to in subsection (4).

             (7)  A reference in subsection (3) to an inferior court is a reference to:

                     (a)  a County Court, District Court or Local Court; or

                     (b)  a court of summary jurisdiction exercising civil jurisdiction;

being a court having jurisdiction in actions for the recovery of debts up to an amount not less than the amount of compensation claimed.

##### <a id="14"></a>14  Validation of certain licences

                   Where, before 13 October 1983, the Company purported to grant a licence for a particular period expiring after that date in respect of the design of the logo, the licence is as valid and effectual as it would have been if it had been granted on that date for the part of that period that commenced on that date.

##### <a id="15"></a>15  Immunity from suit

             (1)  No action or proceeding, whether civil or criminal, lies against the Commonwealth or the Company for or in relation to any matter or thing arising out of or incidental to the grant before 13 October 1983 of any purported licence in respect of the design of the logo.

             (2)  No action or proceeding, whether civil or criminal, lies against the Commonwealth, the Company or a person acting in accordance with any purported licence in respect of the design of the logo for or in relation to the use of the logo before 13 October 1983.

##### <a id="16"></a>16  Compensation for acquisition of property

             (1)  Where, but for this subsection, the operation of a provision of this Act would result in the acquisition of property from a person by another person otherwise than on just terms, there is payable to the first‑mentioned person by that other person such amount of compensation as is agreed upon between those persons, or, failing agreement, as is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.

             (2)  Any compensation recovered in proceedings that are instituted under this section shall be taken into account in assessing damages or compensation or giving any other remedy in proceedings that are instituted otherwise than by virtue of this Act and that arise out of the same event or transaction.

             (3)  Any damages or compensation recovered or other remedy given in proceedings that are instituted otherwise than by virtue of this Act shall be taken into account in assessing compensation payable in proceedings that are instituted under this section and that arise out of the same event or transaction.

             (4)  In this section, **_acquisition of property_** and **_just terms_** have the same respective meanings as in paragraph 51(xxxi) of the Constitution.

             (3)  After the expiration of the prescribed period, it is not an infringement of the copyright in the logo to do any act or thing that, had it been done immediately before the expiration of the prescribed period, would have been an act or thing that, by virtue of this Act, the owner of the design of the logo would have had the exclusive right to do if a reference in this Act to the design of the logo had, immediately before the expiration of the prescribed period, included a reference to another design that when applied to an article differs from the design of the logo only in immaterial details or in features commonly used in a relevant trade.

             (4)  Any registration of the design of the logo that was purported to be made under the _Designs Act 1906_, whether before or after this subsection commenced to have effect, is void and shall be deemed never to have been made.
