### Division 3—Establishing standards for listable chemical products

##### <a id="56D"></a>56D  NRA to prepare standards

             (1)  This section applies in respect of each listable chemical product, whether or not the product is the subject of a monograph in the British Pharmacopoeia or the British Pharmacopoeia (Veterinary) or in a similar publication.

             (2)  The NRA must prepare in writing a standard for each listable chemical product and must submit the standard to the Minister for his or her approval of the standard. A particular standard may relate to a specified chemical product or specified chemical products or to each chemical product in a specified class of chemical products.

             (3)  The standard for a listable chemical product must require that the product be labelled in a manner, or kept in containers that comply with requirements, specified in the standard.

             (4)  Without limiting the generality of subsection (3), the NRA may, in a standard, direct that the particulars required by the standard be set out, in a manner specified in the standard, on:

                     (a)  chemical products, or a class of chemical products, identified in the standard; or

                     (b)  a container containing chemical products, or a class of chemical products, identified in the standard; or

                     (c)  a label for containers for chemical products, or a class of chemical products, identified in the standard.

             (5)  Without limiting the generality of the preceding provisions of this section, a standard for a listable chemical product:

                     (a)  may be specified by reference to any one or more of the following:

                              (i)  the composition and form of the constituents of the product;

                             (ii)  the physical and chemical properties of the chemical product;

             (6)  If the Minister decides not to approve a standard for a listable chemical product:

                     (a)  the Minister must inform the NRA of the reasons for the decision; and

                     (b)  the NRA must prepare in writing such revised standard or standards for the product as may be required until the Minister endorses his or her approval on the instrument containing the standard concerned.

             (7)  If the Minister decides to approve a standard for a listable chemical product:

                     (a)  the approval is effected by the Minister endorsing his or her approval on an instrument containing the standard; and
