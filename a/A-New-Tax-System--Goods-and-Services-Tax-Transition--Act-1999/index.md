##### <a id="6"></a>6  Time of supply or acquisition

             (1)  This section sets out how to determine when a supply or acquisition is made for the purposes of this Act.

Note:          Many of the rules in this Act rely on this concept.

             (2)  A supply or acquisition of goods is made:

                     (a)  when the goods are removed; or

                     (b)  if the goods are not to be removed—when the goods are made available to the recipient; or

                     (c)  if the goods are removed before it is certain that a supply will be made (for example, if the goods are given or taken on approval, sale or return, or similar terms)—when it becomes certain that a supply has been made.

Note:          Subsection 20(8) provides a rule stating when motor vehicles and other goods covered by subsection 20(1) are taken to be removed.

             (3)  A supply or acquisition of real property is made when the property is made available to the recipient.

             (4)  A supply or acquisition of services is made when the services are performed.

Note:          However, section 12 provides a different rule for progressive and periodic contracts.

             (5)  A supply or acquisition of any other thing is made when the thing is performed or done.

Note:          However, section 12 provides a different rule for progressive and periodic contracts.

##### 6A  Trading periods spanning midnight on 30 June 2000

             (1)  Despite section 6, if:

                     (a)  an entity has chosen to apply this section; and

                     (b)  the entity makes a supply that, under section 6, would be taken to be made on 1 July 2000 but before:

                              (i)  6 am on that day; or

                             (ii)  if the entity has chosen to stop the application of this section at an earlier time on that day—the time so chosen; and

                     (c)  the part of the entity’s enterprise through which the supply is made was open for business both immediately before 1 July 2000 and immediately after 30 June 2000; and

                     (d)  that part of the entity’s enterprise remains open for business during 1 July 2000 until at least the time at which, under section 6, the supply would be taken to be made;

the supply, and the acquisition made by the recipient of the supply, is taken, for the purposes of this Act, to be made immediately before 1 July 2000.

             (2)  If an entity makes a supply to which subsection (1) applies, then, in relation to that supply:

                     (a)  section 12 has effect as if the reference in paragraph 12(1)(b) to a period that begins before 1 July 2000 and ends on or after 1 July 2000 were a reference to a period that begins before the end of the transition trading period and ends on or after the end of the transition trading period; and

                     (b)  Part 4 has effect as if references to having goods on hand at the start of 1 July 2000 were references to having goods on hand immediately after the end of the transition trading period; and

                     (c)  subsection 16(3A) has effect as if the reference to the amount of sales tax borne changing after 1 July 2000 were a reference to that amount changing after the end of the transition trading period; and

                     (d)  paragraph 17(1)(b) has effect as if the reference to applying the goods on or after 1 July 2000 were a reference to applying the goods after the end of the transition trading period; and

                     (e)  paragraph 17(3)(b) has effect as if the reference to ceasing to be registered on or after 1 July 2000 were a reference to ceasing to be registered after the end of the transition trading period; and

                      (f)  section 24 has effect as if:

                              (i)  the reference to making gambling supplies before 1 July 2000 were a reference to making gambling supplies before the end of the transition trading period; and

                             (ii)  the reference to a gambling event happening on or after 1 July 2000 were a reference to a gambling event happening on or after the end of the transition trading period; and

                            (iii)  the references to gambling events that happened before 1 July 2000 were references to gambling events that happened before the end of the transition trading period; and

                     (g)  section 24A has effect as if the references to vouchers supplied before, not redeemed before, or supplied after, 1 July 2000 were references to vouchers supplied before, not redeemed before, or supplied after, the end of the transition trading period (as the case requires).

             (3)  This section does not apply if, but for this section, the supply would be input taxed.

             (4)  In this section:

                    <a name="transition-trade-period"></a>**_transition trading period_** means the period ending:

                     (a)  at the first time after 30 June 2000 that the part of the entity’s enterprise through which the supply in question was made was not open for business; or

                     (b)  at:

                              (i)  6 am on 1 July 2000; or

                             (ii)  if the entity has chosen to stop the application of this section at an earlier time on that day—the time so chosen;

whichever occurs sooner.

## Part 2—Start of GST

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Start of GST

             (1)  GST is only payable on a supply or importation to the extent that it is made on or after 1 July 2000.

Note:          GST may not apply to supplies during trading periods spanning midnight on 30 June 2000: see section 6A.

             (2)  An entitlement to an input tax credit only arises on an acquisition or importation to the extent that it is made on or after 1 July 2000.

Note:          There are special rules about input tax credits for motor vehicles etc.: see section 20.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Effect on sales tax

             (1)  No sales tax is payable on an assessable dealing to the extent that a supply or importation in respect of the dealing is made on or after 1 July 2000.

Note 1:       If sales tax has been paid, a credit will arise for the amount overpaid, to the extent that the claimant has not passed it on: see CR1 in Table 3 in Schedule 1 to the _Sales Tax Assessment Act 1992_.

Note 2:       For the end of sales tax generally, see the _A New Tax System (End of Sales Tax) Act 1999_.

Note 3:       Sales tax may still apply to supplies during trading periods spanning midnight on 30 June 2000: see section 6A.

             (2)  Despite the _A New Tax System (End of Sales Tax) Act 1999_, if:

                     (a)  all or part of a supply or importation in respect of an assessable dealing is made before that Act commences (even if it is also made before this Act commences); and

                     (b)  the time of the dealing is on or after 1 July 2000;

for the purpose of determining the extent (if any) to which sales tax is payable on the dealing, the time of the dealing is taken to be immediately before that Act commences.

##### <a id="9"></a>9  GST registration before 1 July 2000

             (1)  Parts 2-5 and 4-5 of the GST Act, and any other provisions of the GST law so far as they relate to registration, apply on and after the day determined by the Commissioner (even if that day is before the commencement of the GST Act).

Note:          From that day, you may apply to be registered if you are entitled to do so under section 23-10 of the GST Act.

             (2)  However, you are not required to be registered before 1 June 2000.

Example:    On 1 May 2000, you start carrying on a business whose annual turnover meets the registration turnover threshold. Although you would normally be required to apply within 21 days, you can apply anytime before 1 June 2000\. But if instead you start carrying on a business on 20 May, you have until 10 June (21 days later) to apply to be registered.

##### <a id="10"></a>10  Invoice or consideration before 1 July 2000

                   If, before 1 July 2000:

                     (a)  any consideration is received in connection with a supply, or provided in connection with an acquisition, that you will make on or after that day; or

                     (b)  an invoice is issued relating to a supply or acquisition that you will make on or after that day;

for the purposes of determining the tax period to which GST or input tax credits are attributable, the consideration is taken to have been received or provided, or invoice taken to have been issued, during your first tax period after that day.

Note:          Division 29 of the GST Act contains rules about attributing GST and input tax credits to tax periods.

##### <a id="11"></a>11  Supply of rights exercisable on or after 1 July 2000

             (1)  A supply of a right that has been or is granted on or after 2 December 1998 (other than a supply of a right granted on or after 1 July 2000) is taken to be a supply made on or after 1 July 2000 if, and to the extent that, the right could reasonably be expected to be exercised on or after 1 July 2000.

          (1A)  However, this section does not apply to:

                     (a)  a supply to which section 12 applies; or

                     (b)  a supply of a right that is an option to purchase, under a hire purchase agreement, goods hired under that agreement; or

                     (c)  a supply of a right to use software if:

                              (i)  the value of the right was included in the price of the software; and

                             (ii)  the right to use the software is for an indefinite period.

          (1B)  This section does not apply to:

                     (a)  a supply of a long-term lease made before 1 July 2000; or

                     (b)  a supply of a voucher made before 1 July 2000 if, on redemption of the voucher, the holder of the voucher is entitled to supplies up to a monetary value stated on the voucher.

             (2)  The Commissioner may make a written ruling determining methods for working out the extent to which a right could reasonably be expected to be exercised on or after 1 July 2000 where that extent is not readily ascertainable.

             (3)  This section does not affect the operation of section 13.

             (4)  If this section has an effect in relation to a supply, it has a corresponding effect in relation to the acquisition to which the supply relates.

## Part 3—Agreements spanning 1 July 2000

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Progressive or periodic supplies

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  you make a supply under an agreement, or an enactment, that provides (expressly or impliedly) that the thing supplied is to be supplied:

                              (i)  for a period; or

                             (ii)  progressively over a period;

                            whether or not at regular intervals; and

                     (b)  that period begins before 1 July 2000 and ends on or after 1 July 2000.

Note:          Section 11 does not apply to supplies covered by this section: see paragraph 11(1A)(a).

          (1A)  However, this section does not apply to a supply of a warranty (whether express, implied or required by law) that relates to goods or a service, if the value of the warranty was included in the price of the goods or service.

             (2)  For the purposes of this Act, the supply is taken to be made continuously and uniformly throughout that period.

             (3)  For the purposes of this section, a supply by way of lease, hire or similar arrangement is taken to be a supply for the period of the lease, hire or arrangement.

             (4)  This section does not apply to a supply of a long-term lease made before 1 July 2000.

             (5)  In this section:

                    <a name="warranti"></a>**_warranty_**, in relation to goods or a service, means an undertaking or obligation in relation to:

                     (a)  the quality, performance or characteristics of the goods or service; or

                     (b)  the provision of services that are or may at any time be required in respect of the goods or service; or

                     (c)  the supply of parts that are or may at any time be required for the goods;

given or made in connection with the supply of the goods or service.

             (6)  If this section has an effect in relation to a supply, it has a corresponding effect in relation to the acquisition to which the supply relates.

##### <a id="13"></a>13  Existing agreements: no opportunity to review

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a written agreement specifically identifies a supply and identifies the consideration in money, or a way of working out the consideration in money, for the supply; and

                     (b)  the agreement was made before the day on which this Act received the Royal Assent.

             (2)  The supply is GST-free to the extent that it is made before the earlier of the following:

                     (a)  1 July 2005;

                     (b)  if a review opportunity arises on or after the day of Royal Assent—when that opportunity arises.

             (3)  If all of the consideration was paid before 2 December 1998, the supply is also GST-free to the extent it is made on or after 1 July 2005 but before a review opportunity has arisen as mentioned in paragraph (2)(b).

             (4)  However, if the recipient of the supply would not be entitled to a full input tax credit for it, treat the references in paragraphs (1)(b) and (2)(b) to the day of Royal Assent as references instead to 2 December 1998.

          (4A)  For the purposes of this section, a Commonwealth entity is to be treated as if it were entitled or not entitled to a full input tax credit (whichever is relevant) if it would be so entitled or not entitled if it were an entity other than a Commonwealth entity.

             (5)  In this section:

                    <a name="review-opportun"></a>**_review opportunity_**, for an agreement to which this section applies, means an opportunity that arises under the agreement:

                     (a)  for the supplier under the agreement (acting either alone or with the agreement of one or more of the other parties to the agreement) to change the consideration directly or indirectly because of the imposition of GST; or

                     (b)  for the supplier under the agreement (acting either alone or with the agreement of one or more of the other parties to the agreement) to conduct, on or after 1 July 2000, a general review, renegotiation or alteration of the consideration; or

                     (c)  for the supplier under the agreement (acting either alone or with the agreement of one or more of the other parties to the agreement) to conduct, before 1 July 2000, a general review, renegotiation or alteration of the consideration that takes account of the imposition of the GST.

##### <a id="14"></a>14  Rights granted for life

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  you supply services or any other things (other than goods or real property) under an agreement or enactment; and

                     (b)  the agreement or enactment provides (expressly or impliedly) that a right is to be granted or exercisable for the rest of an individual’s life; and

                     (c)  the right is granted or first exercisable before 1 July 2000.

             (2)  To the extent that the supply is constituted by the supply of the right, so much of the supply as is made before 1 July 2000 is instead taken, for the purposes of this Act, to be made on 1 July 2000.

             (3)  However, in the case of an agreement entered into before 2 December 1998 that is also covered by section 13:

                     (a)  subsections 13(2) and (3) do not apply; and

                     (b)  instead, the supply is GST-free to the extent that the consideration for the supply is paid before the earlier of the following:

                              (i)  1 July 2005;

                             (ii)  if a review opportunity as mentioned in paragraph 13(2)(b) arises—when that opportunity arises.

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  an agreement is for the supply of a life membership; and

                     (b)  the entity to which the supply is made would be entitled to a full input tax credit for it;

subsection (3) has effect as if the reference to 2 December 1998 were a reference to 8 July 1999.

             (5)  For the purposes of this section, a Commonwealth entity is to be treated as if it were entitled or not entitled to a full input tax credit (whichever is relevant) if it would be so entitled or not entitled if it were an entity other than a Commonwealth entity.

             (6)  If this section has an effect in relation to a supply, it has a corresponding effect in relation to the acquisition to which the supply relates.

##### <a id="15"></a>15  Funeral agreements

             (1)  If, before 1 July 2000, you enter, or have entered, into an agreement for a supply consisting of the provision of a funeral (or a right to the provision of a funeral):

                     (a)  section 11 and this Part (apart from this section) do not apply; and

                     (b)  the supply of any right under the agreement relating to the provision of a funeral is taken to be a supply made on or after 1 July 2000 only if the funeral is provided on or after that day.

             (2)  If you entered into the agreement before 1 December 1999 and the funeral is provided on or after 1 July 2000, the supply is GST-free to the extent that the consideration for the supply is paid before 1 July 2005.

## Part 4—Stock on hand on 1 July 2000

##### <a id="16"></a>16  Special GST credit for sales tax paid on stock

             (1)  You are entitled to a special credit for GST purposes if:

                     (a)  you are registered as at 1 July 2000; and

                     (b)  you have on hand, at the start of 1 July 2000, goods you acquired or imported that are held for the purposes of sale or exchange (but not for manufacture) in the ordinary course of business.

Note:          In some cases relating to alcoholic beverages, subsections 16A(3) and 16B(3) prevent special credits arising.

             (2)  However, this section does not apply to the following:

                     (a)  second-hand goods, unless:

                              (i)  you imported them; and

                             (ii)  nobody was entitled to quote under the _Sales Tax Assessment Act 1992_ for the importation; and

                            (iii)  you did not hold the goods, at any time prior to 1 July 2000, for a purpose other than for sale or exchange in the ordinary course of business.

                     (b)  goods mentioned in subsection 15A(1) (alcoholic beverages) of the _Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1992_, if those goods are opened stock;

                     (c)  wine within the meaning of the _A New Tax System (Wine Equalisation Tax) Act 1999_.

             (3)  The amount of the special credit is equal to the amount of sales tax that you have borne in respect of the goods.

Note:          In some cases relating to alcoholic beverages, subsections 16A(2) and 16B(2) reduce the amounts of special credits.

          (3A)  However, if the amount of sales tax you have borne in respect of the goods changes after 1 July 2000, the amount of the special credit changes accordingly.

             (4)  The special credit is treated as though it were an input tax credit attributable to any one tax period of your choice. However, you are not entitled to it unless you separately identify it in a GST return that you lodge for a tax period that ends before 7 January 2001.

          (4A)  If the amount of the special credit changes under subsection (3A) after you lodged that return, you must lodge with the Commissioner an amended GST return for that tax period. You must lodge it on or before the 21st day of the month following the end of the tax period in which the change happens.

             (5)  The Commissioner may make a written ruling determining methods for working out the amount of sales tax that you have borne in respect of specified goods in cases where that amount is not readily ascertainable.

Note:          Goods may be specified by name, by inclusion in a specified class or in any other way.

                     (b)  they are goods mentioned in subsection 15A(1) (alcoholic beverages) of the _Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1992_; and

                     (c)  either:

                              (i)  an amount of excise duty or customs duty (the **_old duty amount_**) in respect of the goods was paid before 1 July 2000; or

                             (ii)  the goods were delivered into home consumption before 1 July 2000 under a permission given under subsection 61C(1) of the _Excise Act 1901_ or granted under subsection 69(3) of the _Customs Act 1901_, and an amount of excise duty or customs duty (the **_old duty amount_**) was or is payable in respect of the goods; and

                     (d)  were excise duty or customs duty (whichever is applicable) instead to become payable on the goods immediately after 1 July 2000, the amount of that duty (the **_new duty amount_**) would be greater than the old duty amount.

             (2)  The amount of the special credit in respect of the goods is reduced by an amount equal to the difference between the new duty amount and the old duty amount.

             (3)  However, there is no special credit in respect of the goods if the difference between the new duty amount and the old duty amount equals or exceeds what would (apart from this section) be the amount of the special credit.

##### <a id="16AB"></a>16AB  Special GST credit for certain alcoholic beverages on which duty has decreased

             (1)  This section applies to goods if:

                              (i)  an amount of excise duty or customs duty (the **_old duty amount_**) in respect of the goods was paid before 1 July 2000; or

                             (ii)  the goods were delivered into home consumption before 1 July 2000 under a permission given under subsection 61C(1) of the _Excise Act 1901_ or granted under subsection 69(3) of the _Customs Act 1901_, and an amount of excise duty or customs duty (the **_old duty amount_**) was or is payable in respect of the goods; and

                     (d)  were excise duty or customs duty (whichever is applicable) instead to become payable on the goods immediately after 1 July 2000, the amount of that duty (the **_new duty amount_**) would be less than the old duty amount.

             (2)  The amount of the special credit in respect of the goods is increased by an amount equal to the difference between the old duty amount and the new duty amount.

##### <a id="16B"></a>16B  Special GST credit for certain alcoholic beverages on which duty would not previously have been paid

             (1)  This section applies to goods if:

                             (ii)  goods of a kind in respect of which customs duty was imposed by the Parliament, or goods the subject of a Customs Tariff or Customs Tariff proposed in the Parliament; and

                     (d)  at the start of 1 July 2000, the goods became goods of a kind referred to in subparagraph (c)(i) or (ii).

             (2)  The amount of the special credit in respect of the goods is reduced by an amount (the **_new duty amount_**) equal to what would be the excise duty or customs duty (whichever is applicable) in respect of the goods if that duty were to become payable immediately after 1 July 2000.

             (3)  However, there is no special credit in respect of the goods if the new duty amount equals or exceeds what would (apart from this section) be the amount of the special credit.

             (4)  To avoid doubt, goods that are subject to a “free” rate of duty, or which, under a Customs Tariff proposed in the Parliament, would be subject to a “free” rate of duty, are not goods of a kind referred to in subparagraph (1)(c)(ii).

                     (e)  were excise duty or customs duty (whichever is applicable) instead to become payable on the goods after 1 July 2000, the amount of that duty (the **_new duty amount_**) would be less than the old duty amount.

             (2)  The amount of the special petroleum credit in respect of the goods is an amount equal to the difference between the old duty amount and the new duty amount.

             (3)  The Commissioner must, on behalf of the Commonwealth, pay the special petroleum credit to you or, as provided in the regulations, to another person on your behalf. The payment must be made within the period and in the manner specified in the regulations.

                     (b)  on or after 1 July 2000, you cease to be registered; and

                     (c)  you still hold the goods at the time of the cessation;

you are taken, for the purposes of the GST law, to have made a taxable supply that is attributable to the tax period that was in progress immediately before the cessation.

             (7)  If an input tax credit to which you are entitled is reduced under subsection (4B), then, for the purposes of applying section 21-15 or 21-20 of the GST Act (where relevant), the amount of any adjustment under that section is reduced by the same proportion (before any application of Division 136 of that Act).

             (8)  For the purposes of applying subsection 6(2) to determine when an acquisition to which this section applies is made, the goods in question are not taken to be removed until the goods are physically removed:

##### <a id="24"></a>24  Gambling

             (1)  If you make a gambling supply before 1 July 2000 relating to a gambling event that happens on or after 1 July 2000, the gambling supply is instead taken to have been made on 1 July 2000 and is attributable to your first tax period after that day.

                     (a)  all monetary prizes you are liable to pay at any time on the outcome of gambling events that happened before 1 July 2000; and

                     (b)  all amounts of money you are liable to pay, of a kind referred to in paragraph (b) of the definition of **_total monetary prizes_** in subsection 126-10(1), to the extent that they relate to gambling events that happened before 1 July 2000.

##### 24A  Unredeemed vouchers

                   Section 100-15 of the GST Act applies to vouchers supplied before 1 July 2000, and not redeemed before that day, in the same way that it applies to vouchers supplied after that day.

##### <a id="24B"></a>24B  Commissioner may make determinations relating to rounding

             (1)  The Commissioner may determine in writing a way in which amounts of GST for taxable supplies recorded on invoices may be rounded for the purposes of:

                     (a)  subsection 9-90(1) of the GST Act; and

                     (b)  subparagraph 9-90(2)(a)(ii) of the GST Act; and

                     (c)  step 4 in the method statement in subsection 9-90(2) of the GST Act.

             (2)  However, the determination only applies:

                     (a)  to the entity specified in the determination; and

                     (b)  to taxable supplies attributable under the GST Act to tax periods that end on or before the day specified in the determination.

             (3)  The entity may round amounts of GST, for the purposes of the provisions referred to in paragraphs (1)(a), (b) and (c):

                     (a)  in the way specified in the determination; or

                     (b)  in the way specified in the provisions referred to in those paragraphs.

             (4)  The day specified under paragraph (2)(b) must not be later than 30 June 2002.

             (5)  An entity may apply to the Commissioner in writing for a determination under this section.

Note:          Refusing an application for a determination under this section, and making determinations under this section, are reviewable GST transitional decisions (see Division 7 of Part VI of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_).

             (6)  If one or more taxable supplies, none of which are recorded on an invoice, are recorded on a document that is not an invoice, this section applies as if the document were an invoice.

##### <a id="24C"></a>24C  Supplies from certain coin-operated devices may be input taxed

             (1)  A supply of tangible personal property or a service from a mechanical coin-operated device is input taxed if:

                     (a)  the maximum consideration for the supply is $1 and is paid by depositing up to 2 coins in the device; and

                     (b)  the device accepts only one denomination of coin and does not give change; and

                     (c)  the device was operating on 1 July 2000; and

                     (d)  the supply is made before 1 July 2005; and

                     (e)  the supply is not a gambling supply; and

                      (f)  you choose to have all of your supplies made from the device on or after 1 July 2000 treated as input taxed.

Note:          If a supply is input taxed, there is no entitlement to an input tax credit for the things that are acquired or imported to make the supply (see sections 11-15 and 15-10 of the GST Act).

             (2)  However, if you revoke the choice, you can no longer choose to have all of your supplies from the device treated as input taxed.

## Part 6—Regulations

##### <a id="25"></a>25  Regulations

             (1)  The Governor-General may make regulations prescribing matters:

                     (a)  required or permitted by this Act to be prescribed; or

                     (b)  necessary or convenient to be prescribed for carrying out or giving effect to this Act.

             (2)  In particular, regulations may be made for other transitional measures relating to the end of sales tax, the start of GST, or the transition from sales tax to GST.
