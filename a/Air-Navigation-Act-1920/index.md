##### <a id="5"></a>5  Contracting States

                   The Minister may, by notice published in the _Gazette_, declare which countries are from time to time parties to the Chicago Convention, the Air Transit Agreement or any of the Protocols referred to in section 3A, and such a notice is evidence of the matter so declared.

##### <a id="9"></a>9  International airports

             (1)  The Minister may, by signed writing, designate as an international airport an aerodrome at which facilities are available for the formalities incident to customs, immigration, quarantine and other requirements in connexion with arrival in or departure from Australian territory of aircraft.

##### <a id="10"></a>10  International aircraft to land at and take off from designated airports

             (1)  Subject to such exceptions as are prescribed:

                     (a)  an aircraft arriving in Australian territory from a place outside Australian territory shall land at an aerodrome designated as an international airport under section 9; and

             (2)  If an aircraft is flown in contravention of subsection (1), the operator of the aircraft and the pilot in command of the aircraft are each guilty of an offence punishable on conviction by imprisonment for a period of not more than 2 years.

Note:          Subsection 4B(2) of the _Crimes Act 1914_ allows a court to impose in respect of an offence an appropriate fine instead of, or in addition to, a term of imprisonment.

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not apply if the operator or the pilot in command, as the case may be, has a reasonable excuse.

Note:          A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in subsection (3) (see subsection 13.3(3) of the _Criminal Code_).

                     (a)  to give to the Minister such information as is specified in the notice concerning the extent (if any) to which foreign persons have relevant interests in shares in the Australian international airline; or

                     (b)  if foreign persons have relevant interests in shares in the Australian international airline that represent, in total, more than 49% of the total value of the issued share capital of the Australian international airline—to take all necessary action to ensure that its constitution complies with subsection (2).

             (2)  The constitution of an Australian international airline complies with this subsection if it:

                     (a)  imposes restrictions on the issue and ownership (including joint ownership) of shares in the Australian international airline so as to prevent foreign persons having relevant interests in shares in the Australian international airline that represent, in total, more than 49% of the total value of the issued share capital of the Australian international airline; and

                     (c)  confers the following powers on the directors of the Australian international airline to enable the directors to enforce the restrictions referred to in paragraph (a):

the Federal Court may, on the application of the Minister, grant an injunction restraining the airline or the person from engaging in the conduct. If in the court’s opinion it is desirable to do so, the injunction may also require the airline or person to do any act or thing.

             (2)  If an Australian international airline or any other person has refused or failed, is refusing or failing, or is proposing to refuse or fail, to do an act or thing that the airline or person is required by the mandatory provisions of its constitution or under subsection 11A(1) to do, the Federal Court may, on the application of the Minister, grant an injunction requiring the airline or person to do that act or thing.

             (3)  An injunction under this section is to be granted on such terms as the Federal Court thinks appropriate.

             (4)  On an application under subsection (1) or (2), the Federal Court may, if the court determines it to be appropriate, grant an injunction by the consent of all the parties to the proceeding, whether or not the court is satisfied that that subsection applies.

             (6)  The Federal Court may discharge or vary an injunction granted under this section.

             (7)  The Federal Court’s power to grant an injunction restraining an Australian international airline or any other person from engaging in conduct may be exercised:

                     (a)  whether or not it appears to the court that the airline or person intends to engage again, or to continue to engage, in conduct of that kind; and

                     (b)  whether or not the airline or person has previously engaged in conduct of that kind; and

                     (c)  whether or not there is imminent danger of substantial damage to any person if the airline or the first‑mentioned person engages in conduct of that kind.

             (8)  The Federal Court’s power to grant an injunction requiring an Australian international airline or any other person to do an act or thing may be exercised:

           (11)  In this section:

                    <a name="australian-intern-airlin"></a>**_Australian international airline_** has the same meaning as in section 11A.

             (3)  The Secretary may, by legislative instrument, determine that subsection (1) does not apply in relation to a category of scheduled international air services. The determination has effect accordingly.

             (4)  For the purposes of this section:

##### <a id="13"></a>13  Licensing of scheduled international air services

             (1)  Without limiting section 26, the regulations may provide for or in relation to the licensing of scheduled international air services operated over, into or out of Australian territory.

             (2)  In particular, the regulations may provide for or in relation to the following:

                     (a)  the granting of international airline licences by the Secretary;

                     (b)  the imposition of conditions on international airline licences by the Secretary;

# Schedule 1—Convention on International Civil Aviation 

_Section 4_

PREAMBLE.

WHEREAS the future development of international civil aviation can greatly help to create and preserve friendship and understanding among the nations and peoples of the world, yet its abuse can become a threat to the general security; and 

WHEREAS it is desirable to avoid friction and to promote that co‑operation between nations and peoples upon which the peace of the world depends; 

THEREFORE, the undersigned governments having agreed on certain principles and arrangements in order that international civil aviation may be developed in a safe and orderly manner and that international air transport services may be established on the basis of equality of opportunity and operated soundly and economically; 

Have accordingly concluded this Convention to that end.

PART  I.—AIR NAVIGATION

CHAPTER I.—GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND APPLICATION OF THE CONVENTION. 

_Article_ 1.

**Sovereignty.**

The contracting States recognize that every State has complete and exclusive sovereignty over the airspace above its territory.

_Article_ 2.

**Territory.**

For the purposes of this Convention the territory of a State shall be deemed to be the land areas and territorial waters adjacent thereto under the sovereignty, suzerainty, protection or mandate of such State.

_Article_ 3.

**Civil and state aircraft.**

            (_a_)        This Convention shall be applicable only to civil aircraft, and shall not be applicable to state aircraft. 

            (_b_)        Aircraft used in military, customs and police services shall be deemed to be state aircraft. 

            (_c_)        No state aircraft of a contracting State shall fly over the territory of another State or land thereon without authorization by special agreement or otherwise, and in accordance with the terms thereof. 

            (_d_)        The contracting States undertake, when issuing regulations for their state aircraft, that they will have due regard for the safety of navigation of civil aircraft.

_Article_ 4.

**Misuse of civil aviation.**

Each contracting State agrees not to use civil aviation for any purpose inconsistent with the aims of this Convention. 

CHAPTER II.—FLIGHT OVER TERRITORY OF CONTRACTING STATES. 

_Article_ 5.

**Right of non‑scheduled flight.**

Each contracting State agrees that all aircraft of the other contracting States, being aircraft not engaged in scheduled international air services shall have the right, subject to the observance of the terms of this Convention, to make flights into or in transit non‑stop across its territory and to make stops for non‑traffic purposes without the necessity of obtaining prior permission, and subject to the right of the State flown over to require landing. Each contracting State nevertheless reserves the right, for reasons of safety of flight, to require aircraft desiring to proceed over regions which are inaccessible or without adequate air navigation facilities to follow prescribed routes, or to obtain special permission for such flights. 

Such aircraft, if engaged in the carriage of passengers, cargo, or mail for remuneration or hire on other than scheduled international air services, shall also, subject to the provisions of Article 7, have the privilege of taking on or discharging passengers, cargo, or mail, subject to the right of any State where such embarkation or discharge takes place to impose such regulations, conditions or limitations as it may consider desirable. 

_Article_ 6.

**Scheduled air services.**

No scheduled international air service may be operated over or into the territory of a contracting State, except with the special permission or other authorization of that State, and in accordance with the terms of such permission or authorization. 

_Article_ 7.

**Cabotage.**

Each contracting State shall have the right to refuse permission to the aircraft of other contracting States to take on in its territory passengers, mail and cargo carried for remuneration or hire and destined for another point within its territory. Each contracting State undertakes not to enter into any arrangements which specifically grant any such privilege on an exclusive basis to any other State or an airline of any other State, and not to obtain any such exclusive privilege from any other State. 

_Article_ 8.

**Pilotless aircraft.**

No aircraft capable of being flown without a pilot shall be flown without a pilot over the territory of a contracting State without special authorization by that State and in accordance with the terms of such authorization. Each contracting State undertakes to insure that the flight of such aircraft without a pilot in regions open to civil aircraft shall be so controlled as to obviate danger to civil aircraft. 

_Article_ 9.

**Prohibited areas.**

     (_a_)        Each contracting State may, for reasons of military necessity or public safety, restrict or prohibit uniformly the aircraft of other States from flying over certain areas of its territory, provided that no distinction in this respect is made between the aircraft of the State whose territory is involved, engaged in international scheduled airline services, and the aircraft of the other contracting States likewise engaged. Such prohibited areas shall be of reasonable extent and location so as not to interfere unnecessarily with air navigation. Descriptions of such prohibited areas in the territory of a contracting State, as well as any subsequent alterations therein, shall be communicated as soon as possible to the other contracting States and to the International Civil Aviation Organization.

     (_b_)        Each contracting State reserves also the right, in exceptional circumstances or during a period of emergency, or in the interest of public safety, and with immediate effect, temporarily to restrict or prohibit flying over the whole or any part of its territory, on condition that such restriction or prohibition shall be applicable without distinction of nationality to aircraft of all other States. 

     (_c_)        Each contracting State, under such regulations as it may prescribe, may require any aircraft entering the areas contemplated in subparagraphs (_a_) or (_b_) above to effect a landing as soon as practicable thereafter at some designated airport within its territory. 

_Article_ 10.

**Landing at customs airport.**

Except in a case where, under the terms of this Convention or a special authorization, aircraft are permitted to cross the territory of a contracting State without landing, every aircraft which enters the territory of a contracting State shall, if the regulations of that State so require, land at an airport designated by that State for the purpose of customs and other examination. On departure from the territory of a contracting State, such aircraft shall depart from a similarly designated customs airport. Particulars of all designated customs airports shall be published by the State and transmitted to the International Civil Aviation Organization established under Part II of this Convention for communication to all other contracting States. 

_Article_ 11.

**Applicability of air regulations.**

Subject to the provisions of this Convention, the laws and regulations of a contracting State relating to the admission to or departure from its territory of aircraft engaged in international air navigation, or to the operation and navigation of such aircraft while within its territory, shall be applied to the aircraft of all contracting States without distinction as to nationality, and shall be complied with by such aircraft upon entering or departing from or while within the territory of that State. 

_Article_ 12.

**Rules of the air.**

Each contracting State undertakes to adopt measures to insure that every aircraft flying over or manoeuvring within its territory and that every aircraft carrying its nationality mark, wherever such aircraft may be, shall comply with the rules and regulations relating to the flight and manoeuvre of aircraft there in force. Each contracting State undertakes to keep its own regulations in these respects uniform, to the greatest possible extent, with those established from time to time under this Convention. Over the high seas, the rules in force shall be those established under this Convention. Each contracting State undertakes to insure the prosecution of all persons violating the regulations applicable.

_Article_ 14.

**Prevention of spread of disease.**

Each contracting State agrees to take effective measures to prevent the spread by means of air navigation of cholera, typhus (epidemic), smallpox, yellow fever, plague and such other communicable diseases as the contracting States shall from time to time decide to designate, and to that end contracting States will keep in close consultation with the agencies concerned with international regulations relating to sanitary measures applicable to aircraft. Such consultation shall be without prejudice to the application of any existing international convention on this subject to which the contracting States may be parties. 

_Article_ 15.

**Airport and similar charges.**

Every airport in a contracting State which is open to public use by its national aircraft shall likewise, subject to the provisions of Article 68, be open under uniform conditions to the aircraft of all the other contracting States. The like uniform conditions shall apply to the use, by aircraft of every contracting State, of all air navigation facilities, including radio and meteorological services, which may be provided for public use for the safety and expedition of air navigation. 

Any charges that may be imposed or permitted to be imposed by a contracting State for the use of such airports and air navigation facilities by the aircraft of any other contracting State shall not be higher, 

(_a_)   As to aircraft not engaged in scheduled international air services, than those that would be paid by its national aircraft of the same class engaged in similar operations, and 

(_b_)   As to aircraft engaged in scheduled international air services, than those that would be paid by its national aircraft engaged in similar international air services. 

All such charges shall be published and communicated to the International Civil Aviation Organization: provided that, upon representation by an interested contracting State, the charges imposed for the use of airports and other facilities shall be subject to review by the Council, which shall report and make recommendations thereon for the consideration of the State or States concerned. No fees, dues or other charges shall be imposed by any contracting State in respect solely of the right of transit over or entry into or exit from its territory of any aircraft of a contracting State or persons or property thereon. 

_Article_ 16.

**Search of aircraft.**

The appropriate authorities of each of the contracting States shall have the right, without unreasonable delay, to search aircraft of the other contracting States on landing or departure, and to inspect the certificates and other documents prescribed by this Convention.

(_a_)   Aircraft on a flight to, from, or across the territory of another contracting State shall be admitted temporarily free of duty, subject to the customs regulations of the State. Fuel, lubricating oils, spare parts, regular equipment and aircraft stores on board an aircraft of a contracting State, on arrival in the territory of another contracting State and retained on board on leaving the territory of that State shall be exempt from customs duty, inspection fees or similar national or local duties and charges. This exemption shall not apply to any quantities or articles unloaded, except in accordance with the customs regulations of the State, which may require that they shall be kept under customs supervision.

(_b_)   Spare parts and equipment imported into the territory of a contracting State for incorporation in or use on an aircraft of another contracting State engaged in international air navigation shall be admitted free of customs duty, subject to compliance with the regulations of the State concerned, which may provide that the articles shall be kept under customs supervision and control. 

_Article_ 25.

**Aircraft in distress.**

Each contracting State undertakes to provide such measures of assistance to aircraft in distress in its territory as it may find practicable, and to permit, subject to control by its own authorities, the owners of the aircraft or authorities of the State in which the aircraft is registered to provide such measures of assistance as may be necessitated by the circumstances. Each contracting State, when undertaking search for missing aircraft, will collaborate in co‑ordinated measures which may be recommended from time to time pursuant to this Convention. 

_Article_ 26.

**Investigation of accidents.**

In the event of an accident to an aircraft of a contracting State occurring in the territory of another contracting State, and involving death or serious injury, or indicating serious technical defect in the aircraft or air navigation facilities, the State in which the accident occurs will institute an inquiry into the circumstances of the accident, in accordance, so far as its laws permit, with the procedure which may be recommended by the International Civil Aviation Organization. The State in which the aircraft is registered shall be given the opportunity to appoint observers to be present at the inquiry and the State holding the inquiry shall communicate the report and findings in the matter to that State. 

_Article_ 27.

**Exemption from seizure on patent claims.**

(_a_)   While engaged in international air navigation, any authorized entry of aircraft of a contracting State into the territory of another contracting State or authorized transit across the territory of such State with or without landings shall not entail any seizure or detention of the aircraft or any claim against the owner or operator thereof or any other interference therewith by or on behalf of such State or any person therein, on the ground that the construction, mechanism, parts, accessories or operation of the aircraft is an infringement of any patent, design, or model duly granted or registered in the State whose territory is entered by the aircraft, it being agreed that no deposit of security in connection with the foregoing exemption from seizure or detention of the aircraft shall in any case be required in the State entered by such aircraft. 

(_b_)   The provisions of paragraph (_a_) of this Article shall also be applicable to the storage of spare parts and spare equipment for the aircraft and the right to use and install the same in the repair of an aircraft of a contracting State in the territory of any other contracting State, provided that any patented part or equipment so stored shall not be sold or distributed internally in or exported commercially from the contracting State entered by the aircraft.

# Schedule 2—International Air Services Transit Agreement

_Section 4_

The States which sign and accept this International Air Services Transit Agreement, being members of the International Civil Aviation Organization, declare as follows: 

ARTICLE I.

_Section 1._

Each contracting State grants to the other contracting States the following freedoms of the air in respect of scheduled international air services: 

(1)   The privilege to fly across its territory without landing; 

(2)   The privilege to land for non‑traffic purposes. 

The privileges of this section shall not be applicable with respect to airports utilized for military purposes to the exclusion of any scheduled international air services. In areas of active hostilities or of military occupation, and in time of war along the supply routes leading to such areas, the exercise of such privileges shall be subject to the approval of the competent military authorities.

_Section 2._

The exercise of the foregoing privileges shall be in accordance with the provisions of the Interim Agreement on International Civil Aviation and, when it comes into force, with the provisions of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, both drawn up at Chicago on December 7, 1944.

_Section 3._

A contracting State granting to the airlines of another contracting State the privilege to stop for non‑traffic purposes may require such airlines to offer reasonable commercial service at the points at which such stops are made. 

Such requirements shall not involve any discrimination between airlines operating on the same route, shall take into account the capacity of the aircraft, and shall be exercised in such a manner as not to prejudice the normal operations of the international air services concerned or the rights and obligations of a contracting State. 

_Section 4._

Each contracting State may, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, 

(1)   Designate the route to be followed within its territory by any international air service and the airports which any such service may use; 

(2)   Impose or permit to be imposed on any such service just and reasonable charges for the use of such airports and other facilities; these charges shall not be higher than would be paid for the use of such airports and facilities by its national aircraft engaged in similar international services: provided that, upon representation by an interested contracting State, the charges imposed for the use of airports and other facilities shall be subject to review by the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization established under the abovementioned Convention, which shall report and make recommendations thereon for the consideration of the State or States concerned.

_Section 5._

Each contracting State reserves the right to withhold or revoke a certificate or permit to an air transport enterprise of another State in any case where it is not satisfied that substantial ownership and effective control are vested in nationals of a contracting State, or in case of failure of such air transport enterprise to comply with the laws of the State over which it operates, or to perform its obligations under this Agreement. 

ARTICLE II.

_Section 1._

A contracting State which deems that action by another contracting State under this Agreement is causing injustice or hardship to it, may request the Council to examine the situation. The Council shall thereupon inquire into the matter, and shall call the States concerned into consultation. Should such consultation fail to resolve the difficulty, the Council may make appropriate findings and recommendations to the contracting States concerned. If thereafter a contracting State concerned shall in the opinion of the Council unreasonably fail to take suitable corrective action, the Council may recommend to the Assembly of the above‑mentioned Organization that such contracting State be suspended from its rights and privileges under this Agreement until such action has been taken. The Assembly by a two‑thirds vote may so suspend such contracting State for such period of time as it may deem proper or until the Council shall find that corrective action has been taken by such State.

_Section 2._

If any disagreement between two or more contracting States relating to the interpretation or application of this Agreement cannot be settled by negotiation, the provisions of Chapter XVIII of the above‑mentioned Convention shall be applicable in the same manner as provided therein with reference to any disagreement relating to the interpretation or application of the above‑mentioned Convention. 

ARTICLE III. 

This Agreement shall remain in force as long as the above‑mentioned Convention; provided, however, that any contracting State, a party to the present Agreement, may denounce it on one year’s notice given by it to the Government of the United States of America, which shall at once inform all other contracting States of such notice and withdrawal. 

ARTICLE IV. 

Pending the coming into force of the above‑mentioned Convention, all references to it herein, other than those contained in Article II, Section 2, and Article V, shall be deemed to be references to the Interim Agreement on International Civil Aviation drawn up at Chicago on December 7, 1944; and references to the International Civil Aviation Organization, the Assembly, and the Council shall be deemed to be references to the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization, the Interim Assembly, and Interim Council, respectively. 

ARTICLE V.
