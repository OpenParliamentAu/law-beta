## An Act providing for Arrangements with the States with respect to Aboriginal Affairs

WHEREAS by reason of an amendment made to the Constitution in the year 1967, certain powers to make laws for the benefit of the Aboriginal people of Australia in the States became vested in the Parliament:

AND WHEREAS the Australian Government, after consultation with the Governments of the States, proposes that those powers and other relevant powers be used to promote legislative and executive action under which the Australian Government will assume increased responsibilities for the development of the Aboriginal people of Australia including responsibilities for the planning, co‑ordination and financing of such activities as are designed to promote the economic, social and cultural advancement of that people and are at present the responsibility of the States and their authorities:

AND WHEREAS by reason of the foregoing it is necessary to make provision for enabling persons employed by the States to be appointed to the Australian Public Service and at the same time for permitting persons in the Australian Public Service to hold offices, and perform functions, under the laws of the States relating to Aboriginal affairs:

BE IT THEREFORE ENACTED by the Queen, the Senate and the House of Representatives of Australia, as follows:

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Rate of remuneration  [_see_ Notes 2 and 3]

             (1)  Subject to this section, the provisions of Division 6 of Part III of the Public Service Act relating to the reduction in, or suspension of, remuneration payable to an officer, the _Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act 1979_ and to any law providing for a reduction in the remuneration payable to officers of the Australian Public Service generally, the rate of remuneration of a State employee appointed or engaged under this Act shall, while he or she continues in the Australian Public Service, be not less favourable than that to which, in the opinion of the Board, he or she would have been entitled in respect of the normal position which he or she occupied as a State employee immediately before his or her appointment or engagement under this Act.

             (2)  Where, by virtue of subsection (1), the remuneration to which a person is entitled would or might be increased by reason of an increment of salary in respect of the normal position which he or she occupied as a State employee, his or her entitlement to the increase is subject to the provisions which, under subsections 31(4), (5) and (6), of the Public Service Act, apply to increments of salary referred to in subsection 31(1) of that Act.

             (1)  For the purpose of ensuring that the conditions of employment of a person appointed or engaged under this Act are, as far as possible, as favourable as those which, in the opinion of the Board, he or she enjoyed as a State employee, the Board may, notwithstanding anything in the Public Service Act or in any other law:

                     (a)  determine any conditions of employment that are to apply to him or her; or

                     (b)  determine that an allowance is payable to him or her as compensation, or both.
