## An Act for the Interpretation of Acts of Parliament and for Shortening their Language

## Part 1—Preliminary

##### <a id="1"></a>1  Short title [_see_ Note 1]

                   This Act may be cited as the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

##### <a id="1A"></a>1A  Simplified outline

                   The following is a simplified outline of this Act:

* * *

_Overview_

This Act is like a dictionary and manual to use when reading and interpreting Commonwealth Acts and instruments made under Commonwealth Acts.

The definitions and many of the interpretation rules are aimed at making Commonwealth legislation shorter, less complex and more consistent in operation.

A provision of this Act is subject to a contrary intention in other Commonwealth legislation.

_Structure_

Part 1 provides that this Act applies to all Acts. This Act also applies to legislative instruments and other instruments made under an Act (see subsection 13(1) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ and subsection 46(1) of this Act).

Part 2 contains definitions that apply across all Commonwealth legislation (for example, **_Australian citizen_**, **_business day_**, **_document_** and **_month_**).

Part 3 deals with the commencement of Commonwealth Acts. For example, section 4 allows certain powers to be exercised (like the making of appointments) between the enactment and commencement of an Act.

Part 4 deals with the amendment, repeal and expiry of Commonwealth legislation. For example, section 7 provides that the repeal of an Act does not affect any rights accrued under the Act, or any legal proceedings instituted, before the repeal.

Part 5 contains various rules for interpreting Commonwealth legislation, including:

               (a)     section 15A (about interpreting an Act subject to the Constitution); and

              (b)     section 15AA (which provides for interpreting an Act in a way that best achieves the purpose or object of the Act); and

               (c)     section 15AB (about using material that is not part of an Act (like explanatory memorandums and second reading speeches) in interpreting an Act); and

              (d)     sections 19 to 19C (which deal with references to Ministers, Departments and Secretaries of Departments and with administrative changes in the operation of the Commonwealth Government).

Part 6 deals with the service of documents on persons.

Part 7 contains rules about exercising powers and performing functions and duties under Commonwealth legislation, including:

               (a)     subsection 33(3) (which provides that a power to make an instrument includes the power to vary or revoke the instrument); and

              (b)     section 33A (about acting appointments); and

               (c)     sections 34AA, 34AB and 34A (about delegating powers, functions and duties).

Part 8 deals with the calculation of distance, time and age.

Part 9 deals with the citation of Acts.

Part 10 deals with non‑legislative instruments. For example, it provides that this Act applies to those instruments and that expressions in those instruments have the same meaning as in the enabling legislation.

Part 11 contains a regulation‑making power.

Example 1: A month starting on 15 December in a year ends immediately before 15 January in the next year.

Example 2: A month starting on 31 August in a year ends at the end of September in that year (because September is the calendar month coming after August and does not have 31 days).

Example 1: A reference to 6 months starting on 15 December in a year is a reference to a period starting on that day and ending immediately before 15 June in the next year.

Example 2: A reference to 6 months starting on 31 October in a year is a reference to a period starting on that day and ending at the end of April in the next year (because April is the calendar month coming sixth after October and does not have 31 days).

##### <a id="3"></a>3  When Acts come into operation

                   If an Act or a provision of an Act is expressed to come into operation on a particular day (whether the expression “come into operation” or “commence” is used), it shall come into operation immediately on the expiration of the last preceding day.

##### <a id="3A"></a>3A  Commencement of Acts

             (1)  This section does not apply to an Act so far as it provides for its commencement.

             (3)  An Act to alter the Constitution commences on the day on which that Act receives the Royal Assent.

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Exercise of powers between enactment and commencement of Act

Application of section

             (1)  This section applies if an Act is enacted and at a time (the **_start time_**) after its enactment the Act will confer power to make an appointment, or to make an instrument of a legislative or administrative character (including rules, regulations or by‑laws), because:

                     (a)  the Act will commence at the start time; or

                     (b)  the Act will be amended at the start time by an Act that has been enacted and that commences at that time.

Exercise of power before start time

             (2)  The power may be exercised before the start time as if the relevant commencement had occurred.

             (3)  Anything may be done before the start time for the purpose of enabling the exercise of the power, or of bringing the appointment or instrument into effect, as if the relevant commencement had occurred.

             (4)  The exercise of a power under subsection (2) does not confer a power or right or impose an obligation on a person before the relevant commencement except so far as is necessary or convenient for the purpose of:

                     (a)  bringing the appointment or instrument into effect; or

                     (b)  bringing the Act conferring power into operation; or

                     (c)  making the Act conferring power fully effective at or after the start time.

             (5)  An appointment, or a provision of an instrument, made under subsection (2) takes effect at the start time or a later time specified in the appointment or instrument.

One instrument may rely on subsection (2) and existing power

             (6)  To avoid doubt, a single instrument may be made before the start time partly under subsection (2) and partly under a power already conferred by an Act.

Extended application to provisions of an Act

             (7)  Subsections (1) to (6) also apply in relation to a provision of an Act in the same way as they apply in relation to an Act.

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Evidence of date of assent

                   The date appearing on the copy of an Act printed by the Government Printer, and purporting to be the date on which the Governor‑General assented thereto, or made known the Sovereign’s assent, shall be evidence that such date was the date on which the Governor‑General so assented or made known the Sovereign’s assent, and shall be judicially noticed.

## Part 4—Amendment, repeal and expiry of Acts

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Effect of repeal or amendment of Act

No revival of other Act or part

             (1)  The repeal of an Act, or of a part of an Act, that repealed an Act (the **_old Act_**) or part (the **_old part_**) of an Act does not revive the old Act or old part, unless express provision is made for the revival.

No effect on previous operation of Act or part

             (2)  If an Act, or an instrument under an Act, repeals or amends an Act (the **_affected Act_**) or a part of an Act, then the repeal or amendment does not:

                     (a)  revive anything not in force or existing at the time at which the repeal or amendment takes effect; or

                     (b)  affect the previous operation of the affected Act or part (including any amendment made by the affected Act or part), or anything duly done or suffered under the affected Act or part; or

                     (c)  affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued or incurred under the affected Act or part; or

                     (d)  affect any penalty, forfeiture or punishment incurred in respect of any offence committed against the affected Act or part; or

                     (e)  affect any investigation, legal proceeding or remedy in respect of any such right, privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment.

Any such investigation, legal proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or enforced, and any such penalty, forfeiture or punishment may be imposed, as if the affected Act or part had not been repealed or amended.

Note:          The Act that makes the repeal or amendment, or provides for the instrument to make the repeal or amendment, may be different from, or the same as, the affected Act or the Act containing the part repealed or amended.

Interpretation

             (3)  A reference in subsection (1) or (2) to the repeal or amendment of an Act or of a part of an Act includes a reference to:

                   Where an Act contains a reference to a short title that is or was provided by law for the citation of another Act as originally enacted, or of another Act as amended, then:

                     (a)  the reference shall be construed as a reference to that other Act as originally enacted and as amended from time to time; and

                     (b)  where that other Act has been repealed and re‑enacted, with or without modifications, the reference shall be construed as including a reference to the re‑enacted Act as originally enacted and as amended from time to time; and

                     (b)  where that law has been repealed and re‑enacted or re‑made, with or without modifications, the reference shall be construed as including a reference to the re‑enacted or re‑made law as originally enacted or made and as amended from time to time; and

                     (c)  if a provision of that law is repealed and re‑enacted or re‑made (including where that law is repealed and re‑enacted or re‑made), with or without modifications, a reference to the repealed provision extends to any corresponding re‑enacted or re‑made provision.

##### <a id="11"></a>11  Acts may be altered etc. in same session

##### <a id="11A"></a>11A  Inserting definitions into provisions or inserting items into lists or tables

Inserting definitions

             (1)  If an amending Act inserts a definition in a provision of the Act being amended, but does not specify the position in that provision where it is to be inserted, it is to be inserted in the appropriate alphabetical position, determined on a letter‑by‑letter basis.

Inserting items into lists or tables

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  an amending Act inserts an item into a list or table in a provision of the Act being amended, but does not specify the position in the list or table where the item is to be inserted; and

                     (b)  immediately before the insertion, the list or table was arranged alphabetically;

the item is inserted in the appropriate alphabetical position, determined on a letter‑by‑letter basis.

##### <a id="11B"></a>11B  Amending Act to be construed with amended Act

             (1)  Every Act amending another Act must be construed with the other Act as part of the other Act.

             (2)  If:

                     (b)  a provision (the **_non‑amending provision_**) of the amending Act does not amend the principal Act, but relates to an amendment of the principal Act made by another provision of the amending Act; and

                     (c)  a term is used in the non‑amending provision that has a particular meaning in the principal Act or in a provision of the principal Act amended or included by the amending Act;

then the term has that meaning in the non‑amending provision.

Note:          Subsection (2) covers, for example, application, transitional and saving items in a Schedule to an amending Act that relate to amendments of a principal Act made by other items in the Schedule.

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not limit subsection (1).

## Part 5—General interpretation rules

             (1)  All material from and including the first section of an Act to the end of:

                     (a)  if there are no Schedules to the Act—the last section of the Act; or

##### <a id="15A"></a>15A  Construction of Acts to be subject to Constitution

                   Every Act shall be read and construed subject to the Constitution, and so as not to exceed the legislative power of the Commonwealth, to the intent that where any enactment thereof would, but for this section, have been construed as being in excess of that power, it shall nevertheless be a valid enactment to the extent to which it is not in excess of that power.

##### <a id="15AA"></a>15AA  Interpretation best achieving Act’s purpose or object

                   In interpreting a provision of an Act, the interpretation that would best achieve the purpose or object of the Act (whether or not that purpose or object is expressly stated in the Act) is to be preferred to each other interpretation.

##### <a id="15AB"></a>15AB  Use of extrinsic material in the interpretation of an Act

             (1)  Subject to subsection (3), in the interpretation of a provision of an Act, if any material not forming part of the Act is capable of assisting in the ascertainment of the meaning of the provision, consideration may be given to that material:

                     (a)  to confirm that the meaning of the provision is the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision taking into account its context in the Act and the purpose or object underlying the Act; or

                     (b)  to determine the meaning of the provision when:

                              (i)  the provision is ambiguous or obscure; or

                             (ii)  the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision taking into account its context in the Act and the purpose or object underlying the Act leads to a result that is manifestly absurd or is unreasonable.

             (2)  Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), the material that may be considered in accordance with that subsection in the interpretation of a provision of an Act includes:

                     (a)  all matters not forming part of the Act that are set out in the document containing the text of the Act as printed by the Government Printer;

                     (b)  any relevant report of a Royal Commission, Law Reform Commission, committee of inquiry or other similar body that was laid before either House of the Parliament before the time when the provision was enacted;

                     (c)  any relevant report of a committee of the Parliament or of either House of the Parliament that was made to the Parliament or that House of the Parliament before the time when the provision was enacted;

                     (d)  any treaty or other international agreement that is referred to in the Act;

                     (e)  any explanatory memorandum relating to the Bill containing the provision, or any other relevant document, that was laid before, or furnished to the members of, either House of the Parliament by a Minister before the time when the provision was enacted;

                      (f)  the speech made to a House of the Parliament by a Minister on the occasion of the moving by that Minister of a motion that the Bill containing the provision be read a second time in that House;

                     (g)  any document (whether or not a document to which a preceding paragraph applies) that is declared by the Act to be a relevant document for the purposes of this section; and

                     (h)  any relevant material in the Journals of the Senate, in the Votes and Proceedings of the House of Representatives or in any official record of debates in the Parliament or either House of the Parliament.

             (3)  In determining whether consideration should be given to any material in accordance with subsection (1), or in considering the weight to be given to any such material, regard shall be had, in addition to any other relevant matters, to:

                     (a)  the desirability of persons being able to rely on the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision taking into account its context in the Act and the purpose or object underlying the Act; and

                     (b)  the need to avoid prolonging legal or other proceedings without compensating advantage.

##### <a id="15AC"></a>15AC  Changes to style not to affect meaning

                   Where:

                     (a)  an Act has expressed an idea in a particular form of words; and

                     (b)  a later Act appears to have expressed the same idea in a different form of words for the purpose of using a clearer style;

the ideas shall not be taken to be different merely because different forms of words were used.

##### <a id="15AD"></a>15AD  Examples

                   If an Act includes an example of the operation of a provision:

                     (a)  the example is not exhaustive; and

                     (b)  the example may extend the operation of the provision.

##### <a id="15AE"></a>15AE  Legislative instruments etc.

Instruments that are described as legislative instruments

             (1)  If a provision of a law requires or permits an instrument that is described as a legislative instrument to be made, then an instrument made under that provision:

(a)  must be in writing; and

                     (b)  is a legislative instrument for the purposes of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_.

             (2)  However, the fact that a provision of a law requires or permits an instrument that is described as a legislative instrument to be made does not imply that an instrument made under that provision is or must be of legislative character (within the ordinary meaning of that term).

Instruments that are described as not being legislative instruments

             (3)  If a provision of a law requires or permits an instrument that is described as not being a legislative instrument to be made, then an instrument made under that provision is not a legislative instrument for the purposes of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_.

             (4)  However, the fact that a provision of a law requires or permits an instrument that is described as not being a legislative instrument to be made does not imply that an instrument made under that provision is not, or must not be, of legislative character (within the ordinary meaning of that term).

No inference to be drawn from express statements

             (5)  In determining whether an instrument made under a provision of a law is a legislative instrument for the purposes of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_, no inference may be drawn from the fact that an instrument made under another provision of that or any other law is described as a legislative instrument, or as not being a legislative instrument.

Example:    In determining whether a Ministerial direction under a provision is a legislative instrument, no inference may be drawn from the fact that a Ministerial direction under another provision is described as being a legislative instrument.

Meaning of **may**

          (2A)  Where an Act assented to after the commencement of this subsection provides that a person, court or body may do a particular act or thing, and the word **_may_** is used, the act or thing may be done at the discretion of the person, court or body.

Powers, functions and duties of bodies not affected by membership vacancies

          (2B)  Where an Act confers a power or function, or imposes a duty, on a body, whether incorporated or unincorporated, the exercise of the power or the performance of the function or duty is not affected merely because of a vacancy or vacancies in the membership of the body.

Power to make instrument includes power to vary or revoke etc. instrument

             (3)  Where an Act confers a power to make, grant or issue any instrument of a legislative or administrative character (including rules, regulations or by‑laws) the power shall be construed as including a power exercisable in the like manner and subject to the like conditions (if any) to repeal, rescind, revoke, amend, or vary any such instrument.

       (3AA)  If a condition (the **_ongoing condition_**):

                     (a)  must be satisfied before the making, granting or issuing of an instrument; and

                     (b)  is capable of ceasing to be satisfied after the making, granting or issuing of the instrument;

subsection (3) has effect, in relation to the repeal, rescission or revocation of the instrument, as if the reference to like conditions (to the extent that the reference relates to the ongoing condition) were a reference to the ongoing condition ceasing to be satisfied.

Example:    A Minister may give a person a written permission if, among other things, the Minister is satisfied the person is of good character.

                   This condition is capable of ceasing to be satisfied after the giving of the permission.

                   The Minister may repeal, rescind or revoke the permission in the like manner if the Minister ceases to be satisfied that the person is of good character.

Scope of powers in respect of matters

          (3A)  Where an Act confers a power to make, grant or issue any instrument of a legislative or administrative character (including rules, regulations or by‑laws) with respect to particular matters (however the matters are described), the power shall be construed as including a power to make, grant or issue such an instrument with respect to some only of those matters or with respect to a particular class or particular classes of those matters and to make different provision with respect to different matters or different classes of matters.

       (3AB)  If an Act confers on a person or authority the power to make an instrument (except a legislative instrument or a rule of court):

                     (a)  specifying, declaring or prescribing a matter; or

                     (b)  doing anything in relation to a matter;

then, in exercising the power, the person or authority may identify the matter by reference to a class or classes of matters.

Note:          This provision has a parallel, in relation to legislative instruments, in section 13 of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_.

       (3AC)  For the purposes of subsections (3A) and (3AB), **_matter_** includes thing, person and animal.

          (3B)  Where an Act confers a power to make, grant or issue any instrument of a legislative or administrative character (including rules, regulations or by‑laws), the power shall not be taken, by implication, not to include the power to make provision for or in relation to a particular aspect of a matter by reason only that provision is made by the Act in relation to another aspect of that matter or in relation to another matter.

Power to make appointment to an office or place

             (4)  Where an Act confers upon any person or authority a power to make appointments to any office or place, the power shall be construed as including a power to appoint a person to act in the office or place until:

                     (a)  a person is appointed to the office or place; or

                     (b)  the expiration of 12 months after the office or place was created or became vacant, as the case requires:

whichever first happens, and as also including a power to remove or suspend any person appointed, and to appoint another person temporarily in the place of any person so suspended or in place of any sick or absent holder of such office or place:

     Provided that where the power of such person or authority to make any such appointment is only exercisable upon the recommendation or subject to the approval or consent of some other person or authority, such power to make an appointment to act in an office or place or such power of removal shall only be exercisable upon the recommendation or subject to the approval or consent of such other person or authority.

Power to make instrument prescribing penalties

             (5)  Where an Act confers a power to make, grant or issue an instrument (including rules, regulations or by‑laws) prescribing penalties not exceeding a specified amount or imprisonment for a specified period, that limitation on the penalties that may be prescribed does not prevent the instrument from requiring the making of a statutory declaration.

##### <a id="33AA"></a>33AA  Power to appoint includes power to reappoint

                   If an Act confers on a person or body a power to make an appointment, the power is taken to include a power of reappointment.

##### <a id="33AB"></a>33AB  Validity of things done under appointments under Acts

                   Anything done by or in relation to a person purporting to act under an appointment (including an acting appointment) under an Act is not invalid merely because:

                     (a)  for any appointment—the occasion for the appointment had not arisen; or

                     (b)  for any appointment—there was a defect or irregularity in connection with the appointment; or

## Part 10—Non‑legislative instruments and resolutions

##### <a id="46"></a>46  Construction of instruments

             (1)  If a provision confers on an authority the power to make an instrument that is neither a legislative instrument for the purposes of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ nor a rule of court, then:

                     (a)  this Act applies to any instrument so made as if it were an Act and as if each provision of the instrument were a section of an Act; and

                     (b)  expressions used in any instrument so made have the same meaning as in the enabling legislation as in force from time to time; and

                     (c)  any instrument so made is to be read and construed subject to the enabling legislation as in force from time to time, and so as not to exceed the power of the authority.

             (2)  If any instrument so made would, but for this subsection, be construed as being in excess of the authority’s power, it is to be taken to be a valid instrument to the extent to which it is not in excess of that power.

Note:         This provision has a parallel, in relation to legislative instruments, in section 13 of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_.

##### <a id="46AA"></a>46AA  Prescribing matters by reference to other instruments

             (1)  If legislation authorises or requires provision to be made in 
 relation to any matter in an instrument that is neither a legislative instrument for the purposes of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ nor a rule of court, that instrument may make provision in relation to that matter:

                     (a)  by applying, adopting or incorporating, with or without modification, the provisions of any Act, or of any disallowable legislative instrument for the purposes of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_, as in force at a particular time or as in force from time to time; or

                     (b)  subject to subsection (2), by applying, adopting or incorporating, with or without modification, any matter contained in any other instrument or writing as in force or existing at the time when the first‑mentioned instrument takes effect.

             (2)  The instrument may not make provision in relation to that matter by applying, adopting or incorporating any matter contained in an instrument or other writing as in force or existing from time to time.

Note:         This provision has a parallel, in relation to legislative instruments, in section 14 of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_.

##### <a id="46B"></a>46B  Disallowable non‑legislative instruments

             (1)  This section applies to instruments:

                     (a)  that are neither legislative instruments for the purposes of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ nor rules of court; and

                     (b)  that are made under a provision of an Act or legislative instrument (the **_enabling_ _provision_**); and

                     (c)  that are expressly declared by the enabling provision or by another provision of the Act or instrument to be disallowable instruments for the purposes of this section.

             (2)  An instrument to which this section applies that is made on or after the commencing day for the purposes of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_, or a particular provision of such an instrument, takes effect from:

                     (a)  the day specified in the instrument for the purposes of the commencement of the instrument or provision; or

                     (b)  the day and time specified in the instrument for the purposes of the commencement of the instrument or provision; or

                     (c)  the day, or day and time, of the commencement of an Act, or of a provision of an Act, or of the occurrence of an event, that is specified in the instrument for the purposes of the commencement of the instrument or provision; or

                     (d)  in any other case—the first moment of the day next following the day of notification under subsection (5).

             (3)  An instrument to which this section applies, or a provision of such an instrument, has no effect if, apart from this subsection, it would take effect before the date of its notification under subsection (5) and as a result:

                     (a)  the rights of a person (other than the Commonwealth or an authority of the Commonwealth) as at the date of notification would be affected so as to disadvantage that person; or

                     (b)  liabilities would be imposed on a person (other than the Commonwealth or an authority of the Commonwealth) in respect of anything done or omitted to be done before the date of notification.

             (4)  The effect of subsections (2) and (3) on an instrument is subject to any contrary provision for commencement of the instrument in the enabling legislation for the instrument if the enabling legislation is an Act or a provision of an Act.

             (5)  An instrument to which this section applies must be notified in the _Gazette_ and, if the instrument is not so notified by being published in full in the _Gazette_, a notice in the _Gazette_ of the instrument’s having been made, and of the place or places where copies of it can be purchased, is sufficient compliance with that requirement.

             (6)  If a notice of the making of an instrument is published in accordance with subsection (5), copies of the instrument must, at the time of publication of the notice or as soon as practicable thereafter, be made available for purchase at the place, or at each of the places, specified in the notice.

             (7)  If, on the day of publication of a notice referred to in subsection (5), there are no copies of the instrument to which the notice relates available for purchase at the place, or at one or more of the places, specified in the notice, the Minister administering the enabling provision must cause to be laid before each House of the Parliament, within 15 sitting days of that House after that day, a statement that copies of the instrument were not so available and the reason why they were not so available.

             (8)  Failure to comply with a requirement of subsection (6) or (7) in relation to any instrument does not constitute a failure to comply with subsection (5).

             (9)  A copy of an instrument to which this section applies must be laid before each House of the Parliament not later than 6 sitting days of that House after the instrument is made and, for that purpose, must be delivered to the House by the person or body authorised to make the instrument.

           (10)  If a copy of an instrument is not laid before each House of the Parliament in accordance with subsection (9), it thereupon ceases to have effect.

           (11)  Unless the law otherwise provides, Part 5 of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_, other than sections 38, 39, 40 and 44, applies in relation to an instrument to which this section applies as if:

                    (aa)  the reference in section 37 of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ to registered were omitted, and the note to that section were repealed; and

                     (a)  references to legislative instruments or to a legislative instrument were references to an instrument to which this section applies; and

                     (b)  references to enabling legislation were references to the enabling provision; and

                     (c)  references to repeal were references to revocation; and

                    (ca)  references to registered were references to made; and

                   (cb)  references to subsection 38(1) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ were references to subsection (9) of this section; and

                    (cc)  references to subsection 38(3) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ were references to subsection (10) of this section; and

                     (d)  references in subsection 45(2) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ to another legislative instrument included references to a provision of another non‑legislative instrument made under the enabling provision.

##### <a id="47"></a>47  Construction of resolutions

                   Where any resolution is or has been passed by either House of the Parliament in purported pursuance of any Act, then the resolution shall be read and construed subject to the Constitution and to the Act under which it purports to have been passed, to the intent that where the resolution would, but for this section, have been construed as being in excess of authority, it shall nevertheless be a valid resolution to the extent to which it is not in excess of authority.

## Part 11—Regulations

### Application, saving or transitional provisions

_Acts Interpretation Amendment Act 1998 (No. 125, 1998)_

## Schedule 1

## 2  Validation of past authorisations

If a Minister (the **_authorising Minister_**) purported, before the commencement of this item, to give to another Minister or member of the Executive Council an authorisation to act on behalf of the authorising Minister in the performance of functions or duties, or the exercise of powers, that the authorising Minister was empowered to perform or exercise under an Act or a provision of an Act or under an instrument (including a regulation, rule or Proclamation) having effect under or for the purposes of such an Act or provision:

                     (a)  the authorisation is taken to have been validly given; and

                     (b)  if the authorisation continues in force after that commencement, the authorising Minister may at any time, by writing, revoke the authorisation.

## 5  Validation of past acts

Any act that a Minister purported to do before the commencement of this Act on behalf of another Minister in the purported performance of a function or duty or the purported exercise of a power conferred on the other Minister by an Act or by an instrument (including a regulation, rule or Proclamation) having effect under or for the purposes of an Act is taken to have been as valid as it would have been if:

                     (a)  the amendment of subsection 19A(1) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ made by item 4 had been in force when the purported act was done; and

                     (b)  the purported act had been done by the first‑mentioned Minister under that subsection as amended by that item.

## 7  Validation of past orders

(1)       Any order that the Governor‑General purported to make before the commencement of item 6 under paragraph 19BA(1)(c) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ is taken to have been, at all times before that commencement when the order purported to be in force, as valid as it would have been if the amendment made by that item had been in force when the purported order was made.

(2)       If an order that the Governor‑General purported to make before the commencement of item 6 under paragraph 19BA(1)(c) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ purported to be in force immediately before that commencement, the purported order has the effect after that commencement that it would have if the amendment made by that item had been in force when the purported order was made.

                     (g)  references to an office in a particular Department or Statutory Agency include references to a position occupied by an APS employee in that Department or Statutory Agency.

             (2)  If a reference in a statutory instrument to “the Department” is read as a reference to a particular Department because of subsection 19A(3) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_, then that reference to “the Department” is a reference to a particular Department for the purposes of this section.

_Legislative Instruments (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 2003 (No. 140, 2003)_

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Transitional provisions

             (1)  If legislation introduced into the Parliament before the commencing day but commencing on or after that day:

                     (a)  authorises an instrument to be made in the exercise of a power delegated by the Parliament; and

                     (b)  is expressed to require that instrument to be published as a statutory rule under the _Statutory Rules Publication Act 1903_;

any instrument so made is taken to be an instrument referred to in paragraph 6(b) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ despite the repeal by this  Act  of the _Statutory Rules Publication Act 1903_.

             (2)  If legislation introduced into the Parliament before the commencing day but commencing on or after that day:

                     (a)  authorises an instrument to be made in the exercise of a power delegated by the Parliament; and

                     (b)  is expressed to declare that instrument to be a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_;

any instrument so made is taken to be an instrument referred to in subparagraph 6(d)(i) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ despite the repeal by this Act of section 46A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

             (3)  If legislation that is in force immediately before the commencing day or that is introduced into the Parliament before that day but that commences on or after that day:

                     (a)  authorised or authorises an instrument to be made in the exercise of a power delegated by the Parliament that adversely affects the rights of a person, or results in the imposition of liabilities on a person; and

                     (b)  provided or provides that the instrument has effect, to the extent that it adversely affects those rights or results in the imposition of those liabilities, despite subsection 48(2) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_, before the date of its notification in the _Gazette_;

that legislation is to be construed, on and after the commencing day or the day of its commencement, whichever last occurs, as if it had provided instead that the instrument, to the extent that it adversely affects those rights or results in the imposition of those liabilities, has effect, despite subsection 12(2) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_, before its registration under that Act.

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  legislation (the **_enabling legislation_**) in force immediately before the commencing day:

                              (i)  authorises the making of an instrument; and

                             (ii)  does not declare such an instrument to be a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ but nonetheless makes provision for its disallowance by the application, with or without modification, of the provisions of Part XII of that Act; and

                     (b)  an instrument is made in the exercise of that authority on or after the commencing day; and

                     (c)  the instrument is not a legislative instrument for the purposes of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ or otherwise;

the enabling legislation has effect, on and after the commencing day, as if:

                     (d)  it had declared such instruments to be disallowable instruments for the purposes of section 46B of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_; and

                     (e)  it had provided for such modifications of the operation of that section as are necessary to ensure that the effect of the applied provisions of Part XII of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ is preserved.

             (5)  In this section:

                    <a name="commenc-dai"></a>**_commencing day_** means the commencing day within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003._

_Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Act 2005 (No. 8, 2005)_

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Saving of matters in Part 2 of Schedule 1

             (1)  If:
