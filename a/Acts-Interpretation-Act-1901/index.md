## An Act for the Interpretation of Acts of Parliament and for Shortening their Language

## Part I—Preliminary

##### <a id="1"></a>1  Short title [_see_ Note 1]

                   This Act may be cited as the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

##### <a id="2"></a>2  Application of Act

             (1)  Except so far as the contrary intention appears, this Act applies to all Acts, including this Act.

             (2)  This Act shall bind the Crown.

## Part II—Commencement of Acts

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Meaning of _commencement_ 

             (1)  In every Act, **_commencement_**, in relation to an Act or a provision of an Act, means the time at which the Act or provision comes into operation.

             (2)  Where an Act, or any instrument (including any rules regulations or by-laws) made granted or issued under a power conferred by an Act, is expressed to come into operation on a particular day (whether the expression “come into operation” or “commence” is used), it shall come into operation immediately on the expiration of the last preceding day.

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Exercise of certain powers between passing and commencing of Act

             (1)  Where an Act (in this section referred to as the Act concerned), being:

                     (a)  an Act enacted on or after the date of commencement of this section that is not to come into operation immediately upon its enactment; or

                     (b)  an Act enacted before the date of commencement of this section that did not come into operation on or before that date;

is expressed to confer power, or to amend another Act in such a manner that the other Act, as amended, will confer power, to make an appointment or to make an instrument of a legislative or administrative character (including rules, regulations or by-laws), then, unless the contrary intention appears, the power may be exercised, and anything may be done for the purpose of enabling the exercise of the power or of bringing the appointment or instrument into effect, before the Act concerned comes into operation as if it had come into operation.

          (1A)  Where:

                     (a)  an Act that is in operation (in this subsection called the **_parent Act_**) is expressed to confer power to make an instrument of a legislative or administrative character (including rules, regulations or by-laws); and

                     (b)  the Act concerned is expressed to amend the parent Act in such a manner that the parent Act, as amended, will confer additional power to make such an instrument;

then, unless the contrary intention appears:

                     (c)  the powers mentioned in paragraphs (a) and (b) may be exercised by making a single instrument; and

                     (d)  such an instrument is to be treated as made under subsection (1) so far as any provisions contained in it required an exercise of the additional power mentioned in paragraph (b).

             (2)  An appointment made under subsection (1) takes effect:

                     (a)  on the day specified in the appointment, being a day that is not earlier than the day on which the Act concerned comes into operation; or

                     (b)  if a day is not specified in the appointment—on the day on which the Act concerned comes into operation.

          (2A)  Where, because of some or all of its provisions (in this subsection called the **_relevant provisions_**), an instrument is made under subsection (1), each relevant provision takes effect, as declared in the instrument:

                     (a)  on a specified date that is not earlier than the date when the Act concerned comes into operation; or

                     (b)  from a specified time on a specified date that is not earlier than the date and time when the Act concerned comes into operation; or

                     (c)  on the date, or from the date and time, when the Act concerned comes into operation.

             (3)  Where an Act is to come into operation on a date to be fixed by a Proclamation or other instrument, the Proclamation or other instrument may be made and published at any time after the enactment of the Act.

             (4)  Where this section applies to an Act by reason of the fact that that Act is expressed to amend another Act in the manner referred to in subsection (1) and that other Act has not come into operation, this section has effect as if the references in subsections (1), (2) and (2A) to the coming into operation of the Act concerned were references to the coming into operation of the other Act as amended by the Act concerned.

             (5)  In subsections (1), (1A), (2), (2A), (3) and (4) a reference to an Act shall be read as including a reference to any provision or provisions of an Act.

             (6)  In the application of this section to an instrument of a legislative character (including such an instrument made by virtue of this section):

                     (a)  references in this section to the enactment of an Act are to be read as references to the making of such an instrument; and

                     (b)  references in this section to an Act other than the Act concerned are to be read as references to instruments of a legislative character.

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Commencement of Acts

             (1)  Every Act to which the Royal Assent has been given by the Governor-General for and on behalf of the King on or before 31 December 1937, shall be deemed to have come into operation on the day on which that Act received the Royal Assent, unless the contrary intention appears in the Act.

          (1A)  Every Act (other than an Act to alter the Constitution) to which the Royal Assent is given by the Governor-General for and on behalf of the King on or after 1 January 1938, shall come into operation on the twenty-eighth day after the day on which that Act receives the Royal Assent, unless the contrary intention appears in the Act.

          (1B)  Every Act to alter the Constitution to which the Royal Assent is given by the Governor-General for and on behalf of the King on or after 1 January 1938, shall come into operation on the day on which that Act receives the Royal Assent, unless the contrary intention appears in that Act.

             (2)  Every Act reserved for the signification of the King’s pleasure thereon shall come into operation on the day on which His Majesty’s assent is proclaimed in the _Gazette_ by the Governor-General, unless the contrary intention appears in such Act.

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Evidence of date of assent or proclamation

                   The date appearing on the copy of an Act printed by the Government Printer, and purporting to be the date on which the Governor-General assented thereto, or made known the King’s assent, shall be evidence that such date was the date on which the Governor-General so assented or made known the King’s assent, and shall be judicially noticed.

## Part III—Repeal and expiration of Acts

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Effect of repeal of Act

                   The repeal of an Act or part thereof by which a previous Act or part thereof was repealed shall not have the effect of reviving such last-mentioned Act or part thereof without express words.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Effect of repeal

                     (a)  revive anything not in force or existing at the time at which the repeal takes effect; or

                     (b)  affect the previous operation of any Act so repealed, or anything duly done or suffered under any Act so repealed; or

                     (c)  affect any right privilege obligation or liability acquired accrued or incurred under any Act so repealed; or

                     (d)  affect any penalty forfeiture or punishment incurred in respect of any offence committed against any Act so repealed; or

and any such investigation legal proceeding or remedy may be instituted continued or enforced, and any such penalty forfeiture or punishment may be imposed, as if the repealing Act had not been passed.

##### <a id="8A"></a>8A  Implied repeals etc.

                   A reference in section 7 or 8 to the repeal of an Act or of a part of an Act includes a reference to:

                     (a)  a repeal effected by implication;

                     (b)  the abrogation or limitation of the effect of the Act or part; and

                     (c)  the exclusion of the application of the Act or part to any person, subject-matter or circumstance.

##### <a id="8B"></a>8B  Effect of expiration of Act

                   Where an Act or a part of an Act expires, lapses or otherwise ceases to have effect, sections 7 and 8 apply as if the Act or part had been repealed by another Act.

##### <a id="8C"></a>8C  References to part of an Act

                   A reference in section 7, 8, 8A or 8B to a part of an Act includes a reference to any provision of, or words, figures, drawings or symbols in, an Act.

##### <a id="14A"></a>14A  Definitions inserted by amending Act

                   Every Act amending another Act shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be construed with such other Act and as part thereof.

##### <a id="15A"></a>15A  Construction of Acts to be subject to Constitution

                   Every Act shall be read and construed subject to the Constitution, and so as not to exceed the legislative power of the Commonwealth, to the intent that where any enactment thereof would, but for this section, have been construed as being in excess of that power, it shall nevertheless be a valid enactment to the extent to which it is not in excess of that power.

##### <a id="15AA"></a>15AA  Regard to be had to purpose or object of Act

             (1)  In the interpretation of a provision of an Act, a construction that would promote the purpose or object underlying the Act (whether that purpose or object is expressly stated in the Act or not) shall be preferred to a construction that would not promote that purpose or object.

##### <a id="15AB"></a>15AB  Use of extrinsic material in the interpretation of an Act

             (1)  Subject to subsection (3), in the interpretation of a provision of an Act, if any material not forming part of the Act is capable of assisting in the ascertainment of the meaning of the provision, consideration may be given to that material:

                     (a)  to confirm that the meaning of the provision is the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision taking into account its context in the Act and the purpose or object underlying the Act; or

                     (b)  to determine the meaning of the provision when:

                              (i)  the provision is ambiguous or obscure; or

                             (ii)  the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision taking into account its context in the Act and the purpose or object underlying the Act leads to a result that is manifestly absurd or is unreasonable.

             (2)  Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), the material that may be considered in accordance with that subsection in the interpretation of a provision of an Act includes:

                     (a)  all matters not forming part of the Act that are set out in the document containing the text of the Act as printed by the Government Printer;

                     (b)  any relevant report of a Royal Commission, Law Reform Commission, committee of inquiry or other similar body that was laid before either House of the Parliament before the time when the provision was enacted;

                     (c)  any relevant report of a committee of the Parliament or of either House of the Parliament that was made to the Parliament or that House of the Parliament before the time when the provision was enacted;

                     (d)  any treaty or other international agreement that is referred to in the Act;

                     (e)  any explanatory memorandum relating to the Bill containing the provision, or any other relevant document, that was laid before, or furnished to the members of, either House of the Parliament by a Minister before the time when the provision was enacted;

                      (f)  the speech made to a House of the Parliament by a Minister on the occasion of the moving by that Minister of a motion that the Bill containing the provision be read a second time in that House;

                     (g)  any document (whether or not a document to which a preceding paragraph applies) that is declared by the Act to be a relevant document for the purposes of this section; and

                     (h)  any relevant material in the Journals of the Senate, in the Votes and Proceedings of the House of Representatives or in any official record of debates in the Parliament or either House of the Parliament.

             (3)  In determining whether consideration should be given to any material in accordance with subsection (1), or in considering the weight to be given to any such material, regard shall be had, in addition to any other relevant matters, to:

                     (a)  the desirability of persons being able to rely on the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision taking into account its context in the Act and the purpose or object underlying the Act; and

                     (b)  the need to avoid prolonging legal or other proceedings without compensating advantage.

##### <a id="15AC"></a>15AC  Changes to style not to affect meaning

                   Where:

                     (a)  an Act has expressed an idea in a particular form of words; and

                     (b)  a later Act appears to have expressed the same idea in a different form of words for the purpose of using a clearer style;

the ideas shall not be taken to be different merely because different forms of words were used.

##### <a id="15AD"></a>15AD  Examples

                   Where an Act includes an example of the operation of a provision:

                     (a)  the example shall not be taken to be exhaustive; and

                     (b)  if the example is inconsistent with the provision, the provision prevails.

##### <a id="15AE"></a>15AE  Legislative instruments etc.

Instruments that are described as legislative instruments

             (1)  If a provision of a law requires or permits an instrument that is described as a legislative instrument to be made, then an instrument made under that provision:

(a)  must be in writing; and

                     (b)  is a legislative instrument for the purposes of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_.

             (2)  However, the fact that a provision of a law requires or permits an instrument that is described as a legislative instrument to be made does not imply that an instrument made under that provision is or must be of legislative character (within the ordinary meaning of that term).

Instruments that are described as not being legislative instruments

             (3)  If a provision of a law requires or permits an instrument that is described as not being a legislative instrument to be made, then an instrument made under that provision is not a legislative instrument for the purposes of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_.

             (4)  However, the fact that a provision of a law requires or permits an instrument that is described as not being a legislative instrument to be made does not imply that an instrument made under that provision is not, or must not be, of legislative character (within the ordinary meaning of that term).

No inference to be drawn from express statements

             (5)  In determining whether an instrument made under a provision of a law is a legislative instrument for the purposes of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_, no inference may be drawn from the fact that an instrument made under another provision of that or any other law is described as a legislative instrument, or as not being a legislative instrument.

Example:    In determining whether a Ministerial direction under a provision is a legislative instrument, no inference may be drawn from the fact that a Ministerial direction under another provision is described as being a legislative instrument.

Definition

             (6)  In this section:

                    <a name="law"></a>**_law_** means an Act or regulations or any other instrument made under an Act.

##### <a id="15B"></a>15B  Application of Acts in coastal sea

             (1)  Except so far as the contrary intention appears:

                     (a)  the provisions of every Act, whether passed before or after the commencement of this section, shall be taken to have effect in and in relation to the coastal sea of Australia as if the coastal sea of Australia were part of Australia; and

                     (b)  any reference in an Act, whether passed before or after the commencement of this section, to Australia or to the Commonwealth shall be read as including a reference to the coastal sea of Australia.

             (2)  Except so far as the contrary intention appears:

                     (a)  the provisions of an Act, whether passed before or after the commencement of this section, that are in force in an external Territory shall be taken to have effect in and in relation to the coastal sea of the Territory as if the coastal sea of the Territory were part of the Territory; and

                     (b)  any reference in an Act, whether passed before or after the commencement of this section, to all or any of the external Territories (whether or not a particular Territory or particular Territories is or are referred to) shall be read as including a reference to the coastal sea of any Territory to which the reference relates.

             (3)  Nothing in subsection (1) or (2) shall be taken as limiting the operation that any Act had before the commencement of this section.

             (4)  In this section, **_coastal sea_**:

                     (d)  any relevant earlier law.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply to:

                     (b)  a reference in the _Corporations (Repeals, Consequentials and Transitionals) Act 2001_; or

                     (b)  the question whether a part, provision or provisions of the old ASIC legislation **_corresponds_** to a part, provision or provisions of the new ASIC legislation is to be determined in the same way as it is determined for the purposes of Part 16 of the _Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001_.

             (5)  The regulations may provide that subsection (1) does not apply in relation to a particular reference, or class of references, in an Act.

## Part XI—Non-legislative instruments and resolutions

##### <a id="46"></a>46  Construction of instruments

             (1)  If a provision confers on an authority the power to make an instrument that is neither a legislative instrument for the purposes of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ nor a rule of court, then, unless the contrary intention appears:

                     (a)  this Act applies to any instrument so made as if it were an Act and as if each provision of the instrument were a section of an Act; and

                     (b)  expressions used in any instrument so made have the same meaning as in the enabling legislation; and

                     (c)  any instrument so made is to be read and construed subject to the enabling legislation, and so as not to exceed the power of the authority.

             (2)  If any instrument so made would, but for subsection (1), be construed as being in excess of the authority’s power, it is to be taken to be a valid instrument to the extent to which it is not in excess of that power.

             (3)  If a provision confers on an authority the power to make an instrument (that is not a legislative instrument or a rule of court):

                     (a)  specifying, declaring or prescribing a matter or thing; or

                     (b)  doing anything in relation to a matter or thing;

then, in exercising the power, the authority may identify the matter or thing by reference to a class or classes of matters or things.

Note:         This provision has a parallel, in relation to legislative instruments, in section 13 of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_.

##### <a id="46AA"></a>46AA  Prescribing matters by reference to other instruments

             (1)  If legislation authorises or requires provision to be made in 
 relation to any matter in an instrument that is neither a legislative instrument for the purposes of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ nor a rule of court, that instrument may, unless the contrary intention appears, make provision in relation to that matter:

                     (a)  by applying, adopting or incorporating, with or without modification, the provisions of any Act, or of any disallowable legislative instrument for the purposes of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_, as in force at a particular time or as in force from time to time; or

                     (b)  subject to subsection (2), by applying, adopting or incorporating, with or without modification, any matter contained in any other instrument or writing as in force or existing at the time when the first-mentioned instrument takes effect.

             (2)  Unless the contrary intention appears, the instrument may not make provision in relation to that matter by applying, adopting or incorporating any matter contained in an instrument or other writing as in force or existing from time to time.

Note:         This provision has a parallel, in relation to legislative instruments, in section 14 of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_.

##### <a id="46B"></a>46B  Disallowable non-legislative instruments

             (1)  This section applies to instruments:

                     (a)  that are neither legislative instruments for the purposes of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ nor rules of court; and

                     (b)  that are made under a provision of an Act or legislative instrument (the **_enabling_ _provision_**); and

                     (c)  that are expressly declared by the enabling provision or by another provision of the Act or instrument to be disallowable instruments for the purposes of this section.

             (2)  An instrument to which this section applies that is made on or after the commencing day for the purposes of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_, or a particular provision of such an instrument, takes effect from:

                     (a)  the day specified in the instrument for the purposes of the commencement of the instrument or provision; or

                     (b)  the day and time specified in the instrument for the purposes of the commencement of the instrument or provision; or

                     (c)  the day, or day and time, of the commencement of an Act, or of a provision of an Act, or of the occurrence of an event, that is specified in the instrument for the purposes of the commencement of the instrument or provision; or

                     (d)  in any other case—the first moment of the day next following the day of notification under subsection (5).

             (3)  An instrument to which this section applies, or a provision of such an instrument, has no effect if, apart from this subsection, it would take effect before the date of its notification under subsection (5) and as a result:

                     (a)  the rights of a person (other than the Commonwealth or an authority of the Commonwealth) as at the date of notification would be affected so as to disadvantage that person; or

                     (b)  liabilities would be imposed on a person (other than the Commonwealth or an authority of the Commonwealth) in respect of anything done or omitted to be done before the date of notification.

             (4)  The effect of subsections (2) and (3) on an instrument is subject to any contrary provision for commencement of the instrument in the enabling legislation for the instrument if the enabling legislation is an Act or a provision of an Act.

             (5)  An instrument to which this section applies must be notified in the _Gazette_ and, if the instrument is not so notified by being published in full in the _Gazette_, a notice in the _Gazette_ of the instrument’s having been made, and of the place or places where copies of it can be purchased, is sufficient compliance with that requirement.

             (6)  If a notice of the making of an instrument is published in accordance with subsection (5), copies of the instrument must, at the time of publication of the notice or as soon as practicable thereafter, be made available for purchase at the place, or at each of the places, specified in the notice.

             (7)  If, on the day of publication of a notice referred to in subsection (5), there are no copies of the instrument to which the notice relates available for purchase at the place, or at one or more of the places, specified in the notice, the Minister administering the enabling provision must cause to be laid before each House of the Parliament, within 15 sitting days of that House after that day, a statement that copies of the instrument were not so available and the reason why they were not so available.

             (8)  Failure to comply with a requirement of subsection (6) or (7) in relation to any instrument does not constitute a failure to comply with subsection (5).

             (9)  A copy of an instrument to which this section applies must be laid before each House of the Parliament not later than 6 sitting days of that House after the instrument is made and, for that purpose, must be delivered to the House by the person or body authorised to make the instrument.

           (10)  If a copy of an instrument is not laid before each House of the Parliament in accordance with subsection (9), it thereupon ceases to have effect.

           (11)  Unless the law otherwise provides, Part 5 of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_, other than sections 38, 39, 40 and 44, applies in relation to an instrument to which this section applies as if:

                    (aa)  the reference in section 37 of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ to registered were omitted, and the note to that section were repealed; and

                     (a)  references to legislative instruments or to a legislative instrument were references to an instrument to which this section applies; and

                     (b)  references to enabling legislation were references to the enabling provision; and

                     (c)  references to repeal were references to revocation; and

                    (ca)  references to registered were references to made; and

                    (cb)  references to subsection 38(1) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ were references to subsection (9) of this section; and

                    (cc)  references to subsection 38(3) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ were references to subsection (10) of this section; and

                     (d)  references in subsection 45(2) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ to another legislative instrument included references to a provision of another non-legislative instrument made under the enabling provision.

##### <a id="47"></a>47  Construction of resolutions

                   Where any resolution is or has been passed by either House of the Parliament in purported pursuance of any Act, then, unless the contrary intention appears, the resolution shall be read and construed subject to the Constitution and to the Act under which it purports to have been passed, to the intent that where the resolution would, but for this section, have been construed as being in excess of authority, it shall nevertheless be a valid resolution to the extent to which it is not in excess of authority.

## Part XII—Regulations

##### <a id="51"></a>51  Regulations

                   The Governor-General may make regulations prescribing matters:

                     (a)  required or permitted by this Act to be prescribed; or

                     (b)  necessary or convenient to be prescribed for carrying out or giving effect to this Act.

any instrument so made is taken to be an instrument referred to in paragraph 6(b) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ despite the repeal by this  Act  of the _Statutory Rules Publication Act 1903_.

             (2)  If legislation introduced into the Parliament before the commencing day but commencing on or after that day:

                     (a)  authorises an instrument to be made in the exercise of a power delegated by the Parliament; and

                     (b)  is expressed to declare that instrument to be a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_;

                     (e)  it had provided for such modifications of the operation of that section as are necessary to ensure that the effect of the applied provisions of Part XII of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ is preserved.

                     (c)  the person makes an application to the Finance Minister for one or more payments (the **_replacement payments_**) to compensate the person for the lost payments;

the Finance Minister must make a determination, in accordance with subsection (4), to fully compensate the person.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  a person would have been entitled to one or more payments (the **_lost payments_**) under the _Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991_ if the first amendment of the Trust Deed under that Act that is made after the commencement of this section had commenced on 1 July 2008; and

                     (b)  because that amendment did not commence until after 1 July 2008, the person is not entitled to the payment or payments; and

                     (c)  the person makes an application to the Finance Minister for one or more payments (the **_replacement payments_**) to compensate the person for the lost payments;

                     (a)  a person would have been entitled to one or more payments (the **_lost payments_**) under the _Superannuation Act 1990_ if the first amendment of the Trust Deed under that Act that is made after the commencement of this section had commenced on 1 July 2008; and

                     (b)  because that amendment did not commence until after 1 July 2008, the person is not entitled to the payment or payments; and

                     (c)  the person makes an application to the Finance Minister for one or more payments (the **_replacement payments_**) to compensate the person for the lost payments;

             (5)  An application must be in writing in the form approved by the Finance Minister.

             (7)  Replacement payments are to be made out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which is appropriated accordingly.
