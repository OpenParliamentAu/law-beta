the determination ceases to be in force on the particular day if either:

                     (c)  another determination is made on the particular day on a claim by the claimant for payment of family tax benefit by instalment; or

Consequence of Secretary later becoming aware of bank account details

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  under subsection (3), the Secretary varies the determination; and

                     (b)  the Secretary finds out the bank account details of the claimant concerned before the end of the income year following the one in which the variation took effect;

Consequence where income tax returns are later lodged

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  after the Secretary varies the determination under subsection (2) or (6), an assessment is made under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ for the cancellation income year for everyone (the **_taxpayers involved_**):

                   (ba)  subsection (4) (which is about when the claimant and the claimant’s partner separate after the determination is varied) does not apply;

the Secretary must again vary the determination so that it has the effect that, for the cancellation days, the claimant is entitled to be paid:

                     (c)  if income tax returns for the cancellation income year for the taxpayers involved were lodged with the Commissioner of Taxation during the income year that began 2 years after the beginning of the cancellation income year—the recalculated amount; or

                     (d)  in any other case—the lesser of:

                              (i)  the recalculated amount; and

                             (ii)  the amount that the claimant was entitled to be paid before the variation under subsection (2) was made.

Consequence where claimant and partner separate after determination varied

                              (i)  if paragraph (c) applies—the later of the time when the claimant and the ex‑partner last ceased to be members of the same couple and the time when the assessment of the claimant’s taxable income is made; or

                             (ii)  otherwise—the time when the claimant and the ex‑partner last ceased to be members of the same couple;

                     (e)  the Secretary is satisfied that the claimant was eligible for an amount (the **_recalculated amount_**) of family tax benefit for the cancellation days.

             (5)  The Secretary must vary the determination under subsection (4) so that it has the effect that, for the cancellation days, the claimant is entitled to be paid:

                     (a)  if:

                              (i)  the claimant was required to lodge an income tax return for the cancellation income year and the claimant lodged the return with the Commissioner of Taxation before the end of the later income year; or

                             (ii)  the claimant was not required to lodge an income tax return for the cancellation income year;

                            the recalculated amount; or

                              (i)  the recalculated amount; and

                             (ii)  the amount that the claimant was entitled to be paid before the variation under subsection (2) or (6) was made.

Consequence of section applying

             (2)  If this section applies, the Secretary may vary the determination so that it has the effect that the claimant is not entitled to be paid family tax benefit for any day, on which the determination was or will be in force, after the end of the last instalment period before the variation takes place.

Consequence of later provision of reasonable estimate or Secretary finding out the actual amount

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  under subsection (2), the Secretary varies the determination; and

                     (b)  either:

                            (iv)  if the individual is aged 16 or more—payments under a prescribed educational scheme.

Consequence of section applying if the individual is the claimant’s only FTB or regular care child or the claimant is an approved care organisation

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  this section applies because the individual is an individual in respect of whom the claimant is an approved care organisation; or

                     (b)  this section applies because the individual is the only individual who is either an FTB child, or a regular care child who is a rent assistance child, of the claimant;

the Secretary must  vary the determination so that it has the effect that the claimant is not entitled to be paid family tax benefit for any day on which the determination was or will be in force, after the end of the last instalment period before the variation takes place or from a later day determined by the Secretary.

Consequence of section applying if the individual is not the claimant’s only FTB or regular care child

                     (b)  the individual is not the claimant’s only FTB child, or regular care child who is also a rent assistance child;

the Secretary must  vary the determination so that it has the effect that the daily rate of family tax benefit for which the claimant is entitled under the determination does not take into account the child who has made a claim for a payment listed in paragraph (1)(c). The determination takes effect from the day after the end of the claimant’s last instalment period before the variation takes place or from a later day determined by the Secretary.

Consequence of later rejection etc. of individual’s claim

          (2A)  Without limiting subsection (2), if the information or documents required relate to:

                     (a)  the claimant’s eligibility for rent assistance; or

                     (b)  the amount of rent assistance to be added in calculating the claimant’s rate of family tax benefit;

the Secretary may vary the determination so as to establish a different rate of family tax benefit that does not have the amount of rent assistance added for any day, on which the determination was or will be in force, after the end of the last instalment period before the variation takes place or from a later day determined by the Secretary.

          (2B)  Without limiting subsection (2), if the Secretary considers that the information or document is relevant to whether an individual satisfies or is exempt from the FTB activity test, the Secretary may vary the determination so as to disregard the individual for the purposes of working out whether the claimant is entitled to be paid family tax benefit, and if so the rate at which it is to be paid:

                     (c)  the Secretary, after taking reasonable steps, is not able to find out whether the claimant’s address has changed or, if it has, what the claimant’s new address is.

Consequence of section applying

                             (ii)  that the claimant was still so eligible but that the rate of family tax benefit should be a different rate to the rate previously determined;

the Secretary must, subject to subsection (2):

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.   Work out the total amount of family tax benefit the claimant is or was entitled to be paid during the period beginning at the start of the income year and ending at the end of the day before the applicable day.

Step 2.   Work out the total amount of family tax benefit the claimant would have been entitled to be paid during that period if the claimant’s rate of family tax benefit were calculated using:

               (a)     if subparagraph (1)(b)(i) applies—the revised estimate concerned; or

              (b)     if subparagraph (1)(b)(ii) applies—the revised estimate concerned; or

               (c)     if subparagraph (1)(b)(iii) applies—the indexed estimate concerned; or

              (d)     if subparagraph (1)(b)(iv) applies—the indexed actual income concerned; or

               (e)     if subparagraph (1)(b)(v) applies—the revised estimate concerned; or

               (f)     if subparagraph (1)(b)(vi) applies—the revised estimate concerned; or

               (g)     if subparagraph (1)(b)(vii) applies—the estimate of the claimant’s adjusted taxable income for the income year, and the estimate of the claimant’s maintenance income in that income year, that were used in determining the claimant’s rate of family tax benefit under the other determination referred to in that subparagraph.

Step 3.   Take the amount worked out at step 2 away from the amount worked out at step 1.

Step 4.   If the amount worked out at step 3 is greater than zero, work out the number of days during the period beginning on the applicable day and ending at the end of the last day in the income year.

Step 5.   Work out the **_daily overpayment rate_** by dividing the amount worked out at step 3 by the number of days worked out at step 4, and rounding the result of the division to the nearest cent (rounding 0.5 cents upwards).

* * *

             (3)  If there is a daily overpayment rate, the Secretary must vary the applicable determination so that the claimant’s daily rate of family tax benefit for the period beginning on the applicable day and ending at the end of the last day in the income year is reduced (but not below nil) by that daily overpayment rate.

          (3A)  For the purposes of subsection (3), the **_applicable determination_** is:

                     (a)  if subparagraph (1)(b)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) or (vi) applies—the determination referred to in paragraph (1)(a); or

             (5)  In this section:

                    <a name="applic-dai"></a>**_applicable day_** means:

                     (a)  if subparagraph (1)(b)(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) applies—the day on which the variation concerned has effect; and

                     (b)  if subparagraph (1)(b)(v) or (vi) applies—the first day of the instalment period in which the Secretary applies the method statement because of that subparagraph applying; and

                     (c)  if subparagraph (1)(b)(vii) applies—the first day in the income year for which the claimant’s entitlement to be paid family tax benefit arose under the other determination referred to in that subparagraph.

##### <a id="32"></a>32  Notice of variation of determination

             (1)  The Secretary must give notice of any variation of a determination under this Subdivision to the claimant, stating the effect of the variation and that the claimant may apply for review of the decision involved in the manner set out in Part 5.

                              (i)  the individual’s Part A rate of family tax benefit is nil for those days because of the individual’s adjusted taxable income, and there are no other days in either consecutive year for which the individual was entitled to be paid the Part A rate;

                             (ii)  the individual’s Part B rate of family tax benefit is nil for those days because of subclause 28B(1) of Schedule 1 to the Family Assistance Act.

##### <a id="32AG"></a>32AG  Exception—greater than nil rate of FTB for later income year

Scope

             (1)  This section applies if, in respect of an income year (the **_payment year_**) after the later of the consecutive years, the Secretary, taking into account the individual’s adjusted taxable income as finally determined in respect of the payment year by the Secretary, determines either or both of the following on a day (the **_payment day_**):

                     (b)  the individual’s Part B rate of family tax benefit is greater than nil on one or more days in the payment year.

Payment day is in same income year as exclusion day

             (2)  If the payment day is in the income year in which the exclusion day occurs, then:

                     (a)  if this section applies in relation to the Part A rate of family tax benefit—paragraph 32AF(2)(a) is taken not to have applied in relation to the individual; and

                     (b)  if this section applies in relation to the Part B rate of family tax benefit—paragraph 32AF(2)(b) is taken not to have applied in relation to the individual.

Assume that the individual is not entitled, on and after 1 July 2012, to be paid the Part A rate and Part B rate of family tax benefit worked out on an estimated income basis. The exclusion day is 1 July 2012.

                   Assume that on 1 November 2012 the Secretary determines, under subsection (1), that the individual’s Part A rate and Part B rate of family tax benefit are greater than nil on one or more days in 2011‑12\. The payment day is 1 November 2012.

                   Under subsection (2), subsection 32AF(2) is taken not to have prevented the individual from being entitled, on and after 1 July 2012, to be paid family tax benefit worked out on an estimated income basis.

Payment day is in income year later than that of exclusion day

             (3)  If the payment day is in an income year that is later than the income year in which the exclusion day occurs, then:

                     (a)  if this section applies in relation to the Part A rate of family tax benefit—paragraph 32AF(2)(a) ceases to apply in relation to the individual on 1 July of the later income year; and

                     (b)  if this section applies in relation to the Part B rate of family tax benefit—paragraph 32AF(2)(b) ceases to apply in relation to the individual on 1 July of the later income year.

Example:    Assume that under section 32AF the consecutive years are 2009‑10 and 2010‑11\. Assume that the individual is not entitled, on and after 1 July 2012, to be paid the Part A rate and Part B rate of family tax benefit worked out on an estimated income basis. The exclusion day is 1 July 2012.

                   Under subsection (3), subsection 32AF(2) ceases to prevent the individual from being entitled, on and after 1 July 2013, to be paid family tax benefit worked out on an estimated income basis.

Note:          For the meaning of **_consecutive year_**, see subsection 32AF(1). For the meaning of **_exclusion day_**, see subsection 32AF(3).

                     (b)  after the applicable year, the individual makes a claim for family tax benefit in relation to the income year (the **_current year_**) in which the claim is made; and

                     (c)  the Secretary has finally determined the individual’s adjusted taxable income in respect of the applicable year; and

                     (d)  the Secretary is satisfied that, if the Secretary were to take into account that adjusted taxable income, either or both of the following would apply in respect of one or more days in the current year:

                              (i)  the individual’s Part A rate of family tax benefit would be greater than nil;

                             (ii)  the individual’s Part B rate of family tax benefit would be greater than nil, or would be nil (other than because of subclause 28B(1) of Schedule 1 to the Family Assistance Act).

                   Under subsection (2), subsection 32AF(2) is taken not to have prevented the individual from being entitled, on and after 1 July 2012, to be paid family tax benefit worked out on an estimated income basis.

Current year is later than that of exclusion day

             (3)  If the current year is later than the income year in which the exclusion day occurs, then:

                     (a)  if this section applies in relation to the Part A rate of family tax benefit—paragraph 32AF(2)(a) ceases to apply in relation to the individual on 1 July of the current year; and

                     (b)  if this section applies in relation to the Part B rate of family tax benefit—paragraph 32AF(2)(b) ceases to apply in relation to the individual on 1 July of the current year.

Example:    Assume that under section 32AF the consecutive years are 2010‑11 and 2011‑12\. Assume that the individual is not entitled, on and after 1 July 2012, to be paid the Part A rate and Part B rate of family tax benefit worked out on an estimated income basis. The exclusion day is 1 July 2012.

                   Assume that the individual is not eligible for family tax benefit for the whole of 2012‑13 (the applicable year). Assume that in 2013‑14 (the current year) the individual makes a claim for family tax benefit for 2013‑14.

                   Assume that the Secretary is satisfied that, if the Secretary were to take into account the individual’s final adjusted taxable income for 2012‑13, the individual’s Part A rate and Part B rate of family tax benefit would be greater than nil on one or more days in 2013‑14.

                   Under subsection (3), subsection 32AF(2) ceases to prevent the individual from being entitled, on and after 1 July 2013, to be paid family tax benefit worked out on an estimated income basis.

Note:          For the meaning of **_consecutive year_**, see subsection 32AF(1). For the meaning of **_exclusion day_**, see subsection 32AF(3).

### Division 4—Child care benefit

#### Subdivision A—Overview of process of fee reductions

##### <a id="48"></a>48  Overview of process if individual is conditionally eligible for child care benefit by fee reduction

             (1)  An approved child care service is obliged to notify the Secretary if an individual enrols a child for care by the service.

             (2)  Once that enrolment is confirmed by the Secretary, the service is obliged to give weekly reports to the Secretary about the care provided to the child.

             (3)  If a report is given, and a determination of conditional eligibility under section 50F is in force in respect of an individual and a child with the effect that the individual is conditionally eligible for child care benefit by fee reduction for care provided by the approved child care service to the child in a week, the Secretary will calculate the amount by which the fees charged by the service for the care are to be reduced.

             (4)  The amount by which the fees are to be reduced is referable to the amount of child care benefit that would be paid in respect of the sessions if entitlement to an amount of child care benefit was determined under section 51B in respect of the income year in which the week falls. The amount of fee reduction is calculated by the Secretary using the provisions of the Family Assistance Act.

             (5)  The service must pass on to the individual the amount of the fee reduction calculated by the Secretary. If the service has already reduced the amount of fees charged to the individual for care provided to the child in anticipation of the calculation by the Secretary, the service is taken to have passed on a fee reduction equal to the amount by which the fees have already been reduced.

             (6)  When the determination of entitlement is made, if the amount of the entitlement is greater than the amount of the fee reductions already received by the individual in respect of the sessions in the income year, the amount of the entitlement consists of the amount of the difference together with the amount of fee reductions received by the individual.

             (7)  When the determination of entitlement is made, if the amount of the entitlement is less than the amount of the fee reductions already received by the individual in respect of the sessions in the income year, the amount of the entitlement is the amount of the fee reductions less the amount of the difference.

             (8)  Payments in respect of fee reduction are made to the service by the Secretary to enable the service to pass on to the individual the amount of fee reductions as calculated (see Division 2 of Part 8A).

#### Subdivision B—Making claims

The claim is taken to be made on the first day that the service reports to the Secretary in respect of that eligibility.

             (1)  The only persons who can make a claim in accordance with this Subdivision are individuals.

                     (c)  the information about an amount needed by the Secretary for the calculation of the CCB % is not available (for example, because the adjusted taxable income of the claimant or another individual cannot be known until after the end of the relevant income year); and

                     (d)  the claimant gives the Secretary an estimate of the amount needed; and

                     (e)  the Secretary considers the estimate to be reasonable; and

                      (f)  since the estimate was given, the Secretary has not given the individual a notice under subsection 55AA(2) or 55AB(2) with a start day that has arrived or passed;

the Secretary may determine the CCB % applicable to the claimant on the basis of the estimate.

             (2)  This subsection applies if the claimant does not give the Secretary an estimate of the amount needed that the Secretary considers reasonable.

Note:          This means the Secretary must determine the CCB % of the claimant to be zero % (see subsection 50J(2)).

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  a CCB % applicable to a claimant who is an individual is required to be calculated under Schedule 2 to the Family Assistance Act for the purpose of varying a determination of CCB % under Subdivision M, N, P, R, S or V of Division 4 of this Part; and

                     (d)  since the notice was given, the claimant has not given the Secretary an estimate of the claimant’s adjusted taxable income that the Secretary considers to be reasonable;

the Secretary may determine the CCB % applicable to the claimant on the basis of the indexed estimate or indexed actual income stated in the notice (or, if the Secretary has given the claimant more than one notice with a start day that has arrived or passed—the notice with the most recent start day).

Note:          Section 55AC affects the meaning of this provision for members of couples.

                     (c)  the CCB % is worked out on the basis of an estimate of the claimant’s adjusted taxable income, an indexed estimate for the claimant or an indexed actual income for the claimant.

Note:          Section 55AC affects the meaning of paragraph (1)(c) for members of couples.

             (2)  If the Secretary calculates an indexed estimate for the individual, the Secretary may give the claimant a notice:

Any such notice under subsection 55AB(2) must specify a start day that is no earlier than the start day specified in the superseded notice.

             (5)  Calculate an indexed estimate (which may be nil) for the individual by multiplying the individual’s current ATI number (see subsection (6)) by the indexation factor, rounding the result to the nearest dollar and rounding 50 cents upwards. The indexation factor is the greater of 1 and the factor worked out to 3 decimal places as follows (increasing the factor by 0.001 if it would, if worked out to 4 decimal places, end in a number greater than 4):

                     (a)  when a variation under this section takes place, a variation is in force under section 59G or 62CA; and

                     (b)  the variation under section 59G or 62CA has effect for any period when the variation under this section would have effect;

the variation under section 59G or 62CA prevails over the variation under this section.

### Division 4AA—Child care rebate

#### Subdivision AAA—Election to have child care rebate paid in various ways

##### <a id="65EAAAA"></a>65EAAAA  Individual may elect to have child care rebate paid in various ways

             (1)  An individual may give the Secretary notice in accordance with subsection (2) electing to have child care rebate in respect of the individual and a child for care provided for the child in an income year paid in one of the following ways:

                     (a)  weekly into a bank account maintained by the individual alone or jointly or in common with someone else;

                     (b)  weekly to one or more approved child care services;

                     (c)  quarterly into a bank account maintained by the individual alone or jointly or in common with someone else.

Note:          Child care rebate is calculated on the basis of reports given by approved child care services in relation to each week of care under section 219N. A report for care provided in one week may be given up to 2 weeks later. A service may therefore give a report for 2 weeks together. For this reason, payments of child care rebate to an individual for 2 successive weeks may be made together. The effective result is then a fortnightly payment.

             (2)  A notice under subsection (1):

                     (a)  must be given in the form, and in the manner or way, approved by the Secretary; and

                     (b)  must be given before the beginning of the income year to which the notice relates unless:

                              (i)  the individual makes a claim after the beginning of the income year for payment of child care benefit by fee reduction for care provided for the child by one or more approved child care services; or

                             (ii)  the Secretary makes a determination under subsection (4).

             (3)  If an individual gives notice under subsection (1) when making a claim after the beginning of an income year for payment of child care benefit by fee reduction, the election is taken to relate to the income year in which the claim is made.

             (4)  The Secretary may determine, in writing, that an individual may give notice under subsection (1) after the income year to which the notice relates has begun, if the Secretary is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances justifying the determination.

Note:          A determination of entitlement to child care rebate will be made for the income year under Subdivision A of this Division. So if a person is entitled to child care rebate, does not elect to have it paid weekly or quarterly and has not been receiving child care rebate weekly or quarterly as a result of a previous election (see section 65EAAAC), child care rebate will be paid after the end of the income year.

##### <a id="65EAAAB"></a>65EAAAB  Period in which election has effect

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a notice is given under paragraph 65EAAAA(1)(a) or (b) to have child care rebate paid weekly; and

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  a notice is given under paragraph 65EAAAA(1)(c) to have child care rebate paid quarterly; and

                     (b)  the notice is given before the income year to which it relates has begun;

the election takes effect on the first day of the first quarter in the income year and continues in effect for each quarter which falls in the income year.

             (3)  If notice is given under subsection 65EAAAA(1) after the income year to which it relates has begun:

                     (a)  the Secretary must determine in writing the day on which the election is to take effect; and

                     (b)  the election continues in effect:

                              (i)  if the notice is given under paragraph 65EAAAA(1)(a) or (b) to have child care rebate paid weekly—for each week all or part of which falls in the income year; and

                             (ii)  if the notice is given under paragraph 65EAAAA(1)(c) to have child care rebate paid quarterly—for each quarter which falls in the income year.

##### <a id="65EAAAC"></a>65EAAAC  Where no election made for an income year

                   If an individual does not give notice under subsection 65EAAAA(1) for an income year, child care rebate in respect of the individual and the child for care provided during the income year is to be paid:

                     (a)  if child care rebate was paid in respect of the individual and the child in relation to the immediately preceding income year—in the same way as it was paid in relation to that year; and

                     (b)  otherwise—for the income year.

                     (b)  the Secretary has calculated an amount of fee reduction under subsection 50Z(1) in respect of the individual and the child for a session or sessions of care provided by an approved child care service in the week;

the Secretary must calculate the amount of the rebate which the Secretary considers is applicable in respect of the individual and the child for care provided for the child by the approved child care service in the week.

Note 1:       The individual will not be eligible to have child care rebate paid weekly unless the individual has made an election under paragraph 65EAAAA(1)(a) or (b) to have rebate paid weekly.

Note 2:       The calculation is made in accordance with section 84AAA of the Family Assistance Act.

Note 3:       The amount of fee reduction calculated under subsection 50Z(1) may be a nil amount (see section 4A).

                     (b)  the individual has made an election under paragraph 65EAAAA(1)(a) that is in effect for the week to have child care rebate paid weekly into a bank account nominated and maintained by the individual.

             (2)  The Secretary must pay the amount of child care rebate calculated under section 65EAAA to the individual, at such time as the Secretary considers appropriate, by paying it to the credit of the bank account.

             (3)  The Secretary may direct that the whole or a part of an amount that is to be paid under this section is to be paid in a different way from that provided for by subsection (2). If the Secretary gives the direction, the amount is to be paid in accordance with the direction.

             (4)  The Secretary must give notice to the individual:

             (5)  The calculation and payment of an amount of child care rebate applicable under this section is not ineffective by reason only that any, or all, of the requirements of subsection (4) are not complied with.

             (6)  This section is subject to:

                     (b)  if the claimant is so entitled—the amount of the supplement and how it is to be paid; and

                     (c)  that the claimant may apply for review of the determination in the manner set out in Part 5.

             (2)  The determination is not ineffective by reason only that the requirements of subsection (1) are not complied with.

##### <a id="65KP"></a>65KP  Payment of single income family supplement—no claim required

             (1)  Subject to this section, if an individual is not required to make a claim for single income family supplement in relation to a period (the **_past period_**) in an income year (the **_past period income year_**), the Secretary must pay any amount of single income family supplement the individual is eligible for in relation to that past period:

                     (a)  on the day that the Secretary considers to be the earliest day on which it is reasonably practicable for the amount to be paid; and

                     (b)  in such manner as the Secretary considers appropriate.

Note:          Subsection 65K(2) sets out when a claim for single income family supplement is not required.

             (2)  If either or both of the following apply:

                     (a)  the individual is required to lodge an income tax return for the past period income year;

                             (ii)  that person is required to lodge an income tax return for the past period income year;

then the amount of single income family supplement cannot be paid to the individual unless, in relation to each person who is required to lodge an income tax return for that income year, an assessment has been made under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ of the tax payable on that person’s taxable income for that income year.

             (3)  If either or both of the following apply:

                     (a)  the individual is required to lodge an income tax return for the past period income year, but the individual has not lodged the return before the end of the 2 income years immediately following the past period income year;

                     (b)  the following apply:

                              (i)  a person is the individual’s partner at any time during the past period;

                             (ii)  that person is required to lodge an income tax return for the past period income year;

                            (iii)  that person has not lodged the return before the end of the 2 income years immediately following the past period income year;

then the amount of single income family supplement is not to be paid to the individual.

             (4)  This section is subject to Part 4, Division 3 of Part 8B and sections 225 and 226.

##### <a id="65KQ"></a>65KQ  Payment of single income family supplement—claim required

             (1)  If an individual is entitled to be paid an amount of single income family supplement under a determination on a claim for payment of single income family supplement:

                     (a)  for a past period; or

                     (b)  by single payment/in substitution because of the death of another individual;

the Secretary must pay the amount to the individual at such time and in such manner as the Secretary considers appropriate.

             (2)  This section is subject to Part 4, Division 3 of Part 8B and sections 225 and 226.

##### <a id="65KR"></a>65KR  Secretary’s power to request tax file numbers

             (1)  If a determination is in force under which the claimant is entitled to be paid single income family supplement for a past period, the Secretary may request the claimant to give the Secretary, within 28 days of the request being made, a written statement, in relation to a specified TFN determination person, of whichever of the kinds set out in subsections (2), (3) and (4) the claimant chooses.

Statement of tax file number

             (2)  The first kind of statement that can be made is a statement of the TFN determination person’s tax file number. Regardless of who the TFN determination person is, this kind of statement can be made by the claimant only.

Statement that TFN person does not know what his or her tax file number is etc.

             (3)  The second kind of statement that can be made is a statement by the TFN determination person that the person:

                     (a)  has a tax file number but does not know what it is; and

                     (b)  has asked the Commissioner of Taxation to inform the person of his or her tax file number; and

                     (b)  the claimant does not comply with the request within 28 days of the request being made;

then, subject to subsection (2), the consequence in subsection (7) applies.

Exemption from request under subsection 65KR(1)

             (2)  The Secretary may determine that the consequence in subsection (7) does not apply if:

                     (a)  the TFN determination person concerned is or was the claimant’s partner; and

                     (b)  the claimant cannot obtain from the person:

                              (i)  the person’s tax file number; or

                     (b)  by the end of 28 days after the request is made, the claimant gives the Secretary a statement by the TFN determination person of the kind set out in subsection 65KR(3); and

                     (c)  the Commissioner of Taxation subsequently tells the Secretary that the TFN determination person has no tax file number;

the consequence in subsection (7) applies.

the consequence in subsection (7) applies.

Statement made by TFN claim person under subsection 65KB(4)

             (5)  If:

                     (a)  a TFN claim person has made a statement of the kind set out in subsection 65KB(4); and

the consequence in subsection (7) applies.

Consequence—variation of determination

             (7)  For the purposes of subsection (1), (3), (4), (5) or (6), the consequence is that the Secretary may, if the determination is one under which the claimant is entitled to be paid single income family supplement for a past period, vary the determination so that it has the effect that the claimant is not entitled to be paid single income family supplement for any day in the past period.

Consequence of Secretary later becoming aware of tax file number

             (8)  If:

                     (a)  under subsection (7), the Secretary varies the determination; and

                     (b)  the Secretary finds out the tax file number of the TFN determination person or TFN claim person, as the case requires, at any time after the variation takes place;

## Part 4—Overpayments and debt recovery

### Division 1—Preliminary

##### <a id="68"></a>68  Meaning of _amount paid to person_

             (1)  For the purposes of this Part, **_amount paid to person_** in respect of whom a determination of entitlement to be paid child care benefit has been made—means the amount of the entitlement (see subsection 3(1)) paid to the person.

          (1A)  In the case of a person in respect of whom a determination of entitlement to be paid child care benefit by fee reduction has been made under section 51B (individual) or 54B (approved child care service), the amount of the entitlement paid to the person consists of:

                     (a)  the amount:

                              (i)  in the case of an individual—that the service that provided care in respect of which the determination under section 51B was made is required, under section 219B, to pass on to the individual as a fee reduction for that care; or

                             (ii)  in the case of a service that provided care in respect of which a determination under section 54B was made—that the service is required, under section 219BA, to pass on to itself as a fee reduction for that care; and

                     (b)  the amount, as paid to the person, of the difference (if any) referred to in:

                              (i)  in the case of an individual—subsection 56(1); and

                             (ii)  in the case of an approved child care service—subsection 56B(1).

          (1B)  In the case of a person who has made an election under paragraph 65EAAAA(1)(b) to have child care rebate in respect of a child paid weekly to an approved child care service, the amount of child care rebate paid to the person in a week for which the election is in effect consists of the amount that the service is required, under section 219EA, to pass on to the individual for care provided for the child in the week.

             (2)  For the purposes of this Part, an amount of family assistance is taken to be paid to a person if that amount is applied against a liability of that person or another person for:

                     (a)  a primary tax; or

                     (b)  a debt under this Act or the _Social Security Act 1991_.

##### <a id="68A"></a>68A  Recovery from approved child care service

                   The amount of a debt due under this Part by an approved child care service is payable by the operator of the service.

##### <a id="69"></a>69  Special provisions relating to approved child care services

                   For the purposes of this Part, a reference to an amount being paid to a person when the person is an approved child care service includes a reference to an amount that, at the time when it was paid, was paid to an approved child care service even if:

                     (a)  the service is no longer approved; or

                     (b)  the service operator no longer operates the service concerned.

### Division 2—Amounts recoverable under this Act

##### <a id="70"></a>70  Debts due to the Commonwealth

                   If an amount has been paid by way of family assistance, one‑off payment to families, a payment under section 219Q, subsection 219QA(2), section 219QC or subsection 219QD(2), a payment of an enrolment advance under section 219RA, a payment under section 219RD, economic security strategy payment to families, back to school bonus, single income family bonus, a clean energy advance or ETR payment, the amount is a debt due to the Commonwealth only to the extent to which a provision of:

                     (a)  this Act; or

                     (b)  the _Data‑matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990_;

expressly provides that it is.

##### <a id="71"></a>71  Debts arising in respect of family assistance other than child care benefit, child care rebate and family tax benefit advance

No entitlement to amount

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  an amount has been paid to a person by way of family tax benefit, baby bonus, single income family supplement or schoolkids bonus (the **_assistance_**) in respect of a period or event; and

                     (b)  the person was not entitled to the assistance in respect of that period or event;

the amount so paid is a debt due to the Commonwealth by the person.

Overpayment

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  an amount (the **_received amount_**) has been paid to a person by way of assistance; and

                     (b)  the received amount is greater than the amount (the **_correct_ _amount_**) of assistance that should have been paid to the person under the family assistance law;

the difference between the received amount and the correct amount is a debt due to the Commonwealth by the person.

##### <a id="71A"></a>71A  Debts arising in respect of family tax benefit advances

No entitlement to advance

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a family tax benefit advance has been paid to an individual; and

                     (b)  the individual was not entitled to the advance;

the amount so paid is a debt due to the Commonwealth by the individual.

Overpayment

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  an amount (the **_received amount_**) of family tax benefit advance has been paid to an individual; and

                     (b)  the received amount is greater than the amount (the **_correct amount_**) of family tax benefit advance that should have been paid to the individual under the family assistance law;

the difference between the received amount and the correct amount is a debt due to the Commonwealth by the individual.

Debt arising during the repayment period for a family tax benefit advance

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  an individual is paid a family tax benefit advance; and

                     (b)  the repayment period for the advance has not expired; and

                     (c)  one of the following occurs:

                              (i)  the individual ceases to be entitled to be paid family tax benefit by instalment;

                             (ii)  the individual’s Part A rate becomes nil (before reduction under clause 5 or 25A of Schedule 1 to the Family Assistance Act);

the amount of unrepaid family tax benefit advance becomes a debt due to the Commonwealth by the individual.

Debt arising due to variation or review after the repayment period for a family tax benefit advance has expired

(4)  If:

                     (a)  an individual is paid a family tax benefit advance; and

                     (b)  the individual’s Part A rate has been reduced under clause 5 or 25A of Schedule 1 to the Family Assistance Act to repay the advance; and

                     (c)  the repayment period for the advance has expired; and

                     (d)  due to a variation in a determination, or a variation or substitution of a decision on review (other than a variation under subsection 28(2) or (6)), the reduction in the individual’s Part A rate under clause 5 or 25A of Schedule 1 to the Family Assistance Act has not been sufficient to repay the advance; and

                     (e)  at the time of the variation of the determination, or the variation or substitution of the decision on review:

                              (i)  the individual is not entitled to be paid family tax benefit by instalment; or

                             (ii)  the individual’s Part A rate is nil (before reduction under clause 5 or 25A of Schedule 1 to the Family Assistance Act);

the amount of the family tax benefit advance left unrepaid as a result of the variation of the determination, or the variation or substitution of the decision on review, becomes a debt due to the Commonwealth by the individual.

Note:          If the individual is entitled to be paid family tax benefit by instalment and has a Part A rate greater than nil, the unrepaid amount of the advance is to be repaid by reductions in the individual’s Part A rate (see clause 51 of Schedule 1 to the Family Assistance Act).

Debt arising due to variation under subsection 28(2) or (6)

             (5)  If:

                     (a)  an individual is paid a family tax benefit advance; and

                     (b)  the individual’s Part A rate has been reduced under clause 5 or 25A of Schedule 1 to the Family Assistance Act to repay the advance; and

                     (c)  due to a variation in a determination of the individual’s entitlement to family tax benefit made under subsection 28(2) or (6), the reduction in the individual’s Part A rate under clause 5 or 25A of Schedule 1 to the Family Assistance Act has not been sufficient to repay the advance;

the amount of the family tax benefit advance left unrepaid as a result of the variation of the determination becomes a debt due to the Commonwealth by the individual.

             (6)  If a debt is created under subsection (5) and the Secretary varies the determination of the individual’s entitlement to family tax benefit under subsection 28(3) or (4), the debt is taken never to have been created.

Note:          If, after the variation, the individual’s Part A rate was not sufficient to repay the advance, the unrepaid amount of the advance is to be repaid either by reductions in the individual’s Part A rate (see clauses 48 and 51 of Schedule 1 to the Family Assistance Act) or as a debt under subsection (3) or (4).

Debt arising due to determination under clause 45 of Schedule 1 to the Family Assistance Act

             (7)  If:

                     (a)  an individual is paid a family tax benefit advance; and

                     (b)  the Secretary determines under clause 45 of Schedule 1 to the Family Assistance Act that the amount of the advance that is unrepaid is to be a debt;

the amount of the family tax benefit advance becomes a debt due to the Commonwealth by the individual.

Meaning of **FTB advance debt**

             (8)  The debt due to the Commonwealth under subsection (1), (2), (3), (4), (5) or (7) is an **_FTB advance debt_**_._

##### <a id="71B"></a>71B  Debts where no entitlement or where enrolment advance wrongly paid

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  an approved child care service is required under section 219B to pass an amount on to an individual (the **_recipient_**) in respect of one or more sessions of child care provided by the service to a child, but the recipient was not entitled to child care benefit in respect of the session or sessions of care; or

                     (b)  an approved child care service is required under section 219BA to pass an amount on to itself (the **_recipient_**) in respect of one or more sessions of child care provided by the service to a child at risk, but the recipient was not entitled to child care benefit in respect of the session or sessions of care; or

                     (d)  an approved child care service is required under section 219EA to pass on an amount to an individual (the **_recipient_**) in respect of care provided for a child by the service in a week, but the recipient was not entitled to child care rebate in respect of the week;

the amount so paid is, subject to section 71F, a debt due to the Commonwealth by the recipient.
