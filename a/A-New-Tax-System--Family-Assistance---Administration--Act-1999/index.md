Consequence of Secretary later becoming aware of bank account details

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  under subsection (3), the Secretary varies the determination; and

                     (b)  the Secretary finds out the bank account details of the claimant concerned before the end of the income year following the one in which the variation took effect;

                     (d)  in any other case—the lesser of:

                              (i)  the recalculated amount; and

                             (ii)  the amount that the claimant was entitled to be paid before the variation under subsection (2) was made.

                     (e)  the Secretary is satisfied that the claimant was eligible for an amount (the **_recalculated amount_**) of family tax benefit for the cancellation days.

             (5)  The Secretary must vary the determination under subsection (4) so that it has the effect that, for the cancellation days, the claimant is entitled to be paid:

                     (a)  if:

                              (i)  the claimant was required to lodge an income tax return for the cancellation income year and the claimant lodged the return with the Commissioner of Taxation before the end of the later income year; or

the Secretary must  vary the determination so that it has the effect that the daily rate of family tax benefit for which the claimant is entitled under the determination does not take into account the child who has made a claim for a payment listed in paragraph (1)(c). The determination takes effect from the day after the end of the claimant’s last instalment period before the variation takes place or from a later day determined by the Secretary.

Consequence of later rejection etc. of individual’s claim

                     (a)  the claimant’s eligibility for rent assistance; or

                     (b)  the amount of rent assistance to be added in calculating the claimant’s rate of family tax benefit;

                             (ii)  that the claim
