	(ii)	2 or more such persons together acquire such a controlling interest, or acquire interests in AUSSAT that together constitute such a controlling interest; or

In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears:

obligation includes a debt or liability.
share, in relation to a body corporate, means a share in the body’s share capital.

4  Commonwealth guarantee of AUSSAT borrowings
	(1)	The Treasurer may, on the Commonwealth’s behalf, enter into a contract guaranteeing the performance by AUSSAT of one or more of the following:
	(a)	an obligation to repay an AUSSAT borrowing;
	(b)	an obligation to pay interest (including interest on interest) on an AUSSAT borrowing;
	(c)	an obligation to pay amounts (other than interest) that are specified in the contract and that AUSSAT is liable to pay with respect to an AUSSAT borrowing.
	(2)	If the Treasurer determines in writing that the Commonwealth guarantees the performance by AUSSAT of specified obligations each of which is of a kind referred to in subsection (1), the Commonwealth guarantees that performance by force of this subsection.

AUSSAT borrowing means:
	(a)	an amount borrowed or raised, or to be borrowed or raised, by AUSSAT; or
	(b)	an amount of credit obtained, or to be obtained, by AUSSAT.
	(4)	This section ceases to have effect, or is taken to have ceased to have effect, as the case requires, at the transition.
5  Appropriation of up to $800,000,000 to pay out AUSSAT’s existing obligations
	(1)	The purpose of this section is to appropriate up to $800,000,000 to pay out existing obligations of AUSSAT. The money appropriated may be paid to AUSSAT as either of, or as a combination of, the following:
	(a)	additional share capital;
	(b)	loan capital.

	(8)	An authorisation given under subsection (2) or (3) after the transition has no effect, or is taken to have had no effect, as the case requires.
6  AUSSAT not within the shield of the Crown
To avoid doubt, AUSSAT:
	(a)	is not, does not form part of, does not represent, and is not an instrumentality or agency of, the Crown; and
	(b)	is taken never to have been, formed part of, represented, or been an instrumentality or agency of, the Crown.
7  Clarification of AUSSAT’s status for income tax purposes

8  Removal of AUSSAT’s tax losses [see Note 2]

	(3)	In subsection (1) and (2): 
law means:
	(a)	a law (whether written or unwritten) of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory; or
	(b)	regulations or any other instrument made under such a law.
