Insert: 

15AA  Bail not to be granted in certain cases

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>Despite any other law of the Commonwealth, a bail authority must not grant

bail to a person (the _defendant_) charged with, or convicted of,

an offence covered by subsection&#160;(2) unless the bail authority is

satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist to justify bail.</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>This subsection covers: </dd> </dl></dl>

	(a)	a terrorism offence; and
 	(b)	an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, if:
 	(i)	a physical element of the offence is that the defendant engaged in conduct that caused the death of a person; and
 	(ii)	the fault element for that physical element is that the defendant intentionally engaged in that conduct (whether or not the defendant intended to cause the death, or knew or was reckless as to whether the conduct would result in the death); and
 	(c)	an offence against a provision of Division&#160;80 or Division&#160;91 of the _Criminal Code_, or against section&#160;24AA of this Act, if:
 	(i)	the death of a person is alleged to have been caused by conduct that is a physical element of the offence; or
 	(ii)	conduct that is a physical element of the offence carried a substantial risk of causing the death of a person; and
 	(d)	an ancillary offence against a provision of Division&#160;80 or Division&#160;91 of the _Criminal Code_, or against section&#160;24AA of this Act, if, had the defendant engaged in conduct that is a physical element of the primary offence to which the ancillary offence relates, there would have been a substantial risk that the conduct would have caused the death of a person.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(3)</dt><dd>To avoid doubt, the express reference in paragraph&#160;(2)(d) to an

ancillary offence does not imply that references in paragraphs&#160;(2)(a), (b)

or (c) to an offence do not include references to ancillary offences.</dd> <dt>(4)</dt><dd>To avoid doubt, except as provided by subsection&#160;(1), this section does not affect the operation of a law of a State or a Territory. </dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note:	Subsection&#160;(1) indirectly affects laws of the States

 	(c)	an offence against Division&#160;80 or 91 of the _Criminal Code_.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note:	A sentence for a minimum non-parole offence is a federal

sentence, because such an offence is a federal offence.

 </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(2)</dt><dd>The court must fix a single non-parole period of at least <sup>3</sup>/4

</dd> </dl></dl>

	(a)	the sentence for the minimum non-parole offence; or
 	(b)	if 2 or more sentences have been imposed on the person for minimum non-parole offences&#151;the aggregate of those sentences.

The non-parole period is in respect of all federal sentences the person is to serve or complete.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(3)</dt><dd>For the purposes of subsection&#160;(2):

</dd> </dl></dl>

	(a)	a sentence of imprisonment for life for a minimum non-parole offence is taken to be a sentence of imprisonment for 30 years for the offence; and
 	(b)	it does not matter:
 	(i)	whether or not the sentences mentioned in that subsection were imposed at the same sitting; or
 	(ii)	whether or not the convictions giving rise to those sentences were at the same sitting; or

337A  Meaning of _foreign indictable offence_

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>If:

</dd> </dl></dl>

	(a)	an application (the _current application_) is made for a <sup>*</sup>restraining order or <sup>*</sup>confiscation order in relation to conduct that constituted an offence against a law of a foreign country; and
 	(b)	if the conduct had occurred in Australia at the testing time referred to in subsection&#160;(2), the conduct would have constituted an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory punishable by at least 12 months imprisonment;

then, for the purposes of the current application, the conduct is treated as having constituted a _foreign indictable offence_ at all relevant times.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Example:	X commits an offence against a law of a foreign country

at a time when the conduct is not an offence against Australian law. X then

derives literary proceeds in relation to the offence and transfers the proceeds

to Australia. After the proceeds are transferred, a new Commonwealth offence is

created that applies to the type of conduct concerned. An application is then

made for a literary proceeds order. For the purposes of the proceedings for

that order, the original conduct is treated as having constituted a foreign

indictable offence at all relevant times and accordingly an order can be made

in respect of those proceeds.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(2)</dt><dd>The _testing time_ for the current application is:

</dd> </dl></dl>

	(a)	if the current application is an application for a <sup>*</sup>restraining order&#151;the time when the current application was made; or
 	(b)	if the current application is an application for a <sup>*</sup>confiscation order (other than a <sup>*</sup>literary proceeds order) in relation to a restraining order&#151;the time when the application for the restraining order was made; or
 	(c)	if:
 	(i)	the current application is an application for a literary proceeds order; and
 	(ii)	an earlier restraining order has been made in respect of the same offence;
 		the time when the application was made for that earlier restraining order; or
 	(d)	if the current application is an application for a literary proceeds order but paragraph&#160;(c) does not apply&#151;the time when the current application was made.
