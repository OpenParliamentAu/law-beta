An Act to repeal the _Australian Science, Technology and Engineering Council Act 1978_, and for other purposes

[_Assented to 17 June 1998_]

The Parliament of Australia enacts:

##### <a id="1"></a>1  Short title

                   This Act may be cited as the _Australian Science, Technology and Engineering Council Repeal Act 1998_.

##### <a id="2"></a>2  Commencement

             (1)  Subject to this section, this Act commences on the day on which it receives the Royal Assent.

             (2)  Subject to subsection (3), section 3 and Schedule 1 commence on a day to be fixed by Proclamation.

             (3)  If section 3 and Schedule 1 do not commence under subsection (2) within 6 months after the day on which this Act receives the Royal Assent, that section and Schedule commence on the day after the end of that period. 

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Schedule(s)

                   Subject to section 2, each Act that is specified in a Schedule to this Act is amended or repealed as set out in the applicable items in the Schedule concerned, and any other item in a Schedule to this Act has effect according to its terms.

###### Schedule 1—Repeal of the Australian Science, Technology and Engineering Council Act 1978

## 1  The whole of the Act

Repeal the Act.

## 2  Council to continue in existence for purposes of making a final report to the Minister

(1)        Despite the repeal effected by item 1, the Australian Science, Technology and Engineering Council (the **_Council_**) continues in existence for the purpose of performing its functions under this item.

(2)        As soon as practicable after the commencement of this Schedule, the Council must prepare and give to the Minister a report of the operations of the Council during the period that began on 1 July 1997 and ended at that commencement.

(3)        Subject to subitem (4), the report is to set out all requests made by the Minister under subsection 6(1) of the _Australian Science, Technology and Engineering Council Act 1978_ (the **_repealed Act_**), and all directions given by the Minister under section 8 of that Act, during the period to which the report relates.

(4)        The report must not, without the Minister’s consent, disclose the contents of a report given to the Minister under section 6 of the repealed Act before the last-mentioned report has been laid before either House of the Parliament.

(5)        Subject to subitem (6), the Minister must cause the report to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after the report is received by him or her.

(6)        If the laying of the report before the Parliament in accordance with subitem (5) would result in:

                     (a)  the disclosure of information that would, in the Minister’s opinion, be contrary to the public interest because it would prejudice:

                              (i)  Australia’s security, defence or international relations; or

                             (ii)  relations between the Commonwealth and any State; or

                     (b)  the disclosure of information received by the Council in confidence;

the Minister must either:

                     (c)  cause the report to be laid before the Parliament with such deletions as the Minister thinks necessary to avoid that result; or

                     (d)  ensure that the report is not laid before the Parliament until the Minister is satisfied that laying the report before the Parliament would not have that result.

(7)        The Council ceases to exist at the end of the day on which the report is received by the Minister.

(8)        The Minister may give a written certificate specifying the day on which the report is received by him or her. Unless the contrary is established, a certificate so given is conclusive evidence that the report was received by the Minister on the day specified in the certificate.

## 3  Protection against actions

(1)        No action, suit or other proceeding lies:

                     (a)  against a person who is or has been:

                              (i)  a member of the Australian Science, Technology and Engineering Council (the **_Council_**); or

                             (ii)  a member of a committee of the Council appointed under section 24 of the _Australian Science, Technology and Engineering Council Act 1978_ (the **_repealed Act_**); or

                            (iii)  a member of the staff of the Council; or

                            (iv)  an officer or employee of a Commonwealth authority performing services for the Council; or

                             (v)  a consultant to the Council;

                            for or in relation to anything done or omitted to be done in good faith for the purposes of the repealed Act or this Schedule; or

                     (b)  against any person for or in relation to the giving of any information by that person in good faith for the purposes of the repealed Act or this Schedule to:

                              (i)  the Council; or

                             (ii)  a committee appointed under section 24 of the repealed Act; or

                            (iii)  a person referred to in paragraph (a).
