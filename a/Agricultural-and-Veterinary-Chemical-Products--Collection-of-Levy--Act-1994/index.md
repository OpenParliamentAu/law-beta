             (4)  Subject to subsection (6), an amount notified by a person to the APVMA in accordance with this section as being the amount calculated by the person to be the levy payable in respect of a chemical product for a period or, if more than one amount has been so notified for that period, the amount last notified, is taken to be the amount of levy so payable.<o:p></o:p>

             (5)  Subject to subsection (6), if a notification by a person to the APVMA in accordance with this section or, if more than one notification has been made, the last such notification, states that the calculations made by the person show that no levy is payable in respect of a particular chemical product for a period, no levy is payable by the person in respect of that product for that period.<o:p></o:p>

           (10)  A failure to comply with subsection (9) does not affect the validity of the assessment.<o:p></o:p>

           (11)  An assessment is taken to be a decision for the purposes of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_.<o:p></o:p>

           (12)  The production of a notice of assessment, or of a document purporting to be a copy of a notice of assessment, signed on behalf of the APVMA by the Chief Executive Officer of the APVMA or a delegate of the Chief Executive Officer is conclusive evidence of the due making of the assessment and, except in proceedings under section 18 on a review or appeal relating to the assessment, that the amount and all the particulars of the assessment are correct.<o:p></o:p>

##### <a id="17"></a>17  Fresh assessments<o:p></o:p>

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), if the APVMA is satisfied that an assessment was incorrect, the APVMA may make a fresh assessment under section 16 in substitution for the original assessment, even though levy may have been paid in respect of the original assessment.<o:p></o:p>

##### <a id="18"></a>18  Reconsideration and review of assessments<o:p></o:p>

             (1)  A person who is affected by an assessment made by the APVMA may, if dissatisfied with the assessment, by written notice given to the APVMA within 21 days after the day on which the person first received notice of the assessment, or within any further period that the APVMA allows, request the APVMA to reconsider the assessment.<o:p></o:p>

             (2)  The person must set out in the request reasons for making the request.<o:p></o:p>

             (3)  Upon receipt of the request, the APVMA must reconsider the assessment and, subject to subsection (4), may confirm or revoke the assessment or vary the assessment in any manner that it thinks fit.<o:p></o:p>

             (4)  If the APVMA does not confirm, revoke or vary an assessment before the end of 21 days after the day on which it received the request under subsection (1) to reconsider the assessment, it is taken, at the end of that period, to have confirmed the assessment under subsection (3).<o:p></o:p>

             (5)  If the APVMA confirms, revokes or varies an assessment before the end of the period referred to in subsection (4), it must, by written notice given to the person making the request, tell the person the result of the reconsideration of the assessment and the reasons for confirming, varying or revoking the assessment, as the case may be.<o:p></o:p>

             (6)  A failure to comply with subsection (5) does not affect the validity of the confirmation, revocation or variation.<o:p></o:p>

             (9)  If an assessment is taken, because of subsection (4), to be confirmed, section 29 of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ applies as if the prescribed time for making application for review of the assessment were the period beginning on the day on which the assessment is taken to be confirmed and ending on the 28th day after that day.<o:p></o:p>

           (10)  If a request is made under subsection (1) in respect of an assessment, section 41 of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ applies as if the making of the request were the making of an application to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of the assessment.<o:p></o:p>
