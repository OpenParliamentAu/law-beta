             (2)  A person must not, without reasonable excuse, refuse or fail to comply with a requirement made under subsection (1).

                    Penalty:  30 penalty units.

             (3)  Subject to subsection (6), a person who has given to the NRA, under subparagraph (1)(b)(ii) or this subsection, a notification in writing in respect of the total leviable value (if any) in respect of a chemical product for a period and the amount of the levy (if any) that is payable may make a further calculation of that value and amount in substitution for the value and amount last so calculated and notify the NRA of the results of the further calculations and the basis on which the further calculations were made.

             (4)  Subject to subsection (6), an amount notified by a person to the NRA in accordance with this section as being the amount calculated by the person to be the levy payable in respect of a chemical product for a period or, if more than one amount has been so notified for that period, the amount last notified, is taken to be the amount of levy so payable.

             (5)  Subject to subsection (6), if a notification by a person to the NRA in accordance with this section or, if more than one notification has been made, the last such notification, states that the calculations made by the person show that no levy is payable in respect of a particular chemical product for a period, no levy is payable by the person in respect of that product for that period.

             (6)  Subsections (3), (4) and (5) do not apply in relation to a chemical product in respect of a period if the NRA has made or makes an assessment as to whether any levy is payable in respect of that product for that period.

##### <a id="16"></a>16  Assessment of levy by NRA

             (1)  The NRA may make an assessment as to whether any levy is payable in respect of leviable disposals of a particular chemical product during a particular period.

             (2)  An assessment may be made before, on or after the date that, apart from the assessment, would be the prescribed date for payment of the levy and whether or not any payment has been made on account of the levy.

             (3)  An assessment is to state the total leviable value (if any) in respect of the product for the period concerned and the amount of the levy (if any) payable.

             (4)  An assessment may be based on any information in the possession of the NRA, whether obtained as a result of the making of a requirement under this Act or otherwise.

             (5)  The NRA must give written notice of an assessment:

                     (a)  if any levy is assessed to be payable—to the person who it considers is liable to pay the levy; or

                     (b)  if no levy is assessed to be payable—to the person who, if levy had been payable, it considers would have been liable to pay the levy.

             (6)  A notice of assessment must contain particulars of any determination made by the NRA under paragraph 6(a).

             (7)  If any levy is payable, the notice must state the date by which the levy is to be paid.

             (8)  The date to be so stated must not be earlier than whichever is the later of the following dates:

                     (a)  the date that, apart from the assessment, would be the prescribed date for payment of the levy;

                     (b)  the 21st day after the day on which the notice is given.

             (9)  A notice of an assessment must include a statement to the effect of section 18.

           (10)  A failure to comply with subsection (9) does not affect the validity of the assessment.

           (11)  An assessment is taken to be a decision for the purposes of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_.

           (12)  The production of a notice of assessment, or of a document purporting to be a copy of a notice of assessment, signed on behalf of the NRA by the Chief Executive Officer of the NRA or a delegate of the Chief Executive Officer is conclusive evidence of the due making of the assessment and, except in proceedings under section 18 on a review or appeal relating to the assessment, that the amount and all the particulars of the assessment are correct.

##### <a id="17"></a>17  Fresh assessments

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), if the NRA is satisfied that an assessment was incorrect, the NRA may make a fresh assessment under section 16 in substitution for the original assessment, even though levy may have been paid in respect of the original assessment.

             (2)  A fresh assessment may:

                     (a)  if the original assessment was based on false or misleading information given to the NRA or to an inspector—be made at any time; or

                     (b)  otherwise—be made only within 4 years from the date on which levy became payable under the original assessment.

##### <a id="18"></a>18  Reconsideration and review of assessments

             (1)  A person who is affected by an assessment made by the NRA may, if dissatisfied with the assessment, by written notice given to the NRA within 21 days after the day on which the person first received notice of the assessment, or within any further period that the NRA allows, request the NRA to reconsider the assessment.

             (2)  The person must set out in the request reasons for making the request.

             (3)  Upon receipt of the request, the NRA must reconsider the assessment and, subject to subsection (4), may confirm or revoke the assessment or vary the assessment in any manner that it thinks fit.

             (4)  If the NRA does not confirm, revoke or vary an assessment before the end of 21 days after the day on which it received the request under subsection (1) to reconsider the assessment, it is taken, at the end of that period, to have confirmed the assessment under subsection (3).

             (5)  If the NRA confirms, revokes or varies an assessment before the end of the period referred to in subsection (4), it must, by written notice given to the person making the request, tell the person the result of the reconsideration of the assessment and the reasons for confirming, varying or revoking the assessment, as the case may be.

             (6)  A failure to comply with subsection (5) does not affect the validity of the confirmation, revocation or variation.

             (7)  Applications may be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of assessments of the NRA that have been confirmed or varied under subsection (3).

             (8)  If, as a result of an application made under paragraph 33(b), the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has reviewed a determination made by the NRA under paragraph 6(a) in relation to a chemical product as at a particular time, the Tribunal is not entitled to alter the determination as so reviewed by it when it is reviewing an assessment to which the determination is relevant.

             (9)  If an assessment is taken, because of subsection (4), to be confirmed, section 29 of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ applies as if the prescribed time for making application for review of the assessment were the period beginning on the day on which the assessment is taken to be confirmed and ending on the 28th day after that day.

           (10)  If a request is made under subsection (1) in respect of an assessment, section 41 of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ applies as if the making of the request were the making of an application to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of the assessment.

                     (b)  the occupier of the premises consents in writing;

the things may be moved to another place so that the examination or processing can be carried out in order to determine whether they are things that may be seized under section 21 or 22, as the case may be.

contains records that are relevant to determining whether levy is payable under this Act or an offence against this Act has been committed, as the case requires.

             (2)  If the inspector or a person helping the inspector, after equipment at the premises is operated, finds that the equipment contains records of that kind or that a disk, tape or other storage device at the premises contains records of that kind, he or she may:

                     (a)  seize the equipment or the disk, tape or other storage device; or

                     (b)  if the records can, by using facilities at the premises, be put in documentary form—operate the facilities to put the records in that form and seize the documents so produced; or

                              (i)  that is brought to the premises; or

                             (ii)  that is at the premises and the use of which for the purpose has been agreed to in writing by the occupier of the premises;
