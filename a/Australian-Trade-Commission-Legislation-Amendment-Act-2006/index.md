                     (a)  deal with, and give effect to, the certificate as if it were a proper and appropriate instrument for transactions in relation to assets of that kind; and

                     (b)  make such entries in the register as are necessary, having regard to the effect of this Schedule.

## 6  Substitution of Commonwealth as a party to pending proceedings

If any proceedings to which the old Commission was a party were pending in any court or tribunal immediately before the commencement time, the Commonwealth is substituted for the old Commission, from the commencement time, as a party to the proceedings.

## 7  Transfer of custody of old Commission records

(1)       This item applies to any records or documents that, immediately before the commencement time, were in the custody of the old Commission.

(2)       The records and documents are to be transferred into the custody of the CEO at or after the commencement time.

## 8  Access by Board members to records

For the purposes of the operation of subsection 27L(4) of the _Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997_ in relation to the books of the old Commission, the reference in that subsection to a Commonwealth authority is to be read, after the commencement time, as a reference to the CEO.

<h7 class="ActHead7">Part 3—Reference to, and things done by or in relation to, old Commission</h7>

## 9  References in instruments

References to old Commission taken to be references to CEO or Commonwealth

(1)       If:

                     (a)  an instrument is in force immediately before the commencement time; and

                     (b)  the instrument contains a reference to the old Commission (including a reference to the Board, the Managing Director or the Deputy Managing Director);

the instrument has effect from the commencement time as if the reference were a reference to the CEO.

(2)       However, if:

                     (a)  an instrument is in force immediately before the commencement time; and

                     (b)  the instrument relates to assets or liabilities covered by item 2 or 3; and

                     (c)  the instrument refers to the old Commission (including a reference to the Board, the Managing Director or the Deputy Managing Director);

the reference is to be read as a reference to the Commonwealth as necessary to give effect to item 2 or 3, as the case requires.

References to staff of old Commission taken to be references to staff of new Commission

(3)       If:

                     (a)  an instrument is in force immediately before the commencement time; and

                     (b)  the instrument contains a reference to a member of the staff of the old Commission;

the instrument has effect from the commencement time as if the reference to the member of the staff of the old Commission were a reference to a member of the staff of the new Commission referred to in section 60 of the new law.

Minister and regulations may provide otherwise

(4)       The Minister may, by writing, determine that subitem (1), (2) or (3):

                     (a)  does not apply in relation to a specified reference; or

                     (b)  applies as if:

                              (i)  in the case of subitem (1)—the reference in that subitem to the CEO were a reference to the Commonwealth; or

                             (ii)  in the case of subitem (2)—the reference in that subitem to the Commonwealth were a reference to the CEO; or

                            (iii)  in the case of subitem (3)—the reference in that subitem to a member of the staff of the Commission were a reference to the CEO.

A determination under this subitem has effect accordingly.

(5)       The regulations may provide that an instrument containing a reference specified in a determination under paragraph (4)(a) has effect from the commencement time as if:

                     (a)  in the case of an instrument covered by subitem (1)—the reference were a reference to a specified person or body other than the Commonwealth or the CEO; or

                     (b)  in the case of an instrument covered by subitem (2)—the reference were a reference to a specified person or body other than the Commonwealth or the CEO; or

                     (c)  in the case of an instrument covered by subitem (3)—the reference were a reference to a specified person or body other than the CEO or a member of the staff of the Commission.

Determinations are not legislative instruments

(6)       A determination under subitem (4) is not a legislative instrument.

## 10  Operation of laws

Things done by old Commission taken to be done by CEO

(1)       If, before the commencement time, a thing was done by, or in relation to, the old Commission (including the Board, the Managing Director or the Deputy Managing Director), then, for the purposes of the operation of any law of the Commonwealth after the commencement time, the thing is taken to have been done by, or in relation to, the CEO.

(2)       For the purposes of subitem (1), a thing done before the commencement time under a provision that is amended by this Act has effect from that time as if it were done under that provision as amended. However, this is not taken to change the time at which the thing was actually done.

Minister and regulations may provide otherwise

(3)       The Minister may, by writing, determine that subitem (1):

                     (a)  does not apply in relation to a specified thing done by, or in relation to, the old Commission; or

                     (b)  applies as if the reference in that subitem to the CEO were a reference to the Commonwealth.

A determination under this subitem has effect accordingly.

(4)       The regulations may provide for a thing specified in a determination under paragraph (3)(a) to be taken to have been done by, or in relation to, a specified person or body other than the Commonwealth or the CEO.

Meaning of **doing**

(5)       To avoid doubt, for the purposes of this item, **_doing_** a thing includes making an instrument.

Determinations are not legislative instruments

(6)       A determination made under subitem (3) is not a legislative instrument.

## 11  Continued effect of certain instruments made under the old law

The amendments made to the following sections of the _Australian Trade Commission Act 1985_ do not affect the continuity of an instrument made under one of those sections:

                     (a)  section 10;

                     (b)  section 54;

                     (c)  section 55;

                     (d)  section 57;

                     (e)  section 64;

                      (f)  subsection 90(2).

## 12  Financial statements and other reporting requirements

Reporting requirements

(1)       If:

                     (a)  immediately before the commencement time, a law required the old Commission (including the Managing Director) to provide a report (whether financial statements or otherwise) for a period; and

                     (b)  the period ends after the commencement time;

the CEO must provide the report, as required, for so much of the period as occurs before the commencement time.

(2)       If:

                     (a)  under subitem (1), the CEO is required to provide a report for a part of a period; and

                     (b)  the CEO is also required to provide a similar report for the remainder of the period;

the CEO may meet the requirements in a single report for the period.

Outstanding reporting requirements

(3)       If:

                     (a)  a law required the old Commission (including the Managing Director) to provide a report (whether financial statements or otherwise) for a period that ended before the commencement time; and

                     (b)  the report has not been provided by the commencement time;

the CEO must provide the report as required.

## 13  Continuation of secrecy obligations

Despite the amendment of section 94 of the _Australian Trade Commission Act 1985_ by this Act, that section continues to apply after the commencement time, in relation to anything done by a person to whom that section applies immediately before that time, as if the amendments had not been made.

<h7 class="ActHead7">Part 4—CEO and staff</h7>

## 14  CEO

The person holding office as the Managing Director under subsection 51(1) of the old law immediately before the commencement time is taken to have been duly appointed as the CEO by the Minister under subsection 51(1) of the new law:

                     (b)  the old Commission’s staffing procedures to apply, or to continue to apply, in relation to:

                              (i)  processes begun before, but not completed by, the commencement time; or

                             (ii)  things done by, for or in relation to the old Commission or a staff member of the old Commission before the commencement time; or

                     (c)  the new Commission’s staffing procedures to apply in relation to:

                              (i)  processes begun before, but not completed by, the commencement time; or

                             (ii)  things done by, for or in relation to the old Commission or a staff member of the old Commission before the commencement time.

(3)       Regulations made under this item have effect despite the _Public Service Act 1999_.

(4)       In this item:

**_staffing procedures_** includes procedures and policies related to recruitment, promotion, performance management, inefficiency, misconduct, forfeiture of position, fitness for duty, loss of essential qualifications, disciplinary action, reviews of or appeals against staffing decisions, transfers, redundancy, resignations, termination of employment, grievance processes and leave.

<h7 class="ActHead7">Part 5—Miscellaneous</h7>

No stamp duty or other tax is payable under a law of a State or Territory in respect of, or in respect of anything connected with:

                     (a)  the transfer of an asset or liability under this Schedule; or

## 19  Certificates taken to be authentic

A document that appears to be a certificate made or issued under a particular provision of this Schedule:
