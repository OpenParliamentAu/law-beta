##### <a id="28"></a>28  Allocations of payments to local government bodies

             (1)  Money expended by a State by way of funding government authorities to carry out the construction or maintenance of local roads shall not be taken to have been expended in accordance with this Act unless the money is allocated by the State between local government bodies and government authorities that are not local government bodies in accordance with:

## Table A

### Application, saving or transitional provisions

_AusLink (National Land Transport—Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Act 2005 (No. 94, 2005)_

## Schedule 2

## 1  Definition of _transition time_

In this Schedule:

**_transition time_** means the commencement of this Schedule.

## 2  Determination of what approvals become approvals under the _AusLink (__National__Land__Transport) Act 2005_

(1)        The Minister may, in writing, determine:

                     (a)  that specified approvals of projects or programs (each of which is a **_carried over approval_**) that are in force under subsection 26(3) of the _Australian Land Transport Development Act 1988_ immediately before the transition time are to be taken, after that time, to be approvals properly granted under the _AusLink (National Land Transport) Act 2005_; and

                     (b)  for each of those carried over approvals—whether the approval is to be taken to be an approval of an AusLink National Project, an AusLink Transport Development and Innovation Project or an AusLink Black Spot Project (within the meaning of the _AusLink (__National__Land__Transport) Act 2005_).

(2)        The determination has effect accordingly.

(3)        The Minister may, in writing, vary the determination to correct an error.

(4)        The Minister cannot vary the determination except as permitted by subitem (3) and cannot revoke the determination.

(5)        For the purposes of the _AusLink (National Land Transport) Act 2005_, an amount paid under the _Australian Land Transport Development Act 1988_ before the transition time in respect of a project or program to which a carried over approval relates is to be counted towards the maximum funding amount that may be provided under the _AusLink (National Land Transport) Act 2005_ for the project or program.

(6)        The determination under subitem (1), or an instrument varying the determination, is a legislative instrument for the purposes of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_, but neither section 42 nor Part 6 of that Act applies to the instrument.

## 3  Appropriation

$1,371,489,000 is appropriated out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund in respect of the financial year ending on 30 June 2005, for the purpose of:

                     (a)  making payments under the _AusLink (National Land Transport) Act 2005_ during so much of that year as occurs after the transition time; and

                     (b)  making payments under the _Australian__Land__Transport Development Act 1988_ during so much of that year as occurs after the transition time.

## 4  Final charge rate determination

(1)        Despite the amendments made by Schedule 1 to this Act, section 10 of the _Australian__Land__Transport Development Act 1988_, as in force immediately before the transition time, continues to have effect after the transition time for the purpose of the making of a determination under that section in respect of the financial year ending on 30 June 2005.

(2)        A determination under section 10 of the _Australian Land Transport Development Act 1988_, as that section continues to have effect under subitem (1), has effect for the purposes of that Act as in force from 1 July 2004 to the transition time.
