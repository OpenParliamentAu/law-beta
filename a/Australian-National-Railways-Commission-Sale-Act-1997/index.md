_residual liability_ means liabilities and duties of the Commission, including contingent and prospective ones, immediately before the repeal day.

3  Residual assets and liabilities to become Commonwealth assets and liabilities

(1)	By force of this item, all the residual assets of the Commission cease to be assets of the Commission and become assets of the Commonwealth on the repeal day.
 (2)	By force of this item, all residual liabilities of the Commission cease to be liabilities of the Commission and become liabilities of the Commonwealth on the repeal day.
 (3)	A residual instrument continues to have effect on and after the repeal day as if a reference in the instrument to the Commission were a reference to the Commonwealth.

4  Provisions continue to apply

In spite of the repeal of the _Australian National Railways Commission Act 1983_ by this Schedule, that Act continues to apply in relation to residual assets and residual liabilities as if those residual assets and residual liabilities were assets and liabilities transferred to the Commonwealth under section 67AE or 67AG of that Act.

4A  Registration of transfers after repeal

Despite the repeal of the _Australian National Railways Commission Act 1983_ by this Schedule, section&#160;67AZJ of that Act continues to apply, in relation to any right, title or interest in land that vested in a person under section&#160;67AE or 67AM of that Act before its repeal, as if the repeal had not happened.

5  Pending proceedings

If, immediately before the repeal day, proceedings to which the Commission was a party are pending in a court, then, on and after the repeal day, the Commonwealth is substituted for the Commission in the proceedings and has the same rights and obligations as the Commission would have had in the proceedings.
