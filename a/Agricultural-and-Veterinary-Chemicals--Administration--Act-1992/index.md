             (2)  The APVMA has any functions and powers that are expressed to be conferred on it by a law of a State.

                             (ii)  the registration or listed registration of the chemical product;

                            (iii)  the approval of a label for containers for the chemical product;

                            if the variation may affect the GM product;

                     (c)  reconsidering any of the following:

                              (i)  the approval of the active constituent;

                             (ii)  the registration or listed registration of the chemical product;

                              (i)  the active constituent; or

                             (ii)  the chemical product.

             (3)  If the APVMA is required to consult the Gene Technology Regulator under subsection (2), the APVMA must give written notice to the Gene Technology Regulator:

                     (a)  stating that the application has been made, the reconsideration is to be undertaken, or the issue of the permit is being considered; and

                     (b)  requesting the Gene Technology Regulator to give advice about the application, reconsideration, or issue.

             (4)  If the APVMA gives the Gene Technology Regulator a notice under subsection (3), the Gene Technology Regulator may give written advice to the APVMA about the application, reconsideration, or issue.

             (5)  The advice is to be given within the period specified in the notice.

             (6)  If the APVMA receives advice from the Gene Technology Regulator in response to a notice under this section within the period specified in the notice, the APVMA must:

                     (a)  ensure that the advice is taken into account in making a decision on the application, reconsideration, or issue to which the notice relates; and

                     (b)  inform the Gene Technology Regulator of the decision.

             (7)  Unless the contrary intention appears, expressions used in this section have the same meanings as in the _Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act 1994_.

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Agreements and arrangements

             (1)  The Minister, or a person authorised in writing by the Minister, may enter into an agreement or arrangement with a Minister of a State for the performance of functions or the exercise of powers by the APVMA as an agent of the State.

             (2)  The APVMA has such functions and powers as are referred to in such an agreement or arrangement.

##### <a id="9A"></a>9A  APVMA to comply with policies of Governments of Commonwealth, States and participating Territories

                   If there is an agreement in force between the Government of the Commonwealth and the Governments of all or any of the States and participating Territories for the purposes of this Act and the Agvet Codes, the APVMA must, in the performance of its functions and the exercise of its powers, comply with any policies of those Governments determined under the agreement.

##### <a id="10"></a>10  Minister may give directions

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), the Minister may give written directions to the APVMA concerning the performance of its functions or the exercise of its powers, and the APVMA must comply with any such direction.

             (2)  The Minister must not give a direction to the APVMA unless:

                     (a)  the Minister is satisfied that it is necessary to give the direction to the APVMA in order to ensure that, in performing its functions, or exercising its powers, the APVMA complies with policies referred to in section 9A; and

                     (b)  the Minister has given to the APVMA a written notice stating that the Minister is considering giving the direction; and

                     (c)  the Minister has given to the Chief Executive Officer an adequate opportunity to discuss with the Minister the need for the proposed direction.

             (3)  Subject to subsection (4), if the Minister gives a direction to the APVMA, the Minister must:

                     (a)  cause a notice setting out particulars of the direction to be published in the _Gazette_ as soon as practicable after giving the direction; and

             (4)  Subsection (3) does not apply in relation to a particular direction if the Minister determines, in writing, that compliance with the subsection is undesirable because it would, or would be likely to, be prejudicial to the national interest of Australia.

             (5)  A direction under subsection (1) is not a legislative instrument.

##### <a id="10A"></a>10A  Chief Executive Officer not subject to direction on certain matters
