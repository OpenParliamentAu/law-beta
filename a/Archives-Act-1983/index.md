             (3)  Where an arrangement entered into by the Archives to accept the custody of records from a person other than a Commonwealth institution relates to a Commonwealth record, then, to the extent that that arrangement, in so far as it relates to such a record, is inconsistent with a provision of Part V, that provision shall prevail.

                     (g)  information or matter the disclosure of which under this Act would involve the unreasonable disclosure of information relating to the personal affairs of any person (including a deceased person);

                     (h)  information or matter relating to trade secrets, or any other information or matter having a commercial value that would be, or could reasonably be expected to be, destroyed or diminished if the information or matter were disclosed;

                      (j)  information or matter (other than information or matter referred to in paragraph (h)) concerning a person in respect of his or her business or professional affairs or concerning the business, commercial or financial affairs of an organization or undertaking, being information or matter the disclosure of which would, or could reasonably be expected to, unreasonably affect that person adversely in respect of his or her lawful business or professional affairs or that organization or undertaking in respect of its lawful business, commercial or financial affairs.

             (2)  For the purposes of this Act, a Commonwealth record is an exempt record if it is of such a nature that:

                     (a)  it would be privileged from production in legal proceedings on the ground of legal professional privilege; and

                     (b)  disclosure of the record would be contrary to the public interest.

             (3)  For the purposes of this Act, a Commonwealth record is an exempt record if:

                              (i)  that relates to the personal affairs, or the business or professional affairs, of any person (including a deceased person); or

##### <a id="34"></a>34  Certificates by Ministers as to certain exempt records

             (1)  Where a Minister is satisfied that a record contains information or matter of a kind referred to in paragraph 33(1)(a) or (b), whether or not the record has been examined in accordance with section 35 and whether or not a decision has been given in respect of the record under that section, he or she may sign a certificate to that effect and, subject to the operation of this Part, such a certificate, so long as it remains in force, establishes conclusively that the record is an exempt record referred to in the relevant paragraph of subsection 33(1).

             (2)  Where a Minister is satisfied as mentioned in subsection (1) by reason only of information or matter contained in a particular part or particular parts of a record, the certificate under that subsection in respect of the record shall identify that part or those parts of the record as containing the information or matter by reason of which the certificate is given.

             (3)  Where a Minister is satisfied that information as to the existence or non–existence of a record as described in an application for access would, if contained in another record, cause that other record to be an exempt record for the reason that it would contain information or matter of a kind referred to in paragraph 33(1)(a) or (b), he or she may sign a certificate to that effect (specifying that reason).

             (4)  The regulations may prescribe a period as the period during which certificates under subsection (1) or (3), or any specified class of such certificates, remain in force unless sooner revoked.

             (5)  Regulations made in pursuance of subsection (4) may be expressed to apply to certificates signed before the day on which the regulations take effect, but a certificate that is in force at the time when any such regulations applying to the certificate take effect does not, by reason of the regulations, cease to be in force before the expiration of a period of one year from the date on which the regulations take effect.

             (6)  Notwithstanding subsection (4) and any regulations under that subsection, where a certificate under this section has been signed in respect of a record, a further certificate under this section in respect of the record may be signed at any time, whether or not the first–mentioned certificate is still in force.

             (7)  Where a certificate under this section is in force in respect of a record, the record is not subject to examination under section 35.

             (8)  A Minister may, either generally or as otherwise provided by the instrument of delegation, by writing signed by him or her, delegate all or any of his or her powers under this section, other than this power of delegation, to:

                     (a)  the Secretary of a Department (within the meaning of the _Public Service Act 1999_); or

                     (b)  the person holding, in relation to a Commonwealth institution that is a prescribed authority for the purposes of the _Freedom of Information Act 1982_, an office by virtue of which he or she would, for the purposes of that Act, be the principal officer in respect of that Commonwealth institution;

                     (c)  the person holding, in relation to a Commonwealth institution that is not a prescribed authority for the purposes of the _Freedom of Information Act 1982_, an office declared by the regulations to be the relevant office in respect of that Commonwealth institution; or

                     (d)  a person performing the duties of an office referred to in paragraph (a), (b) or (c).

             (9)  A power delegated by a Minister under subsection (8), when exercised by the delegate, shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to have been exercised by the Minister.

           (10)  A delegation by a Minister under subsection (8) does not prevent the exercise of a power by the Minister.

##### <a id="35"></a>35  Identification of exempt records

             (1)  The Director–General, in consultation with the responsible Minister or a person authorized by the responsible Minister, shall make arrangements for determining the Commonwealth records in the open access period that are to be treated by the Archives as being exempt records and may make arrangements for determining the extent to which access in part to Commonwealth records identified as exempt records may be given without disclosing the information or matter by reason of which the records are exempt records.

             (2)  Except in the case of records exempted from transfer to the custody of Archives by virtue of a determination under section 29, an examination of records for the purposes of subsection (1) shall be conducted on premises of the Archives.

             (3)  The identification of records as exempt records in accordance with this section shall be conducted in accordance with programs approved by the Director–General and may take place before the records concerned become records in the open access period.

             (4)  Determinations under subsection (1) in respect of records identified as exempt records shall be reviewed, in accordance with arrangements made as referred to in that subsection, at such intervals as the Director–General thinks appropriate having regard to the nature of the records concerned and any other relevant circumstances and whenever necessary for the purposes of reconsideration of a decision in accordance with section 42.

             (5)  The functions of the Archives with respect to public access to Commonwealth records in the open access period shall be performed in conformity with the determinations made from time to time under this section, except to the extent that any such determination is inconsistent with a decision of the Tribunal on a review under this Act.

##### <a id="36"></a>36  Forms of access

             (1)  Where the Archives is required by this Part to cause a record to be made available for public access, any person is, subject to this Part, entitled to access to the record.

             (2)  Access to a record may be given to a person in one or more of the following forms:

                     (a)  a reasonable opportunity to inspect the record;

                     (b)  on payment of a charge determined in accordance with the regulations, provision to the person of a copy of the record;

                     (c)  in the case of a record from which information or matter can be produced or made available in a particular form by means of a computer, projector or other equipment, provision, on payment of a charge determined in accordance with the regulations, of access to that information or matter by the use of that equipment;

                     (d)  in the case of a record by which words are recorded in a manner in which they are capable of being reproduced in the form of sound or in which words are contained in the form of shorthand writing or in codified form, provision, on payment of a charge determined in accordance with the regulations, of a written transcript of the words recorded or contained in the record.

             (3)  Subject to subsection (4), where a person has applied for access in a particular form, access shall be given in that form.

             (4)  Where the giving of access under this Part in the form requested by the person in his or her application for access:

                     (a)  would interfere unreasonably with the operations of the Archives or of another Commonwealth institution that has the custody of the record;

                     (b)  would not, having regard to the physical nature of the record, be appropriate;

                     (c)  would be detrimental to the preservation of the record; or

                     (d)  would, but for this Act, involve an infringement of copyright (other than copyright owned by the Commonwealth, a Commonwealth institution, a State, the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory) subsisting in matter contained in the record, being matter that does not relate to the affairs of a Commonwealth institution;

access in that form may be refused and access given in another form.

             (5)  The reference in subsection (4) to copyright owned by a Commonwealth institution shall not be taken to extend to copyright owned by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation or the Special Broadcasting Service Corporation in a work or other subject matter forming part of its program material.

##### <a id="37"></a>37  Conditions in respect of proper care of records

             (1)  The Director–General may, for the purpose of ensuring the safe custody and proper preservation of any record, determine reasonable conditions to which access to the record is to be subject, or determine that the record is to be withheld from public access.

             (2)  Where a record is withheld in accordance with subsection (1), a copy shall be provided where, in the opinion of the Director–General, it is practicable to do so without detriment to the proper preservation or safe custody of the record.

##### <a id="38"></a>38  Access to part of exempt record

                   Where a record that would otherwise be required to be made available for public access under this Part is an exempt record, the Archives may, where it is reasonably practicable to do so, make arrangements for part of, or a copy of part of, that record to which access could be given without disclosing information or matter by reason of which the record is an exempt record to be made available for public access in accordance with this Part.

##### <a id="39"></a>39  Information as to existence of certain documents

             (1)  Nothing in this Act shall be taken to require the Archives to give information as to the existence or non–existence of a record where information as to the existence or non–existence of that record, if included in a Commonwealth record, would cause that last–mentioned record to be an exempt record by virtue of paragraph 33(1)(a), (b) or (e).

             (2)  Where an application to the Archives for access to a record relates to a record that is, or if it existed would be, of a kind referred to in subsection (1), the Archives may give notice in writing to the applicant that the Archives neither confirms nor denies the existence, as a Commonwealth record, of such a record but that, assuming the existence of such a record, it would be an exempt record, and, where such a notice is given:

                     (a)  section 40 applies as if the decision to give such a notice were a decision referred to in that section; and

                     (b)  the decision to give the notice shall, for the purposes of Division 4, be deemed to be a decision of the Archives refusing to grant the applicant access to the record on the ground that the record is an exempt record under paragraph 33(1)(a), (b) or (e), as the case may be.

##### <a id="40"></a>40  Notification of decisions

             (1)  This section applies in relation to an application to the Archives for access, or for an extension of partial access, to a record referred to in section 31, being an application:

                     (a)  in writing;

                     (b)  expressed to be made in accordance with this section;

                     (c)  specifying an address in Australia at which notices under this Act may be sent to the person making the application; and

                     (d)  providing such particulars, if any, concerning the record to which it relates as are contained in the Australian National Guide to Archival Material.

             (2)  The Archives shall give all reasonable assistance to persons to enable them to make applications complying with paragraph (1)(d).

             (3)  Where an application to which this section applies is made, the Archives shall take all reasonable steps to enable the applicant to be notified of a decision on the application as soon as practicable but in any case not later than 90 days after the day on which the application is received by the Archives.

             (4)  The regulations may make provision that subsection (3) is to have effect as if a specified shorter period were substituted for the period of 90 days specified in that subsection.

             (5)  Where, in relation to an application, a decision is made relating to a refusal to grant access to a record in accordance with the application, the decision–maker shall cause the applicant to be given notice in writing of the decision and the notice shall:

                     (a)  state the findings on any material questions of fact, referring to the material on which those findings were based, and state the reasons for the decision;

                     (b)  where the decision is a decision of the Archives—state the name and designation of the person making the decision; and

                     (c)  give to the applicant appropriate information concerning:

                              (i)  his or her rights with respect to a review of the decision;

                             (ii)  his or her rights to make a complaint to the Ombudsman in relation to the decision; and

                            (iii)  the procedure for the exercise of the rights referred to in subparagraphs (i) and (ii);

                            including (where applicable) particulars of the manner in which an application for review under section 42 may be made.

             (6)  Section 13 of the _Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977_ does not apply to a decision of the kind referred to in subsection (5).

             (7)  A notice under subsection (5) is not required to contain any matter that is of such a nature that its inclusion in a record would cause that record to be an exempt record under section 33.

             (8)  Where:

                     (a)  an application to which this section applies has been made;

                     (b)  the period of 90 days, or such other period as is applicable in accordance with regulations under subsection (4), has elapsed since the day on which the application was received by the Archives; and

                     (c)  notice of a decision on the application has not been received by the applicant;

the Archives shall, for the purpose of enabling an application to be made to the Tribunal under section 43, be deemed to have made, on the last day of that period, a decision refusing to grant access to the record on the ground that the record is an exempt record.

             (9)  Where a complaint is made to the Ombudsman under the _Ombudsman Act 1976_ concerning failure to make and notify to the applicant a decision on an application (whether the complaint was made before or after the expiration of the period referred to in subsection (8)), an application to the Tribunal under section 43 of this Act by virtue of that subsection shall not be made before the Ombudsman has informed the applicant of the result of the complaint in accordance with section 12 of the _Ombudsman Act 1976_.

           (10)  Where such a complaint is made before the expiration of the period referred to in subsection (8), the Ombudsman, after having investigated the complaint, may, if he or she is of the opinion that there has been unreasonable delay by the Archives in connection with the request, grant to the applicant a certificate certifying that he or she is of that opinion, and, if the Ombudsman does so, the Archives shall, for the purpose of enabling application to be made to the Tribunal under section 43, be deemed to have made, on the day on which the certificate is granted, a decision refusing to grant access to the record on the ground that the record is an exempt record.

           (11)  Where, after an application has been made to the Tribunal by virtue of subsection (8) but before the Tribunal has finally dealt with the application, a decision in the matter to which the application relates is given by the Archives, being a decision that is not satisfactory to the applicant, the Tribunal may, at the request of the applicant, treat the proceedings as extending to a review of that decision in accordance with this Part.

           (12)  Before dealing further with an application made to it by virtue of subsection (8), the Tribunal may, on the application of the Director–General, allow further time to the Archives to deal with the application for access.

### Division 4—Review of decisions

##### <a id="41"></a>41  Interpretation

                   For the purposes of this Division, unless the contrary intention appears, a certificate given under subsection 34(3) in respect of a record as described in an application for access shall be deemed to be a certificate given in respect of the record so described notwithstanding that the certificate does not acknowledge the existence or non–existence of the record so described.

##### <a id="42"></a>42  Internal reconsideration of decisions

             (1)  Where a person has made an application to which section 40 applies and is dissatisfied with the decision on the application, he or she may, within 28 days after the day on which notice of the decision was given to him or her or within such further period as the Archives allows, apply in writing to the Archives for a reconsideration of the decision.

             (2)  Where an application for reconsideration of a decision is made in accordance with this section, the Archives shall:

                     (a)  reconsider the decision and for that purpose arrange for any necessary review under section 35 of a determination under that section; and

                     (b)  as expeditiously as practicable, give notice to the applicant of the decision reached on the reconsideration (whether or not that decision confirms the previous decision).

             (3)  A decision by the Archives on an application in accordance with this section for reconsideration of a decision shall be made after consideration of the application by the Director–General or a person authorized by him or her to deal with such applications.

             (4)  The provisions of section 40 extend to a decision made under this section upon a review of a decision in relation to the provision of access to a record that is the subject of an application under that section.

##### <a id="43"></a>43  Applications to Administrative Appeals Tribunal

             (1)  Subject to this section, an application may be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of a decision of the Archives in respect of access to a record, being:

                     (a)  a decision refusing to grant to the applicant access to the record on the ground that the record is an exempt record or is a Commonwealth record to which Division 3 does not apply;

                     (b)  a decision refusing to grant an extension of partial access to the record on the ground that the record is an exempt record and it is not practicable to make arrangements for giving the further access desired by the applicant in a form that would not disclose information or matter by reason of which the record is an exempt record;

                     (c)  a decision refusing to grant to the applicant access to the record on the ground that the record has been withheld from public access pending examination of the record under section 35;

                     (d)  a decision refusing to grant to the applicant access to the record on the ground that a determination has been made under section 37 that the record is to be withheld from public access or refusing to grant to the applicant access to the record otherwise than on specified conditions determined under that section;

                     (e)  a decision refusing to grant to the applicant access to the record in a particular form by reason of paragraph 36(4)(a), (b) or (d); or

                      (f)  a decision refusing to allow a further period for making an application under subsection 42(1) for a reconsideration of a decision.

             (2)  Subject to subsection (3), where, in relation to a decision referred to in subsection (1), a person is or has been entitled to apply under section 42 for a reconsideration of the decision, that person is not entitled to make an application under subsection (1) in relation to that decision, but may make such an application in respect of the decision made on such a reconsideration.

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not prevent an application to the Tribunal in respect of a decision where:

                     (a)  the person concerned has applied under section 42 for a reconsideration of the decision;

                     (b)  a period of 14 days has elapsed since the day on which that application was received by the Archives; and

                     (c)  he or she has not been informed of the result of the review;

and such an application to the Tribunal may be treated by the Tribunal as having been made within the time allowed by subsection (4) if it appears to the Tribunal that there was no unreasonable delay in making the application to the Tribunal.

             (4)  Notwithstanding section 29 of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_, the period within which (subject to any extension granted by the Tribunal) an application under subsection (1) of this section is to be made in respect of a decision is:

                     (a)  except where paragraph (b) or (c) applies—the period commencing on the day on which notice of the decision was given to the applicant and ending on the sixtieth day after that day;

                     (b)  where the decision is a decision that is deemed by subsection 40(8) or (10) to have been made—the period commencing on the day on which the decision is deemed to have been made and ending on the sixtieth day after that day; or

                     (c)  where subsection 55(4) is applicable—the period commencing on the day on which the Ombudsman has informed the applicant as referred to in that subsection and ending on the sixtieth day after that day.

             (5)  If an application to the Tribunal for review of a decision is made before a reconsideration of the decision in accordance with section 42 has been completed and the result notified to the applicant, the Tribunal may, if it is satisfied that further time is reasonably necessary to enable the reconsideration to be completed, adjourn the proceedings for such time as it thinks fit.

             (6)  Section 28 of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ does not apply in relation to a decision in respect of which an application may be made to the Tribunal under this section where a notice under subsection 40(5) of this Act has been given to the applicant.

             (7)  If the Tribunal, upon application for a declaration under this subsection made to it by a person to whom a notice has been furnished under subsection 40(5), considers that the notice does not contain adequate particulars of findings on material questions of fact, an adequate reference to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based or adequate particulars of the reasons for the decision to which the notice relates, the Tribunal may make a declaration accordingly, and, where the Tribunal makes such a declaration, the person responsible for furnishing the notice shall, as soon as practicable but in any case within 28 days after the Tribunal makes the declaration, furnish to the applicant an additional notice or additional notices containing further and better particulars in relation to matters specified in the declaration with respect to those findings, that evidence or other material or those reasons.

##### <a id="44"></a>44  Powers of Tribunal

             (1)  Subject to this section, in proceedings under this Division, the Tribunal has, in addition to any other power, the power to review any decision of the Archives upon an application for access to a record and to decide any matter in relation to that application that, under this Act, could have been or could be decided by the Archives, and any decision of the Tribunal under this section has the same effect as a decision of the Archives.

             (2)  Where an applicant makes an application under section 43 in respect of a decision of the kind referred to in paragraph (1)(d) of that section, the Tribunal has power to grant access to the record to which the application relates, or to grant access to that record on particular conditions, notwithstanding any determination made by the Director–General under section 37 in relation to that record.

             (3)  Where, in proceedings before the Tribunal in pursuance of an application under section 43, it is established that a record is an exempt record, the Tribunal does not, except as provided by subsection (7), have power to decide that access is to be granted to the record.

             (4)  Where there is in force in respect of a record a certificate under section 34, the powers of the Tribunal do not extend to reviewing the decision to give the certificate but the Tribunal, constituted in accordance with section 46, may determine such question in relation to that certificate as is provided for in whichever of subsections (5) and (6) applies in relation to that certificate.

             (5)  Where application is or has been made to the Tribunal for the review of a decision refusing to grant access to a record in accordance with an application under section 40, being a record that is claimed to be an exempt record under paragraph 33(1)(a) or (b) and in respect of which a certificate is in force under subsection 34(1), the Tribunal shall, if the applicant so requests, determine the question whether there exist reasonable grounds for that claim.

             (6)  Where application is or has been made to the Tribunal for the review of a decision refusing to grant access to a record in accordance with an application under section 40, being a record in respect of which a certificate is in force under subsection 34(3), the Tribunal shall, if the applicant so requests, determine the question whether there exist reasonable grounds for the claim that information as to the existence or non–existence of the record would, if contained in another record, cause that other record to be an exempt record for the reason that it would contain information or matter of a kind referred to in paragraph 33(1)(a) or (b).

             (7)  On a review in pursuance of an application to the Tribunal under section 43, the Tribunal may, if it is satisfied that it would be practicable to give access to, or to a copy of, part of an exempt record in a form that would not disclose information or matter by reason of which the record is an exempt record, direct that access be given accordingly.

##### <a id="45"></a>45  Proceedings upon exercise of powers under subsection 44(5) or (6)

             (1)  Where, in considering a question referred to in subsection 44(5) or (6) in relation to a record in respect of which a certificate has been given, the Tribunal determines that there do not exist reasonable grounds for the claim to which the question relates, the appropriate Minister shall, not later than 28 days after the determination of the Tribunal is communicated to him or her, make a decision:

                     (a)  to revoke the certificate; or

                     (b)  not to revoke the certificate.

             (2)  Where a Minister makes a decision under subsection (1) to revoke a certificate:

                     (a)  in a case where the certificate was given under subsection 34(1)—the claim that the record to which the certificate relates is an exempt record shall be taken, for the purposes of this Act, to have been withdrawn; and

                     (b)  in a case where the certificate was given under subsection 34(3)—the Minister shall, forthwith upon the revocation of the certificate, inform the applicant of the existence or non–existence of the record to which the certificate relates.

             (3)  Where a Minister makes a decision under subsection (1) not to revoke a certificate, he or she shall:

                     (a)  cause notice in writing of the decision to be furnished to the applicant forthwith; and

                     (b)  cause a copy of the notice to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 5 sitting days of that House after the notice is so furnished.
