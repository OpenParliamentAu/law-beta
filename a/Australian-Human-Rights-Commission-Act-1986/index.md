             (3)  Without limiting the generality of the expression **_reasonable excuse_** in this section, it is hereby declared for the avoidance of doubt that it is a reasonable excuse for a person to refuse or fail to furnish information, produce a document or answer a question when required to do so under this Act, that the information, the production of the document or the answer to a question might tend to incriminate that person.

##### <a id="24"></a>24  Disclosure of information or contents of documents

             (1)  Where the Attorney‑General furnishes to the Commission a certificate certifying that the giving to the Commission, or to a person acting for or on behalf of the Commission, of information concerning a specified matter (including the giving of information in answer to a question) or the production to the Commission, or to a person acting for or on behalf of the Commission, of a specified document would be contrary to the public interest:

                     (a)  by reason that it would prejudice the security, defence or international relations of Australia; or

                     (b)  by reason that it would involve the disclosure of communications between a Minister of the Commonwealth and a Minister of a State, being a disclosure that would prejudice relations between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of a State; or

                     (c)  by reason that it would involve the disclosure of deliberations or decisions of the Cabinet or of a Committee of the Cabinet; or

neither the Commission nor any other person is entitled to require a person to give any information concerning the matter or to produce the document.

          (1A)  In relation to the performance of functions by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner under Part IIA, subsection (1) (other than paragraphs (1)(a) and (b)) has effect in relation to a certificate given by the Attorney‑General of a State or Territory in the same way as it has effect in relation to a certificate given by the Attorney‑General of the Commonwealth. For the purposes of this additional effect, references to the Cabinet, a Committee of the Cabinet or the Executive Council are to be treated as references to the corresponding body or committee of the State or Territory concerned.

             (2)  Without limiting the operation of subsection (1), where the Attorney‑General furnishes to the Commission a certificate certifying that the giving to the Commission, or to a person acting for or on behalf of the Commission, of information as to the existence or non‑existence of information concerning a specified matter (including the giving of information in answer to a question) or as to the existence or non‑existence of any one or more documents required to be produced to the Commission, or to a person acting for or on behalf of the Commission, would be contrary to the public interest:

                     (a)  by reason that it would prejudice the security, defence or international relations of Australia; or

                     (b)  by reason that it would prejudice the proper performance of the functions of the Australian Crime Commission;

                     (b)  from answering a question that the person is required to answer by a member before whom the person is attending in compliance with a notice served on the person under subsection 21(5);

on the ground that the giving of the information, the production of the document or the answering of the question:

                     (c)  would disclose legal advice furnished to a Minister, to a person or body that acts on behalf of the Commonwealth, or to an authority of the Commonwealth;

                     (d)  would contravene the provisions of any other Act or would be contrary to the public interest; or

                     (e)  might make the person liable to a penalty.

             (4)  A person is not liable to any penalty under the provisions of any other law by reason of:

                     (a)  giving information or producing a document when required to do so pursuant to this Act; or

_Section 3_

The General Conference of the International Labour Organisation, 

Having been convened at Geneva by the Governing Body of the International Labour Office, and having met in its Forty‑second Session on 4 June 1958, and 

Having decided upon the adoption of certain proposals with regard to discrimination in the field of employment and occupation, which is the fourth item on the agenda of the session, and 

Having determined that these proposals shall take the form of an international Convention, and 

Considering that the Declaration of Philadelphia affirms that all human beings, irrespective of race, creed or sex, have the right to pursue both their material well‑being and their spiritual development in conditions of freedom and dignity, of economic security and equal opportunity, and 

Considering further that discrimination constitutes a violation of rights enunciated by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,

adopts this twenty‑fifth day of June of the year one thousand nine hundred and fifty‑eight the following Convention, which may be cited as the Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention, 1958:

_Article 1_

1.       For the purpose of this Convention the term “discrimination” includes— 

(_a_)   any distinction, exclusion or preference made on the basis of race, colour, sex, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin, which has the effect of nullifying or impairing equality of opportunity or treatment in employment or occupation; 

(_b_)   such other distinction, exclusion or preference which has the effect of nullifying or impairing equality of opportunity or treatment in employment or occupation as may be determined by the Member concerned after consultation with representative employer’s and worker’s organisations, where such exist, and with other appropriate bodies. 

2.    Any distinction, exclusion or preference in respect of a particular job based on the inherent requirements thereof shall not be deemed to be discrimination. 

3.    For the purpose of this Convention the terms “employment” and “occupation” include access to vocational training, access to employment and to particular occupations, and terms and conditions of employment. 

_Article 2_

Each Member for which this Convention is in force undertakes to declare and pursue a national policy designed to promote, by methods appropriate to national conditions and practice, equality of opportunity and treatment in respect of employment and occupation, with a view to eliminating any discrimination in respect thereof.

(_c_)   to repeal any statutory provisions and modify any administrative instructions or practices which are inconsistent with the policy;

(_d_)   to pursue the policy in respect of employment under the direct control of a national authority; 

(_e_)   to ensure observance of the policy in the activities of vocational guidance, vocational training and placement services under the direction of a national authority; 

(_f_)    to indicate in its annual reports on the application of the Convention the action taken in pursuance of the policy and the results secured by such action. 

_Article 4_

Any measures affecting an individual who is justifiably suspected of, or engaged in, activities prejudicial to the security of the State shall not be deemed to be discrimination, provided that the individual concerned shall have the right to appeal to a competent body established in accordance with national practice. 

_Article 5_

1.    Special measures of protection or assistance provided for in other Conventions or Recommendations adopted by the International Labour Conference shall not be deemed to be discrimination. 

2.    Any Member may, after consultation with representative employers’ and workers’ organisations, where such exist, determine that other special measures designed to meet the particular requirements of persons who, for reasons such as sex, age, disablement, family responsibilities or social or cultural status, are generally recognised to require special protection or assistance, shall not be deemed to be discrimination. 

_Article 6_

Each Member which ratifies this Convention undertakes to apply it to non‑metropolitan territories in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation. 

_Article 7_

The formal ratifications of this Convention shall be communicated to the Director‑General of the International Labour Office for registration.

_Article 9_

1.    A Member which has ratified this Convention may denounce it after the expiration of ten years from the date on which the Convention first comes into force, by an act communicated to the Director‑General of the International Labour Office for registration. 

Such denunciation shall not take effect until one year after the date on which it is registered. 

2.    Each Member which has ratified this Convention and which does not, within the year following the expiration of the period of ten years mentioned in the preceding paragraph, exercise the right of denunciation provided for in this Article, will be bound for another period of ten years and, thereafter, may denounce this Convention at the expiration of each period of ten years under the terms provided for in this Article.

_Article 12_

At such times as it may consider necessary the Governing Body of the International Labour Office shall present to the General Conference a report on the working of this Convention and shall examine the desirability of placing on the agenda of the Conference the question of its revision in whole or in part. 

_Article 13_

1.    Should the Conference adopt a new Convention revising this Convention in whole or in part, then, unless the new Convention otherwise provides—

(_a_)    the ratification by a Member of the new revising Convention shall _ipso jure_ involve the immediate denunciation of this Convention, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 9 above, if and when the new revising Convention shall have come into force; 

(_b_)    as from the date when the new revising Convention comes into force this Convention shall cease to be open to ratification by the Members. 

2.    This Convention shall in any case remain in force in its actual form and content for those Members which have ratified it but have not ratified the revising Convention. 

_Article 14_

The English and French versions of the text of this Convention are equally authoritative.

The child shall have the right to adequate nutrition, housing, recreation and medical services. 

_Principle 5_

The child who is physically, mentally or socially handicapped shall be given the special treatment, education and care required by his particular condition. 

_Principle 6_

The child, for the full and harmonious development of his personality, needs love and understanding. He shall, wherever possible, grow up in the care and under the responsibility of his parents, and, in any case, in an atmosphere of affection and of moral and material security; a child of tender years shall not, save in exceptional circumstances, be separated from his mother. Society and the public authorities shall have the duty to extend particular care to children without a family and to those without adequate means of support. Payment of State and other assistance towards the maintenance of children of large families is desirable. 

_Principle 7_

The child is entitled to receive education, which shall be free and compulsory, at least in the elementary stages. He shall be given an education which will promote his general culture and enable him, on a basis of equal opportunity, to develop his abilities, his individual judgment, and his sense of moral and social responsibility, and to become a useful member of society. 

The best interests of the child shall be the guiding principle of those responsible for his education and guidance; that responsibility lies in the first place with his parents. 

The child shall have full opportunity for play and recreation, which should be directed to the same purposes as education; society and the public authorities shall endeavour to promote the enjoyment of this right. 

_Principle 8_

The child shall in all circumstances be among the first to receive protection and relief.

_Principle 9_

The child shall be protected against all forms of neglect, cruelty and exploitation. He shall not be the subject of traffic, in any form. 

The child shall not be admitted to employment before an appropriate minimum age; he shall in no case be caused or permitted to engage in any occupation or employment which would prejudice his health or education, or interfere with his physical, mental or moral development. 

_Principle 10_

The child shall be protected from practices which may foster racial, religious and any other form of discrimination. He shall be brought up in a spirit of understanding, tolerance, friendship among peoples, peace and universal brotherhood, and in full consciousness that his energy and talents should be devoted to the service of his fellow men.

# Schedule 4—Declaration on the Rights of Mentally Retarded Persons

_Section 3_

_The General Assembly,_

_Mindful_ of the pledge of the States Members of the United Nations under the Charter to take joint and separate action in co‑operation with the Organization to promote higher standards of living, full employment and conditions of economic and social progress and development, 

_Reaffirming_ faith in human rights and fundamental freedoms and in the principles of peace, of the dignity and worth of the human person and of social justice proclaimed in the Charter, 

_Recalling_ the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenants on Human Rights, the Declaration of the Rights of the Child and the standards already set for social progress in the constitutions, conventions, recommendations and resolutions of the International Labour Organisation, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the World Health Organization, the United Nations Children’s Fund and other organizations concerned, 

_Emphasizing_ that the Declaration on Social Progress and Development has proclaimed the necessity of protecting the rights and assuring the welfare and rehabilitation of the physically and mentally disadvantaged, 

_Bearing in mind_ the necessity of assisting mentally retarded persons to develop their abilities in various fields of activities and of promoting their integration as far as possible in normal life, 

_Aware_ that certain countries, at their present stage of development, can devote only limited efforts to this end, 

_Proclaims_ this Declaration on the Rights of Mentally Retarded Persons and calls for national and international action to ensure that it will be used as a common basis and frame of reference for the protection of these rights: 

1.    The mentally retarded person has, to the maximum degree of feasibility, the same rights as other human beings. 

2.    The mentally retarded person has a right to proper medical care and physical therapy and to such education, training, rehabilitation and guidance as will enable him to develop his ability and maximum potential. 

3.    The mentally retarded person has a right to economic security and to a decent standard of living. He has a right to perform productive work or to engage in any other meaningful occupation to the fullest possible extent of his capabilities. 

4.    Whenever possible, the mentally retarded person should live with his own family or with foster parents and participate in different forms of community life. The family with which he lives should receive assistance. If care in an institution becomes necessary, it should be provided in surroundings and other circumstances as close as possible to those of normal life.

5.    The mentally retarded person has a right to a qualified guardian when this is required to protect his personal well‑being and interests. 

6.    The mentally retarded person has a right to protection from exploitation, abuse and degrading treatment. If prosecuted for any offence, he shall have a right to due process of law with full recognition being given to his degree of mental responsibility. 

7.    Whenever mentally retarded persons are unable, because of the severity of their handicap, to exercise all their rights in a meaningful way or it should become necessary to restrict or deny some or all of these rights, the procedure used for that restriction or denial of rights must contain proper legal safeguards against every form of abuse. This procedure must be based on an evaluation of the social capability of the mentally retarded person by qualified experts and must be subject to periodic review and to the right of appeal to higher authorities.

# Schedule 5—Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons

_Section 3_

_The General Assembly,_

_Mindful_ of the pledge made by Member States, under the Charter of the United Nations; to take joint and separate action in co‑operation with the Organization to promote higher standards of living, full employment and conditions of economic and social progress and development, 

_Reaffirming_ its faith in human rights and fundamental freedoms and in the principles of peace, of the dignity and worth of the human person and of social justice proclaimed in the Charter, 

_Recalling_ the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenants on Human Rights, the Declaration of the Rights of the Child and the Declaration on the Rights of Mentally Retarded Persons, as well as the standards already set for social progress in the constitutions, conventions, recommendations and resolutions of the International Labour Organisation, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the World Health Organization, the United Nations Children’s Fund and other organizations concerned, 

_Recalling also_ Economic and Social Council resolution 1921 (LVIII) of 6 May 1975 on the prevention of disability and the rehabilitation of disabled persons, 

_Emphasizing_ that the Declaration on Social Progress and Development has proclaimed the necessity of protecting the rights and assuring the welfare and rehabilitation of the physically and mentally disadvantaged, 

_Bearing in mind_ the necessity of preventing physical and mental disabilities and of assisting disabled persons to develop their abilities in the most varied fields of activities and of promoting their integration as far as possible in normal life, 

_Aware_ that certain countries, at their present stage of development, can devote only limited efforts to this end, 

_Proclaims_ this Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons and calls for national and international action to ensure that it will be used as a common basis and frame of reference for the protection of these rights: 

1.    The term “disabled person” means any person unable to ensure by himself or herself, wholly or partly, the necessities of a normal individual and/or social life, as a result of deficiency, either congenital or not, in his or her physical or mental capabilities. 

2.    Disabled persons shall enjoy all the rights set forth in this Declaration. These rights shall be granted to all disabled persons without any exception whatsoever and without distinction or discrimination on the basis of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinions, national or social origin, state of wealth, birth or any other situation applying either to the disabled person himself or herself or to his or her family.

3.    Disabled persons have the inherent right to respect for their human dignity. Disabled persons, whatever the origin, nature and seriousness of their handicaps and disabilities, have the same fundamental rights as their fellow‑citizens of the same age, which implies first and foremost the right to enjoy a decent life, as normal and full as possible. 

4.    Disabled persons have the same civil and political rights as other human beings; paragraph 7 of the Declaration on the Rights of Mentally Retarded Persons applies to any possible limitation or suppression of those rights for mentally disabled persons. 

5.    Disabled persons are entitled to the measures designed to enable them to become as self‑reliant as possible. 

6.    Disabled persons have the right to medical, psychological and functional treatment, including prosthetic and orthetic appliances, to medical and social rehabilitation, education, vocational training and rehabilitation, aid, counselling, placement services and other services which will enable them to develop their capabilities and skills to the maximum and will hasten the process of their social integration or reintegration. 

7.    Disabled persons have the right to economic and social security and to a decent level of living. They have the right, according to their capabilities, to secure and retain employment or to engage in a useful, productive and remunerative occupation and to join trade unions. 

8.    Disabled persons are entitled to have their special needs taken into consideration at all stages of economic and social planning. 

9.    Disabled persons have the right to live with their families or with foster parents and to participate in all social, creative or recreational activities. No disabled person shall be subjected, as far as his or her residence is concerned, to differential treatment other than that required by his or her condition or by the improvement which he or she may derive therefrom. If the stay of a disabled person in a specialized establishment is indispensable, the environment and living conditions therein shall be as close as possible to those of the normal life of a person of his or her age. 

10.  Disabled persons shall be protected against all exploitation, all regulations and all treatment of a discriminatory, abusive or degrading nature. 

11.  Disabled persons shall be able to avail themselves of qualified legal aid when such aid proves indispensable for the protection of their persons and property. If judicial proceedings are instituted against them, the legal procedure applied shall take their physical and mental condition fully into account. 

12.  Organizations of disabled persons may be usefully consulted in all matters regarding the rights of disabled persons. 

13.  Disabled persons, their families and communities shall be fully informed, by all appropriate means, of the rights contained in this Declaration.
