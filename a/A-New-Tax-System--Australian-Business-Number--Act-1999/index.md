## An Act to implement A New Tax System by establishing a Register of Australian Business and providing for the issue of Australian Business Numbers, and for related purposes

## Part 1—Preliminary

### Division 1—Formalities

##### <a id="1"></a>1  Short title [_see_ Note 1]

                   This Act may be cited as the _A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Act 1999_.

##### <a id="2"></a>2  Commencement [_see_ Note 1]

                   This Act commences on the day on which it receives the Royal Assent.

### Division 2—Objects

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Objects

Main object

             (1)  The main object of this Act is to make it easier for businesses to conduct their dealings with the Australian Government. This is done by establishing a system for registering businesses and issuing them with unique identifying numbers so that they can identify themselves reliably:

                     (a)  in all their dealings with the Australian Government; and

                     (b)  for all other Commonwealth purposes.

             (2)  Without limiting paragraph (1)(b), the main object of this Act includes allowing businesses to identify themselves reliably for the purposes of * taxation laws.

Reducing registration and reporting requirements

             (3)  The objects of this Act also include reducing the number of government registration and reporting requirements by making the system available to State, Territory and local government regulatory bodies.

Note:          Section 30 facilitates this object by enabling the Registrar to provide information collected under this Act to State, Territory and local government bodies.

Multi-agency dealings

             (4)  The objects of this Act also include allowing the * Registrar to register and maintain details about representatives of * businesses that are registered under this Act, for the purpose of facilitating electronic dealings by those businesses with * government entities.

### Division 3—Application of this Act

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Crown bound by this Act

                   This Act binds the Crown in each of its capacities, but does not make the Crown liable to be prosecuted for an offence.

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Application to government entities, non-profit sub-entities, superannuation funds and certain RSE licensees

             (1)  This Act applies to a * government entity, a * non-profit sub-entity or a * superannuation fund as if it were an * entity * carrying on an * enterprise in * Australia.

             (2)  This Act applies to an * RSE licensee, or an applicant for an * RSE licence, that is a group of individual trustees as if the group were an * entity * carrying on an * enterprise in * Australia.

##### <a id="5A"></a>5A  Application to religious practitioners and religious institutions

                   If a * religious practitioner:

                     (a)  does an activity, or a series of activities:

                              (i)  in pursuit of his or her vocation as a religious practitioner; and

                             (ii)  as a member of a religious institution; and

                     (b)  does not do the activity, or series of activities, as an employee or agent of the religious institution or another entity;

this Act applies as if the activity, or series of activities, had been done by the religious institution and not by the religious practitioner.

Note:          This will mean that such an activity will be an enterprise of the religious institution and not an enterprise of the religious practitioner.

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Application of _Criminal Code_

                   The _Criminal Code_ applies to all offences against this Act.

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Application to the external Territories

                   This Act extends to every external Territory.

             (3)  That form may request, but not compel, * you to provide your * TFN or that of an * associate.

Note:          Including a TFN in an application will not be an offence against subsection 8WB(1) of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ (see paragraph 8WB(1A)(a) of that Act).

##### <a id="9A"></a>9A  Applying for registration of representatives

             (1)  If * you are registered in the * Australian Business Register, or you are applying to be so registered, you may make an application to the * Registrar requesting the Registrar to register details about a nominated representative (who is an individual) for the purpose of facilitating your electronic dealings with * government entities.

             (2)  An application must be in the * approved form.

             (3)  That form may request, but not compel, the provision of:

                     (c)  the Registrar is satisfied that your identity has been established; and

                     (d)  the representative’s details are not already registered in the * Australian Business Register in relation to you.

             (2)  If * your proposed representative is to be authorised to nominate other representatives of yours, the * Registrar may request you or your proposed representative to give the Registrar specified information or a specified document the Registrar needs to be satisfied that the identity of the proposed representative is established.

             (3)  The * Registrar must give * you a written notice of:

             (2)  Subsection (1):

## Table A

### Application, saving or transitional provisions

_A New Tax System (Tax Administration) Act (No. 2) 2000 (No. 91, 2000)_

## Schedule 4C

## 9  Regulations

Regulations made for the purposes of subsection 26(1) of the _A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Act 1999_ and in force immediately before the commencement of this Schedule continue in force as if they had been made for the purposes of that subsection as amended by item 2\. This does not prevent amendment or repeal of the regulations.

* * *

_Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No. 5) 2001 (No. 168, 2001)_

## Schedule 1

## 3  Application

The amendments of the _A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Act 1999_ made by this Schedule apply to activities done by a religious practitioner on or after 1 July 2000.

* * *

_Tax Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 1) Act 2004 (No. 95, 2004)_

## Schedule 6

## 5  Application of amendments

The amendments of the _A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Act 1999_ made by this Schedule apply in relation to disclosures made on or after 15 October 2001.

* * *

_Tax Laws Amendment (Repeal of Inoperative Provisions) Act 2006 
 (No. 101, 2006)_

## Schedule 6

## 1  Application of Schedule 1 and 2 amendments

Except as mentioned in items 2 and 3, the repeals and amendments made by Schedules 1 and 2 apply:

                     (a)  so far as they affect assessments—to assessments for the 2006-07 income year and all later income years; and

                     (b)  otherwise—to acts done or omitted to be done, or states of affairs existing, after the commencement of the repeals and amendments.

## 6  Object

The object of this Part is to ensure that, despite the repeals and amendments made by this Act, the full legal and administrative consequences of:

                     (a)  any act done or omitted to be done; or

                     (b)  any state of affairs existing; or

                     (c)  any period ending;

before such a repeal or amendment applies, can continue to arise and be carried out, directly or indirectly through an indefinite number of steps, even if some or all of those steps are taken after the repeal or amendment applies.

## 7  Making and amending assessments, and doing other things, in relation to past matters

Even though an Act is repealed or amended by this Act, the repeal or amendment is disregarded for the purpose of doing any of the following under any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_):

                     (a)  making or amending an assessment (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

                     (b)  exercising any right or power, performing any obligation or duty or doing any other thing (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

Example 1: On 31 July 1999, Greg Ltd lodged its annual return under former section 160ARE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The return stated that the company had a credit on its franking account and that no franking deficit tax was payable for the 1998-99 franking year. Under former section 160ARH of that Act, the Commissioner was taken to have made an assessment consistent with the return.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of Part IIIAA of that Act, the Commissioner concludes that Greg Ltd fraudulently overfranked dividends it paid during the 1998-99 franking year, and had a franking account deficit for that franking year. As a result, the Commissioner considers that franking deficit tax and a penalty by way of additional tax are payable.

                   The Commissioner can amend the assessment under former section 160ARN of that Act, because item 7 of this Schedule disregards the repeal of that section for the purposes of making an assessment in relation to the 1998-99 franking year. Item 7 will also disregard the repeal of Division 11 of former Part IIIAA to the extent necessary for the Commissioner to assess Greg Ltd’s liability to a penalty by way of additional tax.

                   Despite the repeal of sections 160ARU and 160ARV, item 9 will ensure that the general interest charge will accrue on the unpaid franking deficit tax and penalty until they are paid.

                   Item 7 will also preserve Greg Ltd’s right, under former section 160ART of that Act, to object against the Commissioner’s amended assessment (including the penalty), since the objection is the exercise of a right in relation to a franking year that ended before the repeal of Part IIIAA.

Example 2: During the 1997-98 income year, Duffy Property Ltd withheld amounts from its employees’ wages as required by former Divisions 1AAA and 2 of Part VI of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The company failed to notify the Commissioner of those amounts, and failed to remit them to the Commissioner.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of those Divisions, the Commissioner discovers that the withheld amounts have not been remitted. The company’s records are incomplete and the Commissioner is unable to completely ascertain the extent of its liability for the withheld amounts. Under section 222AGA of that Act, the Commissioner makes an estimate of the liability.

                   Item 7 will disregard the repeal of section 220AAZA of that Act (which empowered the Commissioner to recover the amount of the estimate). Even though the estimate is made after the repeal, it relates to amounts withheld before the repeal.

## 8  Saving of provisions about effect of assessments

If a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act deals with the effect of an assessment, the repeal or amendment is disregarded in relation to assessments made, before or after the repeal or amendment applies, in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

## 9  Saving of provisions about general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty

If:

                     (a)  a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act provides for the payment of:

                              (i)  general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty (all within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_); or

                             (ii)  interest under the _Taxation (Interest on Overpayments and Early Payments) Act 1983_; and

                     (b)  in a particular case, the period in respect of which the charge, penalty or interest is payable (whether under the provision or under the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_) has not begun, or has begun but not ended, when the provision is repealed or amended;

then, despite the repeal or amendment, the provision or part continues to apply in the particular case until the end of the period.

## 10  Repeals disregarded for the purposes of dependent provisions

If the operation of a provision (the **_subject provision_**) of any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_) made under any Act depends to any extent on an Act, or a provision of an Act, that is repealed by this Act, the repeal is disregarded so far as it affects the operation of the subject provision.

## 11  Schedule does not limit operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_

This Schedule does not limit the operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

* * *

_Financial Sector Legislation Amendment (Simplifying Regulation and Review) Act 2007 (No. 154, 2007)_

## Schedule 1

## 296  Regulations may prescribe matters

The Governor-General may make regulations prescribing matters of a transitional nature (including prescribing any saving or application provisions) in relation to the amendments or repeals made by this Schedule.

* * *

_Tax Laws Amendment (2009 Measures No. 2) Act 2009 (No. 42, 2009)_

## Schedule 6

## 32  Application

(1)        The amendments made by items 1, 2, 3, 4, 23 and 28 of this Schedule apply in relation to applications made under section 9 of the _A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Act 1999_ after the commencement of those items.

(2)        The amendments made by items 9 and 10 of this Schedule apply in relation to changes in circumstances, for the purposes of paragraph 14(1)(c) of that Act, happening after the commencement of those items.

(3)        The amendment made by item 11 of this Schedule applies in relation to requests given under subsection 15(1) of that Act after the commencement of that item.

(4)        The amendment made by item 17 of this Schedule applies in relation to applications made under subsection 18(4) of that Act after the commencement of that item.
