             (4)  Also, the warrant must, in the same terms as the draft warrant given to the issuing authority as part of the request:

                     (a)  authorise the Organisation, subject to any restrictions or conditions, to question the person before a prescribed authority by requesting the person to do either or both of the following:

                              (i)  give information that is or may be relevant to intelligence that is important in relation to a terrorism offence;

                             (ii)  produce records or things that are or may be relevant to intelligence that is important in relation to a terrorism offence; and

                     (b)  authorise the Organisation, subject to any restrictions or conditions, to make copies and/or transcripts of a record produced by the person before a prescribed authority in response to a request in accordance with the warrant.

#### Subdivision C—Questioning and detention warrants

##### <a id="34F"></a>34F  Request for questioning and detention warrant

Seeking of Minister’s consent to request for warrant

             (1)  The Director‑General may seek the Minister’s consent to request the issue of a warrant under section 34G in relation to a person.

             (2)  To avoid doubt, this section operates in relation to a request for the issue of a warrant under section 34G in relation to a person, even if a request for the issue of a warrant under this Division has previously been made in relation to the person.

             (3)  In seeking the Minister’s consent, the Director‑General must give the Minister a draft request that includes:

                     (a)  a draft of the warrant to be requested; and

                     (b)  a statement of the facts and other grounds on which the Director‑General considers it necessary that the warrant should be issued; and

                     (c)  a statement of the particulars and outcomes of all previous requests for the issue of a warrant under this Division relating to the person; and

                     (d)  if one or more warrants were issued under this Division as a result of the previous requests—a statement of:

                              (i)  the period for which the person has been questioned under each of those warrants before the draft request is given to the Minister; and

                             (ii)  if any of those warrants authorised the detention of the person—the period for which the person has been detained in connection with each such warrant before the draft request is given to the Minister.

Minister’s consent to making of request

             (4)  The Minister may, by writing, consent to the making of the request, but only if the Minister is satisfied:

                     (a)  that there are reasonable grounds for believing that issuing the warrant to be requested will substantially assist the collection of intelligence that is important in relation to a terrorism offence; and

                     (b)  that relying on other methods of collecting that intelligence would be ineffective; and

                     (c)  that there is in force under section 34C a written statement of procedures to be followed in the exercise of authority under warrants issued under this Division; and

                     (d)  that there are reasonable grounds for believing that, if the person is not immediately taken into custody and detained, the person:

                              (i)  may alert a person involved in a terrorism offence that the offence is being investigated; or

                             (ii)  may not appear before the prescribed authority; or

                            (iii)  may destroy, damage or alter a record or thing the person may be requested in accordance with the warrant to produce.

The Minister may make his or her consent subject to changes being made to the draft request.

             (5)  In consenting to the making of a request, the Minister must ensure that the warrant to be requested is to permit the person to contact a single lawyer of the person’s choice (subject to section 34ZO) at any time that:

                     (a)  is a time while the person is in detention in connection with the warrant; and

                     (b)  is after:

                              (i)  the person has been brought before a prescribed authority for questioning; and

                             (ii)  the person has informed the prescribed authority, in the presence of a person exercising authority under the warrant, of the identity of the lawyer whom the person proposes to contact; and

                            (iii)  a person exercising authority under the warrant has had an opportunity to request the prescribed authority to direct under section 34ZO that the person be prevented from contacting the lawyer.

             (6)  If, before the Director‑General seeks the Minister’s consent to the request (the **_proposed request_**), the person has been detained under this Division in connection with one or more warrants (the **_earlier warrants_**) issued under this Division:

                     (a)  the Minister must take account of those facts in deciding whether to consent; and

                     (b)  the Minister may consent only if the Minister is satisfied that the issue of the warrant to be requested is justified by information that is additional to or materially different from that known to the Director‑General at the time the Director‑General sought the Minister’s consent to request the issue of the last of the earlier warrants issued before the seeking of the Minister’s consent to the proposed request.

This subsection has effect in addition to subsection (4).

Form of request

             (7)  If the Minister has consented under subsection (4), the Director‑General may request the warrant by giving an issuing authority:

                     (a)  a request that is the same as the draft request except for the changes (if any) required by the Minister; and

                     (b)  a copy of the Minister’s consent.

##### <a id="34G"></a>34G  Issue of questioning and detention warrant

Issue of warrant

             (1)  An issuing authority may issue a warrant under this section relating to a person, but only if:

                     (a)  the Director‑General has requested it in accordance with subsection 34F(7); and

                     (b)  the issuing authority is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the warrant will substantially assist the collection of intelligence that is important in relation to a terrorism offence.

Previous detention

             (2)  If the person has already been detained under this Division in connection with one or more warrants (the **_earlier warrants_**) issued under this Division:

                     (a)  the issuing authority must take account of those facts in deciding whether to issue the warrant requested; and

                     (b)  the issuing authority may issue the warrant requested only if the authority is satisfied that:

                              (i)  the issue of that warrant is justified by information additional to or materially different from that known to the Director‑General at the time the Director‑General sought the Minister’s consent to request the issue of the last of the earlier warrants issued before the seeking of the Minister’s consent to the request for the issue of the warrant requested; and

                             (ii)  the person is not being detained under this Division in connection with one of the earlier warrants.

This subsection has effect in addition to subsection (1).

What the warrant authorises

             (3)  The warrant must, in the same terms as the draft warrant given to the issuing authority as part of the request, do the following:

                     (a)  authorise a specified person to be:

                              (i)  taken into custody immediately by a police officer; and

                             (ii)  brought before a prescribed authority immediately for questioning under the warrant; and

                            (iii)  detained under arrangements made by a police officer for the period described in subsection (4);

                     (b)  permit the person to contact identified persons at specified times when the person is in custody or detention authorised by the warrant.

             (4)  The period starts when the person is first brought before a prescribed authority under the warrant and ends at the first time one of the following events happens:

                     (a)  someone exercising authority under the warrant informs the prescribed authority before whom the person is appearing for questioning that the Organisation does not have any further request described in paragraph (7)(a) to make of the person;

                     (b)  section 34R prohibits anyone exercising authority under the warrant from questioning the person under the warrant;

                     (c)  the passage of 168 hours starting when the person was first brought before a prescribed authority under the warrant.

Contacting persons

             (5)  The warrant may identify someone whom the person is permitted to contact by reference to the fact that he or she is a lawyer of the person’s choice or has a particular legal or familial relationship with the person. This does not limit the ways in which the warrant may identify persons whom the person is permitted to contact.

Note 1:       The warrant may identify persons by reference to a class. See subsection 46(3) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

Note 2:       Section 34K permits the person to contact the Inspector‑General of Intelligence and Security, the Ombudsman and a person referred to in paragraph 40SB(3)(b) of the _Australian Federal Police Act 1979_ while the person is in custody or detention, so the warrant must identify them.

Note 3:       A warrant issued under this section must permit the person to contact a single lawyer of the person’s choice, so the warrant must identify such a lawyer.

             (6)  The warrant may specify times when the person is permitted to contact someone identified as a lawyer of the person’s choice by reference to the fact that the times are:

                     (a)  while the person is in detention in connection with the warrant; and

                     (b)  after:

                              (i)  the person has been brought before a prescribed authority for questioning; and

                             (ii)  the person has informed the prescribed authority, in the presence of a person exercising authority under the warrant, of the identity of the lawyer whom the person proposes to contact; and

                            (iii)  a person exercising authority under the warrant has had an opportunity to request the prescribed authority to direct under section 34ZO that the person be prevented from contacting the lawyer.

Warrant must authorise certain actions by the Organisation

             (7)  Also, the warrant must, in the same terms as the draft warrant given to the issuing authority as part of the request:

                     (a)  authorise the Organisation, subject to any restrictions or conditions, to question the person before a prescribed authority by requesting the person to do either or both of the following:

                              (i)  give information that is or may be relevant to intelligence that is important in relation to a terrorism offence;

                             (ii)  produce records or things that are or may be relevant to intelligence that is important in relation to a terrorism offence; and

                     (b)  authorise the Organisation, subject to any restrictions or conditions, to make copies and/or transcripts of a record produced by the person before a prescribed authority in response to a request in accordance with the warrant.

Warrant to be signed and to specify the period it is in force

             (8)  Also, the warrant must:

                     (a)  be signed by the issuing authority who issues it; and

                     (b)  specify the period during which the warrant is to be in force, which must not be more than 28 days.

##### <a id="34H"></a>34H  Person taken into custody under warrant to be immediately brought before prescribed authority

                   If the person is taken into custody by a police officer exercising authority under the warrant, the officer must make arrangements for the person to be immediately brought before a prescribed authority for questioning.

#### Subdivision D—Certain obligations and protections relating to a warrant issued under Subdivision B or C

_Note:       Subdivision E sets out other obligations and protections relating to a warrant issued under Subdivision B or C (as well as dealing with other matters)._

##### <a id="34J"></a>34J  Prescribed authority must explain warrant

             (1)  When a person first appears before a prescribed authority for questioning under a warrant issued under this Division, the prescribed authority must inform the person of the following:

                     (a)  whether the warrant authorises detention of the person by a police officer and, if it does, the period for which the warrant authorises detention of the person;

                     (b)  what the warrant authorises the Organisation to do;

                     (c)  the effect of section 34L (including the fact that the section creates offences);

                     (d)  the period for which the warrant is in force;

                     (e)  the person’s right to make a complaint orally or in writing:

                              (i)  to the Inspector‑General of Intelligence and Security under the _Inspector‑General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986_ in relation to the Organisation; or

                             (ii)  to the Ombudsman under the _Ombudsman Act 1976_ in relation to the Australian Federal Police;

                            (iii)  to a complaints agency in relation to the police force or police service of the State or Territory concerned;

                    (ea)  the person’s right to give information orally or in writing, under Division 2 of Part V of the _Australian Federal Police Act 1979_, to a person referred to in subsection 40SA(1) of that Act in relation to the Australian Federal Police;

                      (f)  the fact that the person may seek from a federal court a remedy relating to the warrant or the treatment of the person in connection with the warrant;

                     (g)  whether there is any limit on the person contacting others and, if the warrant permits the person to contact identified persons at specified times when the person is in custody or detention authorised by the warrant, who the identified persons are and what the specified times are.

             (2)  To avoid doubt, subsection (1) does not apply to a prescribed authority if the person has previously appeared before another prescribed authority for questioning under the warrant.

             (3)  The prescribed authority before whom the person appears for questioning must inform the person of the role of the prescribed authority. In particular, the prescribed authority must inform the person that the role of the prescribed authority includes:

                     (a)  supervising the questioning of the person; and

                     (b)  giving appropriate directions under section 34K in relation to the person.

             (4)  The prescribed authority before whom the person appears for questioning must inform the person of the reason for the presence of each other person who is present at any time during the questioning. However:

                     (a)  the prescribed authority must not name any person except with the consent of the person to be named; and

                     (b)  the obligation to inform the person being questioned about a particular person’s reason for presence need only be complied with once (even if that particular person subsequently returns to the questioning).

             (5)  At least once in every 24‑hour period during which questioning of the person under the warrant occurs, the prescribed authority before whom the person appears for questioning must inform the person of the fact that the person may seek from a federal court a remedy relating to the warrant or the treatment of the person in connection with the warrant.

Note:          For example, the person may be able to apply to the Federal Court of Australia under subsection 39B(1) of the _Judiciary Act 1903_, or the High Court of Australia under paragraph 75(v) of the Constitution, for a remedy in relation to the warrant or the treatment of the person in connection with the warrant.

##### <a id="34K"></a>34K  Directions by prescribed authority etc.

Directions relating to detention or further appearance

             (1)  At any time when a person is before a prescribed authority for questioning under a warrant issued under this Division, the authority may give any of the following directions:

                     (a)  a direction to detain the person;

                     (b)  a direction for the further detention of the person;

                     (c)  a direction about any arrangements for the person’s detention;

                     (d)  a direction permitting the person to contact an identified person (including someone identified by reference to the fact that he or she has a particular legal or familial relationship with the person) or any person and to disclose information other than specified information while in contact;

                     (e)  a direction to defer questioning of the person under the warrant;

                      (f)  a direction for the person’s further appearance before the prescribed authority for questioning under the warrant;

                     (g)  a direction that the person be released from detention.

             (2)  The prescribed authority is only to give a direction that:

                     (a)  is consistent with the warrant; or

                     (b)  has been approved in writing by the Minister.

However, the prescribed authority may give a direction that is not covered by paragraph (a) or (b) if he or she has been informed under section 34Q of a concern of the Inspector‑General of Intelligence and Security and is satisfied that giving the direction is necessary to address the concern satisfactorily.

             (3)  To avoid doubt, the mere fact that the warrant is issued under section 34E does not prevent a direction under subsection (1) of this section from being consistent with the warrant for the purposes of subsection (2) of this section.

Note:          A warrant issued under section 34E requires a person to appear before a prescribed authority for questioning under the warrant (rather than authorising the person to be taken into custody, brought before a prescribed authority and detained).

             (4)  The prescribed authority is only to give a direction described in paragraph (1)(a) or (b) if he or she is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that, if the person is not detained, the person:

                     (a)  may alert a person involved in a terrorism offence that the offence is being investigated; or

                     (b)  may not continue to appear, or may not appear again, before a prescribed authority; or

                     (c)  may destroy, damage or alter a record or thing the person has been requested, or may be requested, in accordance with the warrant, to produce.

             (5)  A direction under subsection (1) must not result in:

                     (a)  a person being detained after the first time when either of the following events happens:

                              (i)  someone exercising authority under the warrant informs the prescribed authority before whom the person is appearing for questioning that the Organisation does not have any further request described in paragraph 34E(4)(a) or 34G(7)(a) to make of the person;

                             (ii)  section 34R prohibits anyone exercising authority under the warrant from questioning the person under the warrant; or

                     (b)  a person’s detention being arranged by a person who is not a police officer.

Note:          Section 34S also provides that this Division does not authorise a person to be detained for a continuous period of more than 168 hours.

Giving effect to directions

             (6)  Directions given by a prescribed authority have effect, and may be implemented or enforced, according to their terms.

             (7)  A police officer may take a person into custody and bring him or her before a prescribed authority for questioning under a warrant issued under this Division if the person fails to appear before a prescribed authority as required by the warrant or a direction given by a prescribed authority under this section.

Direction has no effect on further warrant

             (8)  This section does not prevent any of the following occurring in relation to a person who has been released after having been detained under this Division in connection with a warrant issued under this Division:

                     (a)  an issuing authority issuing a further warrant under this Division;

                     (b)  the person being detained under this Division in connection with the further warrant.

Complaints while appearing before a prescribed authority for questioning

             (9)  If:

                     (a)  a person is appearing before a prescribed authority for questioning under a warrant issued under this Division; and

                     (b)  the person informs the prescribed authority that the person wants:

                              (i)  to make an oral or written complaint of the kind referred to in paragraph 34J(1)(e); or

                             (ii)  to give oral or written information of the kind referred to in paragraph 34J(1)(ea); and

                     (c)  the person requests facilities to make the complaint or give the information; and

                     (d)  the prescribed authority gives a direction under subsection (1) deferring questioning of the person under the warrant;

then anyone exercising authority under the warrant must give the person facilities for making the complaint or giving the information.

Communications while in custody or detention

           (10)  A person who has been taken into custody, or detained, under this Division is not permitted to contact, and may be prevented from contacting, anyone at any time while in custody or detention.

           (11)  However:

                     (a)  the person may contact anyone whom the warrant under which he or she is detained, or a direction described in paragraph (1)(d), permits the person to contact; and

                     (b)  subsection (10) does not affect the operation of sections 10 and 13 of the _Inspector‑General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986_ in relation to contact between the person and the Inspector‑General of Intelligence and Security; and

                     (c)  anyone holding the person in custody or detention under this Division must give the person facilities for contacting the Inspector‑General of Intelligence and Security to make a complaint orally under section 10 of the _Inspector‑General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986_ if the person requests them; and

                     (d)  subsection (10) does not affect the operation of section 7 of the _Ombudsman Act 1976_ in relation to contact between the person and the Ombudsman in respect of a complaint, or proposed complaint, about the Australian Federal Police; and

                     (e)  anyone holding the person in custody or detention under this Division must give the person facilities for contacting the Ombudsman to make a complaint orally under section 7 of the _Ombudsman Act 1976_ if the person requests them; and

                      (f)  subsection (10) does not affect the operation of section 40SB of the _Australian Federal Police Act 1979_ in relation to contact between the person and a person referred to in paragraph 40SB(3)(b) of that Act; and

                     (g)  anyone holding the person in custody or detention under this Division must give the person facilities for contacting the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police to give information orally under section 40SA of the _Australian Federal Police Act 1979_ if the person requests them; and

                     (h)  subsection (10) does not affect the person’s right to make a complaint to a complaints agency in relation to the police force or police service of the State or Territory concerned; and

                      (i)  anyone holding the person in custody or detention under this Division must give the person facilities for contacting a complaints agency to make an oral or written complaint of the kind mentioned in paragraph (h) if the person requests them.

Note:          The sections mentioned in paragraphs (11)(b), (d) and (f) give the person an entitlement to facilities for making a written complaint or for giving written information.

##### <a id="34L"></a>34L  Giving information and producing things etc.

             (1)  A person must appear before a prescribed authority for questioning, in accordance with a warrant issued under this Division or a direction given under section 34K.

                    Penalty:  Imprisonment for 5 years.

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not apply if the person does not have the information.

Note:          A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in subsection (3) (see subsection 13.3(3) of the _Criminal Code_).

             (4)  A person commits an offence if:

                     (a)  the person is before a prescribed authority for questioning under a warrant issued under this Division; and

                     (b)  the person makes a statement that is, to the person’s knowledge, false or misleading; and

                     (c)  the statement is made in purported compliance with a request for information made in accordance with the warrant.

                    Penalty:  Imprisonment for 5 years.

             (5)  Subsection (4) does not apply if the statement is not false or misleading in a material particular.

                     (a)  anything said by the person, while before a prescribed authority for questioning under a warrant, in response to a request made in accordance with the warrant for the person to give information;

             (4)  If the Director‑General seeks the Minister’s consent to request the issue of a warrant under this Division in relation to a person and the Minister is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the person is at least 16 but under 18, the Minister may consent only if he or she is satisfied on reasonable grounds that:

                     (a)  it is likely that the person will commit, is committing or has committed a terrorism offence; and

                     (b)  the draft warrant to be included in the request will meet the requirements in subsection (6).

             (5)  An issuing authority may issue a warrant under this Division relating to a person whom the authority is satisfied on reasonable grounds is at least 16 but under 18 only if the draft warrant included in the request for the warrant meets the requirements in subsection (6).

Note:          Section 34E or 34G requires that a warrant issued under that section be in the same form as the draft warrant included in the request.

             (6)  If subsection (4) or (5) applies, the draft warrant must:

                     (a)  if the warrant authorises the person to be taken into custody and detained—permit the person to contact, at any time when the person is in custody or detention authorised by the warrant:

                              (i)  a parent or guardian of the person; and

                             (ii)  if it is not acceptable to the person to be questioned in the presence of one of his or her parents or guardians—another person who meets the requirements in subsection (7); and

                     (b)  authorise the Organisation to question the person before a prescribed authority:

                              (i)  only in the presence of a parent or guardian of the person or, if that is not acceptable to the person, of another person who meets the requirements in subsection (7); and

                             (ii)  only for continuous periods of 2 hours or less, separated by breaks directed by the prescribed authority.

Note:          The prescribed authority may set the breaks between periods of questioning by giving appropriate directions under paragraph 34K(1)(f) for the person’s further appearance before the prescribed authority for questioning.

             (7)  The other person must:

                     (a)  be able to represent the person’s interests; and

                     (b)  as far as practicable in the circumstances, be acceptable to the person and to the prescribed authority; and

                     (c)  not be one of the following:

                              (i)  a police officer;

                             (ii)  the Director‑General;

                            (iii)  an officer or employee of the Organisation;

                            (iv)  a person approved under subsection 24(1).

             (8)  If a person appears before a prescribed authority for questioning under a warrant issued under this Division and the prescribed authority is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the person is at least 16 but under 18, the prescribed authority must, as soon as practicable:

                     (a)  inform the person that the person:

                              (i)  may request that one of the person’s parents or guardians or one other person who meets the requirements in subsection (7) be present during the questioning; and

                             (ii)  may contact the person’s parents or guardians and another person who meets the requirements in subsection (7), at any time when the person is in custody or detention in connection with the warrant; and

                            (iii)  may contact a single lawyer of the person’s choice when the person is in detention in connection with the warrant; and

                     (b)  if the person requests that one of the person’s parents or guardians be present during the questioning—direct everyone proposing to question the person under the warrant not to do so in the absence of the parent or guardian; and

                     (c)  if the person does not request that one of the person’s parents or guardians be present during the questioning—direct everyone proposing to question the person under the warrant not to do so in the absence of another person (other than the prescribed authority) who meets the requirements in subsection (7); and

                     (d)  direct under paragraph 34K(1)(d) that the person may contact someone described in subparagraph (a)(ii) of this subsection at any time described in that subparagraph; and

                     (e)  direct everyone proposing to question the person under the warrant that questioning is to occur only for continuous periods of 2 hours or less, separated by breaks directed by the prescribed authority.

Note:          The prescribed authority may set the breaks between periods of questioning by giving appropriate directions under paragraph 34K(1)(f) for the person’s further appearance before the prescribed authority for questioning.

             (9)  Subsection 34K(2) does not prevent the prescribed authority from giving a direction in accordance with paragraph (8)(d) of this section.

           (10)  To avoid doubt, paragraphs (6)(b) and (8)(e) do not affect the operation of section 34R.

                     (b)  omit to perform an act.

##### <a id="34ZG"></a>34ZG  Complaints and information about contravention of procedural statement

##### <a id="34ZJ"></a>34ZJ  Reporting by Inspector‑General on multiple warrants

             (1)  This section imposes requirements on the Inspector‑General of Intelligence and Security if:

                     (a)  a person is detained under this Division in connection with a warrant issued under this Division; and

                     (b)  one or more other warrants (the **_later warrants_**) are issued later under section 34G in relation to the person.

             (2)  The Inspector‑General must inspect a copy of the draft request given to the Minister under subsection 34D(3) or 34F(3) for each of the warrants, to determine whether the draft request for each of the later warrants included information described in paragraph 34F(6)(b).

             (3)  The Inspector‑General must report on the outcome of the inspection in his or her annual report for the year in which he or she carries out the examination. For this purpose, **_annual report_** means a report under section 35 of the _Inspector‑General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986_.

##### <a id="34ZK"></a>34ZK  Discontinuing action before warrants expire

                   If, before a warrant issued under this Division ceases to be in force, the Director‑General is satisfied that the grounds on which the warrant was issued have ceased to exist, the Director‑General must:

                     (a)  inform the Minister, and the issuing authority who issued the warrant, accordingly; and

                     (b)  take such steps as are necessary to ensure that action under the warrant is discontinued.

##### <a id="34ZL"></a>34ZL  Certain records obtained under warrant to be destroyed

                   The Director‑General must cause a record or copy to be destroyed if:

                     (a)  the record or copy was made because of a warrant issued under this Division; and

##### <a id="34ZM"></a>34ZM  Status of issuing authorities and prescribed authorities

             (2)  If a person who is a member of a court created by the Parliament has under this Division a function, power or duty that is neither judicial nor incidental to a judicial function or power, the person has the function, power or duty in a personal capacity and not as a court or a member of a court.

##### <a id="34ZN"></a>34ZN  Certain functions and powers not affected

             (3)  This Division does not affect a function or power of a person under Part V of the _Australian Federal Police Act 1979_.

##### <a id="34ZO"></a>34ZO  Limit on contact of lawyer of choice

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a person (the **_subject_**) is specified in a warrant issued under section 34E and the person is in detention in connection with the warrant; or

                     (b)  a person (the **_subject_**) is specified in a warrant issued under section 34G;

the subject may be prevented from contacting a particular lawyer of the subject’s choice if the prescribed authority concerned so directs.

             (2)  The prescribed authority may so direct only if the authority is satisfied, on the basis of circumstances relating to that lawyer, that, if the subject is permitted to contact the lawyer:

                     (a)  a person involved in a terrorism offence may be alerted that the offence is being investigated; or

                     (b)  a record or thing that the person may be requested in accordance with the warrant to produce may be destroyed, damaged or altered.

             (3)  This section has effect despite paragraph 34K(11)(a).

             (4)  To avoid doubt, subsection (1) does not prevent the subject from choosing another lawyer to contact, but the subject may be prevented from contacting that other lawyer under another application of that subsection.

##### <a id="34ZP"></a>34ZP  Questioning person in absence of lawyer of person’s choice

             (1)  To avoid doubt, a person before a prescribed authority for questioning under a warrant issued under this Division may be questioned under the warrant in the absence of a lawyer of the person’s choice.

Note:          As the warrant authorises questioning of the person only while the person is before a prescribed authority, the prescribed authority can control whether questioning occurs by controlling whether the person is present before the prescribed authority.

             (2)  This section does not permit questioning of the person by a person exercising authority under the warrant at a time when a person exercising authority under the warrant is required by another section of this Division not to question the person.

Example:    This section does not permit the person to be questioned when a person exercising authority under the warrant is required by section 34M or section 34N to defer questioning because an interpreter is not present.

##### <a id="34ZQ"></a>34ZQ  Involvement of lawyers

             (1)  This section applies if the person (the **_subject_**) specified in a warrant issued under this Division contacts another person as a legal adviser as permitted by the warrant or a direction under paragraph 34K(1)(d).

Contact to be able to be monitored

             (2)  The contact must be made in a way that can be monitored by a person exercising authority under the warrant.

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not apply in relation to a warrant issued under section 34E if the contact is in circumstances covered by paragraph 34E(3)(a).

Legal adviser to be given copy of the warrant

             (4)  A person exercising authority under the warrant must give the legal adviser a copy of the warrant. This subsection does not:

                     (a)  require more than one person to give the legal adviser a copy of the warrant; or

                     (b)  entitle the legal adviser to be given a copy of, or see, a document other than the warrant.

Breaks in questioning to give legal advice

             (5)  The prescribed authority before whom the subject is being questioned must provide a reasonable opportunity for the legal adviser to advise the subject during breaks in the questioning.

Note:          The prescribed authority may set breaks between periods of questioning by giving directions under section 34K. Paragraphs 34R(13)(b) to (d) also contain examples of procedural breaks in questioning.

             (6)  The legal adviser must not intervene in questioning of the subject or address the prescribed authority before whom the subject is being questioned, except to request clarification of an ambiguous question.

Breaks in questioning to address prescribed authority

             (7)  During a break in the questioning of the subject, the legal adviser may request the prescribed authority for an opportunity to address the prescribed authority on a matter.

Note:          The prescribed authority may set breaks between periods of questioning by giving directions under section 34K. Paragraphs 34R(13)(b) to (d) also contain examples of procedural breaks in questioning.

             (8)  The prescribed authority must approve or refuse a request under subsection (7).

Removal of legal adviser for disrupting questioning

             (9)  If the prescribed authority considers the legal adviser’s conduct is unduly disrupting the questioning, the authority may direct a person exercising authority under the warrant to remove the legal adviser from the place where the questioning is occurring.

           (10)  If the prescribed authority directs the removal of the legal adviser, the prescribed authority must also direct under paragraph 34K(1)(d) that the subject may contact someone else as a legal adviser. Subsection 34K(2) does not prevent the prescribed authority from giving the direction under paragraph 34K(1)(d) in accordance with this subsection.

If legal adviser also represents young person

           (11)  If section 34ZR also applies to the legal adviser in another capacity in relation to the subject, this section does not apply to conduct of the legal adviser in that other capacity.

##### <a id="34ZR"></a>34ZR  Conduct of parents etc.

             (1)  This section applies in relation to a person (the **_representative_**) who:

                     (a)  is either:

                              (i)  the parent or guardian of a person (the **_subject_**) specified in a warrant issued under this Division; or

                             (ii)  another person who meets the requirements in subsection 34ZE(7) in relation to the subject; and

                     (b)  either:

                              (i)  is or has been contacted by the subject as permitted by the warrant or a direction under paragraph 34K(1)(d); or

                             (ii)  is or has been present when the subject was before a prescribed authority for questioning under the warrant.

             (2)  If a prescribed authority considers the representative’s conduct is unduly disrupting questioning of the subject, the authority may direct a person exercising authority under the warrant to remove the representative from the place where the questioning is occurring.

             (3)  If the prescribed authority directs the removal of the representative, the prescribed authority must also:

                     (a)  inform the subject that the subject:

                              (i)  may request that one of the subject’s parents or guardians or one other person who meets the requirements in subsection 34ZE(7), other than the representative, be present during the questioning; and

                             (ii)  may contact a person covered by subparagraph (i) to request the person to be present during the questioning; and

                     (b)  if the subject requests that one of the subject’s parents or guardians, other than the representative, be present during the questioning—direct everyone proposing to question the subject under the warrant not to do so in the absence of the parent or guardian; and

                     (c)  if the subject does not request that one of the subject’s parents or guardians, other than the representative, be present during the questioning—direct everyone proposing to question the subject under the warrant not to do so in the absence of another person (other than the prescribed authority) who meets the requirements in subsection 34ZE(7); and

                     (d)  direct under paragraph 34K(1)(d) that the subject may contact a person covered by subparagraph (a)(i) of this subsection to request the person to be present during the questioning.

Subsection 34K(2) does not prevent the prescribed authority from giving the direction under paragraph 34K(1)(d) in accordance with this subsection.

                     (b)  a lawyer who has at any time been:

          (1A)  This section does not apply to a security assessment if section 38A applies to the assessment.

             (2)  The Attorney‑General may, by writing signed by the Attorney‑General delivered to the Director‑General, certify that the Attorney‑General is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the withholding of notice to a person of the making of a security assessment in respect of the person is essential to the security of the nation; or
