             (2)  In performing and exercising its functions and powers, APRA is to balance the objectives of financial safety and efficiency, competition, contestability and competitive neutrality and, in balancing these objectives, is to promote financial system stability in Australia.

             (4)  The performance of a function or the exercise of a power by APRA is not invalid merely because of a failure by APRA to comply with this section.

                     (b)  an approval given by the Minister for the purposes of this subsection.

Agreements for performance of prudential regulation or advice services

Subsection (2) agreement may deal with liabilities between the parties

             (3)  An agreement entered into in accordance with subsection (2) may make provision in relation to the circumstances in which, and the extent to which, one party to the agreement is liable to the other party to the agreement in respect of matters arising under or out of the agreement.

                     (b)  changes to, or in relation to, any prudential regulation framework law that APRA considers would overcome or assist in overcoming problems APRA has identified in the course of performing or exercising any of its functions and powers.

             (3)  In addition, APRA must advise the Minister, if requested by the Minister, and may advise the Minister on its own initiative, respecting any of the Minister’s functions and powers.

##### <a id="10A"></a>10A  Cooperation with other agencies

             (1)  The Parliament intends that APRA should, in performing and exercising its functions and powers, have regard to the desirability of APRA cooperating with other financial sector supervisory agencies, and with other agencies specified in regulations for the purposes of this subsection.

             (2)  This section does not override any restrictions that would otherwise apply to APRA or confer any powers on APRA that it would not otherwise have.

             (3)  APRA may enter into contracts in its own right.

Note:          The Chair of APRA may also enter into contracts on behalf of the Commonwealth. See section 44 of the _Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997_.

             (4)  Any real or personal property held by APRA is held for and on behalf of the Commonwealth.

             (5)  Any money received by APRA is received for and on behalf of the Commonwealth.

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Directions by Minister respecting APRA policies and priorities

             (2)  The Minister must not give a direction under subsection (1) unless he or she has:

                     (a)  notified APRA in writing that he or she is considering giving the direction; and

                     (b)  to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after the publication;

but failure of the Minister to do so does not affect the direction’s validity.

             (6)  This section does not limit any other powers to give directions that the Minister has under any other law.

##### <a id="12A"></a>12A  Chair not subject to direction by APRA on certain matters

             (5)  The Finance Minister may delegate, in writing, to an SES employee or acting SES employee in the Department that is administered by the Finance Minister, the Finance Minister’s power of approval for the purposes of subsection (1).

_Tax Laws Amendment (Repeal of Inoperative Provisions) Act 2006 
 (No. 101, 2006)_

## Schedule 6

## 1  Application of Schedule 1 and 2 amendments

Except as mentioned in items 2 and 3, the repeals and amendments made by Schedules 1 and 2 apply:

                     (a)  so far as they affect assessments—to assessments for the 2006‑07 income year and all later income years; and

                     (b)  otherwise—to acts done or omitted to be done, or states of affairs existing, after the commencement of the repeals and amendments.

## 6  Object

The object of this Part is to ensure that, despite the repeals and amendments made by this Act, the full legal and administrative consequences of:

                     (a)  any act done or omitted to be done; or

                     (b)  any state of affairs existing; or

                     (c)  any period ending;

before such a repeal or amendment applies, can continue to arise and be carried out, directly or indirectly through an indefinite number of steps, even if some or all of those steps are taken after the repeal or amendment applies.

## 7  Making and amending assessments, and doing other things, in relation to past matters

Even though an Act is repealed or amended by this Act, the repeal or amendment is disregarded for the purpose of doing any of the following under any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_):

                     (a)  making or amending an assessment (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

                     (b)  exercising any right or power, performing any obligation or duty or doing any other thing (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

Example 1: On 31 July 1999, Greg Ltd lodged its annual return under former section 160ARE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The return stated that the company had a credit on its franking account and that no franking deficit tax was payable for the 1998‑99 franking year. Under former section 160ARH of that Act, the Commissioner was taken to have made an assessment consistent with the return.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of Part IIIAA of that Act, the Commissioner concludes that Greg Ltd fraudulently overfranked dividends it paid during the 1998‑99 franking year, and had a franking account deficit for that franking year. As a result, the Commissioner considers that franking deficit tax and a penalty by way of additional tax are payable.

                   The Commissioner can amend the assessment under former section 160ARN of that Act, because item 7 of this Schedule disregards the repeal of that section for the purposes of making an assessment in relation to the 1998‑99 franking year. Item 7 will also disregard the repeal of Division 11 of former Part IIIAA to the extent necessary for the Commissioner to assess Greg Ltd’s liability to a penalty by way of additional tax.

                   Despite the repeal of sections 160ARU and 160ARV, item 9 will ensure that the general interest charge will accrue on the unpaid franking deficit tax and penalty until they are paid.

                   Item 7 will also preserve Greg Ltd’s right, under former section 160ART of that Act, to object against the Commissioner’s amended assessment (including the penalty), since the objection is the exercise of a right in relation to a franking year that ended before the repeal of Part IIIAA.

Example 2: During the 1997‑98 income year, Duffy Property Ltd withheld amounts from its employees’ wages as required by former Divisions 1AAA and 2 of Part VI of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The company failed to notify the Commissioner of those amounts, and failed to remit them to the Commissioner.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of those Divisions, the Commissioner discovers that the withheld amounts have not been remitted. The company’s records are incomplete and the Commissioner is unable to completely ascertain the extent of its liability for the withheld amounts. Under section 222AGA of that Act, the Commissioner makes an estimate of the liability.

                   Item 7 will disregard the repeal of section 220AAZA of that Act (which empowered the Commissioner to recover the amount of the estimate). Even though the estimate is made after the repeal, it relates to amounts withheld before the repeal.

## 8  Saving of provisions about effect of assessments

If a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act deals with the effect of an assessment, the repeal or amendment is disregarded in relation to assessments made, before or after the repeal or amendment applies, in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

## 9  Saving of provisions about general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty

If:

                     (a)  a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act provides for the payment of:

                              (i)  general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty (all within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_); or

                             (ii)  interest under the _Taxation (Interest on Overpayments and Early Payments) Act 1983_; and

                     (b)  in a particular case, the period in respect of which the charge, penalty or interest is payable (whether under the provision or under the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_) has not begun, or has begun but not ended, when the provision is repealed or amended;

then, despite the repeal or amendment, the provision or part continues to apply in the particular case until the end of the period.

## 10  Repeals disregarded for the purposes of dependent provisions

If the operation of a provision (the **_subject provision_**) of any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_) made under any Act depends to any extent on an Act, or a provision of an Act, that is repealed by this Act, the repeal is disregarded so far as it affects the operation of the subject provision.

## 11  Schedule does not limit operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_

This Schedule does not limit the operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.
