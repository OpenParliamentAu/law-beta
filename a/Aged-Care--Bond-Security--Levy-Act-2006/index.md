Note:          This table relates only to the provisions of this Act as originally passed by the Parliament and assented to. It will not be expanded to deal with provisions inserted in this Act after assent.

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Definitions

                   In this Act:

                    <a name="approved-provid"></a>**_approved provider_** has the meaning given by the Dictionary in Schedule 1 to the _Aged Care Act 1997_.

                    <a name="bond-balanc"></a>**_bond balance_** has the same meaning as in the _Aged Care (Bond Security) Act 2006_.

                    <a name="cost-recoup-determin"></a>**_costs recoupment determination_** means:

                     (a)  a refund costs recoupment determination within the meaning of the _Aged Care (Bond Security) Act 2006_; or

                     (b)  an administrative costs recoupment determination within the meaning of that Act.

                    <a name="default-event-declar"></a>**_default event declaration_** has the same meaning as in the _Aged Care (Bond Security) Act 2006_.

                    <a name="levi"></a>**_levy_** means levy imposed by regulations under section 6.

                    <a name="outstanding-bond-balanc"></a>**_outstanding bond balance_** has the same meaning as in the _Aged Care (Bond Security) Act 2006_.

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Regulations may impose levy

             (1)  If a costs recoupment determination specifying a default event declaration has been made, the regulations may impose a levy in respect of the refund obligations of approved providers relating to the default event declaration.

             (2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), the **_refund obligations of approved providers_** relating to a default event declaration is the set of obligations that the approved providers would have had, at the start of the day that was 10 days before the day on which the default event declaration was made, to refund bond balances if it were assumed that at that time the bond balances became outstanding bond balances.

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Rate of levy

                   The rate of the levy is worked out in accordance with the regulations.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Maximum rate of levy

                   The rate of the levy is to be fixed on the basis that the amount of revenue to be raised by the levy must not exceed the costs recoupment amount specified in the costs recoupment determination, the making of which enabled the levy to be imposed.

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Levy may discriminate between classes of approved providers

             (1)  Regulations imposing a levy:

                     (a)  may provide different rates (including a zero rate) of the levy for different classes of approved providers; but

                     (b)  must not otherwise discriminate between different approved providers.

             (2)  Regulations imposing a levy may define what constitutes a class of approved providers for the purposes of the levy, but must not define a class in such a way that the levy would discriminate between States or parts of States.

##### <a id="10"></a>10  Regulations

                     (a)  required or permitted by this Act to be prescribed; or
