Immediate grant of land to Anindilyakwa Land Trust

                     (a)  execute a deed of grant to the Anindilyakwa Land Trust of an estate in fee simple in so much of the land in the area of the Anindilyakwa Land Council as was included in any Arnhem Land type 1 deed (regardless of whether the deed also included other land); and

                     (b)  deliver it to the Anindilyakwa Land Trust.

The deed of grant is not a legislative instrument.

Note:          See subsection (9) for the definition of **_Arnhem Land type 1 deed_**.

Delayed grant of land to Anindilyakwa Land Trust

             (2)  The Governor-General may:

                     (a)  execute a deed of grant to the Anindilyakwa Land Trust of an estate in fee simple in so much of the land in the area of the Anindilyakwa Land Council as was included in any Arnhem Land type 2 deed; and

Another consequence is that the Anindilyakwa Land Trust will be able to apply under subsection 12(5) to have such a deed registered.

##### <a id="19A"></a>19A  Land Trust may grant headlease over township

Grant of lease

             (1)  A Land Trust may grant a lease of a township to an approved entity if:

                     (a)  the Minister consents, in writing, to the grant of the lease; and

                     (b)  the Land Council for the area in which the land is situated directs, in writing, the Land Trust to grant the lease.

A consent or direction under this subsection is not a legislative instrument.

Land Council direction

             (2)  A Land Council must not give a direction under subsection (1) for the grant of a lease unless it is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the traditional Aboriginal owners (if any) of the land understand the nature and purpose of the proposed lease and, as a group, consent to it; and

                     (b)  any Aboriginal community or group that may be affected by the proposed lease has been consulted and has had adequate opportunity to express its view to the Land Council; and

                     (c)  the terms and conditions of the proposed lease (except those relating to matters covered by this section) are reasonable.

             (3)  If a Land Council, in giving a direction for a grant of a lease, fails to comply with subsection (2), that failure does not invalidate that grant unless the approved entity to whom the grant was made procured the direction of the Land Council by fraud.

Term of lease

             (4)  Subject to subsection (5), the term of a lease granted under this section is 99 years.

             (5)  If, before the end of the 69th year of the term of a lease (the **_original lease_**) granted under this section, a Land Trust grants another lease under this section to the same approved entity covering the area of land concerned (whether or not the other lease also covers other land), the original lease ends at the time the other lease takes effect.

             (6)  A lease granted under this section must not make provision for the lessee to make a payment to a person other than the lessor.

Transfer of lease

             (8)  A lease granted under this section must not be transferred, except to another approved entity with the written approval of the Minister. An approval is not a legislative instrument.

Lease not to be used as security

             (9)  A lease granted under this section must not be used as security for a borrowing.

Preserving any existing right, title or other interest

           (10)  Any right, title or other interest in land the subject of a lease granted under this section that existed immediately before the time the lease takes effect is preserved as a right, title or interest in that land after that time.

           (11)  If that right, title or other interest was granted by the Land Trust, then, at the time the lease granted under this section takes effect, that right, title or other interest has effect as if it were granted by the approved entity on the same terms and conditions as existed immediately before that time.

           (12)  If:

                     (a)  subsection (11) applies in relation to a right, title or other interest; and

                     (b)  the lease is transferred in accordance with this section; and

                     (c)  the right, title or other interest existed immediately before the time the transfer takes effect;

then, at that time, the right, title or other interest has effect as if it were granted by the transferee on the same terms and conditions as existed immediately before that time.

Subleases

           (13)  This section does not prevent a sublease of a lease granted under this section.

           (14)  A lease granted under this section must not contain any provision requiring the consent of any person to the grant of a sublease of the lease.
