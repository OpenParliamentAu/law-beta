             (1)  Subject to subsection (4):

                     (a)  initiating process in a proceeding commenced as an action _in rem_ in the Federal Court may be served on a ship or other property; and

                     (b)  a ship or other property may be arrested in such a proceeding;

at any place within Australia, including a place within the limits of the territorial sea of Australia.

             (2)  Subject to subsection (4), initiating process in a proceeding commenced as an action _in rem_ in a court of a State or a Territory may be served on a ship or other property:

                     (a)  if, at a time when the process was effective for service, the ship or property was within the locality within which the court may exercise jurisdiction—at any place within Australia, including a place within the limits of the territorial sea of Australia; or

                     (b)  in any case—at any place within the State or Territory, including a place within the limits of the territorial sea of Australia that is adjacent to the State or Territory.

             (3)  Subject to subsection (4), in a proceeding commenced as an action _in rem_ in a court of a State or Territory, a ship or other property may be arrested at any place within Australia, including a place within the limits of the territorial sea of Australia.

             (4)  Where the arrest of a foreign ship, or of cargo on board a foreign ship, would be inconsistent with a right of innocent passage that is being exercised by the ship, this Act does not authorise the service of process on the ship or the arrest of the ship or cargo.

             (5)  In this section:

                    <a name="innoc-passag"></a>**_innocent passage_** has the meaning it has under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea done at Montego Bay on 10 December 1982.

Note:          For the Convention on the Law of the Sea see the Schedule to the _Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973_.

                   Where, but for the sale of a ship or other property under this Act, a proceeding could have been commenced as an action _in rem_ against the ship or property, the proceeding may be commenced as an action _in rem_ against the proceeds of the sale that have been paid into a court under this Act.

##### <a id="25"></a>25  Limitation of liability under Liability Conventions

             (1)  A person who apprehends that a claim for compensation under a law (including a law of a State or a Territory) that gives effect to provisions of a Liability Convention may be made against the person by some other person may apply to the Federal Court to determine the question whether the liability of the first-mentioned person in respect of the claim may be limited under that law.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not affect the jurisdiction of any other court.

             (3)  On an application under subsection (1), the Federal Court may, in accordance with the law referred to in that subsection:

                     (b)  order the constitution of a limitation fund for the payment of claims in respect of which the applicant is entitled to limit his or her liability; and

                     (c)  make such orders as are just with respect to the administration and distribution of that fund.

             (4)  Where a court has jurisdiction under this Act in respect of a proceeding, that jurisdiction extends to entertaining a defence in the proceeding by way of limitation of liability under a law that gives effect to provisions of a Liability Convention.

##### <a id="26"></a>26  Proceedings under Civil Liability Convention

                   A proceeding under this Act on a maritime claim referred to in paragraph 4(3)(b) shall not be brought otherwise than in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 3 of Article IX of the Civil Liability Convention, whether or not the proceeding also relates to a maritime claim or to a maritime lien or other charge.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not authorise the transfer of a proceeding commenced as an action _in rem_ to a court that does not, apart from the operation of subsection 28(7), have jurisdiction in respect of proceedings so commenced.

             (3)  Where a proceeding has been so transferred, the second court shall proceed as if:

                     (a)  the proceeding had been commenced in that court;

                     (b)  if service of the initiating process was effected on the ship or property in a Territory—a court of that Territory;

being a court that would have had jurisdiction in respect of the proceeding if:

                     (c)  the proceeding had been commenced in that court as an action _in personam_; and

                     (d)  service of initiating process in that proceeding had been effected within the locality within which that court may exercise jurisdiction.

             (2)  Where a proceeding commenced under this Act as an action _in rem_ is pending in the Supreme Court of a Territory, the court may, at any stage of the proceeding, upon application or on its own motion, remit the proceeding for hearing to some other court of the Territory that would have had jurisdiction in respect of the proceeding if:

                     (a)  the proceeding had been commenced in that court as an action _in personam_; and

                     (b)  service of initiating process in that proceeding had been effected in that Territory.

             (3)  The court from which the proceeding is remitted (in this section called the **_first court_**) may give such orders or directions as are appropriate in relation to the further steps to be taken in the proceeding and, subject to any such orders and directions, the court to which the proceeding is remitted (in this section called the **_second court_**) may give orders and directions of a similar kind.

             (4)  Subject to any orders and directions given under subsection (3), the second court shall proceed as if:

             (6)  Subsection (5) does not affect:

                     (a)  a right of appeal that a party to the proceeding has; or

                     (b)  the power of a court to stay execution pending an appeal.

             (7)  The second court is invested with federal jurisdiction, or, if that court is the Federal Magistrates Court or a court of a Territory, jurisdiction is conferred on that court, in respect of the proceeding.

##### <a id="29"></a>29  Security in relation to stayed or dismissed proceedings

             (1)  Where:

                     (a)  it appears to the court in which a proceeding commenced under this Act is pending that the proceeding should be stayed or dismissed on the ground that the claim concerned should be determined by arbitration (whether in Australia or elsewhere) or by a court of a foreign country; and

                     (b)  a ship or other property is under arrest in the proceeding;

the court may order that the proceeding be stayed on condition that the ship or property be retained by the court as security for the satisfaction of any award or judgment that may be made in the arbitration or in a proceeding in the court of the foreign country.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not limit any other power of the court.

             (3)  The power of the court to stay or dismiss a proceeding includes power to do so on such conditions as are just, including a condition:

                     (a)  with respect to the institution or prosecution of the arbitration or proceeding in the court of the foreign country; and

                     (b)  that equivalent security be provided for the satisfaction of any award or judgment that may be made in the arbitration or in the proceeding in the court of the foreign country.

             (4)  Where a court has made an order under subsection (1) or (3), the court may make such interim or supplementary orders as are appropriate in relation to the ship or property for the purpose of preserving:

                     (a)  the ship or property; or

                     (b)  the rights of a party or of a person interested in the ship or property.

             (5)  Where:

                     (a)  a ship or other property is under arrest in a proceeding;

                     (b)  an award or judgment as mentioned in subsection (1) has been made in favour of a party; and

                     (c)  apart from this section, the award or judgment is enforceable in Australia;

then, in addition to any other proceeding that may be taken by the party to enforce the award or judgment, the party may apply to the court in the stayed proceeding for an appropriate order in relation to the ship or property to give effect to the award or judgment.

##### <a id="30"></a>30  Power to deal with ship or other property

             (4)  Where a court has made an order under paragraph (2)(b), the court to which the proceeding has been transferred or remitted has the same powers in relation to the ship or property as it has in relation to a ship or other property under arrest in a proceeding commenced in that court.

## Part V—Miscellaneous

##### <a id="31"></a>31  Effect of judgment

             (1)  Where judgment is given for the plaintiff in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action _in rem_ against a ship or other property, the extent to which a defendant in the proceeding who has entered an appearance and is a relevant person in relation to the claim is personally liable on the judgment is not limited by the value of the ship or property.

             (2)  Where judgment is given for the plaintiff in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action _in rem_ against a ship or other property, a defendant in the proceeding who has entered an appearance and is not a relevant person in relation to the claim is not personally liable on the judgment for the payment of money in respect of the claim except so far as the judgment is for costs against that defendant.

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not prevent the sale, under this Act, of a ship or other property that is under arrest in a proceeding.

             (2)  Where the ship is under arrest under this Act, the power to detain the ship shall not be exercised.

             (3)  The exercise of the power to detain the ship does not prevent the arrest of the ship under this Act.
