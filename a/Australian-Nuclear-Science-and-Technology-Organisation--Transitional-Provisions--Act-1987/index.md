##### <a id="1"></a>1  Short title [_see_ Note 1]

                   This Act may be cited as the _Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (Transitional Provisions) Act 1987_.

##### <a id="2"></a>2  Commencement [_see_ Note 1]

                   This Act shall come into operation on the day on which the _Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Act 1987_ comes into operation.

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Interpretation

                   Expressions used in this Act have, unless the contrary intention appears, the same meaning as those expressions have in the _Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Act 1987_.

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Application

                   This Act has effect notwithstanding anything contained in the _Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Act 1987_.

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Members of Commission cease to hold office

                   On the commencing day, the Chairman, the Deputy Chairman and the other members of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission who held office immediately before that day cease to hold office, but the corporate identity of the body corporate referred to in subsection 4(1) of the _Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Act 1987_ is preserved.

##### <a id="6"></a>6  References to Commission in instruments, etc.

                   A reference to the Australian Atomic Energy Commission in any law of the Commonwealth, in any law of a Territory, or in any contract, award or other instrument to which the Australian Atomic Energy Commission was a party, shall, except in relation to matters that occurred before the commencing day, be construed as a reference to the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation.

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Property, powers, liabilities, etc.

                   The alteration of the name and constitution of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission resulting from section 4 of the _Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Act 1987_ does not affect any property, powers, rights, liabilities or obligations of the body corporate continued in existence by that section.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Saving of proceedings

             (1)  The alteration of the name and constitution of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission resulting from section 4 of the _Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Act 1987_ does not render defective any legal or other proceedings instituted or to be instituted by or against the body corporate continued in existence by that section, and any legal or other proceedings that might have been continued or commenced by or against the body corporate by the name of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission may be continued or commenced by or against the body corporate by the name of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation.

             (2)  The alteration of the name and constitution of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission resulting from section 4 of the _Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Act 1987_ does not render defective any investigation being or proposed to be undertaken by the Commonwealth Ombudsman under the _Ombudsman Act 1976_ into any action taken before the commencing day by the body corporate continued in existence by that section, and any investigation that might have been continued or commenced into any action taken by the body corporate by the name of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission may be continued or commenced as if the action had been taken by the body corporate by the name of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation.

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Judicial notice

                   All courts, judges and persons acting judicially shall take judicial notice of the imprint of the seal of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission appearing on a document that was executed before the commencing day and shall presume that the document was duly sealed.

##### <a id="10"></a>10  Officers and employees

             (1)  Any person who was an officer (including an officer on probation) or an employee of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission immediately before the commencing day by virtue of his or her having been appointed or engaged under subsection 21(1) of the _Atomic Energy Act 1953_ continues, subject to the _Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Act 1987_, as an officer or employee, as the case may be, of the Organisation as if the person had been appointed or engaged under section 24 of the last-mentioned Act.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to a person whose employment as an officer or employee of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission would, if the _Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Act 1987_ and this Act had not been enacted, have terminated immediately before the commencing day.

             (3)  The Board shall, upon the commencing day, be deemed to have determined under subsection 24(3) of the _Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Act 1987_ with the approval of the Public Service Board terms and conditions of service or employment of officers and employees of the Organisation to whom subsection (1) of this section applies that are the same as the terms and conditions of service or employment of those officers and employees immediately before the commencing day.

##### <a id="11"></a>11  Application of money

                   Notwithstanding section 27 of the _Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Act 1987_, the money of the Organisation may be applied:

                     (a)  in payment or discharge of any expenses, charges, obligations or liabilities that were incurred or undertaken before the commencing day by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission in or in connection with the performance of its functions or the exercise of its powers and were not paid or discharged before that day; and

                     (b)  in payment of any remuneration or allowances the liability for which arose under Part II of the _Atomic Energy Act 1953_ but which had not been paid before the commencing day.

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Estimates

                   Where estimates of receipts and expenses were prepared by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission under subsection 30A(1) of the _Atomic Energy Act 1953_ in relation to a period after the commencement of the _Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Act 1987_, or in relation to a period that included a period after that commencement:

                     (a)  those estimates shall be deemed to be estimates of receipts and expenditure prepared by the Board under subsection 28(1) of the _Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Act 1987_; and

                     (b)  if those estimates, in so far as they were estimates of expenses, related to a period that included a period before the commencement of the _Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Act 1987_—any expenditure in accordance with those estimates by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission shall, for the purposes of the application of those estimates in relation to the Organisation, be deemed to have been incurred by the Organisation.

##### <a id="13"></a>13  Bank accounts

                   The bank accounts maintained by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission immediately before the commencing day continue in existence as bank accounts of the Organisation as if they had been opened by the Organisation under section 63J of the _Audit Act 1901_ as that section applies to the Organisation by virtue of section 29 of the _Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Act 1987_.

##### <a id="14"></a>14  Audit
