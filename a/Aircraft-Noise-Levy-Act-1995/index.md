##### <a id="1"></a>1  Short title [_see_ Note 1]

##### <a id="2"></a>2  Commencement [_see_ Note 1]

             (2)  Levy is not imposed on a landing:

                     (a)   if the aircraft making the landing:

                              (i)  is a state aircraft within the meaning of section 3 of the _Civil Aviation Act 1988_; or

                             (ii)  has an assessed noise (as defined in subsection 6(1)) of less than 265; or

                              (i)  a purpose that relates to the provision of emergency services and that is prescribed by the regulations; or

where:

                    <a name="assessed-nois"></a>**_assessed noise_** means the number equal to the effective perceived noise level of the aircraft concerned, in Effective Perceived Noise Decibels, determined in accordance with the regulations;

                     (a)  the type of the aircraft;

                     (b)  the noise made by another aircraft of the same type at a test conducted before the landing on which the levy is imposed.

             (3)  The regulations made for the purposes of the definition of **_levy unit_** must not provide for an amount to be worked out that exceeds:

                     (a)  if the amount applies in relation to a landing made in the financial year ending on 30 June 1996—$180.00; or

                     (b)  if the amount applies in relation to a landing made in a later financial year—110% of the maximum amount that could have been provided for by regulations in relation to a landing in the immediately preceding financial year.

             (4)  The regulations made for the purposes of the definition of **_levy unit_** must provide for only one amount to apply to all landings made during a particular period (regardless of where each of the landings is made).
