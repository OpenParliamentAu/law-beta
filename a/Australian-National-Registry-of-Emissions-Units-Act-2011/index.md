                     (c)  the person entered into the scheme with the intention of securing or achieving the result, either generally or for a limited period, that, in the event that the body corporate or trust were to become liable to pay the penalty, the body corporate or trust:

                              (i)  will be unable; or

                             (ii)  will be likely to be unable; or

                            (iii)  will continue to be unable; or

                            (iv)  will be likely to continue to be unable;

                            having regard to the other debts of the body corporate or trust, to pay the penalty.

                    Penalty:  Imprisonment for 10 years or 10,000 penalty units, or both.

             (2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), it is immaterial whether the body corporate or the trustee of the trust is:

                     (a)  the person mentioned in subsection (1); or

                     (b)  a party to the scheme.

Knowledge or belief

             (3)  A person commits an offence if:

                     (a)  a penalty is due and payable by a body corporate or trust under section 66F; and

                     (b)  before the penalty became due and payable, the person entered into a scheme; and

                     (c)  the person entered into the scheme with the knowledge or belief that the scheme will, or will be likely to, secure or achieve the result, either generally or for a limited period, that, in the event that the body corporate or trust were to become liable to pay the penalty, the body corporate or trust:

                              (i)  will be unable; or

                             (ii)  will be likely to be unable; or

                            (iii)  will continue to be unable; or

                            (iv)  will be likely to continue to be unable;

Objective purpose

             (5)  A person (the **_first person_**) commits an offence if:

                     (a)  a penalty is due and payable by a body corporate or trust under section 66F; and

                     (b)  before the penalty became due and payable, the first person entered into a scheme; and

                            (iii)  the timing of the scheme;

                            it would be reasonable to conclude that the first person entered into the scheme for the sole or dominant purpose of securing or achieving the result, either generally or for a limited period, that, in the event that the body corporate or trust were to become liable to pay the penalty, the body corporate or trust:

                            (iv)  will be unable; or

                             (v)  will be likely to be unable; or

                            (vi)  will continue to be unable; or

             (2)  An order under subsection (1) is to be known as a **_civil penalty order_**.

Determining amount of pecuniary penalty

             (3)  In determining the pecuniary penalty, the Court may have regard to all relevant matters, including:

                     (a)  the nature and extent of the contravention; and

                      (f)  if the person is a body corporate:

                              (i)  the level of the employees, officers or agents of the body corporate involved in the contravention; and

                     (b)  otherwise—2,000 penalty units for each contravention.

Civil enforcement of penalty

             (6)  A pecuniary penalty is a civil debt payable to the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth may enforce the civil penalty order as if it were an order made in civil proceedings against the person to recover a debt due by the person. The debt arising from the order is taken to be a judgement debt.

##### <a id="70"></a>70  Who may apply for a civil penalty order

             (1)  Only the Regulator may apply for a civil penalty order.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not exclude the operation of the _Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983_.

##### <a id="71"></a>71  Two or more proceedings may be heard together

                   The Court may direct that 2 or more proceedings for civil penalty orders are to be heard together.

##### <a id="72"></a>72  Time limit for application for an order

##### <a id="73"></a>73  Civil evidence and procedure rules for civil penalty orders

                   The Court must apply the rules of evidence and procedure for civil matters when hearing proceedings for a civil penalty order.

##### <a id="74"></a>74  Civil proceedings after criminal proceedings

                   The Court must not make a civil penalty order against a person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision if the person has been convicted of an offence constituted by conduct that is substantially the same as the conduct constituting the contravention.

##### <a id="75"></a>75  Criminal proceedings during civil proceedings

             (1)  Proceedings for a civil penalty order against a person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision are stayed if:

                     (a)  criminal proceedings are started or have already been started against the person for an offence; and

                     (b)  the offence is constituted by conduct that is substantially the same as the conduct alleged to  constitute the contravention.

             (2)  The proceedings for the order may be resumed if the person is not convicted of the offence. Otherwise, the proceedings for the order are dismissed.

##### <a id="76"></a>76  Criminal proceedings after civil proceedings

                   Criminal proceedings may be started against a person for conduct that is substantially the same as conduct constituting a contravention of a civil penalty provision regardless of whether a civil penalty order has been made against the person.

##### <a id="77"></a>77  Evidence given in proceedings for a civil penalty order not admissible in criminal proceedings

                   Evidence of information given, or evidence of production of documents, by an individual is not admissible in criminal proceedings against the individual if:

                     (b)  the conduct alleged to constitute the offence is substantially the same as the conduct that was claimed to constitute the contravention.

However, this does not apply to a criminal proceeding in respect of the falsity of the evidence given by the individual in the proceedings for the civil penalty order.

##### <a id="78"></a>78  Mistake of fact

             (1)  A person is not liable to have a civil penalty order made against the person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision if:

                     (a)  at or before the time of the conduct constituting the contravention, the person:

                              (i)  considered whether or not facts existed; and

                             (ii)  was under a mistaken but reasonable belief about those facts; and

                     (b)  had those facts existed, the conduct would not have constituted a contravention of the civil penalty provision.

             (2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), a person may be regarded as having considered whether or not facts existed if:

                     (a)  the person had considered, on a previous occasion, whether those facts existed in the circumstances surrounding that occasion; and

                     (b)  the person honestly and reasonably believed that the circumstances surrounding the present occasion were the same, or substantially the same, as those surrounding the previous occasion.

             (3)  A person who wishes to rely on subsection (1) or (2) in proceedings for a civil penalty order bears an evidential burden in relation to that matter.

##### <a id="80"></a>80  Continuing contraventions

             (1)  If an act or thing is required, under a civil penalty provision of this Act, to be done within a particular period, or before a particular time, then the obligation to do that act or thing continues (even if the period has expired or the time has passed) until the act or thing is done.

             (2)  A person who contravenes subsection 27(4), so far as that subsection relates to a requirement mentioned in subsection 27(2), commits a separate contravention of that provision in respect of each day (including a day of the making of a relevant civil penalty order or any subsequent day) during which the contravention continues.

             (3)  The pecuniary penalty payable under subsection 69(1) for such a separate contravention in respect of a particular day must not exceed 5% of the maximum pecuniary penalty that could have been imposed for the contravention if subsection (2) of this section had not been enacted.
