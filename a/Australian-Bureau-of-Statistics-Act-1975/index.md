##### <a id="6"></a>6  Functions of Bureau

             (1)  The functions of the Bureau are as follows:

                     (a)  to constitute the central statistical authority for the Australian Government and, by arrangements with the Governments of the States, provide statistical services for those Governments;

                     (b)  to collect, compile, analyse and disseminate statistics and related information;

                     (c)  to ensure co-ordination of the operations of official bodies in the collection, compilation and dissemination of statistics and related information, with particular regard to:

                              (i)  the avoidance of duplication in the collection by official bodies of information for statistical purposes;

                             (ii)  the attainment of compatibility between, and the integration of, statistics compiled by official bodies; and

                            (iii)  the maximum possible utilization, for statistical purposes, of information, and means of collection of information, available to official bodies;

                     (d)  to formulate, and ensure compliance with, standards for the carrying out by official bodies of operations for statistical purposes;

                     (e)  to provide advice and assistance to official bodies in relation to statistics; and

                      (f)  to provide liaison between Australia, on the one hand, and other countries and international organizations, on the other hand, in relation to statistical matters.

             (2)  For the purpose of the performance of its functions and for the purpose of co-ordinating statistical activities and securing the observance of statistical standards, the Bureau may collaborate with bodies, being Departments and authorities of the States, the Administrations and authorities of the external Territories and local governing bodies, in the collection, compilation, analysis and dissemination of statistics, including statistics obtained from the records of those bodies.

             (3)  Subject to subsection (4), each new proposal for the collection of information for statistical purposes by the Bureau shall be laid before both Houses of the Parliament before its implementation, unless the proposal is for the collection of information on a voluntary basis.

             (4)  Where, in relation to a proposal to which subsection (3) is applicable, being a proposal for the collection of information relating to businesses, the Minister considers it necessary to commence implementation of the proposal at a time when it is not practicable to comply with subsection (3) the Minister may authorize the implementation of the proposal without compliance with that subsection but in such a case particulars of the nature of the information to which the authorization relates shall be laid before each House of the Parliament within 5 sitting days of that House after the giving of the authorization.

             (5)  For the purposes of this section:

                     (a)  a reference to statistical purposes shall be read as including purposes in connexion with the collection, compilation, analysis and dissemination of statistics; and

                     (b)  a reference to an official body shall be read as a reference to:

                              (i)  an Agency within the meaning of the _Public Service Act 1999_; or

                             (ii)  the holder of an office established for a public purpose by or under an Act or a law of an internal Territory; or

                            (iii)  a body corporate, or other body, established for a public purpose by or under an Act or a law of an internal Territory other than such a body corporate, or other body, that is declared by the regulations not to be an official body for the purposes of this Act.

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Appointment and tenure of office of Statistician

             (1)  The Statistician shall be appointed by the Governor-General and, subject to this Act, holds office for such period, not exceeding 7 years, as is specified in the instrument of his or her appointment but is eligible for re-appointment.

             (2)  The Governor-General may suspend the Statistician from office on the ground of misbehaviour or incapacity.

             (3)  Where the Governor-General suspends the Statistician from office, the Minister shall cause a statement of the ground of the suspension to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 7 sitting days of that House after the suspension.

             (4)  Where such a statement has been laid before a House of the Parliament, that House may, within 15 sitting days of that House after the day on which the statement has been laid before it, by resolution, declare that the Statistician should be removed from office and, if each House so passes such a resolution, the Governor-General shall remove the Statistician from office.

             (6)  The suspension of the Statistician from office under this section does not affect any entitlement of the Statistician to be paid remuneration and allowances.

             (3)  Where a person is acting in the office of Statistician in pursuance of an appointment under this section otherwise than during a vacancy in that office and the office becomes vacant while that person is so acting, that person may continue to act in the office until the Governor-General otherwise directs, the vacancy is filled or a period of 12 months from the date on which the vacancy occurred expires, whichever first happens.

             (4)  Sections 10 and 11 apply in relation to a person appointed under this section in like manner as they apply in relation to the Statistician.
