Part 2-1&#151;Introduction to the Pay as you go (PAYG) system
Division 6&#151;Guide to Parts 2-5 and 2-10


<dt>(1)</dt><dd>Parts 2-5 and 2-10 establish the PAYG system, which has 2 components:

</dd> 
<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

*	PAYG withholding (Part 2-5)

*	PAYG instalments (Part 2-10).

</dl></dl>
PAYG withholding
<dt>(2)</dt><dd>Under PAYG withholding, amounts are collected in respect of particular

kinds of payments or transactions. Usually, someone who makes a payment to you

is required to _withhold_ an amount from the payment, and then to pay the

amount to the Commissioner.

</dd> 

PAYG instalments
<dt>(3)</dt><dd>You pay PAYG instalments directly to the Commissioner. These are usually

based on your ordinary income for a past period, but excluding:

</dd> 
<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

*	income subject to PAYG withholding (with certain exceptions)

*	exempt income, or income that is otherwise not assessable. 

</dl></dl>
You are entitled to credits for the amounts of your income that are collected

under the PAYG system. The credits are applied under Division 3 of Part IIB

against your tax debts, and any excess is refunded to you.

\[The next Division is Division 16.]





Income Tax Assessment Act 1936









If Division 12 requires an entity to withhold an amount from a payment, the

entity must do so when making the payment.

 
<dl compact="">

Note 1:	An entity is required to withhold an amount under section

12-145 when an investor becomes presently entitled to income of a unit trust. Note 2:	If section 12-215, 12-250 or 12-285 requires an entity to withhold an amount from a payment received by the entity, the entity must do so immediately after receiving the payment.  </dl>

one covered by section 12-325) is to be worked out under the regulations.</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>Regulations made for the purposes of this section may deal differently with different payments. </dd>

Guide to Division 45 
 45-1  What this Division is about

If you have business or investment income, you must pay instalments towards your income tax liability: usually within 21 days after the end of each quarter. If you are not registered for GST purposes, you may be able to choose to pay an annual instalment on 21 October after the end of the income year.
 You do not have to pay instalments unless the Commissioner has given you an instalment rate.
 The amount of a quarterly instalment is worked out by multiplying your instalment income for the quarter by the rate the Commissioner gave you, or by a rate you choose yourself. If you are an individual who is not registered for GST purposes, you may be able to choose to have the amount of your instalment worked out on the basis of your previous year's income tax liability and notified to you by the Commissioner.
 The amount of an annual instalment can be your instalment income for the income year multiplied by the rate the Commissioner gave you; or an amount based on your previous year's income tax liability and notified to you by the Commissioner; or your own estimate of your income tax liability for the income year.

45-205  Choosing a varied instalment rate

amount of your instalment for an <sup>*</sup>instalment quarter in an income

year.</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>If you do so, you must use that instalment rate to work out the amount of that instalment. (You cannot later choose another instalment rate for working out that amount.) </dd> </dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note 1:	If choosing a rate leads you to pay an instalment that is

too low, you may be liable to general interest charge under section 45-230\.  Note 2:	If you choose a rate under this section, you must use it even if the Commissioner later gives you a new instalment rate.  </dl></dl>

subsection (1) for working out that amount.

</dd> </dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note 1:	If you choose a rate under this section, you must use it

even if the Commissioner later gives you a new instalment rate. Note 2:	If a rate you have chosen for an instalment quarter is not appropriate for a later instalment quarter in the same income year, you should choose another rate under subsection (1) for the later quarter. If the earlier rate is too low, you may be liable to general interest charge under section 45-230\.  </dl></dl>

before the end of that quarter, unless you again choose another instalment rate

under subsection (1).

</dd> </dl>

45-210  Notifying Commissioner of varied instalment rate

<dl compact="">

</dl></dl></dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

_Method statement_

_Step 1_.	Add up the instalments you are liable to pay for the earlier <sup>*</sup>instalment quarters in the income year (even if you have not yet paid all of them).
 _Step 2._	Subtract from the step 1 amount each earlier credit that you have claimed under this section in respect of the income year.

 _Step 4_.	Subtract the step 3 amount from the step 2 amount.
 _Step 5_.	If the result is a positive amount, it is the amount of the credit you can claim.
