##### <a id="6-1"></a>6-1  What Parts 2-5 and 2-10 are about

<div style="BORDER-RIGHT: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-RIGHT: 5pt; BORDER-TOP: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-LEFT: 5pt; PADDING-BOTTOM: 5pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 2cm; BORDER-LEFT: windowtext 1pt solid; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0cm; PADDING-TOP: 5pt; BORDER-BOTTOM: windowtext 1pt solid; mso-border-alt: solid windowtext .75pt">

To help taxpayers meet their annual income tax liability, they are required to pay amounts of their income at regular intervals as it is earned during the year. The system for collecting these amounts is called “Pay as you go”.

Amounts collected under this system also go towards meeting liability for Medicare levy and liability to repay contributions under the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS).</div>

6-10<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">          </span>How the amounts collected are dealt with<o:p></o:p>

##### <a id="6-5"></a>6-5  The Pay as you go (PAYG) system

             (1)  Parts 2-5 and 2-10 establish the PAYG system, which has 2 components:

                        •  PAYG withholding (Part 2-5)

                        •  PAYG instalments (Part 2-10).

PAYG withholding

             (2)  Under PAYG withholding, amounts are collected in respect of particular kinds of payments or transactions. Usually, someone who makes a payment to you is required to _withhold_ an amount from the payment, and then to pay the amount to the Commissioner.

For a list of the payments and other transactions to which
PAYG withholding applies, see Division 10

PAYG instalments

             (3)  You pay PAYG instalments directly to the Commissioner. These are usually based on your ordinary income for a past period, but excluding:

                        •  income subject to PAYG withholding (with certain exceptions)

                        •  exempt income, or income that is otherwise not assessable. 

An instalment is usually paid after each quarter, but some taxpayers are eligible to pay an annual instalment after the end of the income year. 

##### <a id="6-10"></a>6-10  How the amounts collected are dealt with

                   You are entitled to credits for the amounts of your income that are collected under the PAYG system. The credits are applied under Division 3 of Part IIB against your tax debts, and any excess is refunded to you.

<o:p> </o:p>

## Part 2-5—Pay as you go (PAYG) withholding

### Division 10—Guide to Part 2-5

##### <a id="10-1"></a>10-1  What this Part is about

<div style="BORDER-RIGHT: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-RIGHT: 5pt; BORDER-TOP: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-LEFT: 5pt; PADDING-BOTTOM: 5pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 2cm; BORDER-LEFT: windowtext 1pt solid; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0cm; PADDING-TOP: 5pt; BORDER-BOTTOM: windowtext 1pt solid; mso-border-alt: solid windowtext .75pt">

Under PAYG withholding, amounts are collected in respect of particular kinds of payments or transactions. Usually, someone who makes a payment to you is required to _withhold_ an amount from the payment, and then to pay the amount to the Commissioner.

If a non-cash benefit is provided instead of a payment, the provider must first pay to the Commissioner the amount that would have been withheld from the payment.

This Part also contains provisions about the obligations and rights of payers and recipients.</div>

##### <a id="10-5"></a>10-5  Summary of withholding payments

                   The payments and other transactions covered by PAYG withholding are called withholding payments. They are summarised in the table.

Note:          The obligation to pay an amount to the Commissioner is imposed on the entity making the withholding payment (except for items 17, 19 and 22).

##### <a id="12-140"></a>12-140  Recipient does not quote tax file number

             (1)  An <sup>* </sup>investment body must withhold an amount from a payment it makes to another entity in respect of a <sup>* </sup><st1:place style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x"><st1:city style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x">Part</st1:city> <st1:state>VA</st1:state></st1:place> investment if:

                     (b)  if the investment is non-transferable—the other entity did not <sup>* </sup>quote its <sup>* </sup>tax file number in connection with the investment before the time when the payment became payable; and

                     (c)  if the investment is transferable—the other entity did not quote its tax file number in connection with the investment before the time when the other entity had to be registered with the investment body as the <sup>* </sup>investor to be entitled to the payment.

Payment in respect of units in a trust or investment-related betting chance

             (2)  If a <sup>* </sup><st1:place style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x"><st1:city style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x">Part</st1:city> <st1:state>VA</st1:state></st1:place> investment consists of:

                     (b)  an investment-related betting chance;

an entity (including the <sup>* </sup>investment body) must withhold an amount from a payment it makes to another entity in respect of the investment if the conditions in subsection (1) of this section are met.

For exceptions to the rules in this section, see sections 12-155 to 12-170.

##### <a id="12-145"></a>12-145  Investor becoming presently entitled to income of a unit trust

                     (b)  the <sup>* </sup>investor becomes presently entitled, for the purposes of Division 6 of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, to a share of income of the trust at a time (the **_entitlement time_**) before any of that share is paid to the investor.

             (2)  The entity (including the <sup>* </sup>investment body) that would have to pay that share to the <sup>* </sup>investor if the share were due and payable at the entitlement time must withhold from the share, at that time, the amount (if any) that subsection 12-140(2) would have required it to withhold if it had paid the share to the investor at that time.

For exceptions to the rules in this section, see sections 12-155 to 12-170.

             (3)  This Part (except section 12-140 and this section) applies as if that entity had paid that share to the <sup>* </sup>investor at the entitlement time.

             (4)  If that entity withholds an amount from that share as required by subsection (2), subsection 12-140(2) does not require an amount to be withheld from a payment of all or part of that share to the <sup>* </sup>investor.

                     (a)  so much of the payment as consists of a periodic interest payment (within the meaning of Division 16E of Part III of that Act); 

                     (b)  if the payment became payable at the end of the term (within the meaning of Division 16E of Part III of that Act) of the investment—so much of the payment as does _not_ exceed what section 159GQ of that Act would include in the <sup>* </sup>investor’s assessable income for the income year in which that term ended if the adoption (under section 18 of that Act) of an accounting period ending on a day other than 30 June were disregarded for the purposes of this paragraph and that Division.

 Note:         To the extent that section 12-140 does not apply to the payment, TFN withholding tax may be payable on it. See Subdivision C of Division 3B of Part VI of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

##### <a id="12-155"></a>12-155  When investor may quote ABN as alternative

                   Section 12-140 or 12-145 does not require an amount to be withheld if:

                     (a)  a provision of Division 5 of Part VA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ has applied to the other entity in relation to the investment, but no longer applies when the payment is made; and

                     (b)  when the payment is made, the <sup>* </sup>investment body has not been informed of anything that resulted in the provision no longer applying.

Note:          Division 5 of <st1:place style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x"><st1:city style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x">Part</st1:city> <st1:state>VA</st1:state></st1:place> of that Act provides, in certain cases, that even though an entity has not quoted its tax file number it is taken to have done so.

##### <a id="12-165"></a>12-165  Exception for fully franked dividend

                   Section 12-140 does not require an amount to be withheld if:

             (2)  Regulations made for the purposes of this section may deal differently with different payments.

#### Payment for a supply

##### <a id="12-190"></a>12-190  Recipient does not quote ABN

             (1)  An entity (the **_payer_**) must withhold an amount from a payment it makes to another entity if:

                     (a)  the payment is for a <sup>* </sup>supply that the other entity has made, or proposes to make, to the payer in the course or furtherance of an <sup>* </sup>enterprise <sup>* </sup>carried on in <st1:country-region style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x"><st1:place style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x">Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region> by the other entity; and

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not require the entity:

                     (a)  the Commissioner has notified the entity under section 12-330 that the entity does not need to withhold an amount from the payment; or

                     (b)  a certificate in force under section 12-335 covers the payment and does not require the entity to withhold an amount from it.

##### <a id="12-330"></a>12-330  Payer must ask Commissioner how much to withhold

             (1)  An entity must not, intentionally or recklessly, make a payment from which section 12-325 requires it to withhold an amount, unless:

                     (b)  the Commissioner has later notified the entity in writing of the amount (if any) that the entity must withhold from the payment in respect of tax that is or may become payable by a foreign resident to whom the payment is made;

or the payment is covered by a certificate in force under section 12-335.

                    Penalty:  20 penalty units.

                     (b)  such other conditions as the certificate specifies.

However, the entity does not contravene subsection 12-330(1) because it contravenes a condition.

             (3)  The Commissioner may, by written notice given to the entity:

                     (a)  revoke a certificate, whether or not a condition of it has been contravened; or

                     (b)  vary a certificate by revoking, changing or adding to its conditions.

Note:          A person who is dissatisfied with a decision under this section may object against the decision in the manner set out in Part IVC.

##### <a id="14-1"></a>14-1  Object of this Division

                   The object of this Division is:

                     (a)  to put entities that provide <sup>* </sup>non-cash benefits, and entities that receive them, in a position similar to their position under Division 12 if payments of money had been made instead of the non-cash benefits being provided; and

                     (b)  in that way, to prevent entities from avoiding their obligations under Division 12 by providing non-cash benefits.

##### <a id="14-5"></a>14-5  Provider of non-cash benefit must pay amount to the Commissioner if payment would be subject to withholding

             (1)  An entity (the **_payer_**) must pay an amount to the Commissioner before providing a <sup>* </sup>non-cash benefit to another entity (the **_recipient_**) if Division 12 would require the payer to withhold an amount (the **_notionally withheld amount_**) if, instead of providing the benefit to the recipient, the payer made a payment to the recipient in money equal to the <sup>* </sup>market value of the benefit when the benefit is provided.

             (2)  The amount to be paid to the Commissioner is equal to the notionally withheld amount.

Example:    Nick is a building contractor who has entered into a voluntary agreement with Mike for the purposes of section 12-55\. Nick proposes to give Mike his old utility van (whose market value is $1,000) as payment for work Mike has done for him over a fortnight.

                   If Nick were instead to pay Mike $1,000, Nick would have had to withhold $203 under Division 12 (in accordance with withholding rates current at the time).

                   This section requires Nick to pay $203 to the Commissioner before giving the van to Mike.

             (3)  This section does not apply to providing:

                     (a)  a <sup>* </sup>fringe benefit; or

                     (b)  a benefit that is an exempt benefit under the _Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986_; or

                     (c)  a benefit that would be an exempt benefit under that Act if paragraphs (d) and (e) of the definition of **_employer_** in subsection 136(1) of that Act were omitted; or

                     (d)  a benefit constituted by the acquisition of a share or right under an employee share scheme (within the meaning of Division 13A of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_).

##### <a id="14-10"></a>14-10  Dividend, interest or royalty received, for a foreign resident, in the form of a non-cash benefit

                   If:

                     (a)  an entity (the **_payer_**) receives in the form of a <sup>* </sup>non-cash benefit:

                              (i)  a <sup>* </sup>dividend of a company; or

                             (ii)  interest (within the meaning of Division 11A of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_); or

                            (iii)  a <sup>* </sup>royalty; and

                     (b)  section 12-215, 12-250 or 12-285 would have required the payer to withhold an amount if the dividend, interest or royalty had been a payment in money;

the payer must pay that amount to the Commissioner before providing the benefit (or part of it) to another entity.

##### <a id="14-15"></a>14-15  Payer can recover amount paid to the Commissioner

             (1)  The payer may recover from the recipient as a debt an amount that the payer has paid to the Commissioner under section 14-5.

             (2)  If the payer has paid an amount to the Commissioner under section 14-10, the payer may:

                     (a)  if the payer has provided all of the benefit to another entity— recover the amount from that other entity as a debt; or

                     (b)  if the payer has provided a part of the benefit to another entity—recover from that other entity as a debt the corresponding proportion of the amount paid to the Commissioner.

             (3)  If the payer can recover an amount from another entity under this section, the payer is entitled to set the amount off against debts due by the payer to the other entity.

#### When and how much to withhold

##### <a id="16-5"></a>16-5  When to withhold an amount

                   If Division 12 requires an entity to withhold an amount from a payment, the entity must do so when making the payment.

Note 1:       An entity is required to withhold an amount under section 12-145 when an investor becomes presently entitled to income of a unit trust.

Note 2:       If section 12-215, 12-250 or 12-285 requires an entity to withhold an amount from a payment received by the entity, the entity must do so immediately after receiving the payment.

##### <a id="16-10"></a>16-10  How much to withhold

             (1)  The amount that Division 12 requires to be withheld from a payment (except one covered by section 12-325) is to be worked out under the regulations.

             (2)  Regulations made for the purposes of this section may deal differently with different payments.

Note:          The Commissioner may vary an amount required to be withheld. See section 16-15.

##### <a id="16-15"></a>16-15  Variation of amounts required to be withheld

             (1)  The Commissioner may, for the purposes of meeting the special circumstances of a particular case or class of cases, vary the <sup>* </sup>amount required to be withheld by an entity from a <sup>* </sup>withholding payment (except a withholding payment covered by section 12-140 or 12-145). If the Commissioner does so, the amount is varied accordingly.

Note:          Section 12-140 is about a payment arising from an investment where the recipient does not quote its tax file number (or, in some cases, its ABN). Section 12-145 is about an investor becoming presently entitled to income of a unit trust.

             (2)  The Commissioner’s power to vary an amount includes the power to reduce the amount to nil.

             (3)  A variation must be made by a written notice:

                     (a)  if it applies to a particular entity— that is given to that entity; or

                     (b)  if it applies to a class of entities—that is given to each of the entities, or a copy of which is published in the _Gazette_.

##### <a id="16-20"></a>16-20  Payer discharged from liability to recipient for amount withheld 

                   An entity that:

                     (a)  withholds an amount as required by Division 12; or

                     (b)  pays to the Commissioner an amount as required by Division 14;

is discharged from all liability to pay or account for that amount to any entity except the Commissioner.

Note:          The entity may be required to refund the amount in some circumstances. See Subdivision 18-B.

#### Penalties for not withholding

##### <a id="16-25"></a>16-25  Failure to withhold: offence

             (1)  An entity must not fail to withhold an amount as required by Division 12.

                    Penalty:  10 penalty units.

Note 1:       See section 4AA of the _Crimes Act 1914_ for the current value of a penalty unit.

Note 2:       See sections 16-30, 16-35 and 16-40 for an alternative civil penalty.

             (2)  An entity must not fail to pay to the Commissioner an amount as required by Division 14.

                    Penalty:  10 penalty units.

Note 1:       See section 4AA of the _Crimes Act 1914_ for the current value of a penalty unit.

Note 2:       See sections 16-30, 16-35 and 16-40 for an alternative civil penalty.

             (3)  An offence against subsection (1) or (2) is a strict liability offence.

             (4)  If a person is convicted of an offence in relation to:

                     (a)  a failure by that person or someone else to withhold an amount as required by Division 12; or

                     (b)  a failure by that person or someone else to pay to the Commissioner an amount as required by Division 14;

the court may order the convicted person to pay to the Commissioner an amount up to the <sup>* </sup>amount required to be withheld. The court may so order in addition to imposing a penalty on the convicted person.

##### <a id="16-30"></a>16-30  Failure to withhold: civil penalty for entity other than exempt Australian government agency

             (1)  An entity (except an <sup>* </sup>exempt Australian government agency) that:

                     (a)  fails to withhold an amount as required by Division 12; or

                     (b)  fails to pay an amount to the Commissioner as required by Division 14;

is liable to pay to the Commissioner a penalty (the **_penalty amount_**) equal to that amount.

             (2)  The penalty amount is due at the time when the entity would have had to pay to the Commissioner the amount referred to in subsection (1).

Note:          An entity may become liable under this section in respect of a payment it made or received that is taken to have been subject to withholding tax as a result of a Commissioner’s determination under subsection 177F(2A) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (see also subsection 177F(2F) of that Act).

##### <a id="16-35"></a>16-35  Failure to withhold: civil penalty for exempt Australian government agency in relation to payment other than dividend, interest or royalty

             (1)  An <sup>* </sup>exempt Australian government agency that:

                     (a)  fails to withhold an amount as required by Division 12; or

                     (b)  fails to pay to the Commissioner an amount as required by Division 14;

is liable to pay to the Commissioner a penalty of 20 penalty units.

Note:          See section 4AA of the _Crimes Act 1914_ for the current value of a penalty unit.

             (2)  The Commissioner must give written notice to the agency about its liability under this section. The notice may be included in any other notice the Commissioner gives to the agency.

             (3)  The penalty becomes due for payment on the day specified in the notice, which must be at least 14 days after the notice is given to the agency.

Exception

             (4)  This section does not apply in relation to an <sup>* </sup>amount required to be withheld from a <sup>* </sup>withholding payment covered by Subdivision 12-F (about dividend, interest or royalty payment).

##### <a id="16-40"></a>16-40  Failure to withhold: civil penalty for exempt Australian government agency in relation to dividend, interest or royalty payment

             (1)  An <sup>* </sup>exempt Australian government agency that:

                     (a)  fails to withhold an amount as required by Division 12 from a <sup>* </sup>withholding payment covered by Subdivision 12-F (about dividend, interest or royalty payment); or

                     (b)  fails to pay to the Commissioner an amount as required by Division 14 in respect of a withholding payment covered by that Subdivision;

is liable to pay to the Commissioner a penalty (the **_penalty amount_**) equal to that amount.

             (2)  The penalty amount is due at the time when the entity would have had to pay to the Commissioner the <sup>* </sup>amount required to be withheld.

Note:          An entity may become liable under this section in respect of a payment it made or received that is taken to have been subject to withholding tax as a result of a Commissioner’s determination under subsection 177F(2A) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (see also subsection 177F(2F) of that Act).

##### <a id="16-45"></a>16-45  Remission of penalty under section 16-30, 16-35 or 16-40

             (1)  The Commissioner may remit all or a part of a penalty under section 16-30, 16-35 or 16-40.

Note:          A person who is dissatisfied with a decision under this section may object against the decision in the manner set out in Part IVC.

##### <a id="16-50"></a>16-50  General interest charge on unpaid penalty

                   If a penalty under section 16-30, 16-35 or 16-40 remains unpaid after it is due, the entity liable to pay the penalty amount is liable to pay <sup>* </sup>general interest charge on the unpaid amount for each day in the period that:

                     (a)  started at the beginning of the day by which the penalty amount was due to be paid; and

                     (b)  finishes at the end of the last day, at the end of which, any of the following remains unpaid:

                     (b)  the total of the deductions that the entity made under Division 2 of Part VI of that Act for the financial year ending on 30 June 2000 exceeded $1 million; or

                     (c)  the total of the entity’s <sup>* </sup>labour hire notional withheld amounts (see subsections <st1:time minute="58" hour="3">(2) to (4)</st1:time>) exceed $1 million; or

                     (d)  at the end of 30 June 2000 the entity was included in a company group as defined in section 220AAI of that Act, and:

                     (e)  the Commissioner determines under section 16-115 that the entity is a large withholder for the current month.

Meaning of labour hire notional withheld amount

             (2)  If during the <sup>* </sup>financial year ending on 30 June 2000 an entity made a payment from which section 12-60 (about payments under labour hire arrangements) would have required it to withhold an amount (if that section had applied to payments made during that financial year), that amount is a **_labour hire notional withheld amount_** of the entity.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  during the <sup>* </sup>financial year ending on <st1:date style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x" year="2000" day="30" month="6">30 June 2000</st1:date> an entity provided a <sup>* </sup>non-cash benefit to an individual; and

                     (b)  section 12-60 (about payments under labour hire arrangements) would have required the entity to withhold an amount if:

                             (ii)  that section had applied to payments made during that financial year;

that amount is a **_labour hire notional withheld amount_** of the entity.

             (4)  For the purposes of subsections (2) and (3), disregard paragraph 12-60(b) (which allows the scope of section 12-60 to be extended by regulations).

Exception

##### <a id="16-135"></a>16-135  Meaning of _medium withholder_

             (1)  An entity is a **_medium withholder_** for a particular month (the **_current month_**) in the <sup>* </sup>financial year starting on <st1:date style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x" year="2000" day="1" month="7">1 July 2000</st1:date> if the entity is not a <sup>* </sup>large withholder for that month and:

                     (a)  the entity:

                              (i)  was a medium remitter in relation to June 2000 because of section 220AAJ of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; and

                             (ii)  would still have been a medium remitter in relation to June 2000 because of that section if the only deductions taken into account under that section were deductions made under Division 2 of Part VI of that Act; or

the payment to the Commissioner is reduced by so much of the amount as the payer so recorded as being offset.

             (7)  The payer must not record that it offsets any part of an amount that:

                     (a)  the payer has previously recorded under subsection (6); or

                              (i)  withheld an amount purportedly under Division 12 from a payment made to, or received for, the recipient; or

                             (ii)  paid to the Commissioner an amount purportedly under Division 14 for a <sup>* </sup>non-cash benefit provided to, or received for, the recipient; and 

                     (b)  the amount was so withheld, or paid to the Commissioner, in error; and

                     (c)  section 18-65 does not apply because the payer did not become aware of the error, or the recipient did not apply for a refund, as mentioned in subsection 18-65(1); and

                     (d)  if subparagraph (a)(i) applies—the payer has already paid the withheld amount to the Commissioner.

             (2)  The Commissioner must refund the amount if the application sets out:

                     (a)  if the recipient has a <sup>* </sup>tax file number—that tax file number; or

                     (b)  if the recipient does not have a tax file number but was taken to have quoted a tax file number to the payer before the amount was withheld or paid to the Commissioner—the basis on which the recipient was taken to have quoted the tax file number; or

                     (c)  if the payment or <sup>* </sup>non-cash benefit was in respect of a <sup>* </sup><st1:place style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x"><st1:city style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x">Part</st1:city> <st1:state>VA</st1:state></st1:place> investment made by the recipient in the course or furtherance of an <sup>* </sup>enterprise carried on by it—the recipient’s <sup>* </sup>ABN;

and the Commissioner is satisfied that it would be fair and reasonable to refund the amount, having regard to:

                     (d)  the circumstances that gave rise to the withholding obligation (if any); and

                     (e)  the nature of the error; and

                              (i)  is taken to have been rolled-over for the purposes of Subdivision AA of Division 2 of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; or

                             (ii)  will be taken to have been rolled-over because of an amount or amounts being paid to a person or persons (the **_payee_** or **_payees_**) as mentioned in subsection 27A(12) of that Act; and

                     (b)  if the applied amount is a part of the eligible termination payment—the withheld amount exceeds the amount that would have been the <sup>* </sup>amount required to be withheld if the eligible termination payment had not included the applied amount.

             (3)  The amount refundable is:

                     (a)  if the applied amount is the whole of the <sup>* </sup>eligible termination payment—the <sup>* </sup>amount withheld from the <sup>* </sup>withholding payment; or

                     (b)  if the applied amount is a part of the eligible termination payment—the excess referred to in paragraph (2)(b).

             (4)  The Commissioner must refund that amount:

                     (a)  by paying the refundable amount to the recipient of the <sup>* </sup>eligible termination payment; or

<div style="BORDER-RIGHT: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-RIGHT: 5pt; BORDER-TOP: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-LEFT: 5pt; PADDING-BOTTOM: 5pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 2cm; BORDER-LEFT: windowtext 1pt solid; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0cm; PADDING-TOP: 5pt; BORDER-BOTTOM: windowtext 1pt solid; mso-border-alt: solid windowtext .75pt">

If you have business or investment income, you must pay instalments towards your income tax liability: usually within 21 days after the end of each quarter. If you are not registered for GST purposes, you may be able to choose to pay an annual instalment on 21 October after the end of the income year.

You do not have to pay instalments unless the Commissioner has given you an instalment rate.

The amount of a quarterly instalment is worked out by multiplying your instalment income for the quarter by the rate the Commissioner gave you, or by a rate you choose yourself. If you are an individual who is not registered for GST purposes, you may be able to choose to have the amount of your instalment worked out on the basis of your previous year’s income tax liability and notified to you by the Commissioner.

The amount of an annual instalment can be your instalment income for the income year multiplied by the rate the Commissioner gave you; or an amount based on your previous year’s income tax liability and notified to you by the Commissioner; or your own estimate of your income tax liability for the income year.</div>

##### <a id="45-5"></a>45-5  Object of this Part

                   The object of this Part is to ensure the efficient collection of:

                     (a)  income tax; and

                     (b)  Medicare levy; and

                     (c)  amounts of liabilities to the Commonwealth under Chapter 5A of the _Higher Education Funding Act 1988_.

##### <a id="45-10"></a>45-10  Application of Part

                   This Part applies to individuals, companies, and the entities listed in items 3 and 4, and 6 to 12, of the table in section 9-1 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (which lists the entities that must pay income tax).

Note:          This Part applies to a trustee covered by item 5 in that table only to the extent set out in section 45-300.

##### <a id="45-15"></a>45-15  Liability for instalments

             (1)  The Commissioner may give you an instalment rate from time to time, by giving you written notice of the rate.

             (2)  You are liable to pay instalments under this Division if the Commissioner has given you an instalment rate.

Note 1:       The instalment rate that the Commissioner gives you is worked out under section 45-320.

Note 2:       If your assessable income has always consisted wholly of withholding payments (other than non-quotation withholding payments), the Commissioner will not give you an instalment rate. 

Note 3:       Work out the amount of your instalments under Subdivision 45-C.

Note 4:       If the Commissioner withdraws the rate under section 45-90, you are not liable to pay further instalments.

##### <a id="45-20"></a>45-20  Information to be given to the Commissioner

             (1)  If you are liable to pay an instalment for a period (even if it is a nil amount), you must notify the Commissioner of the amount of your <sup>* </sup>instalment income for the period.

             (2)  You must notify the Commissioner in the <sup>* </sup>approved form and on or before the day when the instalment is due (regardless of whether it is paid). 

Exceptions

             (3)  Subsection (1) does not apply to:

                     (a)  a quarterly instalment worked out under section 45-112 (on the basis of GDP-adjusted notional tax); or

                     (b)  an annual instalment, unless it is worked out under paragraph 45-115(1)(a) (based on the Commissioner’s rate and your instalment income for the income year).

##### <a id="45-25"></a>45-25  Penalty for failure to notify Commissioner 

                   If you fail to notify the Commissioner of an amount as required by section 45-20, or you notify an amount that is less than the correct amount, you are liable to pay the <sup>* </sup>failure to notify penalty on the amount, or on the shortfall, multiplied by the instalment rate that you are required to use to work out the instalment for the period, for each day in the period that:

                     (a)  started at the beginning of the day by which the amount was due to be paid; and

                     (b)  finishes at the end of the day before you notify the Commissioner of the correct amount, or he or she otherwise becomes aware of it.

##### <a id="45-30"></a>45-30  Credit for instalments payable

             (1)  You are entitled to a credit when the Commissioner:

                     (a)  makes an assessment of the income tax you are liable to pay for an income year; or 

                     (b)  determines that you do not have a taxable income for an income year, or that no income tax is payable on it.

             (2)  The credit is equal to:

                        •  the total of each instalment payable by you for the income year (even if you have not yet paid it);

reduced by:

                        •  the total of each credit that you have claimed under section 45-215 in respect of such an instalment.

Note:          You can claim a credit under section 45-215 in certain cases where you choose a rate for working out an instalment.

             (3)  The making of the assessment or determination, and the resulting credit entitlement, do not affect the liability to pay an instalment.

Note:          How the credit is applied is set out in Division 3 of Part IIB.

             (1)  Your first instalment is payable: 

                     (a)  for the <sup>* </sup>instalment quarter in which the Commissioner first gives you an instalment rate (even if it is not the first instalment quarter in an income year); or

                     (b)  if at the end of that quarter you become an <sup>* </sup>annual payer under Subdivision 45-E—for the income year in which the Commissioner first gives you an instalment rate;

unless the Commissioner withdraws your instalment rate under section 45-90 during that quarter or income year.

             (2)  However, if paragraph (1)(b) applies but during a later <sup>* </sup>instalment quarter in that income year you stop being an <sup>* </sup>annual payer under section 45-150, your first instalment is payable for that later instalment quarter, unless the Commissioner withdraws your instalment rate under section 45-90 during it.

##### <a id="45-55"></a>45-55  Subsequent quarterly instalments

                   If you are liable to pay an instalment for an <sup>* </sup>instalment quarter, you are liable to pay an instalment for the next one unless:

                     (a)  at the end of that next instalment quarter you become an <sup>* </sup>annual payer under Subdivision 45-E; or

                     (b)  during that next quarter the Commissioner withdraws your instalment rate under section 45-90.

##### <a id="45-60"></a>45-60  When quarterly instalments are due

##### <a id="45-72"></a>45-72  Electronic payment

                   You must pay an instalment by <sup>* </sup>electronic payment if you are required to pay by electronic payment the amount of any other liability to the Commissioner that is due on the same day as the instalment.

##### <a id="45-75"></a>45-75  Instalments recoverable in same way as income tax

                   Instalments are to be treated as income tax for the purposes of sections 208, 209, 214, 254, 255, 258 and 259 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

##### <a id="45-80"></a>45-80  General interest charge on late payment

                   If you fail to pay some or all of an instalment by the time by which the instalment is due to be paid, you are liable to pay the <sup>* </sup>general interest charge on the unpaid amount for each day in the period that:

                     (a)  started at the beginning of the day by which the instalment was due to be paid; and

                     (b)  finishes at the end of the last day on which, at the end of the day, any of the following remains unpaid:

                     (a)  by giving you written notice, withdraw your instalment rate; or

                     (b)  by notice published in the _Gazette_, withdraw the instalment rate of a class of entities that includes you.

Note:          If the Commissioner does so, you are not liable to pay further instalments (even if you have chosen a rate under section 45-205). See paragraphs 45-55(b) and 45-65(b).

##### <a id="45-110"></a>45-110  How to work out amount of quarterly instalment

             (1)  Work out the amount of an instalment you are liable to pay for an <sup>* </sup>instalment quarter as follows:

<sub><v:shape id="_x0000_i1032" style="WIDTH: 297.75pt; HEIGHT: 21pt" o:ole="" type="#_x0000_t75" coordsize="21600,21600"><v:imagedata o:title="" src="80D5AAED22C3EA5FCA256FE3000620B2/$FILE/image014.wmz"></v:imagedata></v:shape></sub>

             (2)  For the purposes of the formula in subsection (1):

                    <a name="applic-instal-rate"></a>**_Applicable instalment rate_** means:

                     (a)  unless paragraph (b) or (c) applies—the most recent instalment rate given to you by the Commissioner under section 45-15 before the end of that quarter; or

                     (b)  if you have chosen an instalment rate for that quarter under section 45-205—that rate; or

                     (c)  if you have chosen an instalment rate under section 45-205 for an earlier <sup>* </sup>instalment quarter in that income year (and paragraph (b) does not apply)—that rate.

Note:          If you believe the Commissioner’s rate is not appropriate for the current income year, you may choose a different instalment rate under Subdivision 45-F.

##### <a id="45-112"></a>45-112  Amount of instalment for quarterly payer who pays on basis of GDP-adjusted notional tax

             (1)  If at the end of an <sup>* </sup>instalment quarter in an income year you are a <sup>* </sup>quarterly payer who pays on the basis of GDP-adjusted notional tax, the amount of your instalment for that quarter is the amount notified to you by the Commissioner before the end of that quarter.

Note:          The Commissioner works out that amount under Subdivision 45-L.

             (2)  If the Commissioner notifies you of the amount of the instalment _after_ the end of that quarter, the instalment is due on or before the 21st day after the day on which the notice is given.

##### <a id="45-115"></a>45-115  How to work out amount of annual instalment

             (1)  The amount of an instalment you are liable to pay for the 2002-03 income year or a later income year is whichever of the following you choose:

                     (a)  the amount worked out using the formula:

<sub><v:shape id="_x0000_i1033" style="WIDTH: 260.25pt; HEIGHT: 30.75pt" o:ole="" type="#_x0000_t75" coordsize="21600,21600"><v:imagedata o:title="" src="80D5AAED22C3EA5FCA256FE3000620B2/$FILE/image016.wmz"></v:imagedata></v:shape></sub>

                     (b)  your most recent <sup>* </sup>notional tax notified by the Commissioner before the end of the income year under subsection 45-320(5);

                     (c)  the amount that you estimate will be your <sup>* </sup>benchmark tax for the income year.

Note 1:       You cannot choose a different instalment rate under Subdivision 45-F if you are an annual payer. Instead you can work out the amount of your instalment under paragraph (c).

Note 2:       You may be liable to general interest charge under section 45-235 if working out your instalment under paragraph (c) leads you to pay an instalment that is less than 85% of your benchmark tax for the income year (worked out by the Commissioner under section 45-365).

For the amount of an instalment you are liable to pay
for 2000-01 or 2001-02, see section 45-175.

             (2)  **_Commissioner’s instalment rate_** for an income year means the most recent instalment rate given to you by the Commissioner before the end of the income year.

             (3)  If you choose to work out your instalment under paragraph (1)(c), you must notify the Commissioner, in the <sup>* </sup>approved form, of the amount of the instalment on or before the day when it is due.

##### <a id="45-120"></a>45-120  Meaning of _instalment income_

General rule

             (1)  Your **_instalment income_** for a period includes your <sup>* </sup>ordinary income <sup>* </sup>derived during that period, but only to the extent that it is assessable income of the income year that is or includes that period.

Note 1:       An amount of statutory income is not instalment income unless it is covered by another provision of this section or by Subdivision 45-H or 45-I.

Note 2:       If during that period you are a partner in a partnership, or a beneficiary of a trust, your instalment income also includes some of the partnership’s or trust’s instalment income for the period. See Subdivision 45-H or 45-I.

Statutory income included for some entities

             (2)  The **_instalment income_** of:

                     (a)  an eligible ADF (as defined in section 267 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_); or 

                     (b)  an eligible superannuation fund (as defined in that section); or 

                     (c)  a pooled superannuation trust (as defined in that section);

for a period also includes the entity’s <sup>* </sup>statutory income, to the extent that:

                     (d)  it is reasonably attributable to that period; and

                     (e)  it is assessable income of the income year that is or includes that period.

Exclusion: amounts in respect of withholding payments

             (3)  Your **_instalment income_** for a period does _not_ include amounts in respect of <sup>* </sup>withholding payments (except <sup>* </sup>non-quotation withholding payments) made to you during that period.

Farm management deposits: effect of making and repayment

             (4)  Your **_instalment income_** for a period is reduced (but not below nil) by a <sup>* </sup>farm management deposit made during that period, but only to the extent that, at the end of that period, you can reasonably expect to be able to deduct the deposit under section 393-10 in Schedule 2G to the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ for the income year that is or includes that period.

             (5)  Your **_instalment income_** for a period also includes an amount that section 393-15 in Schedule 2G to the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ includes in your assessable income, for the income year that is or includes that period, because of a repayment during that period of all or some of a <sup>* </sup>farm management deposit.

Instalment income of entity that is not liable for instalments

             (6)  An entity can have <sup>* </sup>instalment income for a period even if the entity is not liable to pay an instalment for that period.

                     (b)  the amount that you estimate will be your <sup>* </sup>benchmark tax for the income year.

Note:          You may be liable to general interest charge under section 45-235 if working out your instalment under paragraph (b) leads you to pay an instalment that is less than 85% of your benchmark tax for the income year (worked out by the Commissioner under section 45-365).

             (2)  If an entity is an instalment taxpayer (as defined by subsection 221AZK(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) for the 2000-01 or 2001-02 income year, the amount of an annual instalment that the entity is liable to pay for that income year is worked out under section 45-115, as if that section applied to that income year.

##### <a id="45-180"></a>45-180  Entity that becomes GST registered, participant in GST joint venture, or company group member stops being annual payer

                   This Subdivision applies if you are a <sup>* </sup>quarterly payer.

##### <a id="45-205"></a>45-205  Choosing a varied instalment rate

             (1)  You may choose an instalment rate for working out under section 45-110 the amount of your instalment for an <sup>* </sup>instalment quarter in an income year.

             (2)  If you do so, you must use that instalment rate to work out the amount of that instalment. (You cannot later choose another instalment rate for working out that amount.)

Note 1:       If choosing a rate leads you to pay an instalment that is too low, you may be liable to general interest charge under section 45-230\. 

Note 2:       If you choose a rate under this section, you must use it even if the Commissioner later gives you a new instalment rate.

             (3)  You must also use that instalment rate to work out the amount of the instalment that you are liable to pay for each later <sup>* </sup>instalment quarter in that income year, unless you choose another instalment rate under subsection (1) for working out that amount.

Note 1:       If you choose a rate under this section, you must use it even if the Commissioner later gives you a new instalment rate.

Note 2:       If a rate you have chosen for an instalment quarter is not appropriate for a later instalment quarter in the same income year, you should choose another rate under subsection (1) for the later quarter. If the earlier rate is too low, you may be liable to general interest charge under section 45-230.

             (4)  However, for working out under section 45-110 the amount of your instalment for an <sup>* </sup>instalment quarter in a later income year, you must use the most recent instalment rate given to you by the Commissioner before the end of that quarter, unless you again choose another instalment rate under subsection (1).

##### <a id="45-210"></a>45-210  Notifying Commissioner of varied instalment rate

                   If you work out the amount of an instalment using an instalment rate you have chosen under section 45-205, you must specify that rate in the notice about your instalment income that you must give the Commissioner under section 45-20.

##### <a id="45-215"></a>45-215  Credit on using varied rate in certain cases 

             (1)  You are entitled to claim a credit if: 

                     (a)  the amount of your instalment for an <sup>* </sup>instalment quarter (the **_current quarter_**) in an income year is to be worked out using an instalment rate you chose under section 45-205; and

                     (b)  either:

                              (i)  that rate is lower than the instalment rate you used to work out the amount of your instalment for the previous instalment quarter (if any) in the same income year; or

                             (ii)  the amount of your instalment for a previous instalment quarter in the same income year was the amount notified to you by the Commissioner under section 45-112 (because you were a quarterly payer on the basis of GDP-adjusted notional tax); and

                     (c)  the amount worked out using the method statement is greater than nil.

<div style="BORDER-RIGHT: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-RIGHT: 5pt; BORDER-TOP: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-LEFT: 5pt; PADDING-BOTTOM: 5pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 2cm; BORDER-LEFT: windowtext 1pt solid; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0cm; PADDING-TOP: 5pt; BORDER-BOTTOM: windowtext 1pt solid; mso-border-alt: solid windowtext .75pt">

_Method statement_

_Step 1_.   Add up the instalments you are liable to pay for the earlier <sup>* </sup>instalment quarters in the income year (even if you have not yet paid all of them).

_Step 2._   Subtract from the step 1 amount each earlier credit that you have claimed under this section in respect of the income year.

_Step 3._   Multiply the total of your <sup>* </sup>instalment income for those earlier <sup>* </sup>instalment quarters by the instalment rate to be used for the current quarter.

_Step 4_.   Subtract the step 3 amount from the step 2 amount.

_Step 5_.   If the result is a positive amount, it is the amount of the credit you can claim.</div>

             (2)  A claim for a credit must be made in the <sup>* </sup>approved form on or before the day on which the instalment for the current quarter is due.

Note:          How the credit is applied is set out in Division 3 of Part IIB.

             (3)  The credit entitlement does not affect your liability to pay an instalment.

##### <a id="45-320"></a>45-320  Working out instalment rate

             (1)  An instalment rate that the Commissioner gives you must be the percentage worked out to 2 decimal places (rounding up if the third decimal place is 5 or more) using the formula:

<sub><v:shape id="_x0000_i1038" style="WIDTH: 176.25pt; HEIGHT: 38.25pt" o:ole="" type="#_x0000_t75" coordsize="21600,21600"><v:imagedata o:title="" src="80D5AAED22C3EA5FCA256FE3000620B2/$FILE/image026.wmz"></v:imagedata></v:shape></sub>

However, the instalment rate must be a nil rate if either component of the formula is nil.

             (2)  For the purposes of the formula in subsection (1):

                    <a name="base-assess-instal-incom"></a>**_base assessment instalment income_** means so much of your assessable income, as worked out for the purposes of the <sup>* </sup>base assessment, as the Commissioner determines is <sup>* </sup>instalment income for the <sup>* </sup>base year.

             (3)  The **_base assessment_** is the latest assessment for your most recent income year for which an assessment has been made. However, if the Commissioner is satisfied that there is a later income year for which you do not have a taxable income, the **_base assessment_** is the latest return or other information from which an assessment for that income year would have been made.

             (4)  The **_base year_** is the income year to which the <sup>* </sup>base assessment relates.

             (5)  When the Commissioner gives you the instalment rate, he or she must also notify you of the amount of your <sup>* </sup>notional tax, as worked out for the purposes of working out the instalment rate.

             (6)  The Commissioner may incorporate notice of the instalment rate and the amount of your <sup>* </sup>notional tax in notice of your assessment.

##### <a id="45-325"></a>45-325  Working out your _notional tax_

Notional tax if you have no withholding income

             (1)  Your **_notional tax_** is your <sup>* </sup>adjusted tax (worked out under section 45-340) on your <sup>* </sup>adjusted taxable income (worked out under section 45-330) for the <sup>* </sup>base year.

Notional tax if you have withholding income

             (2)  However, your **_notional tax_** (as worked out under subsection (1)) is reduced if your assessable income for the <sup>* </sup>base assessment includes amounts in respect of <sup>* </sup>withholding payments (except <sup>* </sup>non-quotation withholding payments).

             (3)  It is reduced (but not below nil) by your <sup>* </sup>adjusted tax (worked out under section 45-340) on your <sup>* </sup>adjusted withholding income (worked out under section 45-335) for the <sup>* </sup>base year.

Commissioner may take into account effect of the law, as applying to income years after base year

             (4)  For the purposes of working out your <sup>* </sup>notional tax, the Commissioner may work out an amount as if provisions of an Act or regulations, as they may reasonably be expected to apply for the purposes of your assessment for a later income year, had applied for the purposes of the <sup>* </sup>base assessment.

Commissioner may take into account proposed changes to the law so as to reduce instalment rate

             (5)  For the purposes of working out your <sup>* </sup>notional tax, the Commissioner may work out an amount as if provisions of an Act or regulations that, in the Commissioner’s opinion, are likely to be enacted or made had applied for the purposes of the <sup>* </sup>base assessment. But the Commissioner may do so only if, as a result, the instalment rate given to you is reduced.

##### <a id="45-330"></a>45-330  Working out your _adjusted taxable income_

             (1)  Your _adjusted taxable income_ for the <sup>* </sup>base year is your total assessable income for the <sup>* </sup>base assessment, reduced by:

                     (a)  any <sup>* </sup>net capital gain included in that assessable income; and

                     (b)  your deductions for the base year (except <sup>* </sup>tax losses), as used in making that assessment; and

                     (c)  the amount of any tax loss, to the extent that you can carry it forward to the next income year.

Exception: superannuation entities and net capital gains

             (2)  Paragraph (1)(a) does not apply in the case of:

                     (a)  an eligible ADF (as defined in section 267 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) for the <sup>* </sup>base year; or 

                     (b)  an eligible superannuation fund (as defined in that section) for that year; or 

                     (c)  a pooled superannuation trust (as defined in that section) for that year.

##### <a id="45-335"></a>45-335  Working out your _adjusted withholding income_

                   Your _adjusted withholding income_ for the <sup>* </sup>base year is:

                        •  the total of the amounts included in your assessable income for the <sup>* </sup>base assessment in respect of <sup>* </sup>withholding payments (except <sup>* </sup>non-quotation withholding payments);

reduced by:

                        •  your deductions for that year, as used in making that assessment, to the extent that they reasonably relate to those amounts.

##### <a id="45-340"></a>45-340  _Adjusted tax_ on adjusted taxable income or on adjusted withholding income

                   Your **_adjusted tax_**on your <sup>* </sup>adjusted taxable income, or on your <sup>* </sup>adjusted withholding income, for the <sup>* </sup>base year is worked out as follows:

<div style="BORDER-RIGHT: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-RIGHT: 5pt; BORDER-TOP: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-LEFT: 5pt; PADDING-BOTTOM: 5pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 2cm; BORDER-LEFT: windowtext 1pt solid; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0cm; PADDING-TOP: 5pt; BORDER-BOTTOM: windowtext 1pt solid; mso-border-alt: solid windowtext .75pt">

_Method statement_

_Step 1_.   The income tax payable on your <sup>* </sup>adjusted taxable income, or on your <sup>* </sup>adjusted withholding income, for the <sup>* </sup>base year is worked out disregarding any <sup>* </sup>tax offset under:

               (a)     Subdivision 61-H of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (for a premium under a private health insurance policy); or

               (b)     section 159N of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (for certain low income individuals); or

               (c)     section 159T of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_(for individuals who make superannuation contributions for a spouse).

_Step 2._   The Medicare levy payable on your <sup>* </sup>adjusted taxable income, or on your <sup>* </sup>adjusted withholding income, for the <sup>* </sup>base year is worked out disregarding sections 8B, 8C, 8D, 8E, 8F and 8G of the _Medicare Levy Act 1986_ (which increase Medicare levy in certain cases).

_Step 3._   The amount (if any) that you would have been liable to pay for the <sup>* </sup>base year in respect of an accumulated HEC debt under the _Higher Education Funding Act 1988_ if your taxable income for the base year had been your <sup>* </sup>adjusted taxable income, or your <sup>* </sup>adjusted withholding income, for that year is worked out. 

_Step 4._ The results of steps 1, 2 and 3 are added together, and reduced by what would have been your <sup>* </sup>FTB amount (if any) for the <sup>* </sup>base year if your taxable income for the base year had been your <sup>* </sup>adjusted taxable income, or your <sup>* </sup>adjusted withholding income, for that year. The result is your **_adjusted tax_**on your <sup>* </sup>adjusted taxable income, or on your <sup>* </sup>adjusted withholding income.</div>

             (2)  The Commissioner may work out your <sup>* </sup>benchmark tax for an income year (the **_variation year_**) if, under paragraph 45-115(1)(c) or 45-175(1)(b), you estimate the amount of your annual instalment for that year.

##### <a id="45-360"></a>45-360  How Commissioner works out _benchmark instalment rate_

             (1)  Your **_benchmark instalment rate_** for the variation year is the percentage worked out to 2 decimal places (rounding up if the third decimal place is 5 or more) using the formula:

             (3)  For the purposes of the formula in subsection (2):

                    <a name="origin-amount"></a>**_original amount_** means the amount that, apart from subsection (2), would be your <sup>* </sup>adjusted taxable income for the <sup>* </sup>base year, or your <sup>* </sup>adjusted withholding income for the <sup>* </sup>base year, as appropriate.

                    <a name="gdp-adjust"></a>**_GDP adjustment_** means the percentage (rounded to the nearest whole number, rounding down a number ending in .5) worked out using the formula:

             (5)  The **_GDP amount_** for a <sup>* </sup>quarter is the amount published by the Australian Statistician as the original gross domestic product at current prices for that quarter.

             (6)  The **_GDP adjustment_** must be worked out on the basis of the first document that:

                     (a)  is published by the Australian Statistician after the end of the later calendar year; and

                     (b)  sets out the <sup>* </sup>GDP amounts for all the <sup>* </sup>quarters in both the later calendar year and the earlier calendar year.

             (7)  To avoid doubt, subsections 45-325(4) and (5) also have effect for the purposes of working out your <sup>* </sup>GDP-adjusted notional tax.

## 10  Subsection 6(1) (at the end of the definition of _this Act_)

Add:

             ; and (c)  Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

## 11  Paragraph 220AF(1)(c)

After “1994”, insert “and before <st1:date style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x" year="2000" day="1" month="7">1 July 2000</st1:date>”.

## 12  Subsection 220AJ(1)

After “financial year”, insert “ending on or before <st1:date style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x" year="2000" day="30" month="6">30 June 2000</st1:date>”.

## 13  Paragraph 220AQ(1)(b)

After “first person”, insert “on or before <st1:date style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x" year="2000" day="30" month="6">30 June 2000</st1:date>”.

## 15  At the end of section 221AKA

Add:

             (3)  This Division does not apply to a taxpayer for the 2000-01 income year or a later income year.

Note:          For the 2000-01 income year a taxpayer may be liable to pay PAYG instalments: see Division 45 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

## 16  Before section 221AZJ

Insert in Subdivision B of Division 1C of Part VI:

##### <a id="221AZJA"></a>221AZJA  Application of this Division

                   A taxpayer is not liable to pay instalments under this Division for the 2000-01 income year or a later income year.

Note:          For the 2000-01 income year a taxpayer may be liable to pay PAYG instalments: see Division 45 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

## 17  Subsection 221AZK(2)

After “subsection (3A)”, insert “of this section and to sections 221AZJA, 221AZKB, 221AZKC and 221AZKE”.

## 18  After section 221AZKA

Insert:

##### <a id="221AZKB"></a>221AZKB  For 1999-2000, some medium and small taxpayers need not pay instalment due in month 18

             (1)  For the 1999-2000 year of income, a medium taxpayer is not liable to pay the instalment that would otherwise be due on the 1st day of month 18.

             (2)  For the 1999-2000 year of income, a small taxpayer is not liable to pay the instalment that would otherwise be due on the 15th day of month 18.

Note:          This subsection does not cover a small taxpayer whose assessed tax for the 1999-2000 is more than $300,000\. See subsection 221AZK(3A).

To qualify, taxpayer must be quarterly instalment payer

             (3)  However, subsection (1) or (2) applies only if the taxpayer is liable to pay an instalment for the first instalment quarter of the 2000-01 year of income under Division 45 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ (even if the amount of that instalment is nil).

Note:          This means that an entity that becomes an annual payer at the end of that instalment quarter under Subdivision 45-E in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ does not qualify.

Effect on amount of final instalment

             (4)  In working out the amount of the final instalment of a small or medium taxpayer for the 1999-2000 year of income, disregard a previous instalment that the taxpayer is not liable to pay because of this section.

##### <a id="221AZKC"></a>221AZKC  Deferring payment of the final instalment for 1999-2000

             (1)  Depending on the amount of its assessed tax for the 1999-2000 year of income, an instalment taxpayer may defer payment of all or some of its final instalment for that year.

             (2)  However, subsection (1) applies only if the taxpayer is liable to pay a quarterly instalment for the first instalment quarter of the 2000-01 year of income under Division 45 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ (even if the amount of that instalment is nil).

Note:          This means that an entity that becomes an annual payer at the end of that instalment quarter under Subdivision 45-E in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ does not qualify.

How much can be deferred, and for how long?

             (3)  The table shows:

                     (a)  how much of the final instalment can be deferred (the **_deferred amount_**); and

                     (b)  the number of equal quarterly payments by which the taxpayer must pay off the deferred amount.

However, the deferred amount cannot be more than the whole of the instalment (reduced by any credits or offsets specified in paragraph 221AZP(1)(b)).

             (4)  If only some of the final instalment can be deferred, the rest is still due on the day on which the whole of the instalment would otherwise be due. Section 221AZMAA (which applies the general interest charge to unpaid amounts) applies as if the rest of the final instalment were the whole of the final instalment.

When the quarterly payments are due

             (5)  The first of the quarterly payments is due:

                     (a)  if (disregarding anything the Commissioner does under section 206) the final instalment would otherwise be due on the 1st day of month 18 for the 1999-2000 year of income—on the 21st day of month 19 for that year; and

                     (b)  if (disregarding anything the Commissioner does under section 206) the final instalment would otherwise be due on the 1st or 15th day of month 21 for the 1999-2000 year of income—on the 21st day of month 22 for that year.

Note:          The due date for the first quarterly payment is the same as for the taxpayer’s next quarterly instalment for the 2000-01 year of income under Division 45 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_. If the taxpayer’s year of income ends on <st1:date style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x" year="2000" day="30" month="6">30 June 2000</st1:date>, the due date will be 21 January or <st1:date style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x" year="2001" day="21" month="4">21 April 2001</st1:date>. 

             (6)  Each of the remaining quarterly payments is due 3 months after the day on which the previous quarterly payment is due (or would be due apart from anything the Commissioner does under section 206).

             (7)  A quarterly payment is due on a particular day even if no quarterly instalment of the taxpayer is due on that day under Division 45 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

Note:          If some or all of a quarterly payment is not paid on time, the taxpayer is liable to pay the general interest charge on the unpaid amount: see section 221AZMAA.

             (8)  Quarterly payments are to be treated as tax for the purposes of sections 206, 208, 209, 214, 254, 255, 258 and 259.

##### <a id="221AZKE"></a>221AZKE  Modified application of sections 221AZKB and 221AZKC to entity adopting a substituted accounting period

                   Sections 221AZKB and 221AZKC apply to an entity with modifications that the Commissioner determines in writing if the Commissioner has granted the entity leave under section 18 to adopt an accounting period ending on a day other than 30 June and, as a result:

                     (a)  the entity’s 1999-2000 year of income will end on a day of a calendar year that does not correspond to the last day of the entity’s 1998-99 year of income; or

                     (b)  the entity’s 2000-01 year of income will end on a day of a calendar year that does not correspond to the last day of the entity’s 1999-2000 year of income.

### Division 3—Treatment of payments, credits and RBA surpluses

##### <a id="8AAZL"></a>8AAZL  Amounts covered by this Division

             (1)  This Division sets out how the Commissioner must treat the following kinds of amount:

                     (a)  a payment the Commissioner receives in respect of a current or anticipated tax debt or tax debts of an entity;

                     (b)  a credit (including an excess non-RBA credit) that an entity is entitled to under a taxation law;

                     (c)  an RBA surplus of an entity.

             (2)  The Commissioner must treat each such amount using the method set out in section 8AAZLA or 8AAZLB (but not both).

Note:          In either case, section 8AAZLC has some additional rules that apply to RBA surpluses and to certain excess non-RBA credits.

##### <a id="8AAZLA"></a>8AAZLA  Method 1—allocating the amount first to an RBA

             (1)  The Commissioner may, in the manner he or she determines, allocate the amount to an RBA of the entity.

             (2)  The Commissioner must then also apply the amount against the following kinds of debts (if there are any):

                     (a)  tax debts that have been allocated to that RBA;

                     (b)  general interest charge on such tax debts.

             (3)  To the extent that the amount is not applied under subsection (2), it gives rise to an **_excess non-RBA credit_** in favour of the entity that:

                     (a)  is equal to the part of the amount that is not applied; and

                     (b)  relates to the RBA to which the amount was allocated.

##### <a id="8AAZLB"></a>8AAZLB  Method 2—applying the amount first against a non-RBA tax debt

             (1)  The Commissioner may, in the manner he or she determines, apply the amount against a non-RBA tax debt of the entity.

             (2)  If the non-RBA tax debt is:

                     (a)  a tax debt that has been allocated to an RBA; or

                     (b)  general interest charge on such a tax debt;

the Commissioner must then also allocate the amount to that RBA.

             (3)  To the extent that the amount is not applied under subsection (1), it gives rise to an **_excess non-RBA credit_** in favour of the entity that is equal to the part of the amount that is not applied.

             (4)  The excess non-RBA credit relates to the RBA (if any) that the Commissioner determines and the balance of that RBA is adjusted in the entity’s favour by the amount of that credit.

Separate RBAs for one entity

             (5)  If the non-RBA tax debt mentioned in subsection (1) has been allocated to 2 or more RBAs, the Commissioner must allocate the amount applied between those RBAs in the proportions in which the tax debt was allocated.

Note:          Separate RBAs may be established for different businesses or undertakings conducted by the same entity, for different parts of the same business or undertaking or for different periods: see subsection 8AAZC(5).

##### <a id="8AAZLC"></a>8AAZLC  RBA surplus and related credits must remain equivalent if one or the other is applied

RBA surpluses

             (1)  If an RBA surplus is allocated or applied under this Division, the Commissioner must reduce by the same amount excess non-RBA credits that relate to the RBA.

Excess non-RBA credits

             (2)  If, under this Division, an excess non-RBA credit that relates to an RBA (the **_related RBA_**) is:

                     (a)  allocated to an RBA; or

                     (b)  applied against a non-RBA tax debt;

the related RBA is adjusted in the Commissioner’s favour by the same amount.
