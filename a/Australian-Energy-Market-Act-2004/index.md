             (2)  Subsection (1) does not authorise the conferral of a function or power, or the imposition of a duty, by a State/Territory energy law to the extent to which:

                     (a)  the conferral or imposition, or the authorisation, would contravene any constitutional doctrines restricting the duties that may be imposed on the Commonwealth Minister; or

                     (b)  the authorisation would otherwise exceed the legislative power of the Commonwealth.

             (3)  The Commonwealth Minister cannot perform a duty or function, or exercise a power, under a State/Territory energy law unless the conferral of the function or power, or the imposition of the duty, is in accordance with an agreement between the Commonwealth and the State or Territory concerned.

##### <a id="13B"></a>13B  How duty is imposed

Application

             (1)  This section applies if a State/Territory energy law purports to impose a duty on the Commonwealth Minister.

Note:          Section 13C sets out when such a law imposes a duty on the Commonwealth Minister.

State or Territory legislative power sufficient to support duty

             (2)  The duty is taken not to be imposed by this Act (or any other law of the Commonwealth) to the extent to which:

                     (a)  imposing the duty is within the legislative powers of the State or Territory concerned; and

                     (b)  imposing the duty by the law of the State or Territory is consistent with the constitutional doctrines restricting the duties that may be imposed on the Commonwealth Minister.

Note:          If this subsection applies, the duty will be taken to be imposed by force of the law of the State or Territory (the Commonwealth having consented under section 13A to the imposition of the duty by that law).

Commonwealth legislative power sufficient to support duty but State or Territory legislative powers are not

             (3)  If, to ensure the validity of the purported imposition of the duty, it is necessary that the duty be imposed by a law of the Commonwealth (rather than by the law of the State or Territory), the duty is taken to be imposed by this Act to the extent necessary to ensure that validity.

             (4)  If, because of subsection (3), this Act is taken to impose the duty, it is the intention of the Parliament to rely on all powers available to it under the Constitution to support the imposition of the duty by this Act.

             (5)  The duty is taken to be imposed by this Act in accordance with subsection (3) only to the extent to which imposing the duty:

                     (a)  is within the legislative powers of the Commonwealth; and

                     (b)  is consistent with the constitutional doctrines restricting the duties that may be imposed on the Commonwealth Minister.

             (6)  Subsections (1) to (5) do not limit section 13A.

##### <a id="13C"></a>13C  When a State/Territory energy law imposes a duty

                   For the purposes of sections 13A and 13B, a State/Territory energy law **_imposes a duty_** on the Commonwealth Minister if:

                     (a)  the law confers a function or power on the Commonwealth Minister; and

                     (b)  the circumstances in which the function or power is conferred give rise to an obligation on the Commonwealth Minister to perform the function or to exercise the power.

##### <a id="13D"></a>13D  No Commonwealth tax consequences for certain transfers of assets and liabilities etc.

             (1)  No consequences arise, for the purposes of a prescribed law of the Commonwealth relating to taxation, in respect of:

                     (a)  a federal tax-exempt matter; or

                     (b)  anything done (including, for example, a transaction entered into or an instrument or document made, executed, lodged or given) because of, or arising out of, a federal tax-exempt matter.
