**Notes** 

## An Act to promote competitiveness, and encourage investment, in the automotive industry, and for related purposes

## Part 1—Preliminary

##### <a id="1"></a>1  Short title [_see_ Note 1]

                   This Act may be cited as the _ACIS Administration Act 1999_.

##### <a id="2"></a>2  Commencement [_see_ Note 1]

                   This Act commences immediately after the commencement of the _Customs Tariff Amendment (ACIS Implementation) Act 1999_.

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Purpose of the Act

                   The purpose of this Act is to provide transitional assistance to encourage competitive investment and innovation in the Australian automotive industry in order to achieve sustainable growth, both in the Australian market and internationally, in the context of trade liberalisation.

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Overview of the Act

             (1)  This Act sets up ACIS for the purpose set out in section 3\. Under ACIS, participants receive duty credit which can be applied against customs duty payable, or paid, on certain eligible imports (item 41E of Schedule 4 to the Tariff and subsection 74A(1) of this Act).

          (1A)  There are 2 stages in ACIS:

                     (a)  Stage 1—the period commencing on the scheme commencement date and ending 31 December 2005; and

                     (b)  Stage 2—the period commencing on 1 January 2006 and ending on 31 December 2010.

             (2)  Each ACIS Stage has a cap on the value of certain duty credit that may be entered in the ACIS ledger in respect of that stage. The stage caps are as follows:

                     (a)  ACIS Stage 1—$2,000,000,000;

                     (b)  ACIS Stage 2—$2,000,000,000.

There are also personal limits on each participant in respect of each ACIS year (see section 54).

          (2A)  In ACIS Stage 2, the stage cap will be divided into separate funding pools—one for MVPs and the other for participants who are not MVPs (see section 55).

             (3)  In ACIS Stage 2, the R&amp;D scheme operates to provide to MVPs, within the funding pool for MVPs, duty credits that are unmodulated type J investment credits (see Part 5A).

          (3A)  Participants can receive duty credits in respect of an ACIS Stage if the cap for that stage has not already been reached. Duty credits issued in respect of a particular ACIS Stage may be applied:

                     (a)  to the importation of eligible imports; or

                     (b)  against the customs duty a person has already paid if the duty was paid in respect of the importation, on or after 1 January 2001, of eligible imports.

          (3B)  Duty credit issued in respect of a particular ACIS Stage expires if the duty credit has not been applied against customs duty:

                     (a)  during the particular stage; or

                     (b)  on or before 31 December of the calendar year next following the stage (see section 74A).

             (4)  Under ACIS, certain persons may apply for registration under the scheme (Part 2).

             (5)  Once registered, a participant has an obligation to make quarterly returns in accordance with Part 3.

             (6)  On the basis of such returns, a participant is eligible to earn unmodulated credit (Part 4 and the R&amp;D scheme for unmodulated type J investment credit) depending on:

                     (a)  the participant’s production of motor vehicles, engines or engine components (MVPs only); and

                     (b)  the participant’s investment in certain plant and equipment and research and development.

             (7)  The scheme provides for a modulation process (Part 5) under which unmodulated credit (except unmodulated uncapped production credit and unmodulated type J investment credit), is converted into modulated credit. The modulation process has regard to the stage caps for ACIS.

             (8)  Duty credit is modulated credit, unmodulated uncapped production credit or unmodulated type J investment credit that has been entered in the ACIS ledger.

             (9)  The ACIS ledger is dealt with in Part 6.

           (10)  Duty credit can be:

                     (a)  transferred to another person (Part 7); or

                     (b)  applied to the importation of certain eligible imports (the Secretary may restrict the uses to which certain kinds of modulated credit can be put (Part 7)); or

                    (ba)  applied against an earlier payment of duty on such eligible imports (Part 7); or

                     (c)  offset against an amount of unearned credit liability imposed on a person in respect of unearned duty credit (Part 9).

           (11)  Under the scheme, there are powers of audit (Part 8).

           (12)  Certain unearned duty credit can be recovered as provided for in Part 9.

           (13)  Part 10 sets out document retention obligations (section 108) and obligations to update business plans on a regular basis (section 109).

           (14)  Participants may be deregistered in the circumstances set out in Part 11.

           (15)  Part 12 provides for administrative review of certain decisions.

           (16)  Part 13 provides for delegation of powers and the making of regulations.

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Offences

             (1)  Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ applies to all offences against this Act.

             (2)  A maximum penalty that is specified:

                     (a)  at the foot of a section of this Act (other than a section that is divided into subsections); or

                     (b)  at the foot of a subsection of this Act;

indicates that a person who contravenes the section or subsection is guilty of an offence against the section or subsection that is punishable, on conviction, by a penalty up to that maximum.

Note 1:       Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.

Note 2:       If the specified penalty is imprisonment only, section 4B of the _Crimes Act 1914_ allows the court to impose a fine instead of imprisonment or in addition to imprisonment.

Original investor not a participant when investment made

             (5)  If:

                     (a)  the original investor was not a participant at the time the investment was undertaken; and

                     (b)  the Secretary is satisfied that:

                              (i)  if the investment had been undertaken by a participant, the investment would be eligible investment of a type specified by the Secretary; and

                     (b)  the Secretary is satisfied that, were the participant to be applying for registration at that time, the participant would not be a fit and proper person within the meaning of section 29; or

                     (c)  the participant asks the Secretary to be deregistered as such a participant; or

                     (d)  the participant fails to comply with the document retention obligations set out in section 108.

Note:          The meaning of **_fit and proper_** is extended, so far as a group is concerned, because of the operation of section 22.

             (3)  In determining whether or not, if a participant were applying for registration at a particular time, the participant would or would not be a fit and proper person within the meaning of section 29, that section has affect as if a misleading statement made in a quarterly return were a misleading statement made in the application for registration.

             (4)  The Secretary may deregister an MVP, ACP, AMTP or ASP who fails to comply with the requirement in section 109 to provide an update of the business plan provided in relation to their application for registration as such an MVP, ACP, AMTP or ASP.

             (5)  The Secretary may deregister a participant if:

                     (a)  the participant is registered on the basis that in the 12 months following the application for registration as such a participant:

                              (i)  in the case of an MVP—the MVP is likely to do the things set out in paragraph 16(1)(b); or

                             (ii)  in the case of an ACP (other than a group of related companies)—the ACP is likely to do the things set out in subparagraph 17(1)(b)(i) or (ii); or

                            (iii)  in the case of an ACP comprised of a group of related companies—the ACP is likely to do the things set out in subparagraph 17(2)(b)(i) or (ii); or

                            (iv)  in the case of an AMTP—the AMTP is likely to do the things set out in subparagraph 18(1)(b)(i) or (ii); or

                             (v)  in the case of an ASP—the ASP is likely to do the things set out in subparagraph 19(1)(b)(i) or (ii); and

                     (b)  at any time during the 12 months following the application the Secretary determines that it is unlikely that the participant will be able to do those things; and

                     (c)  where the participant was registered on the basis that the participant’s registration would further the purpose of the Act set out in section 3 (as required by section 14A)—the Secretary determines that the registration does not further the purpose of the Act.
