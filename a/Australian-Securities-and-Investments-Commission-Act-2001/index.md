##### <a id="12BAA"></a>12BAA  Definition of _financial product_

General definition of **financial product**

             (1)  Subject to subsection (8), for the purposes of this Division, a **_financial product_** is a facility through which, or through the acquisition of which, a person does one or more of the following:

                     (a)  makes a financial investment (see subsection (4));

                     (b)  manages financial risk (see subsection (5));

                     (c)  makes non‑cash payments (see subsection (6)).

             (2)  Subject to subsection (8), for the purposes of this Division, a particular facility that is of a kind through which people commonly make financial investments, manage financial risks or make non‑cash payments is a **_financial product_** even if that facility is acquired by a particular person for some other purpose.

             (3)  A facility does not cease to be a financial product merely because:

                     (a)  the facility has been acquired by a person other than the person to whom it was originally issued; and

                     (b)  that person, in acquiring the product, was not making a financial investment or managing a financial risk.

Meaning of **makes a financial investment**

             (4)  For the purposes of this section, a person (the **_investor_**) **_makes a financial investment_** if:

                     (a)  the investor gives money or money’s worth (the **_contribution_**) to another person and any of the following apply:

                              (i)  the other person uses the contribution to generate a financial return, or other benefit, for the investor;

                             (ii)  the investor intends that the other person will use the contribution to generate a financial return, or other benefit, for the investor (even if no return or benefit is in fact generated);

                            (iii)  the other person intends that the contribution will be used to generate a financial return, or other benefit, for the investor; and

                     (b)  the investor has no day‑to‑day control over the use of the contribution to generate the return or benefit.

Note 1:       Examples of actions that constitute making a financial investment under this subsection are:

(a)    a person paying money to a company for the issue to the person of shares in the company (the company uses the money to generate dividends for the person and the person, as a shareholder, does not have control over the day‑to‑day affairs of the company); or

(b)    a person contributing money to acquire interests in a registered scheme from the responsible entity of the scheme (the scheme uses the money to generate financial or other benefits for the person and the person, as a member of the scheme, does not have day‑to‑day control over the operation of the scheme).

Note 2:       Examples of actions that do not constitute making a financial investment under this subsection are:

(a)    a person purchasing real property or bullion (while the property or bullion may generate a return for the person, it is not a return generated by the use of the purchase money by another person); or

(b)    a person giving money to a financial services licensee who is to use it to purchase shares for the person (while the purchase of the shares will be a financial investment made by the person, the mere act of giving the money to the licensee will not of itself constitute making a financial investment).

Meaning of **manages a financial risk**

             (5)  For the purposes of this section, a person **_manages financial risk_** if they:

                     (a)  manage the financial consequences to them of particular circumstances happening; or

                     (b)  avoid or limit the financial consequences of fluctuations in, or in the value of, receipts or costs (including prices and interest rates).

Note 1:       Examples of actions that constitute managing a financial risk are:

(a)    taking out insurance; or

(b)    hedging a liability by acquiring a futures contract or entering into a currency swap.

Note 2:       An example of an action that does not constitute managing a financial risk is employing a security firm (while that is a way of managing the risk that thefts will happen, it is not a way of managing the financial consequences if thefts do occur).

Meaning of **makes non‑cash payments**

             (6)  For the purposes of this section, a person **_makes non‑cash payments_** if they make payments, or cause payments to be made, otherwise than by the physical delivery of Australian currency in the form of notes and/or coins.

Note:          Examples of actions that constitute making non‑cash payments are:

(a)    making payments by means of a facility for direct debit of a deposit account; or

(b)    making payments by means of a facility for the use of cheques; or

(c)    making payments by means of a purchased payment facility within the meaning of the _Payment Systems (Regulation) Act 1998_, such as a smart card; or

(d)    making payments by means of traveller’s cheques in Australian currency.

Note:          Even though something is expressly excluded from one of these paragraphs, it may still be a financial product (subject to subsection (8)) either because:

             (3)  To avoid doubt, subsection (2) does not:

                     (a)  have the effect that, merely because such evidence to the contrary is adduced, the person who made the representation is taken to have had reasonable grounds for making the representation; or

                     (b)  have the effect of placing on any person an onus of proving that the person who made the representation had reasonable grounds for making the representation.

             (4)  Subsection (1) does not by implication limit the meaning of a reference in this Division to:

                     (a)  a misleading representation; or

                     (b)  a representation that is misleading in a material particular; or

                     (c)  conduct that is misleading or is likely or liable to mislead;

and, in particular, does not imply that a representation that a person makes with respect to any future matter is not misleading merely because the person has reasonable grounds for making the representation.

##### <a id="12BC"></a>12BC  Consumers

             (1)  For the purposes of this Division, unless the contrary intention appears, a person is taken to have acquired particular financial services as a consumer if, and only if:

                     (a)  the price of the services did not exceed the prescribed amount; or

                     (b)  if the price of the services exceeded the prescribed amount—the services were of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household use or consumption; or

                     (c)  if the services were acquired for use or consumption in connection with a small business (see subsection (2)) and the price of the services exceeded the prescribed amount—the services were of a kind ordinarily acquired for business use or consumption.

             (2)  For the purposes of subsection (1):

                    <a name="small-busi"></a>**_small business_** means a business employing less than:

                     (a)  if the business is or includes the manufacture of goods—100 people; or

                     (b)  otherwise—20 people.

             (3)  For the purposes of subsection (1):

                     (a)  the prescribed amount is:

                              (i)  $40,000; or

                             (ii)  if a greater amount is prescribed for the purposes of this paragraph—that greater amount; and

                     (b)  subject to paragraph (c), the price of services purchased by a person is taken to have been the amount paid or payable by the person for the services; and

                     (c)  if a person purchased services together with other property or services, or with both other property and services, and a specified price was not allocated to the services in the contract under which they were purchased, the price of the services is taken to have been:

                              (i)  the price at which, at the time of the acquisition, the person could have purchased the services from the supplier without the other property or services; or

                             (ii)  if, at the time of the acquisition, the services were only available for purchase from the supplier together with the other property or services but, at that time, services of the kind acquired were available for purchase from another supplier without other property or services—the lowest price at which the person could, at that time, reasonably have purchased services of that kind from another supplier; or

                            (iii)  if, at the time of the acquisition, services of the kind acquired were not available for purchase from any supplier except together with other property or services—the value of the services at that time; and

                     (d)  if a person acquired services otherwise than by way of purchase, the price of the services is taken to have been:

                              (i)  the price at which, at the time of the acquisition, the person could have purchased the services from the supplier; or

                             (ii)  if, at the time of the acquisition, the services were not available for purchase from the supplier, or were available only together with other property or services, but, at that time, services of the kind acquired were available for purchase from another supplier—the lowest price at which the person could, at that time, reasonably have purchased services of that kind from another supplier; or

                            (iii)  if services of the kind acquired were not available, at the time of the acquisition, for purchase from any supplier, or were not available except together with other property or services—the value of the services at that time; and

                     (e)  without limiting by implication the meaning of the expression **_services_** in subsection 12BA(1), the obtaining of credit by a person in connection with the person’s acquisition of services is taken to be the acquisition by the person of a service and any amount by which the amount paid or payable by the person for the services is increased by reason of the person’s so obtaining credit is taken to be paid or payable by the person for that service.

             (4)  If it is alleged in a proceeding under this Division, or in any other proceeding in respect of a matter arising under this Division, that a person was a consumer in relation to particular services, it is presumed that the person was a consumer in relation to those services unless the contrary is established.

##### <a id="12BD"></a>12BD  Acquisition, supply and re‑supply

                            (iii)  sets out the charge for an advertisement, for financial services or financial products, that has been published;

             (2)  For the purposes of this section, an invoice or other document purporting to have been sent by or on behalf of a person is taken to have been sent by that person unless the contrary is established.

#### Subdivision BA—Unfair contract terms

##### <a id="12BF"></a>12BF  Unfair terms of consumer contracts

             (1)  A term of a consumer contract is void if:

                     (a)  the term is unfair; and

                     (b)  the contract is a standard form contract; and

                     (c)  the contract is:

                              (i)  a financial product; or

                             (ii)  a contract for the supply, or possible supply, of services that are financial services.

             (2)  The contract continues to bind the parties if it is capable of operating without the unfair term.

             (3)  A **_consumer contract_** is a contract at least one of the parties to which is an individual whose acquisition of what is supplied under the contract is wholly or predominantly an acquisition for personal, domestic or household use or consumption.

##### <a id="12BG"></a>12BG  Meaning of _unfair_

             (1)  A term of a consumer contract referred to in subsection 12BF(1) is **_unfair_** if:

                     (a)  it would cause a significant imbalance in the parties’ rights and obligations arising under the contract; and

                     (b)  it is not reasonably necessary in order to protect the legitimate interests of the party who would be advantaged by the term; and

                     (c)  it would cause detriment (whether financial or otherwise) to a party if it were to be applied or relied on.

             (2)  In determining whether a term of a consumer contract is unfair under subsection (1), a court may take into account such matters as it thinks relevant, but must take into account the following:

                     (b)  the extent to which the term is transparent;

                     (c)  the contract as a whole.

             (3)  A term is **_transparent_** if the term is:

                     (a)  expressed in reasonably plain language; and

                     (b)  legible; and

                     (c)  presented clearly; and

                     (d)  readily available to any party affected by the term.

             (4)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), a term of a consumer contract is presumed not to be reasonably necessary in order to protect the legitimate interests of the party who would be advantaged by the term, unless that party proves otherwise.

##### <a id="12BH"></a>12BH  Examples of unfair terms

             (1)  Without limiting section 12BG, the following are examples of the kinds of terms of a consumer contract referred to in subsection 12BF(1) that may be unfair:

                     (a)  a term that permits, or has the effect of permitting, one party (but not another party) to avoid or limit performance of the contract;

                     (b)  a term that permits, or has the effect of permitting, one party (but not another party) to terminate the contract;

                     (c)  a term that penalises, or has the effect of penalising, one party (but not another party) for a breach or termination of the contract;

                     (d)  a term that permits, or has the effect of permitting, one party (but not another party) to vary the terms of the contract;

                     (e)  a term that permits, or has the effect of permitting, one party (but not another party) to renew or not renew the contract;

                      (f)  a term that permits, or has the effect of permitting, one party to vary the upfront price payable under the contract without the right of another party to terminate the contract;

                     (g)  a term that permits, or has the effect of permitting, one party unilaterally to vary financial services to be supplied under the contract;

                     (h)  a term that permits, or has the effect of permitting, one party unilaterally to determine whether the contract has been breached or to interpret its meaning;

                      (i)  a term that limits, or has the effect of limiting, one party’s vicarious liability for its agents;

                      (j)  a term that permits, or has the effect of permitting, one party to assign the contract to the detriment of another party without that other party’s consent;

                     (k)  a term that limits, or has the effect of limiting, one party’s right to sue another party;

                      (l)  a term that limits, or has the effect of limiting, the evidence one party can adduce in proceedings relating to the contract;

                    (m)  a term that imposes, or has the effect of imposing, the evidential burden on one party in proceedings relating to the contract;

                     (n)  a term of a kind, or a term that has an effect of a kind, prescribed by the regulations.

             (2)  Before the Governor‑General makes a regulation for the purposes of paragraph (1)(n) prescribing a kind of term, or a kind of effect that a term has, the Minister must take into consideration:

                     (a)  the detriment that a term of that kind would cause to consumers; and

                     (b)  the impact on business generally of prescribing that kind of term or effect; and

                     (c)  the public interest.

##### <a id="12BI"></a>12BI  Terms that define main subject matter of consumer contracts etc. are unaffected 

             (1)  Section 12BF does not apply to a term of a consumer contract referred to in subsection (1) of that section to the extent that, but only to the extent that, the term:

                     (a)  defines the main subject matter of the contract; or

                     (b)  sets the upfront price payable under the contract; or

                     (c)  is a term required, or expressly permitted, by a law of the Commonwealth or a State or Territory.

             (2)  The **_upfront price_** payable under a consumer contract referred to in subsection 12BF(1) is the consideration that:

                     (a)  is provided, or is to be provided, for the supply under the contract; and

                     (b)  is disclosed at or before the time the contract is entered into;

but does not include any other consideration that is contingent on the occurrence or non‑occurrence of a particular event.

             (3)  To avoid doubt, if a consumer contract referred to in subsection 12BF(1) is a contract under which credit is provided or is to be provided, the consideration referred to in subsection (2) of this section includes the total amount of principal that is owed under the contract.

##### <a id="12BK"></a>12BK  Standard form contracts

             (1)  If a party to a proceeding alleges that a contract is a standard form contract, it is presumed to be a standard form contract unless another party to the proceeding proves otherwise.

             (2)  In determining whether a contract is a standard form contract, a court may take into account such matters as it thinks relevant, but must take into account the following:

                     (a)  whether one of the parties has all or most of the bargaining power relating to the transaction;

                     (b)  whether the contract was prepared by one party before any discussion relating to the transaction occurred between the parties;

                     (c)  whether another party was, in effect, required either to accept or reject the terms of the contract (other than the terms referred to in subsection 12BI(1)) in the form in which they were presented;

                     (d)  whether another party was given an effective opportunity to negotiate the terms of the contract that were not the terms referred to in subsection 12BI(1);

                     (e)  whether the terms of the contract (other than the terms referred to in subsection 12BI(1)) take into account the specific characteristics of another party or the particular transaction;

                      (f)  any other matter prescribed by the regulations.

##### <a id="12BL"></a>12BL  Contracts to which this Part does not apply

                   This Part does not apply to a consumer contract that is the constitution of a company, managed investment scheme or other kind of body.

##### <a id="12BM"></a>12BM  Contraventions of this Subdivision etc.

                   Conduct is not taken, for the purposes of this Act, to contravene this Subdivision (or this Division) merely because of subsection 12BF(1).

#### Subdivision C—Unconscionable conduct

##### <a id="12CA"></a>12CA  Unconscionable conduct within the meaning of the unwritten law of the States and Territories

             (1)  A person must not, in trade or commerce, engage in conduct in relation to financial services if the conduct is unconscionable within the meaning of the unwritten law, from time to time, of the States and Territories.

             (2)  This section does not apply to conduct that is prohibited by section 12CB.

##### <a id="12CB"></a>12CB  Unconscionable conduct in connection with financial services

             (1)  A person must not, in trade or commerce, in connection with:

                     (a)  the supply or possible supply of financial services to a person (other than a listed public company); or

                     (b)  the acquisition or possible acquisition of financial services from a person (other than a listed public company);

engage in conduct that is, in all the circumstances, unconscionable.

             (2)  This section does not apply to conduct that is engaged in only because the person engaging in the conduct:

                     (a)  institutes legal proceedings in relation to the supply or possible supply, or in relation to the acquisition or possible acquisition; or

                     (b)  refers to arbitration a dispute or claim in relation to the supply or possible supply, or in relation to the acquisition or possible acquisition.

             (3)  For the purpose of determining whether a person has contravened subsection (1):

                     (a)  the court must not have regard to any circumstances that were not reasonably foreseeable at the time of the alleged contravention; and

                     (b)  the court may have regard to conduct engaged in, or circumstances existing, before the commencement of this section.

             (4)  It is the intention of the Parliament that:

                     (a)  this section is not limited by the unwritten law of the States and Territories relating to unconscionable conduct; and

                     (b)  this section is capable of applying to a system of conduct or pattern of behaviour, whether or not a particular individual is identified as having been disadvantaged by the conduct or behaviour; and

                     (c)  in considering whether conduct to which a contract relates is unconscionable, a court’s consideration of the contract may include consideration of:

                              (i)  the terms of the contract; and

                             (ii)  the manner in which and the extent to which the contract is carried out;

                            and is not limited to consideration of the circumstances relating to formation of the contract.

             (5)  In this section:

                    <a name="list-public-compani"></a>**_listed public company_** has the same meaning as it has in the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

##### <a id="12CC"></a>12CC  Matters the court may have regard to for the purposes of section 12CB

             (1)  Without limiting the matters to which the court may have regard for the purpose of determining whether a person (the **_supplier_**) has contravened section 12CB in connection with the supply or possible supply of financial services to a person (the **_service recipient_**), the court may have regard to:

                     (a)  the relative strengths of the bargaining positions of the supplier and the service recipient; and

                     (b)  whether, as a result of conduct engaged in by the supplier, the service recipient was required to comply with conditions that were not reasonably necessary for the protection of the legitimate interests of the supplier; and

                     (c)  whether the service recipient was able to understand any documents relating to the supply or possible supply of the financial services; and

                     (d)  whether any undue influence or pressure was exerted on, or any unfair tactics were used against, the service recipient or a person acting on behalf of the service recipient by the supplier or a person acting on behalf of the supplier in relation to the supply or possible supply of the financial services; and

                     (e)  the amount for which, and the circumstances under which, the service recipient could have acquired identical or equivalent financial services from a person other than the supplier; and

                      (f)  the extent to which the supplier’s conduct towards the service recipient was consistent with the supplier’s conduct in similar transactions between the supplier and other like service recipients; and

                     (g)  if the supplier is a corporation—the requirements of any applicable industry code (see subsection (3)); and

                     (h)  the requirements of any other industry code (see subsection (3)), if the service recipient acted on the reasonable belief that the supplier would comply with that code; and

                      (i)  the extent to which the supplier unreasonably failed to disclose to the service recipient:

                              (i)  any intended conduct of the supplier that might affect the interests of the service recipient; and

                             (ii)  any risks to the service recipient arising from the supplier’s intended conduct (being risks that the supplier should have foreseen would not be apparent to the service recipient); and

                      (j)  if there is a contract between the supplier and the service recipient for the supply of the financial services:

                              (i)  the extent to which the supplier was willing to negotiate the terms and conditions of the contract with the service recipient; and

                             (ii)  the terms and conditions of the contract; and

                     (k)  without limiting paragraph (j), whether the supplier has a contractual right to vary unilaterally a term or condition of a contract between the supplier and the service recipient for the supply of the financial services; and

                      (l)  the extent to which the supplier and the service recipient acted in good faith.

             (2)  Without limiting the matters to which the court may have regard for the purpose of determining whether a person (the **_acquirer_**) has contravened section 12CB in connection with the acquisition or possible acquisition of financial services from a person (the **_supplier_**), the court may have regard to:

                     (a)  the relative strengths of the bargaining positions of the acquirer and the supplier; and

                     (b)  whether, as a result of conduct engaged in by the acquirer, the supplier was required to comply with conditions that were not reasonably necessary for the protection of the legitimate interests of the acquirer; and

                     (c)  whether the supplier was able to understand any documents relating to the acquisition or possible acquisition of the financial services; and

                     (d)  whether any undue influence or pressure was exerted on, or any unfair tactics were used against, the supplier or a person acting on behalf of the supplier by the acquirer or a person acting on behalf of the acquirer in relation to the acquisition or possible acquisition of the financial services; and

                     (e)  the amount for which, and the circumstances in which, the supplier could have supplied identical or equivalent financial services to a person other than the acquirer; and

                              (i)  any intended conduct of the acquirer that might affect the interests of the supplier; and

                             (ii)  any risks to the supplier arising from the acquirer’s intended conduct (being risks that the acquirer should have foreseen would not be apparent to the supplier); and

                              (i)  the extent to which the acquirer was willing to negotiate the terms and conditions of the contract with the supplier; and

                             (ii)  the terms and conditions of the contract; and

             (3)  In this section:

                    <a name="applic-industri-code"></a>**_applicable industry code_**, in relation to a corporation, has the same meaning as it has in subsection 51ACA(1) of the _Competition and Consumer Act 2010_.

##### <a id="12DA"></a>12DA  Misleading or deceptive conduct

             (1)  A person must not, in trade or commerce, engage in conduct in relation to financial services that is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive.

          (1A)  Conduct:

             (2)  Nothing in sections 12DB to 12DN limits by implication the generality of subsection (1).

##### <a id="12DB"></a>12DB  False or misleading representations

#### Subdivision E—Conditions and warranties in consumer transactions

##### <a id="12EA"></a>12EA  Conflict of laws

                   If:

                     (a)  the proper law of a contract for the supply by a person of financial services to a consumer would, but for a term that it should be the law of some other country or a term to the like effect, be the law of any part of Australia; or

                     (b)  a contract for the supply by a person of financial services to a consumer contains a term that purports to substitute, or has the effect of substituting, provisions of the law of some other country, or of a State or Territory, for all or any of the provisions of this Subdivision (sections 12EA to 12ED);

this Subdivision applies to the contract notwithstanding that term.

##### <a id="12EB"></a>12EB  Application of provisions not to be excluded or modified

             (1)  A term of a contract (including a term that is not set out in the contract but is incorporated in the contract by another term of the contract) is void if it purports to exclude, restrict or modify or has the effect of excluding, restricting or modifying:

                     (a)  the application of all or any of the provisions of this Subdivision (sections 12EA to 12ED); or

                     (b)  the exercise of a right conferred by such a provision; or

                     (c)  any liability of the person for breach of a condition or warranty implied by such a provision.

             (2)  A term of a contract is not taken to exclude, restrict or modify the application of a provision of this Subdivision unless the term does so expressly or is inconsistent with that provision.

##### <a id="12EC"></a>12EC  Limitation of liability for breach of certain conditions or warranties

             (1)  Subject to this section, a term of a contract for the supply by a person (the **_supplier_**) of financial services other than services of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household use is not void under section 12EB merely because the term limits the liability of the supplier for a breach of a condition or warranty to:

                     (a)  the supplying of the services again; or

                     (b)  the payment of the cost of having the services supplied again.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to a term of a contract if the person to whom the services were supplied establishes that it is not fair or reasonable for the supplier to rely on that term of the contract.

             (3)  In determining for the purposes of subsection (2) whether or not reliance on a term of a contract is fair or reasonable, a court must have regard to all the circumstances of the case and, in particular, to the following matters:

                     (a)  the strength of the bargaining positions of the supplier and the person to whom the services were supplied (the **_buyer_**) relative to each other, taking into account, among other things, the availability of equivalent services and suitable alternative sources of supply;

                     (b)  whether the buyer received an inducement to agree to the term or, in agreeing to the term, had an opportunity to acquire the services or equivalent services from any source of supply under a contract that did not include that term;

                     (c)  whether the buyer knew or ought reasonably to have known of the existence and extent of the term (having regard, among other things, to any custom of the trade and any previous course of dealing between the parties).

##### <a id="12ED"></a>12ED  Warranties in relation to the supply of financial services

             (1)  In every contract for the supply of financial services by a person to a consumer in the course of a business, there is an implied warranty that:

                     (a)  the services will be rendered with due care and skill; and

                     (b)  any materials supplied in connection with those services will be reasonably fit for the purpose for which they are supplied.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  a person supplies financial services to a consumer in the course of a business; and

                     (b)  the consumer, expressly or by implication, makes known to the person:

                              (i)  any particular purpose for which the services are required; or

                             (ii)  the result that he or she desires the services to achieve;

there is an implied warranty that:

                     (c)  the services supplied under the contract for the supply of the services; and

                     (d)  any materials supplied in connection with those services;

will be reasonably fit for that purpose or are of such a nature and quality that they might reasonably be expected to achieve that result, except if the circumstances show that the consumer does not rely, or that it is unreasonable for him or her to rely, on the person’s skill or judgment.

          (2A)  If:

                     (a)  there is a breach of an implied warranty that exists because of this section in a contract made after the commencement of this subsection; and

                     (b)  the law of a State or Territory is the proper law of the contract;

the law of the State or Territory applies to limit or preclude liability for the breach, and recovery of that liability (if any), in the same way as it applies to limit or preclude liability, and recovery of a liability, for breach of another term of the contract.

             (3)  A reference in this section to financial services does not include a reference to services that are, or are to be, provided, granted or conferred under a contract of insurance.

#### Subdivision G—Enforcement and remedies

##### <a id="12GA"></a>12GA  Interpretation

                   In this Subdivision, unless the contrary intention appears:

                     (a)  a reference to the Court in relation to a matter is a reference to any court having jurisdiction in the matter; and

                     (b)  a reference to the Federal Court is a reference to the Federal Court of Australia; and

                     (c)  a reference to a judgment is a reference to a judgment, decree or order, whether final or interlocutory.

##### <a id="12GB"></a>12GB  Offences against Subdivision D

             (1)  A person who:

                     (a)  contravenes; or

                     (b)  aids, abets, counsels or procures a person to contravene; or

                     (c)  induces, or attempts to induce, a person whether by threats or promises or otherwise, to contravene; or

                     (d)  is in any way, directly or indirectly, knowingly concerned in, or party to, the contravention by a person of; or

                     (e)  conspires with others to contravene;

a provision of Subdivision D (sections 12DA to 12DN) other than section 12DA, is guilty of an offence punishable on conviction:

                      (f)  in the case of a person who is not a body corporate—by a fine not exceeding 2,000 penalty units; or

                     (g)  in the case of a person who is a body corporate—by a fine not exceeding 10,000 penalty units.

          (1A)  Subsections 11.2(2) to (5) (inclusive) of the _Criminal Code_ apply in relation to paragraph (1)(b) of this section in the same way that they apply in relation to subsection 11.2(1) of the _Criminal Code_.

          (1B)  Subsections 11.5(2) to (5) (inclusive) of the _Criminal Code_ apply in relation to paragraph (1)(e) of this section in the same way that they apply in relation to the offence of conspiracy under subsection 11.5(1) of the _Criminal Code_.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  a person is convicted of 2 or more offences constituted by, or relating to, contraventions of the same provision of Subdivision D (sections 12DA to 12DN); and

                     (b)  the contraventions appear to the Court to have been of the same nature or a substantially similar nature and to have occurred at or about the same time;

the Court must not, in respect of the offences, impose on the person fines that, in the aggregate, exceed the maximum fine that would be applicable in respect of one offence by that person against that provision. This applies whether or not the person is also convicted of an offence or offences constituted by, or relating to, another contravention or other contraventions of that provision that were of a different nature or occurred at a different time.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  a person is convicted of an offence constituted by, or relating to, a contravention of a provision of Subdivision D (sections 12DA to 12DN); and

                     (b)  a fine has, or fines have, previously been imposed on the person by the Court for an offence or offences constituted by, or relating to, another contravention or other contraventions of the same provision, being a contravention that, or contraventions each of which, appears to the Court to have been of the same nature as, or of a substantially similar nature to, and to have occurred at or about the same time as, the contravention referred to in paragraph (a);

the Court must not, in respect of the offence referred to in paragraph (a), impose on the person a fine that exceeds the amount (if any) by which the maximum fine applicable (under subsection (1)) in respect of the offence referred to in paragraph (a) is greater than the amount of the fine, or the sum of the amounts of the fines, referred to in paragraph (b). This applies whether or not a fine has, or fines have, also previously been imposed on the person for an offence or offences constituted by, or relating to, a contravention or contraventions of that provision that were of a different nature or occurred at a different time.

             (4)  In proceedings under this section against a person for contravening a provision of Subdivision D (sections 12DA to 12DN), the Court may:

                     (a)  grant an injunction under section 12GD against the person in relation to:

                              (i)  the conduct that constitutes, or is alleged to constitute, the contravention; or

                             (ii)  other conduct of that kind; or

                     (b)  make an order under section 12GLA (non‑punitive orders) in relation to the contravention; or

                     (c)  make an order under section 12GLB (punitive orders requiring adverse publicity) in relation to the contravention.

             (5)  Sections 11.1, 11.2, 11.3, and 11.4 of the _Criminal Code_ and section 11.6 of the _Criminal Code_ to the extent that it applies in relation to those sections, do not apply in relation to an offence against subsection (1).

             (6)  A prosecution for an offence against subsection (1) may be commenced within 3 years after the commission of the offence.

##### <a id="12GBA"></a>12GBA  Pecuniary penalties

             (1)  If the Court is satisfied that a person:

                     (a)  has contravened a provision of Subdivision C, D or GC (other than section 12DA); or

                     (b)  has attempted to contravene such a provision; or

                     (c)  has aided, abetted, counselled or procured a person to contravene such a provision; or

                     (d)  has induced, or attempted to induce, a person, whether by threats or promises or otherwise, to contravene such a provision; or

                     (e)  has been in any way, directly or indirectly, knowingly concerned in, or party to, the contravention by a person of such a provision; or

                      (f)  has conspired with others to contravene such a provision;

the Court may order the person to pay to the Commonwealth such pecuniary penalty, in respect of each act or omission by the person to which this section applies, as the Court determines to be appropriate.

             (2)  In determining the appropriate pecuniary penalty, the Court must have regard to all relevant matters including:

                     (a)  the nature and extent of the act or omission and of any loss or damage suffered as a result of the act or omission; and

                     (b)  the circumstances in which the act or omission took place; and

                     (c)  whether the person has previously been found by the Court in proceedings under this Subdivision to have engaged in any similar conduct.

                     (a)  a proceeding may be instituted under this Act against a person in relation to the contravention of any one or more of the provisions; but

                     (b)  a person is not liable to more than one pecuniary penalty under this section in respect of the same conduct.

##### <a id="12GBB"></a>12GBB  Pecuniary penalties and offences

             (1)  The Court must not make an order under section 12GBA against a person in relation to either of the following matters (a **_consumer protection breach_**):

                     (a)  a contravention of a provision referred to in paragraph 12GBA(1)(a);

                     (b)  conduct referred to in paragraph 12GBA(1)(b), (c), (d), (e) or (f) that relates to a contravention of a provision referred to in paragraph 12GBA(1)(a);

if the person has been convicted of an offence constituted by conduct that is substantially the same as the conduct constituting the consumer protection breach.

             (2)  Proceedings for an order under section 12GBA against a person in relation to a consumer protection breach are stayed if:

                     (a)  criminal proceedings are started or have already been started against the person for an offence; and

                     (b)  the offence is constituted by conduct that is substantially the same as the conduct alleged to constitute the consumer protection breach.

The proceedings for the order may be resumed if the person is not convicted of the offence. Otherwise, the proceedings are dismissed.

             (3)  Criminal proceedings may be started against a person for conduct that is substantially the same as conduct constituting a consumer protection breach regardless of whether an order under section 12GBA has been made against the person in respect of the breach.

             (4)  Evidence of information given, or evidence of production of documents, by an individual is not admissible in criminal proceedings against the individual if:

                     (a)  the individual previously gave the evidence or produced the documents in proceedings for an order under section 12GBA against the individual in relation to a consumer protection breach (whether or not the order was made); and

                     (b)  the conduct alleged to constitute the offence is substantially the same as the conduct that was claimed to constitute the consumer protection breach.

However, this does not apply to a criminal proceeding in respect of the falsity of the evidence given by the individual in the proceedings for the order.

##### <a id="12GBC"></a>12GBC  Civil action for recovery of pecuniary penalties

             (1)  ASIC may institute a proceeding in the Court for the recovery on behalf of the Commonwealth of a pecuniary penalty referred to in section 12GBA.

             (3)  Subsection (1) does not authorise anything that would otherwise be unlawful.

Indemnities are void

             (4)  Anything that purports to indemnify a person against a liability is void to the extent that it contravenes subsection (1).

Application of this section to a person other than a body corporate

             (5)  If, as a result of the operation of Part 2.4 of the _Criminal Code_, a person other than a body corporate is:

                     (a)  convicted of an offence (the **_relevant offence_**) against subsection (1) of this section; or

                     (b)  convicted of an offence (the **_relevant offence_**) against section 11.4 of the _Criminal Code_ in relation to an offence referred to in subsection (1) of this section;

the relevant offence is taken to be punishable on conviction by a fine not exceeding 5 penalty units.

##### <a id="12GC"></a>12GC  Enforcement and recovery of certain fines

             (1)  If a person on whom a fine has been imposed for an offence against section 12GB or subsection 12GN(5) defaults in payment of the fine, a Court may:

                     (a)  exercise any power that the Court has apart from this section with respect to the enforcement and recovery of fines imposed by the Court; or

                     (b)  make an order, on the application of the Minister or ASIC, declaring that the fine is to have effect, and may be enforced, as if it were a judgment debt under a judgment of the Court.

             (2)  If a person in relation to whom an order is made under subsection (1) in respect of a fine gives security for the payment of the fine, the Court must cancel the order in respect of the fine.

             (3)  If the Court makes an order in relation to a person in respect of a fine, the Court may, at any time before the order is executed in respect of the fine, allow the person a specified time in which to pay the fine or allow the person to pay the fine by specified instalments, and, in that case:

                     (a)  the order must not be executed unless the person fails to pay the fine within that time or fails to pay an instalment at or before the time when it becomes payable, as the case may be; and

                     (b)  if the person pays the fine within that time or pays all the instalments, as the case may be, the order is taken to have been discharged in respect of the fine.

             (4)  Subject to subsection (7), an order under subsection (1) in respect of a fine ceases to have effect:

                     (a)  on payment of the fine; or

                     (b)  if the fine is not paid—on full compliance with the order.

             (5)  The term of a sentence of imprisonment imposed by an order under a law of a State or Territory applied by section 15A of the _Crimes Act 1914_ in respect of a fine must be calculated at the rate of one day’s imprisonment for each $25 of the amount of the fine that is from time to time unpaid.

             (6)  Subject to subsection (7), if a person is required to serve periods of imprisonment under an order or orders under subsection (1) in respect of 2 or more fines, those periods of imprisonment must be served consecutively.

             (7)  Subject to subsection (8), if:

                     (a)  a person would, but for this subsection, be required under an order or orders under subsection (1) in respect of 3 or more fines to serve periods of imprisonment in respect of those fines exceeding in the aggregate 3 years; and

                     (b)  those fines were imposed (whether or not in the same proceedings) for offences constituted by contraventions that occurred within a period of 2 years, being contraventions that appear to the Court to have been of the same nature or a substantially similar nature;

the Court must, by order, declare that the order or orders are to cease to have effect in respect of those fines after the person has served an aggregate of 3 years’ imprisonment in respect of those fines.

             (8)  If subsection (7) would, but for this subsection, apply to a person with respect to offences committed by the person within 2 or more overlapping periods of 2 years, the Court must make an order under that subsection with respect to one only of those periods, being whichever period would give the person the maximum benefit from the application of that subsection.

             (9)  For the purposes of subsection (8), the Court may vary or revoke an order made under subsection (7).

           (10)  Paragraphs 15A(1)(b), (c) and (d) of the _Crimes Act 1914_ do not apply with respect to fines referred to in subsection (1).

##### <a id="12GCA"></a>12GCA  Preference must be given to compensation for victims

                   If:

                     (a)  the Court considers that it is appropriate:

                              (i)  to impose a fine under section 12GB on a person (the **_defendant_**); or

                             (ii)  to order a person (the **_defendant_**) to pay a pecuniary penalty under section 12GBA;

                            in respect of a contravention, or an involvement in a contravention, of this Division; and

                     (b)  it is appropriate to order the defendant to pay compensation to a person who has suffered loss or damage in respect of the contravention or the involvement; and

                     (c)  the defendant does not have sufficient financial resources to pay both the pecuniary penalty or fine and the compensation;

the Court must give preference to making an order for compensation.

##### <a id="12GD"></a>12GD  Injunctions

             (1)  If, on the application of the Minister, ASIC or any other person, the Court is satisfied that a person has engaged, or is proposing to engage, in conduct that constitutes or would constitute:

                     (a)  a contravention of a provision of this Division; or

                     (b)  attempting to contravene such a provision; or

                     (c)  aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring a person to contravene such a provision; or

                     (d)  inducing, or attempting to induce, whether by threats, promises or otherwise, a person to contravene such a provision; or

                     (e)  being in any way, directly or indirectly, knowingly concerned in, or party to, the contravention by a person of such a provision; or

                      (f)  conspiring with others to contravene such a provision;

the Court may grant an injunction in such terms as the Court determines to be appropriate.

             (2)  If an application for an injunction under subsection (1) has been made, the Court may, if the Court determines it to be appropriate, grant an injunction by consent of all the parties to the proceedings, whether or not the Court is satisfied that a person has engaged, or is proposing to engage, in conduct of a kind mentioned in subsection (1).

             (3)  If in the opinion of the Court it is desirable to do so, the Court may grant an interim injunction pending determination of an application under subsection (1).

             (4)  The Court may rescind or vary an injunction granted under subsection (1) or (3).

             (5)  The power of the Court to grant an injunction restraining a person from engaging in conduct may be exercised:

                     (a)  whether or not it appears to the Court that the person intends to engage again, or to continue to engage, in conduct of that kind; and

                     (b)  whether or not the person has previously engaged in conduct of that kind; and

                     (c)  whether or not there is an imminent danger of substantial damage to any person if the first‑mentioned person engages in conduct of that kind.

             (6)  The power of the Court to grant an injunction requiring a person to do an act or thing may be exercised:

                     (a)  whether or not it appears to the Court that the person intends to refuse or fail again, or to continue to refuse or fail, to do that act or thing; and

                     (b)  whether or not the person has previously refused or failed to do that act or thing; and

                     (c)  whether or not there is an imminent danger of substantial damage to any person if the first‑mentioned person refuses or fails to do that act or thing.

             (7)  If the Minister or ASIC makes an application to the Court for the grant of an injunction under this section, the Court must not require the applicant or any other person, as a condition of granting an interim injunction, to give any undertakings as to damages.

             (8)  If, in a case to which subsection (7) does not apply:

                     (a)  the Court would, but for this subsection, require a person to give an undertaking as to damages or costs; and

                     (b)  the Minister gives the undertaking;

the Court must accept the undertaking by the Minister and must not require a further undertaking from any other person.

             (9)  A reference in this section to a contravention of a provision of this Division includes a reference to applying or relying on, or purporting to apply or rely on, a term of a consumer contract that the Court has declared under section 12GND to be an unfair term.

##### <a id="12GF"></a>12GF  Actions for damages

             (1)  A person who suffers loss or damage by conduct of another person that contravenes a provision of Subdivision C (sections 12CA to 12CC) or Subdivision D (sections 12DA to 12DN) may recover the amount of the loss or damage by action against that other person or against any person involved in the contravention.

          (1A)  Subsection (1) has effect subject to section 12GNA.

Note:          Section 12GNA may limit the amount that the person may recover for a contravention of section 12DA (Misleading or deceptive conduct) from the other person or from another person involved in the contravention.

          (1B)  Despite subsection (1), if:

                     (a)  a person (the **_claimant_**) makes a claim under subsection (1) in relation to:

                              (i)  economic loss; or

                             (ii)  damage to property;

                            caused by conduct of another person (the **_defendant_**) that was done in contravention of section 12DA; and

                     (b)  the claimant suffered the loss or damage:

                              (i)  as a result partly of the claimant’s failure to take reasonable care; and

                             (ii)  as a result partly of the conduct referred to in paragraph (a); and

                     (c)  the defendant:

                              (i)  did not intend to cause the loss or damage; and

                             (ii)  did not fraudulently cause the loss or damage;

the damages that the claimant may recover in relation to the loss or damage are to be reduced to the extent to which the court thinks just and equitable having regard to the claimant’s share in the responsibility for the loss or damage.

Note:          Subdivision GA also applies proportionate liability to a claim for damages under this section for a contravention of section 12DA.

             (2)  An action under subsection (1) may be commenced within 6 years after the day on which the cause of action that relates to the conduct accrued.

                   In a proceeding against a person under section 12GF or in an application under subsection 12GM(2) or 12GNB(1) for an order against a person, a finding of any fact by a court made in proceedings under section 12GBC, 12GD, 12GLA or 12GLB, or for an offence against section 12GB, in which that person has been found to have contravened, or to have been involved in a contravention of, a provision of this Division is prima facie evidence of that fact. The finding may be proved by production of a document under the seal of the court from which the finding appears.

##### <a id="12GH"></a>12GH  Conduct by directors, employees or agents

             (1)  If, in a proceeding under this Subdivision in respect of conduct engaged in by a body corporate, being conduct in relation to which the Division applies, it is necessary to establish the state of mind of the body corporate, it is sufficient to show that a director, employee or agent of the body corporate, being a director, employee or agent by whom the conduct was engaged in within the scope of the person’s actual or apparent authority, had that state of mind.

             (2)  Any conduct engaged in on behalf of a body corporate:

                     (a)  by a director, employee or agent of the body corporate within the scope of the person’s actual or apparent authority; or

                     (b)  by any other person at the direction or with the consent or agreement (whether express or implied) of a director, employee or agent of the body corporate, if the giving of the direction, consent or agreement is within the scope of the actual or apparent authority of the director, employee or agent;

is taken, for the purposes of this Division, to have been engaged in also by the body corporate.

             (3)  If, in a proceeding under this Subdivision in respect of conduct engaged in by a person other than a body corporate, being conduct in relation to which a provision of this Division applies, it is necessary to establish the state of mind of the person, it is sufficient to show that an employee or agent of the person, being an employee or agent by whom the conduct was engaged in within the scope of the employee’s or agent’s actual or apparent authority, had that state of mind.

             (4)  Conduct engaged in on behalf of a person (the **_principal_**) other than a body corporate:

                     (a)  by an employee or agent of the person within the scope of the actual or apparent authority of the employee or agent; or

                     (b)  by any other person at the direction or with the consent or agreement (whether express or implied) of an employee or agent of the principal, if the giving of the direction, consent or agreement is within the scope of the actual or apparent authority of the employee or agent;

is taken, for the purposes of this Division, to have been engaged in also by the principal.

             (5)  A reference in this section to the state of mind of a person includes a reference to the knowledge, intention, opinion, belief or purpose of the person and the person’s reasons for the person’s intention, opinion, belief or purpose.

             (6)  Part 2.5 of the _Criminal Code_ does not apply in relation to an offence against a provision of this Subdivision.

##### <a id="12GI"></a>12GI  Defences

             (1)  Subject to subsection (3), in a prosecution under this Subdivision in relation to a contravention of a provision of Subdivision D (sections 12DA to 12DN), it is a defence if the defendant establishes:

                     (a)  that the contravention in respect of which the proceeding was instituted was due to reasonable mistake; or

                     (b)  that the contravention in respect of which the proceeding was instituted was due to reasonable reliance on information supplied by another person; or

                     (c)  that:

                              (i)  the contravention in respect of which the proceeding was instituted was due to the act or default of another person, to an accident or to some other cause beyond the defendant’s control; and

                             (ii)  the defendant took reasonable precautions and exercised due diligence to avoid the contravention.

Note:          A defendant bears a legal burden in relation to the matters in subsection (1) (see section 13.4 of the _Criminal Code_).

          (1A)  Paragraph (1)(a) is to be interpreted as having the same effect in relation to a contravention of a provision of this Subdivision as section 9.2 of the _Criminal Code_ has in relation to offences of strict liability.

             (2)  In paragraphs (1)(b) and (c), **_another person_** does not include a person who was:

                     (a)  an employee or agent of the defendant; or

                     (b)  in the case of a defendant being a body corporate, a director, employee or agent of the defendant;

at the time when the contravention occurred.

             (3)  If a defence provided by subsection (1) involves an allegation that a contravention was due to reliance on information supplied by another person or to the act or default of another person, the defendant is not, without leave of the Court, entitled to rely on that defence unless he or she has, not later than 7 days before the day on which the hearing of the proceeding commences, served on the person by whom the proceeding was instituted a notice in writing giving such information that would identify or assist in the identification of the other person as was then in his or her possession.

             (4)  In a proceeding under this Subdivision in relation to a contravention of a provision of Subdivision D (sections 12DA to 12DN) committed by the publication of an advertisement, it is a defence if the defendant establishes that he or she is a person whose business it is to publish or arrange for the publication of advertisements and that he or she received the advertisement for publication in the ordinary course of business and did not know and had no reason to suspect that its publication would amount to a contravention of a provision of Subdivision D.

Note:          A defendant bears a legal burden in relation to the matters in subsection (4) (see section 13.4 of the _Criminal Code_).

             (5)  If, in proceedings under section 12GBA against a person other than a body corporate, it appears to the Court that the person has, or may have:

                     (a)  engaged in conduct in contravention of a provision referred to in paragraph (1)(a) of that section; or

                     (b)  engaged in conduct referred to in paragraph (1)(b), (c), (d), (e) or (f) of that section that relates to a contravention of such a provision;

but that the person acted honestly and reasonably and, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, ought fairly to be excused, the Court may relieve the person either wholly or partly from liability to pay a pecuniary penalty under that section.

##### <a id="12GJ"></a>12GJ  Jurisdiction of courts

             (1)  Jurisdiction is conferred on the Federal Court in any matter:

                     (a)  arising under this Division; or

in respect of which a civil proceeding is instituted under this Subdivision or under Part 3 as so applying:

                     (c)  the several courts of the States are invested with federal jurisdiction within the limits of their several jurisdictions, whether those limits are as to locality, subject‑matter or otherwise; and

                     (d)  subject to the Constitution, jurisdiction is conferred on the several courts of the Territories.

             (3)  Nothing in subsection (2) is taken to enable an inferior court of a State or Territory to grant a remedy other than a remedy of a kind that the court is able to grant under the law of that State or Territory.

             (4)  The jurisdiction conferred by subsection (1) on the Federal Court is exclusive of the jurisdiction of any other court other than the jurisdiction of the several courts of the States and Territories under subsection (2) and the jurisdiction of the High Court under section 75 of the Constitution.

             (2)  The Federal Court must not transfer a matter to another court under subsection (1) unless the other court has power to grant the remedies sought before the Federal Court in the matter and it appears to the Federal Court that:

                     (a)  the matter arises out of or is related to a proceeding that is pending in the other court; or

                     (b)  it is otherwise in the interests of justice that the matter be determined by the other court.

             (3)  If the Federal Court transfers a matter to another court under subsection (1):

                     (a)  further proceedings in the matter must be as directed by the other court; and

                     (b)  the judgment of the other court in the matter is enforceable throughout Australia and the external Territories as if it were a judgment of the Federal Court.

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  a proceeding is pending in a court (other than the Supreme Court) of a State or Territory; and

                     (b)  a matter for determination in the proceeding arose under:

                              (i)  this Division; or

                             (ii)  Part 3 in its application in relation to an investigation of a contravention of this Division;

the court must, if directed to do so by the Federal Court, transfer to the Federal Court the matter and such other matters for determination in the proceeding, as the Federal Court decides, the determination of which would, apart from any law of a State or of the Northern Territory relating to cross‑vesting of jurisdiction, be within the jurisdiction of the Federal Court.

             (5)  If:

                     (a)  a proceeding is pending in a court (other than the Supreme Court) of a State or Territory; and

                     (b)  a matter for determination in the proceeding arose under:

                              (i)  this Division; or

                             (ii)  Part 3 in its application in relation to an investigation of a contravention of this Division;

the court may, subject to subsection (6), upon the application of a party or of the court’s own motion, transfer the matter to a court (other than the Supreme Court) of a State or Territory other than the State or Territory referred to in paragraph (a).

             (6)  The court must not transfer the matter to another court under subsection (5) unless the other court has power to grant the remedies sought in the matter and it appears to the court that:

                     (a)  the matter arises out of or is related to a proceeding that is pending in the other court; or

                     (b)  it is otherwise in the interests of justice that the matter be determined by the other court.

             (7)  If a court transfers a matter to another court under subsection (5), further proceedings in the matter must be as directed by the other court.

##### <a id="12GL"></a>12GL  Transfer of certain proceedings to Family Court

                              (i)  that are associated with matters arising in the proceeding; or

                             (ii)  that, apart from subsection 32(1) of the _Federal Court of Australia Act 1976_, the Federal Court would have had jurisdiction to hear and determine in the proceeding; and

                     (c)  the Family Court may, in and in relation to the proceeding:

                     (d)  remedies, orders and writs granted, made or issued by the Family Court in and in relation to the proceeding have effect, and may be enforced by the Family Court, as if they had been granted, made or issued by the Federal Court; and

                     (e)  appeals lie from judgments of the Family Court given in and in relation to the proceeding as if the judgments were judgments of the Federal Court constituted by a single Judge of that Court, and do not otherwise lie; and

                      (f)  subject to paragraphs (a) to (e) (inclusive), this Division, the regulations, the _Federal Court of Australia Act 1976_, the Rules of Court made under that Act, and other laws of the Commonwealth, apply in and in relation to the proceeding as if:

##### <a id="12GNA"></a>12GNA  Limit on liability for misleading or deceptive conduct

State or Territory professional standards law limits liability

             (1)  A professional standards law of a State, the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory applies to limit occupational liability relating to an action for contravention of section 12DA in the same way as it limits occupational liability arising under a law of the State or Territory.

Note:          Section 12DA prohibits misleading or deceptive conduct by a person in relation to financial services.

             (2)  However, the professional standards law applies for that purpose:

                     (a)  only in relation to a scheme that was prescribed by the regulations at the time (the **_contravention time_**) of the contravention; and

                     (b)  as if the scheme were in force under that law at the contravention time in the form the scheme would have been in if:

                              (i)  the scheme had not been amended or revoked under that law since the scheme was first prescribed; and

                             (ii)  the modifications (if any) prescribed by the regulations at the contravention time had been made to the scheme.

Which State’s or Territory’s professional standards law applies?

             (3)  For the purposes of working out whether a professional standards law of a particular State or Territory applies under subsection (1) in relation to a particular contravention of section 12DA, choice of law rules operate in relation to the contravention in the same way as they operate in relation to a tort.

Definitions

             (4)  In this section:

                    <a name="modif"></a>**_modifications_** includes additions, omissions and substitutions.

                    <a name="occup"></a>**_occupation_** includes profession and trade.

                    <a name="occup-associ"></a>**_occupational association_** means a body:

                     (a)  that represents the interests of persons who have the same occupation; and

                     (b)  whose membership is limited principally to such persons.

                    <a name="occup-liabil"></a>**_occupational liability_** means civil liability arising directly or vicariously from anything done or omitted by a member of an occupational association in the course of his or her occupation.

                    <a name="profession-standard-law"></a>**_professional standards law_** means a law providing for the limitation of occupational liability by reference to schemes for limiting that liability that were formulated and published in accordance with that law.

                             (ii)  is a party to a consumer contract who is advantaged by a term (the **_declared term_**) of the contract in relation to which the Court has made a declaration under section 12GND; and

                     (b)  the contravening conduct or declared term caused, or is likely to cause, a class of persons to suffer loss or damage; and

                     (c)  the class includes persons who are non‑party consumers in relation to the contravening conduct or declared term;

the Court may, on the application of ASIC, make such order or orders (other than an award of damages) as the Court thinks appropriate against a person referred to in subsection (2) of this section.

Note:          The orders that the Court may make include all or any of the orders set out in section 12GNC.

                     (b)  if subparagraph (1)(a)(ii) applies—the declaration is made.

Determining whether to make an order

             (6)  In determining whether to make an order under subsection (1) against a person referred to in paragraph (2)(a), the Court may have regard to the conduct of the person, and of the non‑party consumers in relation to the contravening conduct, since the contravention occurred.

             (7)  In determining whether to make an order under subsection (1) against a person referred to in paragraph (2)(b), the Court may have regard to the conduct of the person, and of the non‑party consumers in relation to the declared term, since the declaration was made.

             (8)  In determining whether to make an order under subsection (1), the Court need not make a finding about either of the following matters:

                     (a)  which persons are non‑party consumers in relation to the contravening conduct or declared term;

                     (b)  the nature of the loss or damage suffered, or likely to be suffered, by such persons.

When a non‑party consumer is bound by an order etc.

             (9)  If:

                     (a)  an order is made under subsection (1) against a person; and

                     (b)  the loss or damage suffered, or likely to be suffered, by a non‑party consumer in relation to the contravening conduct, or declared term, to which the order relates has been redressed, prevented or reduced in accordance with the order; and

                     (c)  the non‑party consumer has accepted the redress, prevention or reduction;

then:

                     (d)  the non‑party consumer is bound by the order; and

                     (e)  any other order made under subsection (1) that relates to that loss or damage has no effect in relation to the non‑party consumer; and

                      (f)  despite any other provision of this Act or any other law of the Commonwealth, or a State or Territory, no claim, action or demand may be made or taken against the person by the non‑party consumer in relation to that loss or damage.

Other

           (10)  Subsection (1) has effect subject to section 12GNA.

Note:          Section 12GNA may limit the liability, under an order made under subsection (1) of this section, of a person for his or her contravention of section 12DA (which is about misleading or deceptive conduct) or involvement in such a contravention.

           (11)  This section does not apply in relation to contravening conduct that occurred before the commencement of this section.

##### <a id="12GNC"></a>12GNC  Kinds of orders that may be made to redress loss or damage suffered by non‑party consumers etc.

#### Subdivision GA—Proportionate liability for misleading and deceptive conduct

##### <a id="12GP"></a>12GP  Application of Subdivision

             (1)  This Subdivision applies to a claim (an **_apportionable claim_**) if the claim is a claim for damages made under section 12GF for:

                     (a)  economic loss; or

                     (b)  damage to property;

caused by conduct that was done in a contravention of section 12DA.

             (2)  For the purposes of this Subdivision, there is a single apportionable claim in proceedings in respect of the same loss or damage even if the claim for the loss or damage is based on more than one cause of action (whether or not of the same or a different kind).

             (3)  In this Subdivision, a **_concurrent wrongdoer_**, in relation to a claim, is a person who is one of 2 or more persons whose acts or omissions (or act or omission) caused, independently of each other or jointly, the damage or loss that is the subject of the claim.

             (4)  For the purposes of this Subdivision, apportionable claims are limited to those claims specified in subsection (1).

             (5)  For the purposes of this Subdivision, it does not matter that a concurrent wrongdoer is insolvent, is being wound up or has ceased to exist or died.

##### <a id="12GQ"></a>12GQ  Certain concurrent wrongdoers not to have benefit of apportionment

             (1)  Nothing in this Subdivision operates to exclude the liability of a concurrent wrongdoer (an **_excluded concurrent wrongdoer_**) in proceedings involving an apportionable claim if:

                     (a)  the concurrent wrongdoer intended to cause the economic loss or damage to property that is the subject of the claim; or

                     (b)  the concurrent wrongdoer fraudulently caused the economic loss or damage to property that is the subject of the claim.

             (2)  The liability of an excluded concurrent wrongdoer is to be determined in accordance with the legal rules (if any) that (apart from this Subdivision) are relevant.

             (3)  The liability of any other concurrent wrongdoer who is not an excluded concurrent wrongdoer is to be determined in accordance with the provisions of this Subdivision.

##### <a id="12GR"></a>12GR  Proportionate liability for apportionable claims

             (1)  In any proceedings involving an apportionable claim:

                     (a)  the liability of a defendant who is a concurrent wrongdoer in relation to that claim is limited to an amount reflecting that proportion of the damage or loss claimed that the court considers just having regard to the extent of the defendant’s responsibility for the damage or loss; and

                     (b)  the court may give judgment against the defendant for not more than that amount.

             (2)  If the proceedings involve both an apportionable claim and a claim that is not an apportionable claim:

                     (a)  liability for the apportionable claim is to be determined in accordance with the provisions of this Subdivision; and

                     (b)  liability for the other claim is to be determined in accordance with the legal rules, if any, that (apart from this Subdivision) are relevant.

             (3)  In apportioning responsibility between defendants in the proceedings:

                     (a)  the court is to exclude that proportion of the damage or loss in relation to which the plaintiff is contributorily negligent under any relevant law; and

                     (b)  the court may have regard to the comparative responsibility of any concurrent wrongdoer who is not a party to the proceedings.

             (4)  This section applies in proceedings involving an apportionable claim whether or not all concurrent wrongdoers are parties to the proceedings.

             (5)  A reference in this Subdivision to a defendant in proceedings includes any person joined as a defendant or other party in the proceedings (except as a plaintiff) whether joined under this Subdivision, under rules of court or otherwise.

##### <a id="12GS"></a>12GS  Defendant to notify plaintiff of concurrent wrongdoer of whom defendant is aware

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a defendant in proceedings involving an apportionable claim has reasonable grounds to believe that a particular person (the **_other person_)**may be a concurrent wrongdoer in relation to the claim; and

                     (b)  the defendant fails to give the plaintiff, as soon as practicable, written notice of the information that the defendant has about:

                              (i)  the identity of the other person; and

                             (ii)  the circumstances that may make the other person a concurrent wrongdoer in relation to the claim; and

                     (c)  the plaintiff unnecessarily incurs costs in the proceedings because the plaintiff was not aware that the other person may be a concurrent wrongdoer in relation to the claim;

the court hearing the proceedings may order that the defendant pay all or any of those costs of the plaintiff.

             (2)  The court may order that the costs to be paid by the defendant be assessed on an indemnity basis or otherwise.

##### <a id="12GT"></a>12GT  Contribution not recoverable from defendant

                   A defendant against whom judgment is given under this Subdivision as a concurrent wrongdoer in relation to an apportionable claim:

                     (a)  cannot be required to contribute to any damages or contribution recovered from another concurrent wrongdoer in respect of the apportionable claim (whether or not the damages or contribution are recovered in the same proceedings in which judgment is given against the defendant); and

                     (b)  cannot be required to indemnify any such wrongdoer.

##### <a id="12GU"></a>12GU  Subsequent actions

             (1)  In relation to an apportionable claim, nothing in this Subdivision or any other law prevents a plaintiff who has previously recovered judgment against a concurrent wrongdoer for an apportionable part of any damage or loss from bringing another action against any other concurrent wrongdoer for that damage or loss.

             (2)  However, in any proceedings in respect of any such action, the plaintiff cannot recover an amount of damages that, having regard to any damages previously recovered by the plaintiff in respect of the damage or loss, would result in the plaintiff receiving compensation for damage or loss that is greater than the damage or loss actually sustained by the plaintiff.

##### <a id="12GV"></a>12GV  Joining non‑party concurrent wrongdoer in the action

             (1)  The court may give leave for any one or more persons to be joined as defendants in proceedings involving an apportionable claim.

             (2)  The court is not to give leave for the joinder of any person who was a party to any previously concluded proceedings in respect of the apportionable claim.

##### <a id="12GW"></a>12GW  Application of Subdivision

                   Nothing in this Subdivision:

                     (a)  prevents a person being held vicariously liable for a proportion of an apportionable claim for which another person is liable; or

                     (b)  prevents a partner from being held severally liable with another partner for that proportion of an apportionable claim for which the other partner is liable; or

                     (c)  affects the operation of any other Act to the extent that it imposes several liability on any person in respect of what would otherwise be an apportionable claim.

#### Subdivision GB—Infringement notices

##### <a id="12GX"></a>12GX  Purpose and effect of this Subdivision

             (1)  The purpose of this Subdivision is to provide for the issue of an infringement notice to a person for an alleged contravention of an infringement notice provision as an alternative to proceedings for an order under section 12GBA.

             (2)  This Subdivision does not:

                     (a)  require an infringement notice to be issued to a person for an alleged contravention of an infringement notice provision; or

                     (b)  affect the liability of a person to proceedings under Subdivision G (sections 12GA to 12GO) in relation to an alleged contravention of an infringement notice provision if:

                              (i)  an infringement notice is not issued to the person for the alleged contravention; or

                             (ii)  an infringement notice issued to a person for the alleged contravention is withdrawn under section 12GXG; or

                     (c)  prevent a Court from imposing a higher penalty than the penalty specified in the infringement notice if the person does not comply with the notice.

##### <a id="12GXA"></a>12GXA  Issue of an infringement notice

             (1)  If ASIC has reasonable grounds to believe that a person has contravened an infringement notice provision, ASIC may issue an infringement notice to the person.

             (2)  ASIC must not issue more than one infringement notice to the person for the same alleged contravention of the infringement notice provision.

             (3)  The infringement notice does not have any effect if the notice:

                     (a)  is issued more than 12 months after the day on which the contravention of the infringement notice provision is alleged to have occurred; or

                     (b)  relates to more than one alleged contravention of an infringement notice provision by the person.

##### <a id="12GXB"></a>12GXB  Matters to be included in an infringement notice

                   An infringement notice must:

                     (a)  be identified by a unique number; and

                     (b)  state the day on which it is issued; and

                     (c)  state the name and address of the person to whom it is issued; and

                     (d)  state that it is being issued by ASIC; and

                     (e)  state how ASIC may be contacted; and

                      (f)  give details of the alleged contravention by the person, including:

                             (ii)  the particular infringement notice provision that was allegedly contravened; and

                     (g)  state the maximum pecuniary penalty that the Court could order the person to pay under section 12GBA for the alleged contravention; and

                     (h)  specify the penalty that is payable in relation to the alleged contravention; and

                      (j)  state that the penalty is payable to ASIC on behalf of the Commonwealth; and

                     (k)  explain how payment of the penalty is to be made; and

                      (l)  explain the effect of sections 12GXD, 12GXE, 12GXF and 12GXG.

##### <a id="12GXC"></a>12GXC  Amount of penalty

                   The penalty to be specified in an infringement notice that is to be issued to a person must be a pecuniary penalty equal to the number of penalty units worked out using the following table:

                     (c)  the infringement notice is not withdrawn under section 12GXG.

             (2)  The person is not, merely because of the payment, regarded as:

                     (a)  having contravened the infringement notice provision; or

                     (b)  having been convicted of an offence constituted by the same conduct that constituted the alleged contravention of the infringement notice provision.

             (3)  No proceedings (whether criminal or civil) may be started or continued against the person by, or on behalf of, the Commonwealth or ASIC in relation to:

                     (a)  the alleged contravention of the infringement notice provision; or

             (4)  Notice of the extension must be given to the person who was issued the infringement notice.

             (5)  A failure to comply with subsection (4) does not affect the validity of the extension.

             (6)  If ASIC extends the infringement notice compliance period for an infringement notice, a reference in this Act to the infringement notice compliance period for an infringement notice is taken to be a reference to the infringement notice compliance period as so extended.

##### <a id="12GXG"></a>12GXG  Withdrawal of an infringement notice

### Division 9—Evidentiary use of certain material

##### <a id="76"></a>76  Statements made at an examination: proceedings against examinee

             (1)  A statement that a person makes at an examination of the person is admissible in evidence against the person in a proceeding unless:

                     (a)  because of subsection 68(3), the statement is not admissible in evidence against the person in the proceeding; or

                     (b)  the statement is not relevant to the proceeding and the person objects to the admission of evidence of the statement; or

                     (c)  the statement is qualified or explained by some other statement made at the examination, evidence of the other statement is not tendered in the proceeding and the person objects to the admission of evidence of the first‑mentioned statement; or

                     (d)  the statement discloses matter in respect of which the person could claim legal professional privilege in the proceeding if this subsection did not apply in relation to the statement, and the person objects to the admission of evidence of the statement.

             (2)  Subsection (1) applies in relation to a proceeding against a person even if it is heard together with a proceeding against another person.

             (3)  Where a written record of an examination of a person is signed by the person under subsection 24(2) or authenticated in any other prescribed manner, the record is, in a proceeding, prima facie evidence of the statements it records, but nothing in this Part limits or affects the admissibility in the proceeding of other evidence of statements made at the examination.

##### <a id="77"></a>77  Statements made at an examination: other proceedings

                   Where direct evidence by a person (the **_absent witness_**) of a matter would be admissible in a proceeding, a statement that the absent witness made at an examination of the absent witness and that tends to establish that matter is admissible in the proceeding as evidence of that matter:

                     (a)  if it appears to the court or tribunal that:

                              (i)  the absent witness is dead or is unfit, because of physical or mental incapacity, to attend as a witness; or

                             (ii)  the absent witness is outside the State or Territory in which the proceeding is being heard and it is not reasonably practicable to secure his or her attendance; or

                            (iii)  all reasonable steps have been taken to find the absent witness but he or she cannot be found; or

                     (b)  if it does not so appear to the court or tribunal—unless another party to the proceeding requires the party tendering evidence of the statement to call the absent witness as a witness in the proceeding and the tendering party does not so call the absent witness.

##### <a id="78"></a>78  Weight of evidence admitted under section 77

             (1)  This section applies where evidence of a statement made by a person at an examination of the person is admitted under section 77 in a proceeding.

             (2)  In deciding how much weight (if any) to give to the statement as evidence of a matter, regard is to be had to:

                     (a)  how long after the matters to which it related the statement was made; and

                     (b)  any reason the person may have had for concealing or misrepresenting a material matter; and

                     (c)  any other circumstances from which it is reasonable to draw an inference about how accurate the statement is.

             (3)  If the person is not called as a witness in the proceeding:

                     (a)  evidence that would, if the person had been so called, have been admissible in the proceeding for the purpose of destroying or supporting his or her credibility is so admissible; and

                     (b)  evidence is admissible to show that the statement is inconsistent with another statement that the person has made at any time.

             (4)  However, evidence of a matter is not admissible under this section if, had the person been called as a witness in the proceeding and denied the matter in cross‑examination, evidence of the matter would not have been admissible if adduced by the cross‑examining party.

##### <a id="79"></a>79  Objection to admission of statements made at examination

             (1)  A party (the **_adducing party_**) to a proceeding may, not less than 14 days before the first day of the hearing of the proceeding, give to another party to the proceeding written notice that the adducing party:

                     (a)  will apply to have admitted in evidence in the proceeding specified statements made at an examination; and

                     (b)  for that purpose, will apply to have evidence of those statements admitted in the proceeding.

             (2)  A notice under subsection (1) must set out, or be accompanied by writing that sets out, the specified statements.

             (3)  Within 14 days after a notice is given under subsection (1), the other party may give to the adducing party a written notice:

                     (a)  stating that the other party objects to specified statements being admitted in evidence in the proceeding; and

                     (b)  specifies, in relation to each of those statements, the grounds of objection.

             (4)  The period prescribed by subsection (3) may be extended by the court or tribunal or by agreement between the parties concerned.

             (5)  On receiving a notice given under subsection (3), the adducing party must give to the court or tribunal a copy of:

                     (a)  the notice under subsection (1) and any writing that subsection (2) required to accompany that notice; and

                     (b)  the notice under subsection (3).

             (6)  Where subsection (5) is complied with, the court or tribunal may either:

                     (a)  determine the objections as a preliminary point before the hearing of the proceeding begins; or

                     (b)  defer determination of the objections until the hearing.

             (7)  Where a notice has been given in accordance with subsections (1) and (2), the other party is not entitled to object at the hearing of the proceeding to a statement specified in the notice being admitted in evidence in the proceeding, unless:

                     (a)  the other party has, in accordance with subsection (3), objected to the statement being so admitted; or

                     (b)  the court or tribunal gives the other party leave to object to the statement being so admitted.

                     (c)  a matter referred to in paragraph 32A(c) or (d);

is admissible in evidence in a proceeding as if the copy were the original book, or the extract were the relevant part of the original book, as the case may be, whether or not the copy or extract was made under section 37.

             (2)  A copy of, or an extract from, a book is not admissible in evidence under subsection (1) unless it is proved that the copy or extract is a true copy of the book, or of the relevant part of the book, as the case may be.

             (3)  For the purposes of subsection (2), a person who has compared:

                     (a)  a copy of a book with the book; or

                   Subject to section 82, where a copy of a report under Division 1 purports to be certified by ASIC as a true copy of such a report, the copy is admissible in a proceeding (other than a criminal proceeding) as prima facie evidence of:

                     (a)  ASIC’s report of its opinion for the purposes of paragraph 461(1)(h) or subparagraph 583(c)(iii) of the Corporations Act; and

                     (b)  any facts or matters that the report states ASIC to have found to exist.

##### <a id="82"></a>82  Exceptions to admissibility of report

             (1)  This section applies where a party to a proceeding tenders a copy of a report as evidence against another party.

             (2)  The copy is not admissible under section 81 in the proceeding as evidence against the other party unless the court or tribunal is satisfied that:

                     (a)  a copy of the report has been given to the other party; and

                     (b)  the other party, and the other party’s lawyer, have had a reasonable opportunity to examine that copy and to take its contents into account in preparing the other party’s case.

             (3)  Before or after the copy referred to in subsection (1) is admitted in evidence, the other party may apply to cross‑examine, in relation to the report, a specified person who, or 2 or more specified persons each of whom:

                     (a)  was concerned in preparing the report or making a finding about a fact or matter that the report states ASIC to have found to exist; or

                     (b)  whether or not pursuant to a requirement made under this Part, gave information, or produced a book, on the basis of which, or on the basis of matters including which, such a finding was made.

             (4)  The court or tribunal must grant an application made under subsection (3) unless it considers that, in all the circumstances, it is not appropriate to do so.

                     (b)  a person to whom the application or any of the applications relate, or 2 or more such persons, is or are unavailable, or does not or do not attend, to be cross‑examined in relation to the report; and

                     (c)  the court or tribunal is of the opinion that to admit the copy under section 81 in the proceeding as evidence against the other party without the other party having the opportunity so to cross‑examine the person or persons would unfairly prejudice the other party;

the court or tribunal must refuse so to admit the copy, or must treat the copy as not having been so admitted, as the case requires.

##### <a id="83"></a>83  Material otherwise admissible

                   Nothing in this Division renders evidence inadmissible in a proceeding in circumstances where it would have been admissible in that proceeding if this Division had not been enacted.

##### <a id="255"></a>255  Relationship of Part with State validation Acts

             (1)  This Part applies to an invalid administrative action of a Commonwealth authority or an officer of the Commonwealth (within the meaning of a State validation Act) as if the circumstances that made the authority’s or officer’s action an invalid administrative action had not made the action invalid.

Note:          For the status and effect of invalid administrative actions in relation to times before the commencement, see the State validation Acts.

             (2)  However, if there are other circumstances that affect or may affect the validity of the action, neither this section, nor anything else in this Part, is taken to negate the effect of those other circumstances.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  a person would have had a right or liability under a provision (the **_old provision_**) of the old ASIC legislation of a State if the circumstances that made the authority’s or officer’s action an invalid administrative action (within the meaning of the State validation Act) of that State had not made the action invalid; and

                     (b)  the effect of that State validation Act in relation to that action is to declare that the person has, and is taken always to have had, the same rights and liabilities as they would have had under the old provision if the invalid administrative action had been taken, or purportedly taken, at the relevant time by a duly authorised State authority or officer of the State (within the meaning of that Act);

this Part applies as if:

                     (c)  a reference to a right or liability arising under the old ASIC legislation included a reference to the right or liability that the person is declared to have by the State validation Act; and

                     (d)  that right or liability arose under the old provision.

             (4)  In this section:

                    <a name="relev-function-power"></a><a name="state-valid-act"></a>**_State validation Act_** means an Act of a State in this jurisdiction under which certain administrative actions (within the meaning of that Act) taken, or purportedly taken, at or before the commencement by Commonwealth authorities or officers of the Commonwealth (within the meaning of that Act) pursuant to functions or powers (the **_relevant functions or powers_**) conferred, or purportedly conferred, by or under laws that include the old application Act for that State have, and are deemed always to have had, the same force and effect for all purposes as they would have had if:

                     (a)  they had been taken, or purportedly taken by a State authority or officer of the State (within the meaning of that Act); and

                     (b)  the relevant functions or powers had been duly conferred on those authorities or officers.

                             (ii)  to give something an effect for the purposes of the old ASIC legislation (or a provision of that legislation) that it would not otherwise have had; and

                     (b)  that effect was continuing immediately before the commencement;

this Part applies as if that thing had actually happened or were actually the case, or as if that thing actually had that other effect.

##### <a id="257"></a>257  Existence of several versions of the old ASIC legislation does not result in this Part operating to take the same thing to be done several times under the new ASIC legislation etc.

                   If, apart from this section, a provision of this Part (the **_transitional provision_**) would, because the Commonwealth, each State in this jurisdiction and the Northern Territory had its own old ASIC legislation (containing parallel provisions) before the commencement, operate so that:

                     (a)  a particular thing done before the commencement would be taken to be done, or have effect, 2 or more times by, under, or for the purposes of, a provision of the new ASIC legislation; or

                     (b)  a right or liability would be created 2 or more times in respect of a particular event, circumstance or thing that happened before the commencement; or

                     (c)  a particular result or effect would be produced 2 or more times for the purposes of the new ASIC legislation in relation to the same matter;

the transitional provision is taken to operate so that:

                     (d)  if paragraph (a) applies—the thing is taken to be done or have effect only once by, under, or for the purposes of the provision of, the new ASIC legislation; or

                     (e)  if paragraph (b) applies—the right or liability is created only once in respect of the event, circumstance or thing; or

                      (f)  if paragraph (c) applies—the result or effect is produced only once in relation to the matter.

##### <a id="258"></a>258  Penalty units in respect of pre‑commencement conduct remain at $100

             (1)  If, because of this Part, an offence can be prosecuted after the commencement in respect of conduct that occurred before the commencement, the amount of a penalty unit in respect of that offence is $100.

             (2)  This section has effect despite section 4AA of the _Crimes Act 1914_.

##### <a id="259"></a>259  Ceasing to be a referring State does not affect previous operation of this Part

                   If, after the commencement, a State ceases to be a referring State, that does not undo or affect:

                     (a)  the effects that this Part has already had in relation to matters connected with that State; or

                     (b)  the ongoing effect of this Act as it operates because of the effects referred to in paragraph (a).

##### <a id="267"></a>267  Treatment of court proceedings under or related to the old ASIC legislation—proceedings other than federal ASIC proceedings

             (1)  This section applies to a proceeding, other than a federal ASIC proceeding, in relation to which the following paragraphs are satisfied:

                     (a)  the proceeding was started in a court before the commencement; and

                     (b)  the proceeding was:

                              (i)  under a provision of the old ASIC legislation of the Commonwealth, a State in this jurisdiction or the Northern Territory; or

                             (ii)  brought as, or connected with, a prosecution for an offence against a provision of the old ASIC legislation of the Commonwealth, a State in this jurisdiction or the Northern Territory; and

                     (c)  the proceeding was not an enforcement proceeding, or an appeal or review proceeding, in relation to an order of a court; and

                     (d)  the proceeding had not been concluded or terminated before the commencement; and

                     (e)  either:

                              (i)  if the proceeding is a primary proceeding—no final determination of any of the existing rights or liabilities at issue in the proceeding had been made before the commencement; or

                             (ii)  if the proceeding is an interlocutory proceeding—this section applies to the primary proceeding to which the interlocutory proceeding relates.

             (2)  In this section:

                     (a)  the proceeding to which this section applies is called the **_old proceeding_**; and

                     (b)  the provision of the old ASIC legislation referred to in whichever of subparagraphs (1)(b)(i) and (ii) applies is called the **_relevant old provision_**.

             (3)  A proceeding (the **_new proceeding_**) equivalent to the old proceeding is, on the commencement, taken to have been brought in the same court, exercising federal jurisdiction:

                     (a)  if subparagraph (1)(b)(i) applies—under the provision of the new ASIC legislation that corresponds to the relevant old provision; or

                     (b)  if subparagraph (1)(b)(ii) applies—as, or connected with, a prosecution for an offence against the provision of the new ASIC legislation that corresponds to the relevant old provision.

To the extent that the old proceeding, before the commencement, related to pre‑commencement rights or liabilities, the new proceeding relates to the substituted rights and liabilities in relation to those pre‑commencement rights and liabilities.

Note 1:       See sections 276 and 277 for the creation of the substituted rights and liabilities.

Note 2:       In all cases, there will be a provision of the new ASIC legislation that corresponds to the relevant old provision, either because:

(a)    the new ASIC legislation actually contains a provision that corresponds to the relevant old provision; or

(b)    the new ASIC legislation, because of section 277 or 284, is taken to include the relevant old provision (whether with or without modifications), in which case the provision so taken to be included will be the corresponding provision.

             (4)  The following provisions apply in relation to the new proceeding:

                     (a)  the parties to the new proceeding are the same as the parties to the old proceeding;

                     (b)  subject to subsections (5) and (6), and to any order to the contrary made by the court, the court must deal with the continued proceeding as if the steps that had been taken for the purposes of the old proceeding before the commencement had been taken for the purposes of the new proceeding.

             (5)  If:

                     (a)  an interlocutory order was made before the commencement for the purpose of, or in relation to, the old proceeding; and

                     (b)  that interlocutory order was in force immediately before the commencement;

the rights and liabilities of all persons (including rights and liabilities arising wholly or partly because of conduct occurring before the commencement) are declared to be, for all purposes, the same as if the interlocutory order had instead been made by the same court, in the exercise of federal jurisdiction, for the purpose of, or in relation to, the new proceeding.

             (6)  The court may make orders doing all or any of the following:

                     (a)  cancelling or varying rights or liabilities that a person has because of subsection (5);

                     (b)  substituting other rights or liabilities for rights or liabilities a person has because of subsection (5);

                     (c)  adding rights or liabilities to the rights or liabilities a person has because of subsection (5);

                     (d)  enforcing, or otherwise dealing with conduct contrary to, a right or liability a person has because of subsection (5) in the same way as it could enforce, or deal with, the right, liability or conduct if the right or liability had arisen under or because of an order made by the court in the exercise of federal jurisdiction under the new ASIC legislation.

##### <a id="268"></a>268  Treatment of court proceedings under or related to the old ASIC legislation—federal ASIC proceedings

                     (c)  the proceeding had not been concluded or terminated before the commencement.

             (2)  In this section:

                     (a)  the proceeding to which this section applies is called the **_continued proceeding_**; and

                     (b)  the provision of the old ASIC legislation referred to in paragraph (1)(b) is called the **_relevant old provision_**.

             (3)  Subject to subsection (4):

                     (a)  the continued proceeding continues after the commencement in the same court as if it were, and always had been, a proceeding in relation to a matter to which the provision of the new ASIC legislation that corresponds to the relevant old provision applies; and

                     (b)  to the extent that the proceeding, before the commencement, related to pre‑commencement rights or liabilities, the proceeding, as continued, relates, and is taken always to have related, to the substituted rights and liabilities in relation to those pre‑commencement rights and liabilities.

Note 1:       See sections 276 and 277 for the creation of substituted rights and liabilities.

Note 2:       In all cases, there will be a provision of the new ASIC legislation that corresponds to the relevant old provision, either because:

(a)    the new ASIC legislation actually contains a provision that corresponds to the relevant old provision; or

(b)    the new ASIC legislation, because of section 277 or 284, is taken to include the relevant old provision (whether with or without modifications), in which case the provision so taken to be included will be the corresponding provision.

             (4)  Subject to any order to the contrary made by the court, the court must deal with the continued proceeding as if:

                     (a)  the steps that had been taken for the purposes of the proceeding before the commencement had been taken for the purpose of the proceeding as continued by this section; and

                     (b)  any orders made in relation to the proceeding before the commencement had been made in relation to the proceeding as continued by this section.

                     (c)  the proceeding had been concluded or terminated before the commencement.

             (2)  A decision or order made in the proceeding may be appealed against, or otherwise reviewed, as if it had been made in a proceeding that related to a matter to which a provision of this Act applied.

             (3)  An order made in the proceeding may be enforced as if it had been made in a proceeding that related to a matter to which a provision of this Act applied.

##### <a id="268B"></a>268B  Effect of decisions and orders made in federal corporations proceedings before commencement

                     (c)  a decision was made or an order given in the proceeding before the commencement;

the decision or order continues to have effect after the commencement despite the provision of the old ASIC legislation ceasing to have effect.

             (2)  This section does not limit the operation of section 268 in relation to the decision or order.

             (3)  On the commencement, the person acquires, accrues or incurs a right or liability (the **_substituted right or liability_**), equivalent to the pre‑commencement right or liability, under the provision taken to be included in the new ASIC legislation by paragraph (2)(a) (as if that provision applied to the conduct or circumstances that gave rise to the pre‑commencement right or liability).

Note:          If a time limit applied in relation to the pre‑commencement right or liability under the old ASIC legislation, that same time limit (calculated from the same starting point) will apply under the new ASIC legislation to the substituted right or liability—see subsection 278(3).

             (4)  A procedure, proceeding or remedy in respect of the right or liability may be instituted after the commencement under the provisions taken to be included in the new ASIC legislation by subsection (2) (as if those provisions applied to the conduct or circumstances that gave rise to the pre‑commencement right or liability).

Note:          For pre‑commencement proceedings in respect of substituted rights and liabilities, see sections 267 and 268.

                     (a)  the starting point of which:

                              (i)  was known or had been determined before the commencement (whether that starting point occurred or would occur before, on or after the commencement); or

                             (ii)  would have become known, or have been determined, after the commencement if the old ASIC legislation had continued to apply (whether that starting point would have occurred before, on or after the commencement); and

                     (b)  that had not ended at or before the commencement;

continues to run, or starts or started to run, as if that same time limit (starting from the same starting point) were applicable under the new ASIC legislation.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  under the old ASIC legislation, a process, a status of a person or body, or an instrument, commenced from a particular time before the commencement; and

                     (b)  that process, status or instrument is continued after the commencement for the purposes of the new ASIC legislation by a provision of this Part;

that process, status or instrument as so continued is still taken to have commenced from the time referred to in paragraph (a).

             (3)  If an old ASIC legislation time limit related to a pre‑commencement right or liability, the same time limit applies in relation to the substituted right or liability.

             (4)  In this section:

                    <a name="old-asic-legisl-time-limit"></a>**_old ASIC legislation time limit_** includes:

                     (a)  a period for the doing of a thing specified or determined under a provision of the old ASIC legislation of the Commonwealth, a State in this jurisdiction or the Northern Territory; or

                     (b)  a period specified or determined under a provision of the old ASIC legislation of the Commonwealth, a State in this jurisdiction or the Northern Territory as the duration of a particular instrument or status.

##### <a id="279"></a>279  Preservation of significance etc. of events or circumstances

             (1)  An event, circumstance or other thing:

                     (a)  that occurred or arose before the commencement under or as mentioned in a provision of the old ASIC legislation of the Commonwealth, a State in this jurisdiction or the Northern Territory; and

                     (b)  that had a particular significance, status or effect for the purposes of a carried over provision of that legislation (including because of an interpretative provision);

has that same significance after the commencement for the purposes of the provision of the new ASIC legislation that corresponds to that carried over provision.

             (2)  Without limiting subsection (1), an event, circumstance or other thing has a particular significance for the purposes of a carried over provision of the old ASIC legislation of the Commonwealth, a State in this jurisdiction or the Northern Territory if:

                     (a)  the carried over provision creates an obligation in respect of the event, circumstance or thing (whenever it arose); or

                     (b)  the carried over provision provides for the event, circumstance or thing to be dealt with in a particular way; or

             (1)  Subject to this section, a reference in the new ASIC legislation to an event, circumstance or thing of a particular kind that happens or arises, or that has happened or arisen, is taken to include a reference to an event, circumstance or thing of that kind that happened or arose at a time before the commencement, unless the contrary intention appears. The fact that the provision uses only the present tense in referring to an event, circumstance or thing is not, of itself, to be regarded as an expression of a contrary intention.

             (2)  Nothing in subsection (1) is taken to produce a result that a right or liability exists under a provision of the new ASIC legislation that relates solely to events, circumstances or things that occurred before the commencement.

Note:          Instead, an equivalent right or liability will be created by section 276 or 277.

             (3)  The regulations may provide that subsection (1) does not apply in relation to a particular reference or class of references in the new ASIC legislation.

##### <a id="281"></a>281  References in the new ASIC legislation to that legislation or the new corporations legislation generally include references to corresponding provisions of the old ASIC legislation or old corporations legislation

             (3)  In subsection (2):

                     (a)  **_new corporations legislation_** and **_old corporations legislation_** have the same meanings as they have in Part 10.1 of the Corporations Act; and

                     (b)  the question whether a provision or part of the old corporations legislation corresponds to a provision of part of the new corporations legislation is to be determined in the same way as it is determined for the purposes of Part 10.1 of the Corporations Act.

             (4)  The regulations may provide that subsection (1) or (2) does not apply in relation to a particular reference or class of references in the new ASIC legislation.

##### <a id="282"></a>282  Carrying over references to corresponding previous laws or relevant previous laws

             (1)  If a carried over provision of the old ASIC legislation of the Commonwealth, a State in this jurisdiction or the Northern Territory contained a reference (whether in its own terms or by operation of another provision) to:

                     (a)  a corresponding previous law (as defined for the purposes of that provision or provisions including that provision), or a thing done by, under, or for the purposes of, such a law; or

                     (b)  a relevant previous law (as defined for the purposes of that provision or provisions including that provision), or a thing done by, under, or for the purposes of, such a law;

the corresponding provision of the new ASIC legislation is taken to contain an equivalent reference to that previous law, or to such a thing done by, under, or for the purposes of, that previous law.

             (2)  The following references in the old ASIC legislation of the Commonwealth, a State in this jurisdiction or the Northern Territory are covered by subsection (1) in the same way as they would be if they used the “corresponding previous law” form of words:

                     (a)  the reference in section 15 to a “previous law corresponding to”;

                     (b)  any other references prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this subsection.

##### <a id="283"></a>283  References to ASIC legislation in instruments

                     (b)  an instrument made under such an Act;

to:

                     (c)  an Act, or to regulations or some other instrument, that is part of the old ASIC legislation (whether the reference is in general terms or in relation to the Commonwealth, or a particular State or Territory in this jurisdiction); or

                     (d)  to a provision or group of provisions of such an Act, regulations or other instrument;

is taken, after the commencement, to include a reference to the corresponding part, provision or provisions of the new ASIC legislation (unless there is no such corresponding part, provision or provisions).

Note:          In this Part, **_instrument_** means an instrument of a legislative or administrative character (see the definition in section 254), or any other document.

             (2)  The regulations may do either or both of the following:

                     (a)  provide that subsection (1) does not apply in relation to prescribed references in prescribed instruments;

                     (b)  provide that subsection (1) has effect in relation to prescribed references in prescribed instruments as if, in that subsection, the words “to be” were substituted for the words “to include”.

##### <a id="284"></a>284  Old transitional provisions continue to have their effect

             (1)  Subject to subsection (3), this Act has the same effect, after the commencement, as it would have if:

                     (a)  the transitional provisions (see subsections (6) and (7)) of the old ASIC Act, the old ASIC Law of the States in this jurisdiction and the old ASIC Law of the Northern Territory (as in force from time to time before the commencement) had been part of this Act; and

                     (b)  those transitional provisions produced the same results or effects (to the greatest extent possible) for the purposes of this Act as they produced for the purposes of that Act and those Laws.

             (2)  Without limiting subsection (1) (but subject to subsection (3)), if a transitional provision of the old ASIC Act, the old ASIC Law of the States in this jurisdiction or the old ASIC Law of the Northern Territory could, if it had continued in force after the commencement, have operated to give rise to rights and liabilities (including civil or criminal liabilities) in relation to acts or omissions occurring after the commencement, this Act is taken to include that transitional provision (with such modifications (if any) as are necessary).

Note:          In relation to acts or omissions that occurred before the commencement, equivalent rights or liabilities are created by sections 276 and 277.

             (3)  The regulations may determine how a matter dealt with in a transitional provision of the old ASIC Act, the old ASIC Law of the States in this jurisdiction or the old ASIC Law of the Northern Territory is to be dealt with under or in relation to the new ASIC legislation (including by creating offences). The regulations have effect despite subsections (1) and (2), but subject to subsection (5).

Note:          In creating offences, the regulations are subject to the limitation imposed by section 258.

             (4)  For the purpose of determining whether the new ASIC legislation includes a provision that corresponds to a provision of the old ASIC legislation of the Commonwealth, a State in this jurisdiction or the Northern Territory, and for the purpose of any reference in this Part to a corresponding provision of the new ASIC legislation, this Act is taken to include the transitional provisions of the old ASIC legislation of the Commonwealth, a State in this jurisdiction or the Northern Territory, as they have effect because of subsections (1) and (2).

             (5)  Nothing in subsection (1) or (2), or in regulations made for the purposes of subsection (3), is taken to produce a result that a right or liability exists under a transitional provision as it has effect because of subsection (1) or (2), or exists under regulations made for the purposes of subsection (3), that relates solely to events, circumstances or things that occurred before the commencement.

Note:          Instead, an equivalent right or liability will be created by section 276 or 277.

             (6)  Subject to subsection (7), for the purposes of this section, a **_transitional provision_** is any of the following provisions of the old ASIC Act, the old ASIC Law of the States in this jurisdiction and the old ASIC Law of the Northern Territory:

             (2)  For the purposes of this section, if an act or omission is alleged to have taken place between 2 dates, one before and one on or after the day on which a particular amendment commences, the act or omission is alleged to have taken place before the amendment commences.

* * *

_Abolition of Compulsory Age Retirement (Statutory Officeholders) Act 2001 (No. 159, 2001)_

## Schedule 1

## 97  Application of amendments

The amendments made by this Schedule do not apply to an appointment if the term of the appointment began before the commencement of this item.

* * *

_Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Act 2005 (No. 8, 2005)_

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Saving of matters in Part 2 of Schedule 1

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a decision or action is taken or another thing is made, given or done; and

                     (b)  the thing is taken, made, given or done under a provision of a Part 2 Act that had effect immediately before the commencement of this Act;

then the thing has the corresponding effect, for the purposes of the Part 2 Act as amended by this Act, as if it had been taken, made, given or done under the Part 2 Act as so amended.

             (2)  In this section:

                    <a name="part-act"></a>**_Part 2 Act_** means an Act that is amended by an item in Part 2 of Schedule 1.

* * *

_Tax Laws Amendment (Repeal of Inoperative Provisions) Act 2006 
 (No. 101, 2006)_

## Schedule 6

## 5  Application of Schedule 5 amendments

The repeals and amendments made by Schedule 5 apply to acts done or omitted to be done, or states of affairs existing, after the commencement of the amendments.

## 6  Object

The object of this Part is to ensure that, despite the repeals and amendments made by this Act, the full legal and administrative consequences of:

                     (a)  any act done or omitted to be done; or

                     (b)  any state of affairs existing; or

                     (c)  any period ending;

before such a repeal or amendment applies, can continue to arise and be carried out, directly or indirectly through an indefinite number of steps, even if some or all of those steps are taken after the repeal or amendment applies.

## 7  Making and amending assessments, and doing other things, in relation to past matters

Even though an Act is repealed or amended by this Act, the repeal or amendment is disregarded for the purpose of doing any of the following under any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_):

                     (a)  making or amending an assessment (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

                     (b)  exercising any right or power, performing any obligation or duty or doing any other thing (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

Example 1: On 31 July 1999, Greg Ltd lodged its annual return under former section 160ARE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The return stated that the company had a credit on its franking account and that no franking deficit tax was payable for the 1998‑99 franking year. Under former section 160ARH of that Act, the Commissioner was taken to have made an assessment consistent with the return.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of Part IIIAA of that Act, the Commissioner concludes that Greg Ltd fraudulently overfranked dividends it paid during the 1998‑99 franking year, and had a franking account deficit for that franking year. As a result, the Commissioner considers that franking deficit tax and a penalty by way of additional tax are payable.

                   The Commissioner can amend the assessment under former section 160ARN of that Act, because item 7 of this Schedule disregards the repeal of that section for the purposes of making an assessment in relation to the 1998‑99 franking year. Item 7 will also disregard the repeal of Division 11 of former Part IIIAA to the extent necessary for the Commissioner to assess Greg Ltd’s liability to a penalty by way of additional tax.

                   Despite the repeal of sections 160ARU and 160ARV, item 9 will ensure that the general interest charge will accrue on the unpaid franking deficit tax and penalty until they are paid.

                   Item 7 will also preserve Greg Ltd’s right, under former section 160ART of that Act, to object against the Commissioner’s amended assessment (including the penalty), since the objection is the exercise of a right in relation to a franking year that ended before the repeal of Part IIIAA.

Example 2: During the 1997‑98 income year, Duffy Property Ltd withheld amounts from its employees’ wages as required by former Divisions 1AAA and 2 of Part VI of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The company failed to notify the Commissioner of those amounts, and failed to remit them to the Commissioner.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of those Divisions, the Commissioner discovers that the withheld amounts have not been remitted. The company’s records are incomplete and the Commissioner is unable to completely ascertain the extent of its liability for the withheld amounts. Under section 222AGA of that Act, the Commissioner makes an estimate of the liability.

                   Item 7 will disregard the repeal of section 220AAZA of that Act (which empowered the Commissioner to recover the amount of the estimate). Even though the estimate is made after the repeal, it relates to amounts withheld before the repeal.

## 8  Saving of provisions about effect of assessments

If a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act deals with the effect of an assessment, the repeal or amendment is disregarded in relation to assessments made, before or after the repeal or amendment applies, in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

## 9  Saving of provisions about general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty

If:

                     (a)  a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act provides for the payment of:

                              (i)  general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty (all within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_); or

                             (ii)  interest under the _Taxation (Interest on Overpayments and Early Payments) Act 1983_; and

                     (b)  in a particular case, the period in respect of which the charge, penalty or interest is payable (whether under the provision or under the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_) has not begun, or has begun but not ended, when the provision is repealed or amended;

then, despite the repeal or amendment, the provision or part continues to apply in the particular case until the end of the period.

## 10  Repeals disregarded for the purposes of dependent provisions

If the operation of a provision (the **_subject provision_**) of any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_) made under any Act depends to any extent on an Act, or a provision of an Act, that is repealed by this Act, the repeal is disregarded so far as it affects the operation of the subject provision.

## 11  Schedule does not limit operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_

This Schedule does not limit the operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

Application of law to Agency head

(4)       To avoid doubt, if, under this item, an Agency head is required to provide a report under a law, the law applies to the Agency head in respect of the report in the same way as the law would have applied to the Agency or the member of the Agency in respect of the report.

(2)       That Subdivision does not apply to a contract entered into before the commencement of this Part of this Schedule. However:

                     (b)  if a term of the contract is varied on or after that commencement, and paragraph (a) has not already applied in relation to the contract—that Subdivision applies to the term as varied, on and from the day (the **_variation day_**) on which the variation takes effect, in relation to conduct that occurs on or after the variation day.
