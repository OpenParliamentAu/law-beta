<h7 class="ActHead7">Part 3—References to, and things done by or in relation to, ABA or ACA</h7>

## 8  References in instruments to ABA or ACA

(1)       This item applies to an instrument if it:

                     (a)  was in force immediately before the transition time; and

                     (b)  is an instrument covered by one or more of the following subparagraphs:

                              (i)  an instrument that was made by the ABA or ACA; or

                             (ii)  an instrument to which the ABA or ACA was a party; or

                             (v)  any other instrument in which a reference is made to the ABA or ACA.

(2)       Subject to subitem (3), an instrument to which this item applies continues to have effect from the transition time as if a reference in the instrument to the ABA or ACA (whether the reference is in that abbreviated form or is in the full name of that Authority) were a reference to the ACMA.

(3)       However, if:

                     (a)  the reference is to the ABA or the ACA as an entity with a particular power or capacity (for example, as party to a contract or the holder of real or personal property); and

                     (b)  the ACMA does not have that power or capacity (see sections 12 and 18 of the ACMA Act);

the reference has effect from the transition time as if it were a reference to the Commonwealth.

(4)       The regulations may determine that one of subitems (2) and (3), rather than the other of those subitems, applies in relation to a particular reference or class of references.

(5)       For the purposes of this item, an **_instrument_**:

                     (a)  includes, but is not limited to, a regulation, declaration, determination, direction, licence, application or standard; but

                     (b)  does not include an Act, or an instrument made under an Imposition Act.

## 9  Transfer of appropriated money

(1)       For the purposes of the operation of an Appropriation Act after the commencement of this Schedule, references to the Australian Broadcasting Authority or the Australian Communications Authority are to be read as references to the Australian Communications and Media Authority.

**_Appropriation Act_** means an Act appropriating money for expenditure out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund.

## 10  Things done by, or in relation to, ABA or ACA etc.

(1)       This item applies to a thing done by, or in relation to, the ABA or the ACA under:

                     (a)  a provision (the **_authorising provision_**) of an Act, other than:

                             (ii)  a provision of an Imposition Act; or

                             (ii)  a provision that is repealed by this Act; or

                     (b)  a provision (the **_authorising provision_**) of an instrument made under a provision of an Act, other than:

                             (ii)  a provision of an Imposition Act; or

                             (ii)  a provision that is repealed by this Act.

(2)       Subject to subitem (3), the thing done has effect from the transition time as if it had been done by, or in relation to, the ACMA under the authorising provision as in force from the transition time. However this is not taken to change the time at which the thing was actually done.

(3)       However if the thing done is a thing of a kind that, under the authorising provision as in force from the transition time, cannot be done by or in relation to the ACMA, the thing has effect from the transition time as if it had been done by or in relation to the Commonwealth.

(4)       The regulations may:

                     (a)  provide that this item does not apply to a specified class or classes of things done; or

                     (b)  determine that one of subitems (2) and (3), rather than the other of those subitems, applies in relation to a particular thing done, or class of things done; or

                     (c)  clarify how a thing has effect as mentioned in subitem (2) or (3).

## 11  Continuation of inquiries, investigations and hearings

(1)       If the ABA or ACA (however constituted) was holding or conducting an inquiry, investigation or hearing (the **_proceeding_**) that had not ended or been discontinued by the transition time, the ACMA is to continue the proceeding in accordance with the provisions as amended by this Act (the **_relevant provisions_**) that apply in relation to that kind of inquiry, investigation or hearing.

(2)       The ACMA is to take whatever action, under or for the purposes of the relevant provisions, as is necessary for the continuation of the proceeding. However this does not limit any power or discretion that the ACMA would otherwise have to discontinue such a proceeding.

_Note:       An example of an action that the ACMA may have to take is to determine how the ACMA is to be constituted for the purposes of the proceeding._

(3)       Anything done for the purposes of the proceeding before the transition time is taken to have been done for the purposes of the proceeding as continued in accordance with this item.

(4)       This item has effect despite item 10, but does not otherwise limit the generality of that item.

## 12  Continued effect of certain instruments made under the repealed provisions

(1)       An instrument:

                     (a)  made or given under the _Australian Communications Authority Act 1997_ and specified in the following table; and

                     (b)  in force immediately before the transition time;

continues to have effect from the transition time as if it were made or given under the corresponding provision of the ACMA Act  specified in the table.
