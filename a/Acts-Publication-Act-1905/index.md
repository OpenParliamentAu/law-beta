The following provision commences on 1 January 2005 unless proclaimed earlier: 

**4  Transitional provisions**

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>If legislation introduced into the Parliament before the commencing day

but commencing on or after that day:

by the Parliament; and</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>is expressed to require that instrument to be published as a statutory

rule under the _Statutory Rules Publication Act 1903_;

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

any instrument so made is taken to be an instrument referred to in paragraph 6(b) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ despite the repeal by this  Act  of the _Statutory Rules Publication Act 1903_.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(2)</dt><dd>If legislation introduced into the Parliament before the commencing day

but commencing on or after that day:

</dd> </dl></dl>

adversely affects those rights or results in the imposition of those

liabilities, despite subsection 48(2) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_, before the date of its notification in the _Gazette_;

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

that legislation is to be construed, on and after the commencing day or the day of its commencement, whichever last occurs, as if it had provided instead that the instrument, to the extent that it adversely affects those rights or results in the imposition of those liabilities, has effect, despite subsection 12(2) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_, before its registration under that Act.
