                     (c)  where the Land Council for the area in which the land is situated consents to the grant.

             (3)  A reference in paragraph (2)(a) or in subparagraph (2)(b)(i) to a right of a person shall be read as a reference to a right that was vested in the person immediately before the land became Aboriginal land.

##### <a id="41A"></a>41A  Withdrawal of application for consent to exploration licence

                   If the consent of the Northern Territory Mining Minister referred to in subsection 41(1) is withdrawn before the Land Council consents, or refuses to consent, to the grant of an exploration licence in respect of the Aboriginal land concerned, the application under that subsection is taken to have been withdrawn on the day the consent is withdrawn.

##### <a id="42"></a>42  Response of Land Council and Minister to application

             (1)  Where a Land Council receives an application under section 41 for consent to the grant of an exploration licence in respect of particular land, it shall, before the end of the negotiating period in respect of that application:

                     (a)  by notice in writing, either consent, or refuse to consent, to the grant of an exploration licence authorising the proposed exploration program in respect of that land or of a part of that land; and

                     (b)  notify the Minister, through the Land Council, of that decision.

             (6)  Subject to subsection (7), the Land Council shall not consent to the grant of the licence unless:

             (8)  Where the Land Council consents to the grant of the licence, the Minister shall determine, in writing, whether he or she also consents to the grant, and shall notify the applicant and the Land Council, in writing, accordingly, within 30 days, or such other period as is prescribed, after:

                     (a)  the receipt by the Minister of the notice under subsection (1); or

                     (b)  the day on which the Land Council was, under subsection (7), deemed to consent to the grant of the licence.

                     (d)  except where the traditional Aboriginal owners as a group decide, and, through the Land Council, notify the intending miner that the representatives of the intending miner may not attend a subsequent meeting that is so convened—the representatives may attend so much of that subsequent meeting as is appropriate in order further to explain those mining proposals or further to discuss the terms and conditions.

             (6)  The Minister may, in writing, authorise a specified person, or any person included in a specified class of persons, to:

                     (a)  attend the first meeting; and

                     (b)  attend any subsequent meeting.

          (6A)  However, a person covered by subsection (6) must not attend any subsequent meeting if the traditional Aboriginal owners as a group:

             (8)  Where a request is made to the Minister under subsection (7), the Minister shall, as soon as practicable, arrange for a person to be appointed as a Mining Commissioner under section 48F and that person shall thereupon try, by conciliation, to assist the intending miner and the Land Council to resolve the matters in dispute.

             (9)  If the Mining Commissioner becomes of the opinion that there is no reasonable prospect, by conciliation, of assisting the intending miner and the Land Council to resolve any matters in dispute between them, he or she shall notify both parties, in writing, that he or she is so satisfied and, unless either party objects, proceed, by arbitration of the matters in dispute, to determine the terms and conditions that should, in his or her opinion, be acceptable to both parties.

           (10)  If either party objects under subsection (9), the Minister shall, as soon as practicable, arrange for another person to be appointed as a Mining Commissioner under section 48F and that person shall, by arbitration of the matters in dispute, determine the terms and conditions that should, in his or her opinion, be acceptable to both parties.

           (11)  The Mining Commissioner shall determine terms and conditions that are fair and reasonable and that, in his or her opinion, should have been negotiated by the parties in commercial arms’ length negotiations conducted in good faith.

           (12)  Where the intending miner is willing to enter into an agreement with the Land Council setting out the terms and conditions determined under this section, the Land Council shall enter into that agreement.

           (13)  Where the Minister is satisfied that the Land Council has refused, or is unwilling, to enter into an agreement in the circumstances referred to in subsection (12), the Minister shall, in the name of, and on behalf of, the Land Council, enter into such an agreement.

           (14)  Where an agreement is entered into under this section concerning the terms and conditions, the terms and conditions are binding upon the parties and their heirs, successors or assigns.

           (15)  Nothing in this Part shall be taken to imply that the intending miner must enter into an agreement with the Land Council to give effect to any terms and conditions determined by the Mining Commissioner under this section, but, if the intending miner does not enter into the agreement, within 90 days after the determination or such longer period as the Minister may determine on application, within that period of 90 days, by either party, the licence or lease referred to in subsection (1) is cancelled.

           (16)  Where:

                     (a)  the Mining Commissioner has, under this section, determined the terms and conditions; and

                     (b)  the intending miner has withdrawn the application for the grant of the mining interest because the intending miner is unwilling to accept the terms and conditions so determined;

the Minister shall not consent to the grant to another intending miner of a mining interest that will enable the mining of a mineral deposit on the same land, being a deposit that was delineated by a previous intending miner (whether the first‑mentioned intending miner or not), unless the Minister is satisfied that the other intending miner has entered into an agreement described in subsection (17).

           (17)  For the purposes of subsection (16), the agreement shall be an agreement with the previous intending miner or with the heirs, successors or assigns of the previous intending miner to reimburse the previous intending miner, or the heirs, successors or assigns of the previous intending miner, an amount equal to the sum of the exploration expenditure reported by the previous intending miner in accordance with the conditions of the exploration licence or exploration retention licence held by the previous intending miner in respect of the land under a law of the Northern Territory relating to mining for minerals.

           (18)  Without limiting the generality of the preceding subsections, the terms and conditions of an agreement under this section shall include terms and conditions relating to the payment to the Land Council of an amount or amounts specified in, or determined under, the agreement.

             (4)  If mining operations for minerals are carried on under the _Atomic Energy Act 1953_ or any other Act on Aboriginal land by, or on behalf of, the Commonwealth, the Northern Territory or an Authority, there must be credited to the Account, from time to time, payments in respect of those mining operations of such amounts as are determined in accordance with subsection (5).

             (5)  Amounts payable under subsection (4) are:

                     (a)  such amounts as would be payable to the Crown as royalties if the mining operations were carried on in accordance with the law of the Northern Territory relating to mining for minerals and the royalties were payable at the rate fixed by that law immediately before 26 January 1977; or

                     (b)  if the Minister administering the Act under which the mining operations are carried on and the Minister administering this Act jointly determine that amounts higher than the amounts referred to in paragraph (a) are to be payable under subsection (4) in respect of particular mining operations—the amounts so determined.

             (6)  There must be credited to the Account amounts equal to any money paid by any person to the Commonwealth for the purposes of the Account.

             (7)  There must be credited to the Account amounts equal to any amounts from time to time received by the Commonwealth as interest on, or as repayment of, any loan made under subsection 64(4).

##### <a id="64"></a>64  Debits from the Account

             (1)  There must be debited  from the Account from time to time, and paid by the Commonwealth for distribution between or among the Land Councils such amounts as the Minister determines having regard to the following in relation to each Land Council:

                     (a)  credited to the Account in accordance with subsection 63(1) in respect of that mining interest; or

                     (b)  credited to the Account in accordance with subsection 63(4) in respect of those mining operations;

as the case may be.

             (4)  There must be debited from the Account  and paid by the Commonwealth  such other amounts as the Minister directs to be paid or applied to or for the benefit of Aboriginals living in the Northern Territory.

Note:          The activities or operations of any individual or organisation that receives a payment under this subsection may be evaluated or audited: see paragraph 193X(1)(cc) of the _Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Act 2005_.

          (4A)  There must be debited from the Account  and paid by the Commonwealth  such other amounts as the Minister directs to be paid in relation to:

                    (aa)  the acquiring of a lease by the Commonwealth if the Minister has agreed to a request under subsection 19(3A) or 20CA(2) in relation to the lease; or

                   (ab)  the administering of a lease covered by paragraph (aa) if the Executive Director entered into the lease on behalf of the Commonwealth; or

                    (ac)  the acquiring of a sublease by the Commonwealth if the Minister has agreed to a request under subsection 20CA(2) in relation to the sublease; or

                   (ad)  the administering of a sublease covered by paragraph (ac) if the Executive Director entered into the sublease on behalf of the Commonwealth; or

                     (b)  the payment of amounts under leases granted or transferred to approved entities under section 19A.

             (5)  A payment of an amount debited from the Account under subsection (4) may be by way of a loan (whether secured or unsecured) by the Commonwealth.

          (5A)  The Minister may, by notice in writing, specify conditions on which a payment of an amount to a person under subsection (4) (including by way of a loan) is made. The notice is not a legislative instrument.

          (5B)  If a condition on which a payment of an amount to a person under subsection (4) is made is breached, the Minister, on behalf of the Commonwealth, may:

                     (a)  if the payment is by way of a loan—recover so much of the loan as has not been repaid, and any accrued interest that has not been paid, as a debt in a court of competent jurisdiction; or

                     (b)  in any other case—recover the whole or a part of the amount as a debt in a court of competent jurisdiction.

             (6)  There must be debited from the Account and paid by the Commonwealth such amounts to meet the expenses of administering the Account as the Minister directs.

             (7)  Amounts that the Minister directs to be debited from the Account under subsection (4), (4A) or (6) must be paid or applied in accordance with the direction.

##### <a id="64A"></a>64A  Debit of additional amounts from Account

             (1)  The Minister may, in his or her discretion, from time to time, by written instrument, direct the debit from the Account of such amounts as he or she specifies in the direction.

             (2)  If the Minister directs, under subsection (1), the debit of a specified amount from the Account, section 12‑320 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ does not apply in relation to the debit of that amount. But there must also be debited from the Account such additional amount as would be necessary to discharge any liability for mining withholding tax in accordance with Division 11C of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ in respect of the first‑mentioned amount. The debit of that additional amount discharges that liability.

             (3)  The Minister must, in a direction under subsection (1), specify, in relation to each amount that he or she directs be debited from the Account:

                     (a)  that the amount is to be taken, for the purposes of this section, to have been debited from the Account in relation to a specified Land Council; or

                     (b)  that specified amounts that are, in the aggregate, equal to that amount are to be respectively taken, for the purposes of this section, to have been debited from the Account in relation to specified Land Councils.

             (4)  If, in consequence of a direction by the Minister under subsection (1) that an amount be debited from the Account, an additional amount is also debited from the Account in accordance with subsection (2), the Minister must, by written instrument, direct, in relation to that additional amount:

                     (a)  that the additional amount is to be taken, for the purposes of this section, to have been debited from the Account in relation to a specified Land Council; or

                     (b)  that specified amounts that are, in the aggregate, equal to the additional amount are to be respectively taken for the purposes of this section, to have been debited from the Account in relation to specified Land Councils.

             (5)  The Minister must, in specifying under subsection (3) that an amount is to be taken, for the purposes of this section, to have been debited from the Account in relation to a specified Land Council, ensure that the aggregate of that amount and the amount or amounts (if any) specified in a previous direction or previous directions under subsection (1) in relation to that Land Council does not exceed the total of the amounts paid by the Commonwealth, after 30 June 1978, to that Land Council for the purpose of meeting the administrative costs or capital costs of that Land Council.

             (6)  An amount that is to be taken for the purposes of this section to have been debited from the Account in respect of a particular Land Council must nonetheless be taken into account for the purposes of subsection 64(1) as if it had been debited from the Account and paid by the Commonwealth in accordance with that subsection to the Land Council.

             (7)  The reference in subsection (5) to amounts paid by the Commonwealth to a Land Council for the purpose of meeting the administrative costs or capital costs of that Land Council does not include a reference to:

                     (a)  any amount that is paid to that Land Council under an agreement under subsection 44(1) or (2); or

                     (b)  any amount that is paid to that Land Council out of the appropriation made by item 07 of subdivision 3 of Division 640 of the _Appropriation Act (No. 1) 1978‑79_; or

                     (c)  any amount that is paid to that Land Council out of the appropriation made by subdivision 1 of Division 815 of the _Appropriation Act (No. 4) 1980‑81_; or

                     (d)  any amount that is paid to that Land Council out of the appropriation made by item 09 of subdivision 3 of Division 120 of the _Appropriation Act (No. 1) 1981‑82_; or

                     (e)  any other amount that is paid to that Land Council for that purpose by the Commonwealth and that the Minister determines, by written instrument, should not be taken into account for the purposes of this section.

##### <a id="64B"></a>64B  Accounts, financial statements and annual report

             (3)  The Chair and the members of the Committee elected by each Land Council shall be Aboriginals living in the Northern Territory or whose names are set out in a register maintained in accordance with section 24.

             (4)  The Minister may, by writing, appoint 1 or 2 persons to be members of the Committee.

             (5)  The Minister must not appoint a person as a member under subsection (4) unless the Minister is satisfied that the person has professional expertise in:

                     (a)  land management; or

                     (b)  business or financial management.

             (6)  A member of the Committee may be re‑appointed or re‑elected.

             (7)  The period of any appointment or election (or any re‑appointment or re‑election) must not exceed 3 years.

                     (b)  the Governor‑General executes a deed of grant of an estate in fee simple in the area of land, or in an area of land that includes the area of land, under section 12; or

                     (c)  the Commissioner informs the Minister, in the Commissioner’s report to the Minister in respect of the claim:

                              (i)  that the Commissioner finds that there are no Aboriginals who are the traditional Aboriginal owners of the area of land; or

                             (ii)  that the Commissioner is unable to make a finding that there are Aboriginals who are the traditional Aboriginal owners of the area of land; or

                     (d)  where the Commissioner finds that there are Aboriginals who are the traditional Aboriginal owners of the area of land, or of an area of land that includes the area of land—the Minister determines, in writing, that the Minister does not propose to recommend to the Governor‑General that a grant of estate in fee simple in the area of land, or in an area of land that includes the area of land, be made to a Land Trust.

Note:          Subparagraph (b)(i) relates to subsection 50(2A), which prevents Commissioners considering applications relating to traditional land claims made after the expiration of 10 years after the commencement of that subsection. That subsection commenced on 5 June 1987.

             (7)  If:

                     (a)  an application has been made under section 50 by or on behalf of Aboriginals claiming to have a traditional land claim to an area of land; and

           (10)  The Commissioner must provide a copy of a determination referred to in subsection (7), (8) or (9) to the applicants concerned and to the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory.

           (11)  A determination under subsection (7), (8) or (9) is not a legislative instrument.

           (12)  This subsection applies in relation to an application:

                     (a)  that was made under section 50 before the commencement of this subsection by or on behalf of Aboriginals claiming to have a traditional land claim to qualifying land (whether or not recommendations of the kind referred to in subparagraph 50(1)(a)(ii) have been made and whether or not the application covers other land); and

                     (c)  to the extent that it relates to qualifying land that is described in the regulations; and

                     (d)  on the day on which the regulations take effect.

           (13)  To avoid doubt, if regulations are made for the purposes of subsection (12) in relation to a particular application, then later regulations may also be made for the purposes of that subsection in relation to that application.

                     (a)  the Land Council for the area in which that land, or that part of that land, is situated enters into an agreement under subsection (2) of this section in relation to that grant; and

                     (b)  for a grant the term of which exceeds 40 years—the Minister, by written notice, gives his or her consent to the grant.

                     (b)  any Aboriginal community or group that may be affected by the proposed grant has been consulted and has had adequate opportunity to express its view to the Council; and

                     (c)  the terms and conditions on which the proposed grant is to be made are reasonable.

             (4)  An agreement entered into by a Land Council under subsection (2) is binding on any successors to the Council.

             (5)  If a Land Council fails to comply with subsection (3) in entering into an agreement under subsection (2), that failure does not invalidate the Council’s entry into that agreement.

Payments

             (6)  If a Land Council receives a payment under an agreement entered into under subsection (2), the Council must, within 6 months after receiving the payment:

                     (a)  apply the payment in accordance with the agreement; or

                     (b)  if the agreement makes no provision in relation to the application of the payment—apply the payment to or for the benefit of the traditional Aboriginal owners of the area of land, or the part of the area of land, referred to in subsection (2).

             (7)  If:

                     (a)  a Land Council receives a payment as mentioned in subsection (6); and

the Land Council must, at the time it pays that amount, advise the person in writing that the amount is an accountable amount.

Note 1:       Sections 35B and 35C impose requirements on a body corporate in relation to accountable amounts.

Note 2:       The activities or operations of a body corporate or other person receiving an accountable amount may be evaluated or audited: see paragraph 193X(1)(cb) of the _Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Act 2005_.

Commissioner to continue to assess land claim application

             (8)  To avoid doubt, if a grant of an estate or interest in land is made after the relevant requirements of subsection (1) have been satisfied, the Commissioner must continue to perform the function mentioned in paragraph 50(1)(a) in relation to that land.

Estates or interests preserved

             (9)  If the Governor‑General executes a deed of grant of an estate in fee simple in the area (the **_claim area_**) of land concerned, or in an area of land that includes the claim area, under section 12, any estate or interest granted in the claim area after the relevant requirements of subsection (1) of this section have been satisfied is preserved as an estate or interest in the claim area after the deed is executed.

Consent of Minister not a legislative instrument

           (10)  A notice under paragraph (1)(b) is not a legislative instrument.

##### <a id="68"></a>68  Roads over Aboriginal land

_Tax Laws Amendment (Repeal of Inoperative Provisions) Act 2006 (No. 101, 2006)_

## Schedule 6

## 1  Application of Schedule 1 and 2 amendments

Except as mentioned in items 2 and 3, the repeals and amendments made by Schedules 1 and 2 apply:

                     (a)  so far as they affect assessments—to assessments for the 2006‑07 income year and all later income years; and

                     (b)  otherwise—to acts done or omitted to be done, or states of affairs existing, after the commencement of the repeals and amendments.

## 6  Object

The object of this Part is to ensure that, despite the repeals and amendments made by this Act, the full legal and administrative consequences of:

                     (a)  any act done or omitted to be done; or

                     (b)  any state of affairs existing; or

                     (c)  any period ending;

before such a repeal or amendment applies, can continue to arise and be carried out, directly or indirectly through an indefinite number of steps, even if some or all of those steps are taken after the repeal or amendment applies.

## 7  Making and amending assessments, and doing other things, in relation to past matters

Even though an Act is repealed or amended by this Act, the repeal or amendment is disregarded for the purpose of doing any of the following under any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_):

                     (a)  making or amending an assessment (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

                     (b)  exercising any right or power, performing any obligation or duty or doing any other thing (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

Example 1: On 31 July 1999, Greg Ltd lodged its annual return under former section 160ARE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The return stated that the company had a credit on its franking account and that no franking deficit tax was payable for the 1998‑99 franking year. Under former section 160ARH of that Act, the Commissioner was taken to have made an assessment consistent with the return.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of Part IIIAA of that Act, the Commissioner concludes that Greg Ltd fraudulently overfranked dividends it paid during the 1998‑99 franking year, and had a franking account deficit for that franking year. As a result, the Commissioner considers that franking deficit tax and a penalty by way of additional tax are payable.

                   The Commissioner can amend the assessment under former section 160ARN of that Act, because item 7 of this Schedule disregards the repeal of that section for the purposes of making an assessment in relation to the 1998‑99 franking year. Item 7 will also disregard the repeal of Division 11 of former Part IIIAA to the extent necessary for the Commissioner to assess Greg Ltd’s liability to a penalty by way of additional tax.

                   Despite the repeal of sections 160ARU and 160ARV, item 9 will ensure that the general interest charge will accrue on the unpaid franking deficit tax and penalty until they are paid.

                   Item 7 will also preserve Greg Ltd’s right, under former section 160ART of that Act, to object against the Commissioner’s amended assessment (including the penalty), since the objection is the exercise of a right in relation to a franking year that ended before the repeal of Part IIIAA.

Example 2: During the 1997‑98 income year, Duffy Property Ltd withheld amounts from its employees’ wages as required by former Divisions 1AAA and 2 of Part VI of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The company failed to notify the Commissioner of those amounts, and failed to remit them to the Commissioner.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of those Divisions, the Commissioner discovers that the withheld amounts have not been remitted. The company’s records are incomplete and the Commissioner is unable to completely ascertain the extent of its liability for the withheld amounts. Under section 222AGA of that Act, the Commissioner makes an estimate of the liability.

                   Item 7 will disregard the repeal of section 220AAZA of that Act (which empowered the Commissioner to recover the amount of the estimate). Even though the estimate is made after the repeal, it relates to amounts withheld before the repeal.

## 8  Saving of provisions about effect of assessments

If a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act deals with the effect of an assessment, the repeal or amendment is disregarded in relation to assessments made, before or after the repeal or amendment applies, in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

## 9  Saving of provisions about general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty

If:

                     (a)  a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act provides for the payment of:

                              (i)  general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty (all within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_); or

                             (ii)  interest under the _Taxation (Interest on Overpayments and Early Payments) Act 1983_; and

                     (b)  in a particular case, the period in respect of which the charge, penalty or interest is payable (whether under the provision or under the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_) has not begun, or has begun but not ended, when the provision is repealed or amended;

then, despite the repeal or amendment, the provision or part continues to apply in the particular case until the end of the period.

## 10  Repeals disregarded for the purposes of dependent provisions

If the operation of a provision (the **_subject provision_**) of any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_) made under any Act depends to any extent on an Act, or a provision of an Act, that is repealed by this Act, the repeal is disregarded so far as it affects the operation of the subject provision.

## 11  Schedule does not limit operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_

This Schedule does not limit the operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

would result in an acquisition of property to which paragraph 51(xxxi) of the Constitution applies from a person otherwise than on just terms, the Commonwealth is liable to pay a reasonable amount of compensation to the person.

(3)       If the Commonwealth and the person do not agree on the amount of the compensation, the person may institute proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction for the recovery from the Commonwealth of such reasonable amount of compensation as the court determines.

(4)       In subitem (2):

**_acquisition of property_** has the same meaning as in paragraph 51(xxxi) of the Constitution.

**_just terms_** has the same meaning as in paragraph 51(xxxi) of the Constitution.
