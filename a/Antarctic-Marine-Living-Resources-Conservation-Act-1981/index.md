<dl compact="">

The Contracting Parties,

 </dl>

	RECOGNISING the importance of safeguarding the environment and protecting the integrity of the ecosystem of the seas surrounding Antarctica;
 	NOTING the concentration of marine living resources found in Antarctic waters and the increased interest in the possibilities offered by the utilization of these resources as a source of protein;
 	CONSCIOUS of the urgency of ensuring the conservation of Antarctic marine living resources;
 	CONSIDERING that it is essential to increase knowledge of the Antarctic marine ecosystem and its components so as to be able to base decisions on harvesting on sound scientific information;
 	BELIEVING that the conservation of Antarctic marine living resources calls for international co-operation with due regard for the provisions of the Antarctic Treaty and with the active involvement of all States engaged in research or harvesting activities in Antarctic waters;
 	RECOGNISING the prime responsibilities of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties for the protection and preservation of the Antarctic environment and, in particular, their responsibilities under Article IX, paragraph 1 (f) of the Antarctic Treaty in respect of the preservation and conservation of living resources in Antarctica;
 	RECALLING the action already taken by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties including in particular the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora, as well as the provisions of the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals;
 	BEARING in mind the concern regarding the conservation of Antarctic marine living resources expressed by the Consultative Parties at the Ninth Consultative Meeting of the Antarctic Treaty and the importance of the provisions of Recommendation IX-2 which led to the establishment of the present Convention;
 	BELIEVING that it is in the interest of all mankind to preserve the waters surrounding the Antarctic continent for peaceful purposes only and to prevent their becoming the scene or object of international discord;
 	RECOGNISING, in the light of the foregoing, that it is desirable to establish suitable machinery for recommending, promoting, deciding upon and co-ordinating the measures and scientific studies needed to ensure the conservation of Antarctic marine living organisms;
 	HAVE AGREED as follows:

<dl compact="">

<center>ARTICLE I</center> 1.	This Convention applies to the Antarctic marine living resources of the area south of 60&#176; South latitude and to the Antarctic marine living resources of the area between that latitude and the Antarctic Convergence which form part of the Antarctic marine ecosystem. 2.	Antarctic marine living resources means the populations of fin fish, molluscs, crustaceans and all other species of living organisms, including birds, found south of the Antarctic Convergence. 3.	The Antarctic marine ecosystem means the complex of relationships of Antarctic marine living resources with each other and with their physical environment. 4.	The Antarctic Convergence shall be deemed to be a line joining the following points along parallels of latitude and meridians of longitude: 	50&#176; S, 0&#176;; 50&#176; S, 30&#176; E; 45&#176; S, 30&#176; E; 45&#176; S, 80&#176; E; 55&#176; S, 80&#176; E; 55&#176; S, 150&#176; E; 60&#176; S, 150&#176; E; 60&#176; S, 50&#176; W; 50&#176; S, 50&#176; W; 50&#176; S, 0&#176;.  </dl>

1.	The objective of this Convention is the conservation of Antarctic marine

living resources. 2.	For the purposes of this Convention, the term "conservation" includes rational use. 3.	Any harvesting and associated activities in the area to which this Convention applies shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of this Convention and with the following principles of conservation:  </dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>prevention of decrease in the size of any harvested population to levels

below those which ensure its stable recruitment. For this purpose its size

should not be allowed to fall below a level close to that which ensures the

greatest net annual increment;</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>maintenance of the ecological relationships between harvested, dependent

and related populations of Antarctic marine living resources and the

restoration of depleted populations to the levels defined in

sub-paragraph&#160;(a) above; and</dd>

<dt>(c)</dt><dd>prevention of changes or minimization of the risk of changes in the marine

ecosystem which are not potentially reversible over two or three decades,

taking into account the state of available knowledge of the direct and indirect

impact of harvesting, the effect of the introduction of alien species, the

effects of associated activities on the marine ecosystem and of the effects of

environmental changes, with the aim of making possible the sustained

conservation of Antarctic marine living resources.</dd>
