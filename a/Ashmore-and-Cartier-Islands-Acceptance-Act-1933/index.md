##### <a id="6A"></a>6A  _Criminal Code_ does not apply

                   Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ does not apply in relation to, or in relation to matters arising under, a law in force in the Territory because of section 6.

                   A law in force in the Territory by virtue of section 6 may be amended or repealed by an Ordinance or by a law made under an Ordinance.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Application of Commonwealth Acts

             (1)  An Act or a provision of an Act (whether passed before or after the commencement of this section) is in force as such in the Territory except as otherwise provided by that Act or by another Act.

             (2)  An Ordinance shall not be made so far as it affects the application of an Act of its own force in or in relation to the Territory.

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Ordinances

             (1)  The Governor-General may make Ordinances for the peace, order and good government of the Territory.

             (2)  Notice of the making of an Ordinance shall be published in the _Gazette_, and an Ordinance shall, unless the contrary intention appears in the Ordinance, come into operation on the date of publication of the notice.

##### <a id="10"></a>10  Tabling of Ordinances

             (1)  An Ordinance shall be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after the making of the Ordinance and, if it is not so laid before each House of the Parliament, ceases to have effect.

             (2)  If either House of the Parliament, in pursuance of a motion of which notice has been given within 15 sitting days after an Ordinance has been laid before that House, passes a resolution disallowing the Ordinance or a part of the Ordinance, the Ordinance or part so disallowed thereupon ceases to have effect.

             (3)  If, at the expiration of 15 sitting days after notice of a motion to disallow an Ordinance or part of an Ordinance has been given in a House of the Parliament, being notice given within 15 sitting days after the Ordinance has been laid before that House:

                     (a)  the notice has not been withdrawn and the motion has not been called on; or

                     (b)  the motion has been called on, moved and seconded and has not been withdrawn or otherwise disposed of;

the Ordinance or part, as the case may be, specified in the motion shall thereupon be deemed to have been disallowed.

             (4)  If, before the expiration of 15 sitting days after notice of a motion to disallow an Ordinance or part of an Ordinance has been given in a House of the Parliament:

                     (a)  the House of Representatives is dissolved or expires, or the Parliament is prorogued; and

                     (b)  at the time of the dissolution, expiry or prorogation, as the case may be:

                              (i)  the notice has not been withdrawn and the motion has not been called on; or

                             (ii)  the motion has been called on, moved and seconded and has not been withdrawn or otherwise disposed of;

the Ordinance shall, for the purposes of subsections (3) and (4), be deemed to have been laid before that first-mentioned House on the first sitting day of that first-mentioned House after the dissolution, expiry or prorogation, as the case may be.

             (5)  Where an Ordinance is disallowed, or is deemed to have been disallowed, under this section or ceases to have effect by virtue of the operation of subsection (1), the disallowance of the Ordinance or the operation of subsection (1) in relation to the Ordinance, as the case may be, has the same effect as a repeal of the Ordinance.

          (5A)  Where:

                     (a)  an Ordinance (in this subsection referred to as the **_relevant Ordinance_**) is disallowed, or is deemed to have been disallowed, under this section or ceases to have effect by virtue of the operation of subsection (1); and

                     (b)  the relevant Ordinance repealed, in whole or in part, another Ordinance or any other law that was in force immediately before the relevant Ordinance came into operation;

the disallowance of the relevant Ordinance or the operation of subsection (1) in relation to the relevant Ordinance, as the case may be, has the effect of reviving that other Ordinance or law, as the case may be, from and including the date of the disallowance or the date on which the relevant Ordinance ceased to have effect by virtue of that operation of subsection (1), as the case may be, as if the relevant Ordinance had not been made.

          (5B)  A reference in subsection (5) or (5A) to an Ordinance shall be read as including a reference to a part of an Ordinance, and a reference in subsection (5A) to a law has a corresponding meaning.

##### <a id="10A"></a>10A  Ordinance not to be re-made while required to be tabled

             (1)  Where an Ordinance (in this section called the **_original Ordinance_**) has been made, no Ordinance containing a provision being the same in substance as a provision of the original Ordinance shall be made during the period defined by subsection (2) unless both Houses of the Parliament by resolution approve the making of an Ordinance containing a provision the same in substance as that provision of the original Ordinance.

             (2)  The period referred to in subsection (1) is the period starting on the day on which the original Ordinance was made and ending at the end of 7 days after:

                     (a)  if the original Ordinance has been laid, in accordance with subsection 10(1), before both Houses of the Parliament on the same day—that day;

                     (b)  if the original Ordinance has been so laid before both Houses on different days—the later of those days; or

                     (c)  if the original Ordinance has not been so laid before both Houses—the last day on which subsection 10(1) could have been complied with.

             (3)  If a provision of an Ordinance is made in contravention of this section, the provision has no effect.

##### <a id="10B"></a>10B  Ordinance not to be re-made while subject to disallowance

             (1)  Where notice of a motion to disallow an Ordinance has been given in a House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days after the Ordinance has been laid before that House, no Ordinance containing a provision being the same in substance as a provision of the first-mentioned Ordinance shall be made unless:

                     (a)  the notice has been withdrawn;

                     (b)  the Ordinance is deemed to have been disallowed under subsection 10(3);

                     (c)  the motion has been withdrawn or otherwise disposed of; or

                     (d)  subsection 10(4) has applied in relation to the Ordinance.

             (2)  Where:

                     (a)  because of subsection 10(4), an Ordinance is deemed to have been laid before a House of the Parliament on a particular day; and

                     (b)  notice of a motion to disallow the Ordinance has been given in that House within 15 sitting days after that day;

no Ordinance containing a provision being the same in substance as a provision of the first-mentioned Ordinance shall be made unless:

                     (c)  the notice has been withdrawn;

                     (d)  the Ordinance is deemed to have been disallowed under subsection 10(3);

                     (e)  the motion has been withdrawn or otherwise disposed of; or

                      (f)  subsection 10(4) has applied again in relation to the Ordinance.

             (3)  If a provision of an Ordinance is made in contravention of this section, the provision has no effect.

             (4)  This section does not limit the operation of section 10A or 10C.

             (5)  In this section:

                    <a name="ordin"></a>**_Ordinance_** includes a part of an Ordinance.

##### <a id="10C"></a>10C  Disallowed Ordinance not to be re-made unless resolution rescinded or House approves

                   If an Ordinance or a part of an Ordinance is disallowed, or is deemed to have been disallowed, under section 10, and an Ordinance containing a provision being the same in substance as a provision so disallowed, or deemed to have been disallowed, is made within 6 months after the date of the disallowance, that provision has no effect, unless:

                     (a)  in the case of an Ordinance, or a part of an Ordinance, disallowed by resolution—the resolution has been rescinded by the House of the Parliament by which it was passed; or

                     (b)  in the case of an Ordinance, or a part of an Ordinance, deemed to have been disallowed—the House of the Parliament in which notice of the motion to disallow the Ordinance or part was given has approved, by resolution, the making of a provision the same in substance as the provision deemed to have been disallowed.

##### <a id="10D"></a>10D  Regulations, rules and by-laws

             (1)  All regulations made under an Ordinance shall be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after the day on which the regulations are made and, if they are not so laid before each House of the Parliament, have no effect.

             (2)  Subsections 10(2) to (5B), inclusive, and sections 10A, 10B and 10C apply in relation to regulations laid before a House of the Parliament as if, in those provisions, references to an Ordinance were references to regulations and references to a provision of an Ordinance were references to a regulation.

             (3)  In this section, **_regulations_** includes rules and by-laws.

##### <a id="11"></a>11  Powers and functions under adopted laws
