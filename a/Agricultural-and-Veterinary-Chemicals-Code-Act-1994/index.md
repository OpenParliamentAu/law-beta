## An Act to make provision for the evaluation, registration and control of agricultural and veterinary chemical products, and for related matters, for the purposes of the _Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1994_

RECOGNISING:<o:p></o:p>

<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">                            </span>(a)  that the protection of the health and safety of human beings, animals and the environment is essential to the well-being of society and can be enhanced by putting in place a system to regulate agricultural chemical products and veterinary chemical products; and<o:p></o:p>

                     (b)  that the principle of ecologically sustainable development requires a regulatory system that is designed to ensure that the use of such products at the present time will not impair the prospects of future generations; and<o:p></o:p>

                     (c)  that the furthering of trade and commerce between Australia and places outside Australia, and the present and future economic viability and competitiveness of primary industry and of a domestic industry for manufacturing and formulating such products, are essential for the well being of the economy and require a system for regulating such products that is cost effective, efficient, predictable, adaptive and responsive; and<o:p></o:p>

                     (d)  that it is desirable to establish a regulatory system that is open and accountable and gives opportunity for public input with respect to the regulation of such products; and<o:p></o:p>

                     (e)  that the system should, so far as practicable, be uniform throughout <st1:country-region style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x"><st1:place style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x">Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>; and<o:p></o:p>

                      (f)  that uniformity could best be achieved by the enactment of legislation by the Parliament of the Commonwealth as a law for the government of the <st1:state><st1:place style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x">Australian Capital Territory</st1:place></st1:state> and the adoption of that legislation by the Parliaments and legislatures of the States and the <st1:state><st1:place style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x">Northern Territory</st1:place></st1:state>:<o:p></o:p>

The Parliament of Australia enacts:<o:p></o:p>

             (3)  The regulations may:<o:p></o:p>

                     (a)  adopt wholly or partly, and specifically or by reference, and with any modifications, any of the standards, rules, codes, specifications or methods of any association, body or institution whether as in force at the time of adoption or as changed from time to time; and<o:p></o:p>

                     (b)  provide for the approval of the APVMA to be the standard that applies in respect of a particular matter or thing; and<o:p></o:p>

                     (c)  exempt particular substances or chemical products from the operation of any provision of the Code, either unconditionally or subject to conditions; and<o:p></o:p>

             (4)  Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Act or the Code, the regulations may be of general or specially limited application or may differ according to differences in time, locality, place or circumstance.<o:p></o:p>

             (5)  Subject to subsection (6), in the regulations, unless the contrary intention appears, an expression has the same meaning as it has in the Agvet Code of the participating Territories.<o:p></o:p>

             (6)  In a provision of the regulations that has effect for the purposes of a particular provision of the Agvet Code of the participating Territories, unless the contrary intention appears, an expression has the same meaning as it has in that provision of that Code.<o:p></o:p>

             (7)  The regulations are to be interpreted subject to the Agvet Code of the participating Territories and it is intended that if, apart from this subsection, a provision of the regulations would have been interpreted as being inconsistent with that Code, the provision is nevertheless to be valid in so far as it is not so inconsistent.<o:p></o:p>

             (8)  An expression has, in this section, the meaning it would have if this section were included in the Code.<o:p></o:p>

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Orders<o:p></o:p>

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), if:<o:p></o:p>

                     (a)  the effect that the order would have for the purposes of the Agvet Code of each jurisdiction other than the participating Territories because of a law of that jurisdiction that corresponds to the _Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1994_; and<o:p></o:p>

                     (b)  the fact that section 48 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ would apply in relation to the order because of subsection (3) of this section.<o:p></o:p>

             (7)  Subject to subsection (8), in an order, unless the contrary intention appears, an expression has the same meaning as it has in the Agvet Code of the participating Territories.<o:p></o:p>

             (8)  In a provision of an order that has effect for the purposes of a particular provision of the Agvet Code of the participating Territories, unless the contrary intention appears, an expression has the same meaning as it has in that provision of that Code.<o:p></o:p>

             (9)  An order is to be interpreted subject to the Agvet Code of the participating Territories and it is intended that if, apart from this subsection, a provision of an order would have been interpreted as being inconsistent with that Code, the provision is nevertheless to be valid in so far as it is not so inconsistent.<o:p></o:p>

### Division 4A—Limits on use of information

#### Subdivision A—Preliminary

##### <a id="34B"></a>34B  Explanation of Division

             (1)  This Division limits for a period the use the APVMA can make of information given to it:

                     (a)  in connection with an application under section 10 or 27 relating to:

                              (i)  approval of an active constituent for a chemical product; or

                             (ii)  registration of a chemical product; or

                            (iii)  approval of a label for a container for a chemical product; or

                     (b)  under section 161 in connection with a registered chemical product.

             (2)  During the period, the APVMA cannot use the information for granting another application, or for a reconsideration of an approval or registration, unless:

                     (a)  the APVMA is given a written statement made by a person who can authorise the use of the information consenting to the use; or

                     (b)  certain other conditions are met.

             (3)  The object of limiting use of the information in this way is to encourage innovation by making it easier for a person who made an investment in finding out the information to get a return on that investment.

#### Subdivision B—Limits on use of information

##### <a id="34C"></a>34C  APVMA must not use some information during some periods for some purposes

             (1)  During the period described in an item of the table, the APVMA must not use information described in the item for a purpose described in the item.

Note 1:       Section 34D sets out exceptions to this subsection.

Note 2:       Section 161 may require an interested person for an approved active constituent to give the APVMA information in connection with the constituent, even though this table does not deal with that requirement.

             (2)  This section applies only to information given to the APVMA:

                     (a)  in connection with an application made after the commencement of this section; or

                     (b)  under section 161 in connection with a chemical product that was registered as a result of an application made after the commencement of this section.

             (3)  The use of information in contravention of subsection (1) for making a decision does not affect the validity of the decision.

             (4)  An action or proceeding does not lie against any of the following for any loss directly or indirectly sustained because of the use of information in contravention of subsection (1):

                     (a)  the Commonwealth;

                     (b)  the APVMA;

                     (c)  a person who is or has been:

                              (i)  a director of the APVMA; or

                             (ii)  the Chief Executive Officer of the APVMA; or

                            (iii)  a delegate of the APVMA; or

                            (iv)  a member of the staff of the APVMA.

#### Subdivision C—Exceptions to limits on use of information

##### <a id="34D"></a>34D  Exceptions

             (1)  Section 34C does not prevent the APVMA from using information for making a decision:

                     (a)  under section 14 or 29 about an application; or

                     (b)  under section 34 about a reconsideration of an approval or registration;

if a condition in subsection (2), (3), (4), (5) or (6) of this section is met.

Evidence of consent for use

             (2)  One condition is that the applicant, an approved person or the interested person for the approval or registration gives the APVMA a written statement by the authorising party of that party’s consent to the APVMA using the information for making the decision. This condition is met even if the authorising party:

                     (a)  later states that it has not consented; or

                     (b)  withdraws the consent (whether before or after the APVMA is given the statement of consent).

Note:          Chapter 7 of the _Criminal Code_ creates offences relating to false and misleading statements and forgery.

Use in the public interest

             (3)  Another condition is that the APVMA is satisfied, having regard to the criteria (if any) prescribed by the regulations, that the use of the information is in the public interest.

Note:          Section 34E sets out other rules that are relevant to the exception based on this condition.

Information does not favour the applicant or interested person

             (4)  Another condition is that:

                     (a)  the decision relates to:

                              (i)  a proposed or existing approval of an active constituent for a proposed or existing chemical product; or

                             (ii)  a proposed or existing registration of a proposed or existing chemical product; and

                     (b)  the information meets a condition in paragraph 160A(4)(b) or (c) or 161(2)(b) or (c) (which are about showing that use or dealing with the product may have adverse effects or that the product may be ineffective), whether or not the information was given to the APVMA under section 160A or 161.

Identical information whose use is not limited

             (5)  Another condition is that the APVMA is satisfied that there is identical information, or information to the same effect, whose use is not prevented by section 14B or 34C or Part 3.

Information given to APVMA in connection with certain applications

             (6)  Another condition is that the application mentioned in subsection 34C(1) was one of the following:

                     (a)  an application for approval, as an active constituent for a chemical product, of a substance that was a previously endorsed active constituent on the commencement of this Division;

                     (b)  an application for the variation of the relevant particulars or conditions of the approval of an active constituent for a chemical product;

                     (c)  an application for the registration of a companion animal product each active constituent for which was a previously endorsed active constituent at the time of the preliminary assessment of the application under section 11A;

                     (d)  an application for variation of the relevant particulars or conditions of the registration of a companion animal product;

                     (e)  an application for the approval of a label for a container for a companion animal product each active constituent of which was a previously endorsed active constituent at the time of the preliminary assessment of the application under section 11A;

                      (f)  an application for variation of the relevant particulars or conditions of the approval of a label for a container for a companion animal product.

##### <a id="34E"></a>34E  Further rules about public interest exception

             (1)  This section applies if the APVMA is satisfied under subsection 34D(3) that it is in the public interest to use information that section 34C would otherwise prohibit the APVMA from using for making a decision:

                     (a)  under section 14 or 29 about an application; or

                     (b)  under section 34 about a reconsideration of an approval or registration.

             (2)  As soon as practicable after becoming satisfied, the APVMA must give written notice of its satisfaction to:

                     (a)  the applicant, an approved person or the interested person for the approval or registration; and

                     (b)  the person whom the APVMA believes is the authorising party for the information.

             (3)  Section 168 provides for additional matters to be included in the notice.

             (4)  The APVMA must not make the decision using the information before the end of 28 days after the day on which the notice is given.

             (5)  However, subsections (3) and (4) do not apply if:

                     (a)  the APVMA believes it is necessary to make the decision before the end of 28 days after the notice is given, to prevent imminent risk to public health or occupational health or safety; and

                     (b)  states that belief in the notice.

#### Subdivision D—Period of limit on use of information

##### <a id="34F"></a>34F  Period of limit on future use of information relied on in granting application

             (1)  Subsection 34C(1) prohibits the APVMA from using, during the period described in an item of the following table, information that:

                     (a)  was given to the APVMA by the applicant or an approved person in connection with an application described in the item; and

                     (b)  was given as required by the APVMA or section 160A; and

                     (c)  was relied on by the APVMA to grant the application.

The period starts when the application was granted.

The permit does not have any practical operation unless a law of this jurisdiction permits the thing to be done by the holder of such a permit.<o:p></o:p>

             (2)  Examples of circumstances in which a permit could be sought are:<o:p></o:p>

                     (a)  if someone wants to conduct a trial or experiment in relation to a constituent that is not an approved constituent, or in relation to a chemical product that is not a registered chemical product, a registered listed chemical product or a reserved chemical product, in order to decide whether to make an application for approval, registration or listed registration; or<o:p></o:p>

                     (b)  if someone wants to use a registered chemical product in a way that is not authorised by the approved label for containers for the product; or<o:p></o:p>

                     (c)  if someone wants to use a registered listed chemical product in a way that is not authorised by the labels for containers for the product as required by the standard approved for the product.<o:p></o:p>
