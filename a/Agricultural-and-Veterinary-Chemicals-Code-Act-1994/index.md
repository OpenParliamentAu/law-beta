## An Act to make provision for the evaluation, registration and control of agricultural and veterinary chemical products, and for related matters, for the purposes of the _Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1994_

RECOGNISING:

                            (a)  that the protection of the health and safety of human beings, animals and the environment is essential to the well-being of society and can be enhanced by putting in place a system to regulate agricultural chemical products and veterinary chemical products; and

                     (b)  that the principle of ecologically sustainable development requires a regulatory system that is designed to ensure that the use of such products at the present time will not impair the prospects of future generations; and

                     (c)  that the furthering of trade and commerce between Australia and places outside Australia, and the present and future economic viability and competitiveness of primary industry and of a domestic industry for manufacturing and formulating such products, are essential for the well being of the economy and require a system for regulating such products that is cost effective, efficient, predictable, adaptive and responsive; and

                     (d)  that it is desirable to establish a regulatory system that is open and accountable and gives opportunity for public input with respect to the regulation of such products; and

                     (e)  that the system should, so far as practicable, be uniform throughout Australia; and

                      (f)  that uniformity could best be achieved by the enactment of legislation by the Parliament of the Commonwealth as a law for the government of the Australian Capital Territory and the adoption of that legislation by the Parliaments and legislatures of the States and the Northern Territory:

             (6)  In considering whether to make an order under subsection (1), the Minister must have regard to:

                     (a)  the effect that the order would have for the purposes of the Agvet Code of each jurisdiction other than the participating Territories because of a law of that jurisdiction that corresponds to the _Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1994_; and

                     (b)  the fact that section 48 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ would apply in relation to the order because of subsection (3) of this section.

             (7)  Subject to subsection (8), in an order, unless the contrary intention appears, an expression has the same meaning as it has in the Agvet Code of the participating Territories.

             (8)  In a provision of an order that has effect for the purposes of a particular provision of the Agvet Code of the participating Territories, unless the contrary intention appears, an expression has the same meaning as it has in that provision of that Code.

             (9)  An order is to be interpreted subject to the Agvet Code of the participating Territories and it is intended that if, apart from this subsection, a provision of an order would have been interpreted as being inconsistent with that Code, the provision is nevertheless to be valid in so far as it is not so inconsistent.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Compensation

             (1)  In this section:

                    <a name="acquisit-properti"></a>**_acquisition of property_** has the same meaning as in paragraph 51(xxxi) of the Constitution.

             (2)  If the operation of, or the doing of any act by the APVMA under, the Agvet Code of the participating Territories results in the acquisition of property from a person, the Commonwealth is liable to pay to the person such compensation as is agreed upon between them or, in the absence of agreement, as is determined by the Supreme Court of a participating Territory in an action brought in that Court by the person against the Commonwealth.

Note 1:       Section 34D sets out exceptions to this subsection.

Note 2:       Section 161 may require an interested person for an approved active constituent to give the APVMA information in connection with the constituent, even though this table does not deal with that requirement.

             (2)  This section applies only to information given to the APVMA:

                     (a)  in connection with an application made after the commencement of this section; or

                     (b)  under section 161 in connection with a chemical product that was registered as a result of an application made after the commencement of this section.

             (3)  The use of information in contravention of subsection (1) for making a decision does not affect the validity of the decision.

             (4)  An action or proceeding does not lie against any of the following for any loss directly or indirectly sustained because of the use of information in contravention of subsection (1):

                     (a)  the Commonwealth;

                     (b)  the APVMA;

                     (c)  a person who is or has been:

                              (i)  a director of the APVMA; or

                             (ii)  the Chief Executive Officer of the APVMA; or

                            (iii)  a delegate of the APVMA; or

                            (iv)  a member of the staff of the APVMA.

#### Subdivision C—Exceptions to limits on use of information

##### <a id="34D"></a>34D  Exceptions

             (1)  Section 34C does not prevent the APVMA from using information for making a decision:

                     (a)  under section 14 or 29 about an application; or

                     (b)  under section 34 about a reconsideration of an approval or registration;

if a condition in subsection (2), (3), (4), (5) or (6) of this section is met.

Evidence of consent for use

             (2)  One condition is that the applicant, an approved person or the interested person for the approval or registration gives the APVMA a written statement by the authorising party of that party’s consent to the APVMA using the information for making the decision. This condition is met even if the authorising party:

                     (a)  later states that it has not consented; or

                     (b)  withdraws the consent (whether before or after the APVMA is given the statement of consent).

Note:          Chapter 7 of the _Criminal Code_ creates offences relating to false and misleading statements and forgery.

Use in the public interest

             (3)  Another condition is that the APVMA is satisfied, having regard to the criteria (if any) prescribed by the regulations, that the use of the information is in the public interest.

Note:          Section 34E sets out other rules that are relevant to the exception based on this condition.

Information does not favour the applicant or interested person

             (4)  Another condition is that:

                     (a)  the decision relates to:

                              (i)  a proposed or existing approval of an active constituent for a proposed or existing chemical product; or

                             (ii)  a proposed or existing registration of a proposed or existing chemical product; and

                     (b)  the information meets a condition in paragraph 160A(4)(b) or (c) or 161(2)(b) or (c) (which are about showing that use or dealing with the product may have adverse effects or that the product may be ineffective), whether or not the information was given to the APVMA under section 160A or 161.

Identical information whose use is not limited

             (5)  Another condition is that the APVMA is satisfied that there is identical information, or information to the same effect, whose use is not prevented by section 14B or 34C or Part 3.

Information given to APVMA in connection with certain applications

             (6)  Another condition is that the application mentioned in subsection 34C(1) was one of the following:

                     (a)  an application for approval, as an active constituent for a chemical product, of a substance that was a previously endorsed active constituent on the commencement of this Division;

                     (b)  an application for the variation of the relevant particulars or conditions of the approval of an active constituent for a chemical product;

                     (c)  an application for the registration of a companion animal product each active constituent for which was a previously endorsed active constituent at the time of the preliminary assessment of the application under section 11A;

                     (d)  an application for variation of the relevant particulars or conditions of the registration of a companion animal product;

                     (e)  an application for the approval of a label for a container for a companion animal product each active constituent of which was a previously endorsed active constituent at the time of the preliminary assessment of the application under section 11A;

                      (f)  an application for variation of the relevant particulars or conditions of the approval of a label for a container for a companion animal product.

##### <a id="34E"></a>34E  Further rules about public interest exception

             (1)  This section applies if the APVMA is satisfied under subsection 34D(3) that it is in the public interest to use information that section 34C would otherwise prohibit the APVMA from using for making a decision:

                     (a)  under section 14 or 29 about an application; or

                     (b)  under section 34 about a reconsideration of an approval or registration.

             (2)  As soon as practicable after becoming satisfied, the APVMA must give written notice of its satisfaction to:

                     (a)  the applicant, an approved person or the interested person for the approval or registration; and

                     (b)  the person whom the APVMA believes is the authorising party for the information.

             (3)  Section 168 provides for additional matters to be included in the notice.

             (4)  The APVMA must not make the decision using the information before the end of 28 days after the day on which the notice is given.

             (5)  However, subsections (3) and (4) do not apply if:

                     (a)  the APVMA believes it is necessary to make the decision before the end of 28 days after the notice is given, to prevent imminent risk to public health or occupational health or safety; and

                     (b)  states that belief in the notice.

#### Subdivision D—Period of limit on use of information

##### <a id="34F"></a>34F  Period of limit on future use of information relied on in granting application

             (1)  Subsection 34C(1) prohibits the APVMA from using, during the period described in an item of the following table, information that:

                     (a)  was given to the APVMA by the applicant or an approved person in connection with an application described in the item; and

                     (b)  was given as required by the APVMA or section 160A; and

                     (c)  was relied on by the APVMA to grant the application.

The period starts when the application was granted.

### Division 3—Mediation or arbitration as to terms of compensation

##### <a id="62"></a>62  Application of Division

             (1)  This Division applies if:

                     (a)  there is only one primary applicant and the primary applicant is unable to agree with the secondary applicant as to the terms of the compensation to be paid by the secondary applicant to the primary applicant; or

                     (b)  there are 2 or more primary applicants and none of them is able to agree with the secondary applicant as to the terms of the compensation to be paid by the secondary applicant to the primary applicant concerned;

and the secondary applicant has notified the APVMA in writing of the failure to reach agreement.

             (2)  If the secondary applicant tells the APVMA at any time during the course of any negotiations, mediation or arbitration under this Division that the secondary applicant no longer wants any further action to be taken under this Division for the purposes of the secondary application, this Division ceases to apply in relation to that application.

##### <a id="63"></a>63  Mediation

             (1)  The APVMA must appoint a person as a mediator to try to help the parties to the negotiations to reach agreement as to the terms of the compensation.

                     (c)  resigns his or her appointment; or

                     (d)  for any other reason refuses or fails to perform, or to complete the performance of, his or her functions as required by this section;

the APVMA may appoint another person as mediator in place of the first-mentioned person.

             (4)  If another mediator is appointed under subsection (3), the period of 14 days referred to in paragraph (2)(c) is taken to have begun from the appointment of the first mediator but that period does not include any period after the occurrence of an event referred to in subsection (3) and before the appointment of the other mediator.

##### <a id="64"></a>64  Appointment of arbitrator

             (1)  If the mediation has ceased without the parties having reached agreement as to the terms of the compensation, the APVMA must appoint a person as an arbitrator to determine those terms in accordance with any reasonable proposals that were made in the course of the negotiations (including negotiations during the period of the mediation).

the APVMA may appoint another person as arbitrator in place of the first-mentioned person.

##### <a id="65"></a>65  Determination of compensation on the basis of proposals made during negotiations

             (1)  The arbitrator must consider the proposals as to the terms of the compensation that were made by the parties to the negotiations or each of the negotiations.

             (2)  If a party to any negotiations made a proposal as to the terms of the compensation that the arbitrator considers to be reasonable and the other party failed to make any proposal as to those terms or failed to make a proposal that the arbitrator considers to be reasonable, the arbitrator must determine those terms in accordance with the first-mentioned proposal.

             (3)  If each party to any negotiations made proposals as to the terms of the compensation that the arbitrator considers to be reasonable, the arbitrator must determine those terms in accordance with whichever of those proposals the arbitrator considers to be the most reasonable.

##### <a id="66"></a>66  Arbitrator may require fresh proposals

                   If each party to any negotiations failed to make any proposal as to the terms of the compensation or failed to make a proposal as to those terms that the arbitrator considers to be reasonable, the arbitrator must give written notice to each of them requiring them to make fresh proposals to the arbitrator as to the terms of the compensation.

##### <a id="67"></a>67  Determination on basis of fresh proposals

             (1)  If a party to an arbitration makes a fresh proposal as to the terms of the compensation that the arbitrator considers to be reasonable and the other party fails to make any fresh proposal as to those terms or fails to make a fresh proposal that the arbitrator considers to be reasonable, the arbitrator must determine those terms in accordance with the first-mentioned proposal.

             (2)  If each party to an arbitration makes fresh proposals as to the terms of the compensation that the arbitrator considers to be reasonable, the arbitrator must determine those terms in accordance with whichever of those proposals the arbitrator considers to be the most reasonable.

##### <a id="68"></a>68  What happens if fresh proposals are not made or are inadequate

                   If each party to an arbitration fails, within a reasonable period, to make a fresh proposal as to the terms of the compensation or to make a fresh proposal as to those terms that the arbitrator considers to be reasonable, the arbitrator must give written notice of the failure to the APVMA and, upon the giving of the notice, section 39 permits the APVMA to suspend the registration of the primary product or any of the primary products or of the secondary product, or both or all of them.

##### <a id="69"></a>69  What constitutes a reasonable proposal for compensation

             (1)  A proposal as to the terms of the compensation is taken to be reasonable if, and only if, the arbitrator is satisfied that:

                     (a)  it provides for an amount or amounts to be paid by the secondary applicant to a primary applicant; and

                     (b)  the amount or amounts represent a fair proportion of:

                              (i)  the amount of the cost incurred by that primary applicant in obtaining the protected information excluding any part of that cost that relates to information that was obtained from a Government or public authority, whether in Australia or elsewhere, or was otherwise publicly available; or

                             (ii)  if the protected information was obtained by that primary applicant before the APVMA required that applicant to give that information to the APVMA—a lesser amount than the amount worked out under subparagraph (i) that is appropriate having regard to the period between the time when that information was so obtained and the time when it was given to the APVMA.

             (2)  The question as to what is a fair proportion of an amount referred to in subparagraph (1)(b)(i) or (ii) is to be determined by the arbitrator having regard to any matters that are prescribed by the regulations and any other matters that he or she considers appropriate.

             (3)  For the purposes of subsection (1), the amount of the cost incurred by a primary applicant in obtaining protected information comprises:

                     (a)  all relevant costs incurred by that primary applicant in obtaining that information (taking into account the practices generally engaged in by persons conducting tests or laboratory experiments of the kinds used to obtain information of the kind concerned) and including, without limiting the above:

                              (i)  the direct and indirect costs of planning, conducting, and analysing the results of, tests and laboratory experiments and giving the information to the APVMA; and

                             (ii)  the cost of repeating, or redoing with modifications, tests or laboratory experiments if it was appropriate to repeat or redo them; and

                            (iii)  if the tests or laboratory experiments were conducted by the use of equipment of that primary applicant—depreciation on that equipment; and

                            (iv)  any other prescribed costs; and

                     (b)  a reasonable rate of interest on the amount worked out under paragraph (a).

             (4)  The reference in paragraph (3)(a) to all relevant costs incurred by a primary applicant includes, if the primary applicant is a body corporate, an appropriate portion of any relevant costs incurred by another body corporate that is related to the primary applicant.

             (5)  The question whether 2 bodies corporate are related to each other is to be determined in the same way as for the purposes of the _Corporations Act 2001_.

##### <a id="70"></a>70  Effect and enforcement of determination by arbitrator

             (1)  If the arbitrator makes a determination or determinations as to the terms of the compensation to be paid by the secondary applicant to a primary applicant or primary applicants, the following provisions apply.

             (2)  The arbitrator must:

                     (a)  send the determination, or each determination, to the APVMA; and

                     (b)  give to the primary applicant and secondary applicant to whom a determination relates a copy of the determination certified by the arbitrator to be a true copy.

             (3)  If there is only one such determination and the secondary applicant gives written notice to the primary applicant stating that the secondary applicant agrees to comply with the determination, the secondary applicant is liable to pay compensation to the primary applicant in accordance with the determination.

             (4)  If there are 2 or more such determinations and the secondary applicant gives written notice to the primary applicant to whom one of those determinations relates stating that the secondary applicant agrees to comply with that determination, the secondary applicant is liable to pay compensation to that primary applicant in accordance with that determination.

             (5)  If the secondary applicant to whom a determination relates gives notice under subsection (3) or (4) to the primary applicant to whom that determination relates, that secondary applicant must give a copy of the notice to the APVMA.

                    Penalty:  10 penalty units.

          (5A)  Subsection (5) does not apply if the secondary applicant has a reasonable excuse.

Note:          The defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in subsection (5A). See subsection 13.3(3) of the _Criminal Code_.

          (5B)  An offence under subsection (5) is an offence of strict liability.

Note:          For strict liability, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

             (6)  If a primary applicant to whom a determination by the arbitrator relates receives a notice under subsection (3) or (4) by the secondary applicant to whom that determination relates, that primary applicant may lodge a copy of the determination certified by the arbitrator, together with the notice, with a court having jurisdiction to the extent of the total amount of compensation payable under the determination and, when the determination and application have been so lodged, the determination may be enforced as a final judgment of that court.

##### <a id="71"></a>71  Regulations to govern conduct of arbitration

             (1)  The regulations may make rules governing the conduct of an arbitration under this section.

             (2)  The regulations may provide that rules so made apply to the exclusion of any law of this jurisdiction relating to the conduct of commercial arbitrations.

             (6)  Upon receiving the documents referred to in subsection (5), the magistrate must attach to them the warrant signed by the magistrate and deal with the documents in the manner in which the magistrate would have dealt with the information if the application for the warrant had been made in accordance with section 133.

             (7)  A form of warrant duly completed by an inspector in accordance with subsection (4) is, if it is in accordance with the terms of the warrant signed by the magistrate, authority for any entry, search, seizure or direction that the warrant so signed authorises.

             (8)  If it is material, in any proceedings, for a court to be satisfied that an entry, search, seizure or direction was authorised in accordance with this section, and the warrant signed by a magistrate in accordance with this section authorising the entry, search, seizure or direction is not produced in evidence, the court must assume, unless the contrary is proved, that the entry, search, seizure or direction was not authorised by such a warrant.
