Minister and regulations may provide otherwise

(4)        The Minister may, by writing, determine that subitem (1), (2) or (3):

                     (a)  does not apply in relation to a specified reference; or

                     (b)  applies as if:

                             (ii)  in the case of subitem (2)—the reference in that subitem to the Commonwealth were a reference to the CEO; or

                            (iii)  in the case of subitem (3)—the reference in that subitem to the Commission were a reference to the CEO.

A determination under this subitem has effect accordingly.

(5)        The regulations may provide that an instrument containing a reference specified in a determination under paragraph (4)(a) has effect from the commencement time as if:

                     (a)  in the case of an instrument covered by subitem (1)—the reference were a reference to a specified person or body other than the Commonwealth or the CEO; or

                     (b)  in the case of an instrument covered by subitem (2)—the reference were a reference to a specified person or body other than the Commonwealth or the CEO; or

                     (c)  in the case of an instrument covered by subitem (3)—the reference were a reference to a specified person or body other than the Commission or the CEO.

## 9  Operation of laws

Things done by Centre or Director taken to be done by CEO

(1)        If, before the commencement time, a thing was done by, or in relation to, the Centre or the Director, then, for the purposes of the operation of any law of the Commonwealth after the commencement time, the thing is taken to have been done by, or in relation to, the CEO.

(2)        For the purposes of subitem (1), a thing done before the commencement time under a provision that is amended by this Act has effect from that time as if it were done under that provision as amended. However, this is not taken to change the time at which the thing was actually done.

Minister and regulations may provide otherwise

(3)        The Minister may, by writing, determine that subitem (1):

                     (a)  does not apply in relation to a specified thing done by, or in relation to, the Centre or the Director; or

                     (b)  applies as if the reference in that subitem to the CEO were a reference to the Commonwealth.

A determination under this subitem has effect accordingly.

(4)        The regulations may provide for a thing specified in a determination under paragraph (3)(a) to be taken to have been done by, or in relation to, a specified person or body other than the Commonwealth or the CEO.

Meaning of **doing**

(5)        To avoid doubt, for the purposes of this item, **_doing_** a thing includes making an instrument.

Determinations are not legislative instruments

(6)        A determination made under subitem (3) is not a legislative instrument.

## 10  Reporting requirements

Future reporting requirements

(1)        If:

                     (a)  immediately before the commencement time, a law required the Centre, the Director or the Board to provide a report (whether financial statements or otherwise) for a period; and

                     (b)  the period ends after the commencement time;

the CEO must provide the report, as required, for so much of the period as occurs before the commencement time.

(2)        If:

                     (a)  under subitem (1), the CEO is required to provide a report for a part of a period; and

                     (b)  the CEO is also required to provide a similar report for the remainder of the period;

the CEO may meet the requirements in a single report for the period.

Outstanding reporting requirements

(3)        If:

                     (a)  a law required the Centre, the Director or the Board to provide a report (whether financial statements or otherwise) for a period that ended before the commencement time; and

                     (b)  the report has not been provided by the commencement time;

the CEO must provide the report as required.

Application of law to CEO

(4)        To avoid doubt, if, under this item, the CEO is required to provide a report under a law, the law applies to the CEO in respect of the report in the same way as the law would have applied to the Centre, the Director or the Board in respect of the report.

## 11  CEO

(1)        The person holding office as the Director under section 24 of the old law immediately before the commencement time is taken, at the commencement time, to have been duly appointed as the CEO by the Governor-General under section 24 of the new law:

## 16  Constitutional safety net—acquisition of property

(1)        If the operation of this Schedule would result in an acquisition of property from a person otherwise than on just terms, the Commonwealth is liable to pay a reasonable amount of compensation to the person.

(2)        If the Commonwealth and the person do not agree on the amount of the compensation, the person may institute proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction for the recovery from the Commonwealth of such reasonable amount of compensation as the court determines.

(3)        In this item:
