                     (a)  the employee continues to be employed by Qantas or a Qantas subsidiary (**_the employer_**) so that the employee’s period of service is at least 10 years; or

                     (b)  the employee is to cease to be an employee of the employer, otherwise than because of the employee’s death, on or after the employee reaches the minimum retiring age and the employee’s period of service with the employer is not less than one year; or

                     (c)  the employee is to cease to be an employee of the employer because of retrenchment and the employee’s period of service with the employer is not less than one year;

             (2)  Subject to subsections (6) and (7), if, immediately before the commencement of Part 5, the period of service of an employee of Australian Airlines, for the purposes of the Long Service Leave Act, is less than 10 years, then, if:

the employer must make a payment to the employee of an amount equal to the amount of full salary that would be payable to the employee for a period of long service leave equal to the period of the employee’s long service leave credit under subsection (3A) immediately before the employee ceases to be an employee as if salary were payable to the employee in respect of that period.

             (3)  For the purposes of subsection (1), an employee’s long service leave credit is equal to the long service leave credit that the employee would have under the Long Service Leave Act for the period:

the employer must authorise payment to a dependant of the employee of an amount equal to, or to 2 or more dependants of the employee of amounts aggregating, the amount that would have been payable to the employee under subsection (2) if the employee had, on the day on which the employee died, ceased to be an employee, otherwise than because of the employee’s death, on or after reaching the minimum retiring age.

             (9)  If subsection (8) applies, section 23 of the Long Service Leave Act has effect as if:

                     (a)  that section applied to an employee of Qantas or a Qantas subsidiary; and

                     (b)  a reference in that section to the approving authority were a reference to Qantas or a Qantas subsidiary; and
