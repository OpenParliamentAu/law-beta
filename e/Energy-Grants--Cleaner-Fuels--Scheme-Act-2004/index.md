## Part 2—Entitlement to cleaner fuel grants

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Becoming provisionally entitled to a cleaner fuel grant

             (1)  You are provisionally entitled to a cleaner fuel grant for a quantity of fuel if:

                     (a)  the fuel is:

                              (i)  imported into Australia; or

                             (ii)  manufactured in Australia;

                            on or after the fuel’s start day; and

                     (b)  one of the following subparagraphs applies to you:

                              (i)  you imported the fuel into Australia;

                             (ii)  you manufactured the fuel in Australia;

                            (iii)  you bought the fuel from such an importer or manufacturer;

                            (iv)  you bought the fuel from a licensed person for the fuel;

                             (v)  you arranged for the fuel to be manufactured in Australia on your behalf; and

                     (c)  at a particular time (the **_qualifying time_**):

                              (i)  you enter the fuel; or

                             (ii)  if someone else has already entered the fuel, you consume or finally sell the fuel; and

                     (d)  the qualifying time happens before the end of the fuel’s end day; and

                     (e)  if you did not import the fuel into Australia, you are a licensed person for the fuel at the qualifying time; and

                      (f)  the fuel is a cleaner fuel at the qualifying time; and

                     (g)  at or before the qualifying time you did not:

                              (i)  sell the fuel to a licensed person for the fuel; or

                             (ii)  include the fuel in a fuel blend; and

                     (h)  no other provisional entitlement for the fuel arose before the qualifying time; and

Note:       Previous provisional entitlements disqualified under section 7 are taken never to have existed.

                      (i)  each requirement (if any) prescribed by the regulations is satisfied.

             (2)  However, you are not provisionally entitled to a cleaner fuel grant for the quantity of fuel if:

                     (a)  at the qualifying time, the fuel contained one or more other cleaner fuels; and

                     (b)  for each of those other cleaner fuels, a provisional entitlement arose before the qualifying time.

Note:          Previous provisional entitlements disqualified under section 7 are taken never to have existed.

             (3)  Your provisional entitlement arises at the qualifying time.

             (4)  For the purposes of this section, you **_consume or finally sell the fuel_** if:

                     (a)  you form an intention that the fuel is to be consumed in carrying on your enterprise, other than:

                              (i)  by inclusion in a fuel blend; or

                             (ii)  by being sold, or otherwise provided, to another person; or

                     (b)  you sell the fuel to a person who is not a licensed person for the fuel at the time of the sale.

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Becoming entitled to a cleaner fuel grant

             (1)  You are entitled to a cleaner fuel grant for a quantity of fuel if:

                     (a)  you are provisionally entitled to the grant for the fuel; and

                     (b)  you make a claim for payment of the grant for the fuel; and

                     (c)  at the time you make the claim, you are registered under section 9 of the _Product Grants and Benefits Administration Act 2000_ for entitlement to such a grant.

Note:          Subsection 15(1) of the _Product Grants and Benefits Administration Act 2000_ has an additional requirement for entitlement. That subsection has the effect of requiring your claim to be made for a period that includes the qualifying time.

             (2)  Your entitlement is taken to have arisen at the qualifying time.

             (3)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(c), if you make a claim:

                     (a)  after, or at the same time as, you apply for registration; but

                     (b)  before you are registered;

the claim is taken to have been made immediately after you are registered.

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Disqualifying circumstances

             (1)  You are not provisionally entitled, and are taken never to have been provisionally entitled, to a cleaner fuel grant in respect of a quantity of cleaner fuel if, after the qualifying time:

                     (a)  you sell the fuel to a licensed person for the fuel; or

                     (b)  you include the fuel in a fuel blend; or

Note:       This paragraph does not prevent a provisional entitlement later arising for the fuel blend if it is also a cleaner fuel.

                     (c)  the Commissioner makes a determination under subsection 34(1) of the _Product Grants and Benefits Administration Act 2000_ in relation to a scheme involving you and the fuel; or

                     (d)  regulations made for the purposes of this paragraph apply to you.

Note:          Entitlements can also be disqualified under Parts 5 and 6 of the _Product Grants and Benefits Administration Act 2000_.

             (2)  This section has effect despite any other provision of this Part.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Grant amounts

             (1)  If you are entitled to a cleaner fuel grant for a quantity of biodiesel, CNG, ethanol, LNG, LPG, methanol or renewable diesel, the amount of your grant is worked out in accordance with the regulations by reference to the rate (the **_offset rate_**) set out in the following table.
