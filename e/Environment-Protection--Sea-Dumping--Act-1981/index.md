             (4)  Where, in his or her preliminary consideration of an application for a permit for dumping or artificial reef placement, the Minister forms the view that, in order to enable him or her to decide whether a permit should be granted or not, or to formulate conditions that should be imposed in respect of a permit if a permit is granted, it will be necessary for research or analysis to be undertaken to determine the effect that the proposed dumping or artificial reef placement may have on the marine environment, the Minister, before giving further consideration to the application, may require the applicant to enter into an agreement with the Commonwealth that includes provisions of any, or all, of the following kinds:

                     (a)  a provision that the applicant will, at his or her own expense, undertake such research or analysis as is specified in the agreement, being research or analysis relating to the effect that the proposed dumping or artificial reef placement might have on the marine environment;
