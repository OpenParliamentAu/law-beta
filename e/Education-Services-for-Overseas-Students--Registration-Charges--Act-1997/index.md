**Notes** 

## An Act to impose registration charges in relation to the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students

##### <a id="1"></a>1  Short title [_see_ Note 1]

                   This Act may be cited as the _Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Act 1997_.

##### <a id="2"></a>2  Commencement [_see_ Note 1]

                   This Act commences on the day on which the _Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Amendment Act (No. 1) 1997_ commences.

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Crown to be bound

                   This Act binds the Crown in each of its capacities.

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Interpretation

                   An expression used in this Act that is also used in the _Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000_ has the same meaning as in that Act, unless the contrary intention appears.

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Annual registration charge

             (1)  A provider who is a registered provider on 1 January of a year is liable to pay an annual registration charge for the year.

Note:          This section extends to a registered provider whose registration has been suspended.

             (2)  The amount of the charge for the provider for the year is the sum of:

                     (a)  $300; and

                     (b)  $25 multiplied by the total enrolments for the provider in the previous year.

Note 1:       The dollar amounts are indexed under section 7 for 2005 and later years.

Note 2:       A dollar amount may be different if an instrument under section 5A is in force.

             (3)  The **_total enrolments_** for a provider in a year is worked out by adding together the number of enrolments of overseas students for each course provided by the provider in the year.

             (4)  When working out the enrolments for a course for a year:

                     (a)  for a course of at least 26 weeks duration—each student who is enrolled in the course at any time during the year counts as one enrolment; and

                     (b)  for a course of less than 26 weeks duration—each student who is enrolled in the course at any time during the year counts as 0.5 of an enrolment.

             (5)  For the purposes of this section, a course that spans 2 or more years is taken to be a separate course in each of those years.

##### <a id="5A"></a>5A  Variation of annual registration charge

             (1)  The Governor-General may make a written instrument providing that:

                     (a)  a dollar amount specified in paragraph 5(2)(a) or (b) is replaced by the dollar amount specified in the instrument; or

                     (b)  the dollar amounts specified in paragraphs 5(2)(a) and (b) are replaced by the dollar amounts specified in the instrument.

             (2)  The instrument must be expressed to apply to the first year beginning after it is made and all later years.

             (3)  The instrument may provide that a replacement dollar amount or amounts apply to one class of provider only, or may provide different replacement dollar amounts for different classes of provider.

             (4)  The Minister must table a copy of the instrument in each House of the Parliament as soon as practicable.

             (5)  If each House of the Parliament passes a resolution approving the instrument, then, for each class of provider that the instrument relates to, the amount of annual registration charge payable for the relevant years is worked out using the replacement dollar amount or amounts specified in the instrument instead of the dollar amount or amounts that would otherwise have applied.

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Initial registration charge

             (1)  Before becoming registered, a provider is liable to pay an initial registration charge.

Note:          A provider is liable to pay the initial registration charge each time the provider becomes registered.

             (2)  The amount of the charge for a registration is worked out using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2007C00008/Html/EducSerOSStuRC1997_WD02_image002.gif)

where:

                    <a name="remain-month"></a>**_remaining months_** means the number of complete months that remain in the year after the provider becomes registered.

Note:          The amount of the charge is indexed under section 7 for 1998 and later years.

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Indexation of amounts

             (1)  This section applies for the purpose of working out the amount of initial registration charge for any year (the **_current year_**) after 2004.

          (1A)  This section also applies for the purpose of working out the amount of annual registration charge for any year (also called the **_current year_**) after 2004, unless that year is the first year to which a particular section 5A instrument applies.

Note:          The reason for the exception is that the possibility of indexation for that year can be taken into account in making the instrument, so there is no need for this section to apply as well.

             (2)  The dollar amounts specified in subsection 5(2) or in an instrument in effect under section 5A, and the amount specified in the formula in subsection 6(2), are to be adjusted for the current year by multiplying the amounts that applied to the year before the current year by the indexation factor worked out using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2007C00008/Html/EducSerOSStuRC1997_WD02_image003.gif)

where:

                    <a name="index-number"></a>**_index number_**, for a quarter, means the All Groups Consumer Price Index number that is the weighted average of the 8 capital cities and is published by the Australian Statistician for that quarter.

                    <a name="recent-septemb-quarter"></a>**_recent September quarter_** means the September quarter in the year before the current year.

                    <a name="previou-septemb-quarter"></a>**_previous September quarter_** means the September quarter before the recent September quarter.

             (3)  The indexation factor worked out under subsection (2) must be rounded up or down to 3 places (rounding up in the case of exactly halfway between).

             (4)  Amounts worked out under subsection (2) must be rounded to the nearest whole dollar (rounding up in the case of 50 cents).

             (5)  If at any time (whether before or after the commencement of this section) the Australian Statistician has changed or changes the reference base for the Consumer Price Index, then, for the 
 purposes of applying this section after the change, only index numbers published in terms of the new reference base are to be used.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Imposition of charges

                   The annual registration charge and the initial registration charge are imposed by this section.

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Transitional arrangements for 1997

                   If this Act does not commence before 1 January 1997, then subsection 5(1) applies for 1997 as if the reference in that subsection to “1 January of a year” were a reference to “the day this Act commenced”.
