## An Act relating to the protection of the environment and the conservation of biodiversity, and for related purposes

# Chapter 1—Preliminary

## Part 1—Preliminary

##### <a id="1"></a>1  Short title [_see_ Note 1]

                   This Act may be cited as the _Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999_.

##### <a id="2"></a>2  Commencement [_see_ Note 1]

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), this Act commences on a day to be fixed by Proclamation.

             (2)  If this Act does not commence under subsection (1) within the period of 12 months beginning on the day on which it receives the Royal Assent, it commences on the first day after the end of that period.

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Objects of Act

             (1)  The objects of this Act are:

                     (a)  to provide for the protection of the environment, especially those aspects of the environment that are matters of national environmental significance; and

                     (b)  to promote ecologically sustainable development through the conservation and ecologically sustainable use of natural resources; and

                     (c)  to promote the conservation of biodiversity; and

                    (ca)  to provide for the protection and conservation of heritage; and

                     (d)  to promote a co-operative approach to the protection and management of the environment involving governments, the community, land-holders and indigenous peoples; and

                     (e)  to assist in the co-operative implementation of Australia’s international environmental responsibilities; and

                      (f)  to recognise the role of indigenous people in the conservation and ecologically sustainable use of Australia’s biodiversity; and

                     (g)  to promote the use of indigenous peoples’ knowledge of biodiversity with the involvement of, and in co-operation with, the owners of the knowledge.

             (2)  In order to achieve its objects, the Act:

                     (a)  recognises an appropriate role for the Commonwealth in relation to the environment by focussing Commonwealth involvement on matters of national environmental significance and on Commonwealth actions and Commonwealth areas; and

                     (b)  strengthens intergovernmental co-operation, and minimises duplication, through bilateral agreements; and

                     (c)  provides for the intergovernmental accreditation of environmental assessment and approval processes; and

                     (d)  adopts an efficient and timely Commonwealth environmental assessment and approval process that will ensure activities that are likely to have significant impacts on the environment are properly assessed; and

                     (e)  enhances Australia’s capacity to ensure the conservation of its biodiversity by including provisions to:

                              (i)  protect native species (and in particular prevent the extinction, and promote the recovery, of threatened species) and ensure the conservation of migratory species; and

                             (ii)  establish an Australian Whale Sanctuary to ensure the conservation of whales and other cetaceans; and

                            (iii)  protect ecosystems by means that include the establishment and management of reserves, the recognition and protection of ecological communities and the promotion of off-reserve conservation measures; and

                            (iv)  identify processes that threaten all levels of biodiversity and implement plans to address these processes; and

                      (f)  includes provisions to enhance the protection, conservation and presentation of world heritage properties and the conservation and wise use of Ramsar wetlands of international importance; and

                    (fa)  includes provisions to identify places for inclusion in the National Heritage List and Commonwealth Heritage List and to enhance the protection, conservation and presentation of those places; and

                     (g)  promotes a partnership approach to environmental protection and biodiversity conservation through:

                              (i)  bilateral agreements with States and Territories; and

                             (ii)  conservation agreements with land-holders; and

                            (iii)  recognising and promoting indigenous peoples’ role in, and knowledge of, the conservation and ecologically sustainable use of biodiversity; and

                            (iv)  the involvement of the community in management planning.

##### <a id="3A"></a>3A  Principles of ecologically sustainable development

                   The following principles are **_principles of ecologically sustainable development_**:

                     (a)  decision-making processes should effectively integrate both long-term and short-term economic, environmental, social and equitable considerations;

                     (b)  if there are threats of serious or irreversible environmental damage, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to prevent environmental degradation;

                     (c)  the principle of inter-generational equity—that the present generation should ensure that the health, diversity and productivity of the environment is maintained or enhanced for the benefit of future generations;

                     (d)  the conservation of biological diversity and ecological integrity should be a fundamental consideration in decision-making;

                     (e)  improved valuation, pricing and incentive mechanisms should be promoted.

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Act to bind Crown

                   This Act binds the Crown in each of its capacities.

Definitions

             (5)  In this Act:

                    <a name="australian-aircraft"></a>**_Australian aircraft_** means:

                     (a)  an aircraft that is owned, possessed or controlled by:

                              (i)  the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth agency; or

                             (ii)  a State, a self-governing Territory or an agency of a State or self-governing Territory; or

                     (b)  an aircraft that is registered in Australia.

                    <a name="australian-jurisdict"></a>**_Australian jurisdiction_** means the land, waters, seabed and airspace in, under or above:

                     (a)  Australia; or

                     (b)  an external Territory; or

                     (c)  the exclusive economic zone; or

                     (d)  the continental shelf.

Note:          A reference to Australia or to an external Territory generally includes a reference to the coastal sea of Australia or the Territory (as appropriate). See section 15B of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

                    <a name="australian-vessel"></a>**_Australian vessel_** means:

                     (a)  a vessel that is owned, possessed or controlled by:

                              (i)  the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth agency; or

                             (ii)  a State, a self-governing Territory or an agency of a State or self-governing Territory; or

                     (b)  a vessel that is registered in Australia; or

                     (c)  a vessel that is flying the Australian flag.

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Extended application of Act to match extended management of fisheries under the _Fisheries Management Act 1991_

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  under the _Fisheries Management Act 1991_, a plan of management in force under that Act applies to particular fishing activities in a particular area of water; and

                     (b)  the area of water is not within, or is not wholly within:

                              (i)  the Australian jurisdiction; or

                             (ii)  a Commonwealth area; or

                            (iii)  a Commonwealth marine area; and

                     (c)  the area of water is not:

                              (i)  an area of water, rights in respect of which have been vested in a State by section 4 of the _Coastal Waters (State Title) Act 1980_ or in the Northern Territory by section 4 of the _Coastal Waters (Northern Territory Title) Act 1980_; or

                             (ii)  an area of water within the limits of a State or the Northern Territory.

             (2)  If, apart from this subsection, a provision of this Act would, or would not, apply in relation to the fishing activities (or in relation to fish or other things taken in the course of the activities) because the area of water mentioned in subsection (1) is not within, or is not wholly within:

                     (a)  the Australian jurisdiction; or

                     (b)  a Commonwealth area; or

                     (c)  a Commonwealth marine area;

that provision has effect in relation to the fishing activities (and in relation to fish or other things taken in the course of the activities) as if the area of water were wholly within:

                     (d)  the Australian jurisdiction; or

                     (e)  a Commonwealth area; or

                      (f)  a Commonwealth marine area;

as the case requires.

Note:          This section is subject to subsection 5(3).

Example 1: Fishing activities in an area of water that is not a Commonwealth area generally do not contravene Part 13\. However, because of this subsection, that Part applies to fishing activities to which this section applies as if the area of water were within a Commonwealth area. The fishing activities may therefore contravene that Part.

Example 2: If fish taken in the course of fishing activities in an area of water that is not within the Australian jurisdiction are brought into Australia, this generally constitutes an import (being an import by way of introduction from the sea) of the fish into Australia, which may contravene Part 13A. However, because of this subsection, that Part applies to the fish as if the area of water were within the Australian jurisdiction. The bringing of the fish into Australia therefore does not constitute an import for the purposes of that Part.

Example 3: This section allows a plan of management to be accredited under Part 13 in respect of the entire area of water to which the plan relates (even if some of the area is outside the Australian jurisdiction, a Commonwealth area or a Commonwealth marine area).

             (3)  In this section:

                    <a name="fish"></a>**_fishing_** has the same meaning as in the _Fisheries Management Act 1991_.

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Application of the _Criminal Code_

                   Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ (except Part 2.5) applies to all offences against this Act.

Note 1:       Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.

Note 2:       Part 2.5 of the _Criminal Code_ (which deals with corporate criminal responsibility) is excluded from applying to offences against this Act by subsection 498B(9).

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Native title rights not affected

             (1)  To avoid doubt, nothing in this Act affects the operation of section 211 of the _Native Title Act 1993_ in relation to a provision of this Act.

Note:          Section 211 of the _Native Title Act 1993_ provides that holders of native title rights covering certain activities do not need authorisation required by other laws to engage in those activities.

             (2)  This Act does not affect the operation of:

                     (a)  the _Aboriginal__Land__Rights (__Northern Territory__) Act 1976_; or

                     (b)  the _Native Title Act 1993_.

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Relationship with other Acts

Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976

          (1A)  Subsection 70(1) of the _Aboriginal__Land__Rights (__Northern Territory__) Act 1976_ does not prevent a person exercising powers or performing functions or duties under Division 4 or 5 of Part 15, or Division 5 of Part 19, of this Act from entering or remaining on land:

                     (a)  in the Kakadu region or Uluru region; and

                     (b)  in which an Aboriginal Land Trust established under that Act holds an estate in fee simple.

Airports Act 1996 not affected

             (1)  This Act does not affect the operation of the _Airports Act 1996_.

Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act 1980 not affected

             (2)  To avoid doubt, nothing in this Act affects the operation of subsection 7(1) of the _Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act 1980_ or regulations made for the purposes of that subsection.

##### <a id="10"></a>10  Relationship with State law

                   This Act is not intended to exclude or limit the concurrent operation of any law of a State or Territory, except so far as the contrary intention appears.

# Chapter 2—Protecting the environment

## Part 2—Simplified outline of this Chapter

##### <a id="11"></a>11  Simplified outline of this Chapter

                   The following is a simplified outline of this Chapter:

* * *

This Chapter provides a basis for the Minister to decide whether an action that has, will have or is likely to have a significant impact on certain aspects of the environment should proceed.

It does so by prohibiting a person from taking an action without the Minister having given approval or decided that approval is not needed. (Part 9 deals with the giving of approval.)

Approval is not needed to take an action if any of the following declare that the action does not need approval:

               (a)     a bilateral agreement between the Commonwealth and the State or Territory in which the action is taken;

               (b)     a declaration by the Minister.

Also, an action does not need approval if it is taken in accordance with Regional Forest Agreements or it is for a purpose for which, under a zoning plan for a zone made under the _Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975_, the zone may be used or entered without permission.

##### <a id="14"></a>14  Declaring a property to be a declared World Heritage property

Making declarations

             (1)  The Minister may declare a specified property to be a declared World Heritage property by notice in the _Gazette_ if:

                     (a)  the property is a property submitted by the Commonwealth to the World Heritage Committee under Article 11 of the World Heritage Convention as suitable for inclusion in the World Heritage List; or

                     (b)  the Minister is satisfied that:

                              (i)  the property has, or is likely to have, world heritage values; and

                             (ii)  some or all of the world heritage values of the property are under threat.

Note 1:       The Minister may make more than one declaration relating to the same property. See subsection 33(1) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

Consulting State or Territory before making declaration

             (2)  Before the Minister makes a declaration relating to property wholly or partly within a State or self-governing Territory, the Minister must inform the appropriate Minister of the State or Territory of the proposal to make the declaration, and give him or her a reasonable opportunity to comment on the proposal.

Consultation not required if threat is imminent

             (3)  However, the Minister need not comply with subsection (2) if:

                     (a)  he or she proposes to make a declaration in the circumstances described in paragraph (1)(b); and

                             (ii)  the revocation of the declaration;

                            (iii)  if the declaration specifies a property submitted to the World Heritage Committee for inclusion in the World Heritage List—the Committee either includes the property in the List or decides the property should not be included in the List.

Specified period for which declaration is in force

             (6)  The Minister must specify in a declaration the period for which it is to be in force. The period must not be longer than the period the Minister believes:

                     (a)  the World Heritage Committee needs to decide whether or not to include the property in the World Heritage List, in the case of a declaration specifying a property that has been submitted to the Committee for inclusion in the List; or

                     (b)  the Commonwealth needs to decide whether the property has world heritage values and to submit the property to the World Heritage Committee for inclusion in the World Heritage List, in the case of a declaration specifying a property not yet submitted to the Committee for inclusion in the List.

Declarations because of threat in force for a year or less

             (7)  The Minister must not specify that a declaration of a property is to be in force for more than 12 months if:

Amending declarations specifying nominated property

             (2)  The Minister must, by notice in the _Gazette_, amend a declaration made under section 14 specifying a property that has been submitted to the World Heritage Committee for inclusion in the World Heritage List so as to remove from the specification any part of the property that the Commonwealth decides to withdraw from the submission.

Revoking declarations specifying property not yet nominated

             (3)  The Minister must, by notice in the _Gazette_, revoke a declaration made under section 14 specifying a property that is not submitted to the World Heritage Committee for inclusion in the World Heritage List if:

                     (a)  the Minister is satisfied that the property does not have world heritage values; or

Also, under section 49, bilateral agreements do not operate in relation to actions in Commonwealth areas or in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, or actions taken by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth agency, unless they expressly provide that they do.

             (2)  If the action is to be taken in 2 or more States or self-governing Territories, this section does not operate unless it operates in relation to each of those States or Territories.

##### <a id="30"></a>30  Extended operation in State and Northern Territory waters

             (1)  Section 29 applies to an action taken on, over or under the seabed vested in a State by section 4 of the _Coastal Waters (State Title) Act 1980_ in the same way that it applies to an action taken in the State.

             (2)  Section 29 applies to an action taken on, over or under the seabed vested in the Northern Territory by section 4 of the _Coastal Waters (__Northern Territory__Title) Act 1980_ in the same way that it applies to an action taken in the Territory.

             (3)  Section 29 applies to an action taken in a Commonwealth marine area to which a law of a State or self-governing Territory is applied by a Commonwealth law or by an agreement or arrangement under a Commonwealth law (other than this Act) in the same way as it applies to an action in the State or Territory, if the provision of the bilateral agreement has effect in relation to the area.

Note:          A provision of a bilateral agreement only has effect in relation to a Commonwealth area or the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park if the agreement expressly provides that it does. See section 49.

##### <a id="31"></a>31  Extended operation in non-self-governing Territories

                   A person may take an action described in a provision of Part 3 without an approval under Part 9 for the purposes of the provision if:

                     (a)  the action is taken in a Territory (the **_action_****_Territory_**) that is not a self-governing Territory; and

                     (b)  an Act providing for the government of the action Territory provides that some or all of the law of a State or self-governing Territory is in force in the action Territory as a law of the Territory; and

                     (c)  the action is one of a class of actions declared by a bilateral agreement between the Commonwealth and the State or self-governing Territory not to require approval under Part 9 for the purposes of the provision of Part 3 (because the action is approved or taken in accordance with a bilaterally accredited management arrangement or a bilaterally accredited authorisation process); and

                     (d)  the bilateral agreement specifies that the provision of the agreement making the declaration has effect in relation to actions in the action Territory; and

                     (e)  the provision of the bilateral agreement making the declaration is in operation in relation to the action; and

                      (f)  either of the following applies:

                              (i)  in the case of a bilaterally accredited management arrangement—the management arrangement is in force under a law of the State or self-governing Territory identified in or under the bilateral agreement;

                             (ii)  in the case of a bilaterally accredited authorisation process—the authorisation process is set out in a law of the State or self-governing Territory, and the law and the authorisation process are identified in or under the bilateral agreement; and

                     (g)  the action is taken in accordance with the bilaterally accredited management arrangement or bilaterally accredited authorisation process.

Note:          Division 3 of Part 5 explains how the operation of a bilateral agreement may be ended or suspended.

### Division 2—Actions covered by Ministerial declarations and accredited management arrangements or accredited authorisation processes

#### Subdivision A—Effect of declarations

##### <a id="32"></a>32  Actions declared by Minister not to need approval

                   A person may take an action described in a provision of Part 3 without an approval under Part 9 for the purposes of the provision if:

                     (a)  the action is one of a class of actions declared by the Minister under section 33 not to require approval under Part 9 for the purposes of the provision (because the action is approved in accordance with an accredited management arrangement or an accredited authorisation process for the purposes of the declaration); and

                     (b)  the declaration is in operation when the action is taken; and 

                     (c)  one of the following applies:

                              (i)  in the case of an accredited management arrangement—the management arrangement is in operation under a law of the Commonwealth identified in or under the declaration;

                             (ii)  in the case of an accredited authorisation process—the authorisation process is set out in a law of the Commonwealth, and the law and the authorisation process are identified in or under the declaration; and

                     (d)  the action is taken in accordance with the accredited management arrangement or accredited authorisation process.

#### Subdivision B—Making declarations

##### <a id="33"></a>33  Making declaration that actions do not need approval under Part 9

Declaration of actions not needing approval

             (1)  The Minister may declare in writing that actions in a class of actions specified in the declaration wholly or partly by reference to the fact that their taking has been approved by the Commonwealth or a specified Commonwealth agency, in accordance with a management arrangement or authorisation process that is an accredited management arrangement or an accredited authorisation process for the purposes of the declaration, do not require approval under Part 9 for the purposes of a specified provision of Part 3.

Note 1:       Subdivisions C and D set out rules about prerequisites for making a declaration and limits on making a declaration.

Note 2:       Section 35 provides for revocation of a declaration.

What is an **accredited management arrangement**?

             (2)  A management arrangement is an **_accredited management arrangement_** for the purposes of a declaration that certain actions do not require approval under Part 9 for the purposes of a specified provision of Part 3 if and only if:

                     (a)  the management arrangement is in operation under a law of the Commonwealth identified in or under the declaration; and

                     (b)  the management arrangement has been accredited in writing by the Minister in accordance with this section for the purposes of the declaration.

What is an **accredited authorisation process**?

          (2A)  An authorisation process is an **_accredited authorisation process_** for the purposes of a declaration that certain actions do not require approval under Part 9 for the purposes of a specified provision of Part 3 if and only if:

                     (a)  the authorisation process is set out in a law of the Commonwealth, and the law and the authorisation process are identified in or under the declaration; and

                     (b)  the authorisation process has been accredited in writing by the Minister in accordance with this section for the purposes of the declaration.

Accrediting management arrangement or authorisation process

             (3)  For the purposes of subsection (2) or (2A), the Minister may accredit by written instrument a management arrangement or authorisation process for the purposes of a declaration. However, the Minister may do so only if the Minister is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the management arrangement or authorisation process and the law under which it is in operation, or in which it is set out, meet the criteria prescribed by the regulations; and

                     (b)  there has been or will be adequate assessment of the impacts that actions approved in accordance with the management arrangement or authorisation process:

                              (i)  have or will have; or

                             (ii)  are likely to have;

                            on each matter protected by a provision of Part 3 to which the declaration relates; and

                     (c)  actions approved or taken in accordance with the management arrangement or authorisation process will not have unacceptable or unsustainable impacts on a matter protected by a provision of Part 3 to which the declaration relates.

The Minister must publish in accordance with the regulations (if any) the instrument accrediting the management arrangement or authorisation process.

Note:          Subdivision C sets out more prerequisites for accrediting a management arrangement or authorisation process.

Tabling of management arrangement or authorisation process before accreditation

             (4)  The Minister must cause to be laid before each House of the Parliament:

                     (a)  a copy of:

                              (i)  in the case of a management arrangement—the management arrangement; or

                             (ii)  in the case of an authorisation process—the relevant part of the law in which the authorisation process is set out;

                            that the Minister is considering accrediting for the purposes of subsection (2) or (2A); and

                     (b)  a notice that the Minister proposes to accredit the management arrangement or authorisation process for the purposes of a declaration under this section.

Limitations on accreditation during period for opposition

             (5)  The Minister must not accredit a management arrangement or authorisation process for the purposes of subsection (2) or (2A) under a bilateral agreement:

                     (a)  before, or within 15 sitting days after, a copy of the management arrangement or authorisation process is laid before each House of the Parliament under this section; or

                     (b)  if, within those 15 sitting days of a House, notice of a motion to oppose accreditation of the management arrangement or authorisation process is given in that House—subject to subsection (5A), within 15 sitting days of that House after the notice is given.

          (5A)  If:

                     (a)  notice of a motion to oppose accreditation of the management arrangement or authorisation process is given in a House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days after the management arrangement or authorisation process is laid before the House under this section; and

                     (b)  the notice is withdrawn or otherwise disposed of within 15 sitting days of that House after the notice is given;

then, subject to paragraph (5)(a), the Minister may accredit the management arrangement or authorisation process after the motion is withdrawn or otherwise disposed of.

No accreditation after accreditation opposed

             (6)  The Minister must not accredit the management arrangement or authorisation process if either House of the Parliament passes a resolution opposing accreditation of the management arrangement or authorisation process following a motion of which notice has been given within 15 sitting days after the management arrangement or relevant part of the law has been laid before the House under this section.

No accreditation if motion not defeated in time

             (7)  The Minister must not accredit the management arrangement or authorisation process if, at the end of 15 sitting days after notice of a motion to oppose accreditation of the management arrangement or authorisation process that was given in a House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days after the management arrangement or relevant part of the law was laid before the House under this section:

                     (a)  the notice has not been withdrawn and the motion has not been called on; or

                     (b)  the motion has been called on, moved and seconded and has not been withdrawn or otherwise disposed of.

Extended time after dissolution or prorogation

             (8)  If:

                     (a)  notice of a motion to oppose the accreditation of the management arrangement or authorisation process is given in a House of the Parliament (the **_opposing House_**); and

                     (b)  before the end of 15 sitting days of the opposing House after the notice is given:

                              (i)  the House of Representatives is dissolved or expires; or

                             (ii)  the Parliament is prorogued; and

                     (c)  at the time of the dissolution, expiry or prorogation (as appropriate):

                              (i)  the notice has not been withdrawn and the motion has not been called on; or

                             (ii)  the motion has been called on, moved and seconded and has not been withdrawn or otherwise disposed of;

the management arrangement or relevant part of the law is taken for the purposes of subsections (5), (5A), (6) and (7) to have been laid before the opposing House on the first sitting day of that House after the dissolution, expiry or prorogation (as appropriate).

             (1)  On behalf of the Commonwealth, the Minister may enter into a bilateral agreement.

Note 1:       A bilateral agreement can detail the level of Commonwealth accreditation of State practices, procedures, processes, systems, management plans and other approaches to environmental protection.

Note 2:       Subdivision B sets out some prerequisites for entering into bilateral agreements.

What is a **bilateral agreement**?

             (2)  A **_bilateral agreement_** is a written agreement between the Commonwealth and a State or a self-governing Territory that:

                     (a)  provides for one or more of the following:

                              (i)  protecting the environment;

                             (ii)  promoting the conservation and ecologically sustainable use of natural resources;

                            (iii)  ensuring an efficient, timely and effective process for environmental assessment and approval of actions;

                            (iv)  minimising duplication in the environmental assessment and approval process through Commonwealth accreditation of the processes of the State or Territory (or vice versa); and

                     (b)  is expressed to be a bilateral agreement.

##### <a id="46"></a>46  Agreement may declare actions do not need approval under Part 9

Declaration of actions not needing approval

                     (a)  the State or self-governing Territory that is party to the agreement; or

                     (b)  an agency of the State or Territory;

in accordance with a management arrangement or authorisation process that is a bilaterally accredited management arrangement or a bilaterally accredited authorisation process for the purposes of the agreement do not require approval under Part 9 for the purposes of a specified provision of Part 3.

What is a **bilaterally accredited management arrangement**?

             (2)  A management arrangement is a **_bilaterally accredited management arrangement_** for the purposes of a bilateral agreement declaring that certain actions do not require approval under Part 9 for the purposes of a specified provision of Part 3 if and only if:

                     (a)  the management arrangement is in force under a law of the State or Territory that is a party to the agreement and the law is identified in or under the agreement; and

                     (b)  the management arrangement has been accredited in writing by the Minister in accordance with this section for the purposes of the agreement.

What is a **bilaterally accredited authorisation process**?

          (2A)  An authorisation process is a **_bilaterally accredited authorisation process_** for the purposes of a bilateral agreement declaring that certain actions do not require approval under Part 9 for the purposes of a specified provision of Part 3 if and only if:

                     (a)  the authorisation process is set out in a law of the State or Territory that is a party to the agreement, and the law and the process are identified in or under the agreement; and

                     (b)  the authorisation process has been accredited in writing by the Minister in accordance with this section for the purposes of the agreement.

Accrediting management arrangement or authorisation process

             (3)  For the purposes of subsection (2) or (2A), the Minister may accredit in writing a management arrangement or an authorisation process for the purposes of a bilateral agreement with a State or self-governing Territory. However, the Minister may do so only if the Minister is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the management arrangement or authorisation process and the law under which it is in force, or in which it is set out, meet the criteria prescribed by the regulations; and

                     (b)  there has been or will be adequate assessment of the impacts that actions approved in accordance with the management arrangement or authorisation process:

                              (i)  have or will have; or

                             (ii)  are likely to have;

                     (b)  the matter referred is the same in substance as a matter that has been referred before; or

                     (c)  if the alleged contravention of the bilateral agreement were a contravention of the Act, the person referring the matter would not be entitled to apply under section 475 for an injunction in relation to the contravention.

##### <a id="58"></a>58  Consultation before cancellation or suspension

             (1)  The Minister (the **_Environment Minister_**) must consult the appropriate Minister of a State or Territory that is party to a bilateral agreement if the Environment Minister believes that the State or Territory:

##### <a id="64"></a>64  Cancellation or suspension of bilateral agreement does not affect certain actions

Application

             (1)  This section explains how this Act operates in relation to an action that a person was able to take without approval under Part 9 for the purposes of a provision of Part 3 because of Division 1 of Part 4 and a provision of a bilateral agreement immediately before the cancellation or suspension of the operation of the provision of the agreement for the purposes of this Act or of any provision of this Act.

Actions approved in specified manner may be taken

             (2)  If the action was able to be taken without approval under Part 9 because its taking had already been approved in accordance with a management arrangement or an authorisation process that is a bilaterally accredited management arrangement or a bilaterally accredited authorisation process for the purposes of the agreement, this Act continues to operate in relation to the action as if the suspension or cancellation had not occurred.

#### Subdivision B—Expiry of bilateral agreements

##### <a id="65"></a>65  Expiry and review of bilateral agreements

             (1)  A bilateral agreement ceases to have effect for the purposes of this Act at the time when the agreement provides for it to cease to so have effect.

Note:          The parties to a bilateral agreement may also agree to revoke it.

             (2)  The Minister must cause a review of the operation of a bilateral agreement to be carried out at least once every 5 years while the agreement remains in effect. The Minister must give a copy of the report of each review to the appropriate Minister of the State or Territory that is party to the agreement.

Note:          A bilateral agreement may also provide for review of its operation.

             (3)  The Minister must publish the report on each subsection (2) review in accordance with the regulations.

##### <a id="65A"></a>65A  Expiry of bilateral agreement does not affect certain actions

Actions already approved may be taken

             (2)  This Act continues to operate in relation to the action as if the agreement had not ceased to have effect if the action was able to be taken without approval under Part 9 because its taking had already been approved in accordance with a management arrangement or an authorisation process that was a bilaterally accredited management arrangement or a bilaterally accredited authorisation process for the purposes of the agreement.

# Chapter 4—Environmental assessments and approvals

## Part 6—Simplified outline of this Chapter

##### <a id="66"></a>66  Simplified outline of this Chapter

                   The following is a simplified outline of this Chapter:

* * *

This Chapter deals with assessment and approval of actions that Part 3 prohibits without approval (**_controlled actions_**). (It does not deal with actions that a bilateral agreement declares not to need approval.)

A person proposing to take an action, or a government body aware of the proposal, may refer the proposal to the Minister so he or she can decide:

               (a)     whether his or her approval is needed to take the action; and

               (b)     how to assess the impacts of the action to be able to make an informed decision whether or not to approve the action.

An assessment may be done using:

               (a)     a process laid down under a bilateral agreement; or

               (b)     a process specified in a declaration by the Minister; or

               (c)     a process accredited by the Minister; or

             (ca)     information included in the referral; or

               (d)     preliminary documentation provided by the proponent; or

               (e)     a public environment report; or

               (f)     an environmental impact statement; or

               (g)     a public inquiry.

Once the report of the assessment is given to the Minister, he or she must decide whether or not to approve the action, and what conditions to attach to any approval.

* * *

## Part 7—Deciding whether approval of actions is needed

### Division 1—Referral of proposals to take action

##### <a id="67"></a>67  What is a _controlled action_?

                   An action that a person proposes to take is a **_controlled action_** if the taking of the action by the person without approval under Part 9 for the purposes of a provision of Part 3 would be (or would, but for section 25AA or 28AB, be) prohibited by the provision. The provision is a **_controlling provision_** for the action.

##### <a id="67A"></a>67A  Prohibition on taking controlled action without approval

                   A person must not take a controlled action unless an approval of the taking of the action by the person is in operation under Part 9 for the purposes of the relevant provision of Part 3.

             (3)  If a person (the **_first person_**) referred to in paragraph (2)(a) or (b) refers a proposal to take the action to the Minister under section 68:

                     (a)  no other person is required or permitted to refer a proposal to take the action to the Minister under section 68; and

                     (b)  for the purposes of this Chapter, a reference to, or relating to, the person proposing to take the action is a reference to, or relating to, the first person.

to refer the proposal to the Minister within 15 business days or a longer period agreed by the Minister and the requested person, State, Territory or agency (as appropriate).

Note 1:       If the proposal to take the action is not referred, the person cannot get an approval under Part 9 to take the action. If taking the action without approval contravenes Part 3, an injunction could be sought to prevent or stop the action, or the person could be ordered to pay a pecuniary penalty.

Note 2:       Section 156 sets out rules about time limits.

             (2)  In making a request, the Minister must act in accordance with the regulations (if any).

                     (b)  the period for compliance with the request has ended; and

                     (c)  the requested person has not referred the proposal to the Minister in accordance with the request;

the Minister may, within 20 business days after the end of that period, determine in writing that this Act has effect as if:

                     (c)  may, under section 70, request of the person proposing to take the action that was the subject of the referral, that they refer the proposal, to take the larger action, to the Minister.

             (3)  To avoid doubt, sections 73 and 74 do not apply to a referral that has not been accepted in accordance with subsection (1).

             (4)  If the Minister decides to accept a referral under subsection (1), the Minister must, at the time of making a decision under section 75:

                     (a)  give written notice of the decision to the person who referred the proposal to the Minister;

                     (b)  publish in accordance with the regulations (if any), a copy or summary of the decision.

##### <a id="74AA"></a>74AA  Offence of taking action before decision made in relation to referral etc.

Referral made: taking action while decision making process still going on

             (1)  A person commits an offence if:

                     (a)  the person takes an action; and

                     (b)  either:

                              (i)  a proposal to take the action (or a larger action of which the action is a component) has been referred to the Minister by the person under section 68; or

                             (ii)  a proposal to take the action (or a larger action of which the action is a component) has been referred to the Minister under section 69 or 71 and the person has been informed of the referral under section 73; and

                     (c)  the referral has not been withdrawn under section 170C; and

                     (d)  the Minister has not decided under subsection 74A(1) not to accept the referral; and

                      (f)  provisions of this Chapter are not stopped by section 155 from applying because of the referral in relation to the action (or a larger action of which the action is a component); and

                     (g)  no decision that the action (or a larger action of which the action is a component) is not a controlled action is in operation under section 75 in relation to the referral; and

                     (h)  no decision is in operation under Part 9 in relation to the referral approving, or not approving, the taking of the action (or a larger action of which the action is a component).

                    Penalty:  500 penalty units.

Note:          Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply to the taking of an action by a person if:

                     (a)  the taking of the action is reasonably necessary in order to comply with a requirement or request made under this Part or Part 8 or 9  in relation to the action (or a larger action of which the action is a component); and

                     (b)  before taking the action, the person gave the Minister written notice of the taking of the action; and

                     (c)  the notice was given in accordance with any applicable requirements of the regulations.

Referral requested: taking action before requested referral is made

             (3)  A person commits an offence if:

                     (a)  the person takes an action; and

                     (b)  the Minister, under section 70, has requested the referral by the person  of a proposal to take the action (or a larger action of which the action is a component) to the Minister; and

                     (c)  the request has not been revoked; and

                     (d)  the referral has not been made.

                    Penalty:  500 penalty units.

Note:          Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.

### Division 1A—Decision that action is clearly unacceptable

##### <a id="74B"></a>74B  Application of this Division

             (1)  This Division applies to the referral of a proposal to take an action if, within 20 business days after the Minister receives the referral:

                     (a)  the Minister considers, on the basis of the information in the referral, that it is clear that the action would have unacceptable impacts on a matter protected by a provision of Part 3; and

                     (b)  the Minister decides that this Division should apply to the referral.

             (2)  If this Division applies to a referral, any other provisions of this Chapter that would, apart from this subsection, have applied to the referral cease to apply to the referral.

             (3)  Subsection (2) has effect subject to paragraph 74D(6)(a).

##### <a id="74C"></a>74C  Informing person proposing to take action that action is clearly unacceptable

             (1)  As soon as practicable after making the decision under paragraph 74B(1)(b) in relation to a referral, the Minister must give written notice of the decision to:

                     (a)  the person proposing to take the action that is the subject of the referral; and

                     (b)  the person who referred the proposal to the Minister (if that person is not the person proposing to take the action that is the subject of the referral).

             (2)  The notice must:

                     (a)  state that the Minister considers that the action would have unacceptable impacts on a matter protected by a provision of Part 3; and

                     (b)  set out the reasons for the Minister’s decision.

             (3)  After receiving the notice under subsection (1), the person proposing to take the action may:

                     (a)  withdraw the referral and take no further action in relation to the proposed action; or

                     (b)  withdraw the referral and refer a new proposal to take a modified action to the Minister in accordance with Division 1; or

                     (c)  request the Minister, in writing, to reconsider the referral.

Note 1:       Section 170C sets out the procedure for withdrawing a referral.

Note 2:       A referral of a proposal to take a modified action will be a new referral for the purposes of this Chapter.

##### <a id="74D"></a>74D  Procedure if Minister is requested to reconsider referral

             (1)  This section applies if the Minister receives a request under paragraph 74C(3)(c) to reconsider a referral.

Inviting public comment

             (2)  The Minister must, within 10 business days after receiving the request, publish on the internet:

                     (a)  a notice stating that the Minister proposes not to approve the taking of the action that is the subject of the referral; and

                     (b)  the reasons for the Minister’s decision; and

                     (c)  an invitation for anyone to give the Secretary, within 10 business days (measured in Canberra), comments in writing on:

                              (i)  the impacts that the action would have on a matter protected by a provision of Part 3; and

                             (ii)  the Minister’s proposal to refuse to approve the taking of the action.

Report about relevant impacts of action

             (3)  Within 10 business days after the end of the period for comment under paragraph (2)(c), the Secretary must:

                     (a)  prepare a written report about the relevant impacts that the action has or will have, or is likely to have, on a matter protected by a provision of Part 3; and

                     (b)  give the Minister:

                              (i)  the report; and

                             (ii)  a copy of any comments received by the Secretary within the period for comment.

In preparing the report, the Secretary must have regard to the comments referred to in subparagraph (b)(ii).

Decision following reconsideration

             (4)  Within 20 business days after receiving the report under subsection (3), the Minister must:

                     (a)  if the Minister still considers that it is clear that the action would have unacceptable impacts on a matter protected by a provision of Part 3—decide to refuse to approve the taking of the action; or

                     (b)  decide that the referral is to be dealt with under the provisions of this Chapter that, because of subsection 74B(2), have ceased to apply to the referral.

             (5)  If the Minister decides to refuse to approve the taking of the action, the Minister must, within 10 business days after making the decision, give notice of the decision to:

                     (a)  the person proposing to take the action; and

                     (b)  the person who referred the proposal to the Minister (if that person is not the person proposing to take the action).

Note:          The person proposing to take the action may request reasons for the refusal and the Minister must give them. See section 13 of the _Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977_.

             (6)  If the Minister makes a decision under paragraph (4)(b):

                     (a)  the provisions of this Chapter that, because of subsection 74B(2), have ceased to apply to the referral start to apply to the referral; and

                     (b)  for the purposes of the application of those provisions, a day is not to be counted as a business day if it is:

                              (i)  on or after the day the Minister received the referral; and

                             (ii)  on or before the day the Minister makes the decision under paragraph (4)(b).

Note:          If the Minister had already complied with section 74 in relation to the referral before the Minister made the decision under paragraph 74B(1)(b) in relation to the referral, the Minister is not required to comply with section 74 again.

### Division 2—Ministerial decision whether action needs approval

##### <a id="75"></a>75  Does the proposed action need approval?

Is the action a controlled action?

             (1)  The Minister must decide:

                     (a)  whether the action that is the subject of a proposal referred to the Minister is a controlled action; and

                     (b)  which provisions of Part 3 (if any) are controlling provisions for the action.

Note:          The Minister may revoke a decision made under subsection (1) about an action and substitute a new decision. See section 78.

       (1AA)  To avoid doubt, the Minister is not permitted to make a decision under subsection (1) in relation to an action that was the subject of a referral that was not accepted under subsection 74A(1).

Minister must consider public comment

          (1A)  In making a decision under subsection (1) about the action, the Minister must consider the comments (if any) received:

                     (a)  in response to the invitation under subsection 74(3) for anyone to give the Minister comments on whether the action is a controlled action; and

                     (b)  within the period specified in the invitation.

Considerations in decision

             (2)  If, when the Minister makes a decision under subsection (1), it is relevant for the Minister to consider the impacts of an action:

                     (a)  the Minister must consider all adverse impacts (if any) the action:

                              (i)  has or will have; or

                             (ii)  is likely to have;

                            on the matter protected by each provision of Part 3; and

                     (b)  must not consider any beneficial impacts the action:

                              (i)  has or will have; or

                             (ii)  is likely to have;

                            on the matter protected by each provision of Part 3.

Note:          **_Impact_** is defined in section 527E.

          (2A)  For the purposes of subsection (2), if the provision of Part 3 is subsection 15B(3), 15C(5), 15C(6), 23(1), 24A(1), 26(1) or 27A(1), then the impacts of the action on the matter protected by that provision are only those impacts that the part of the action that is taken in or on a Commonwealth area, a Territory, a Commonwealth marine area or Commonwealth land:

                     (a)  has or will have; or

                     (b)  is likely to have;

on the matter.

       (2AA)  For the purposes of subsection (2), if the provision of Part 3 is subsection 24B(1) or 24C(1) or (3), then the impacts of the action on the matter protected by that provision are only those impacts that the part of the action that is taken in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park:

                     (a)  has or will have; or

                     (b)  is likely to have;

on the matter.

          (2B)  Without otherwise limiting any adverse impacts that the Minister must consider under paragraph (2)(a), the Minister must not consider any adverse impacts of:

                     (a)  any RFA forestry operation to which, under Division 4 of Part 4, Part 3 does not apply; or

                     (b)  any forestry operations in an RFA region that may, under Division 4 of Part 4, be undertaken without approval under Part 9.

Designating a proponent of the action

             (3)  If the Minister decides that the action is a controlled action, the Minister must designate a person as proponent of the action.

Consent to designation

             (4)  The Minister may designate a person who does not propose to take the action only if:

                     (a)  the person agrees to being designated; and

                     (b)  the person proposing to take the action agrees to the designation.

Timing of decision and designation

             (5)  The Minister must make the decisions under subsection (1) and, if applicable, the designation under subsection (3), within 20 business days after the Minister receives the referral of the proposal to take the action.

Note:          If the Minister decides, under subsection 75(1), that the action is a controlled action, the Minister must, unless the Minister has requested more information under subsection 76(3) or section 89, decide on the approach to be used for assessment of the relevant impacts of the action on the same day as the Minister makes the decision under subsection 75(1)—see subsection 88(2).

Time does not run while further information being sought

             (6)  If the Minister has requested more information under subsection 76(1) or (2) for the purposes of making a decision, a day is not to be counted as a business day for the purposes of subsection (5) if it is:

                     (a)  on or after the day the Minister requested the information; and

                     (b)  on or before the day on which the Minister receives the last of the information requested.

Running of time may be suspended by agreement

             (7)  The Minister and the person proposing to take the action may agree in writing that days within a period worked out in accordance with the agreement are not to be counted as business days for the purposes of subsection (5). If the agreement is made, those days are not to be counted for the purposes of that subsection.

##### <a id="76"></a>76  Minister may request more information for making decisions

             (1)  If the Minister believes on reasonable grounds that the referral of a proposal to take an action does not include enough information for the Minister to decide:

                     (a)  whether the action is a controlled action; or

                     (b)  which provisions of Part 3 (if any) are controlling provisions for the action;

the Minister may request the person proposing to take the action to provide specified information relevant to making the decision.

             (2)  Before the Minister makes the decisions under subsection 75(1) in relation to the action, the Minister may request the person proposing to take the action to provide information about whether or not the action is a component of a larger action that is proposed to be taken by the person.

             (3)  If the Minister believes on reasonable grounds that the information given to the Minister in relation to the action is not enough to allow the Minister to make an informed decision on the approach to be used for assessment of the relevant impacts of the action, the Minister may request the person proposing to take the action to provide specified information relevant to making the decision.

             (4)  Without limiting subsection (3), if the action is to be taken in a State or self-governing Territory, the Minister may request the person proposing to take the action to provide information about:

                     (a)  whether the relevant impacts of the action have been, or are being, assessed by the State or Territory; and

                     (b)  if so, the method of assessment that was, or is being, used and what stage the assessment has reached.

             (5)  The Minister may make a request under subsection (3) even if the Minister has not yet made the decisions under subsection 75(1) in relation to the action.

##### <a id="77"></a>77  Notice and reasons for decision

Giving notice

             (1)  Within 10 business days after deciding whether an action that is the subject of a proposal referred to the Minister is a controlled action or not, the Minister must:

                     (a)  give written notice of the decision to:

                              (i)  the person proposing to take the action; and

                             (ii)  if the Minister has designated as proponent of the action a person who does not propose to take the action—that person; and

                            (iii)  if the Minister decided that the action is a controlled action because of Division 1 of Part 3 (which deals with matters of national environmental significance)—the appropriate Minister of each State or self-governing Territory in which the action is to be taken; and

                     (b)  publish notice of the decision in accordance with the regulations.

Note 1:       Section 156 sets out rules about time limits.

Note 2:       Subparagraph (1)(a)(iii) also applies to actions to be taken in an area offshore from a State or the Northern Territory. See section 157.

Notice must identify any applicable controlling provisions

             (2)  If the decision is that the action is a controlled action, the notice must identify each of the controlling provisions.

Reasons for decision

             (4)  The Minister must give reasons for the decision to a person who:

                     (a)  has been given the notice; and

                     (b)  within 28 days of being given the notice, has requested the Minister to provide reasons.

The Minister must do so as soon as practicable, and in any case within 28 days of receiving the request.

##### <a id="77A"></a>77A  Action to be taken in a particular manner

             (1)  If, in deciding whether the action is a controlled action or not, the Minister has made a decision (the **_component decision_**) that a particular provision of Part 3 is not a controlling provision for the action because the Minister believes it will be taken in a particular manner, the notice, to be provided under section 77, must set out the component decision, identifying the provision and the manner.

Note:          The Minister may decide that a provision of Part 3 is not a controlling provision for an action because he or she believes that the action will be taken in a manner that will ensure the action will not have (and is not likely to have) an adverse impact on the matter protected by the provision.

          (1A)  For the purposes of subsection (1), it does not matter whether or not the Minister believes that the action will be taken in accordance with:

                     (a)  an accredited management arrangement or an accredited authorisation process for the purposes of a declaration under section 33; or

                     (b)  a bioregional plan to which a declaration made under section 37A relates; or

                     (c)  a bilaterally accredited management arrangement or a bilaterally accredited authorisation process for the purposes of a bilateral agreement.

             (2)  A person must not take an action, that is the subject of a notice that includes a particular manner under subsection (1), in a way that is inconsistent with the manner specified in the notice.

                    Civil penalty:            

                     (a)  for an individual—1,000 penalty units, or such lower amount as is prescribed by the regulations;

                     (b)  for a body corporate—10,000 penalty units, or such lower amount as is prescribed by the regulations.

### Division 3—Reconsideration of decisions

##### <a id="78"></a>78  Reconsideration of decision

Limited power to vary or substitute decisions

             (1)  The Minister may revoke a decision (the **_first decision_**) made under subsection 75(1) about an action and substitute a new decision under that subsection for the first decision, but only if:

                     (a)  the Minister is satisfied that the revocation and substitution is warranted by the availability of substantial new information about the impacts that the action:

                              (i)  has or will have; or

                             (ii)  is likely to have;

                            on a matter protected by a provision of Part 3; or

                    (aa)  the Minister is satisfied that the revocation and substitution is warranted by a substantial change in circumstances that was not foreseen at the time of the first decision and relates to the impacts that the action:

                              (i)  has or will have; or

                             (ii)  is likely to have;

                            on a matter protected by a provision of Part 3; or

                     (b)  the following requirements are met:

                              (i)  the first decision was that the action was not a controlled action because the Minister believed the action would be taken in the manner identified under subsection 77A(1) in the notice given under section 77;

                             (ii)  the Minister is satisfied that the action is not being, or will not be, taken in the manner identified; or

                    (ba)  the following requirements are met:

                              (i)  the first decision was that the action was not a controlled action because of a provision of a bilateral agreement and a management arrangement or an authorisation process that is a bilaterally accredited management arrangement or a bilaterally accredited authorisation process for the purposes of the agreement;

                             (ii)  the provision of the agreement no longer operates in relation to the action, or the management arrangement or authorisation process is no longer in force under, or set out in, a law of a State or a self-governing Territory identified in or under the agreement; or

                     (c)  the following requirements are met:

                              (i)  the first decision was that the action was not a controlled action because of a declaration under section 33 and a management arrangement or an authorisation process that is an accredited management arrangement or an accredited authorisation process for the purposes of the declaration;

                             (ii)  the declaration no longer operates in relation to the action, or the management arrangement or authorisation process is no longer in operation under, or set out in, a law of the Commonwealth identified in or under the declaration; or

                    (ca)  the following requirements are met:

                              (i)  the first decision was that the action was not a controlled action because of a declaration under section 37A and a bioregional plan to which the declaration relates;

                             (ii)  the declaration no longer operates in relation to the action, or the bioregional plan is no longer in force; or

                     (d)  the Minister is requested under section 79 to reconsider the decision.

Note 1:       Subsection 75(1) provides for decisions about whether an action is a controlled action and what the controlling provisions for the action are.

Note 2:       A person (other than a Minister of a State or self-governing Territory) may request the Minister to reconsider a decision made under subsection 75(1) about an action on the basis of a matter referred to in any of paragraphs 78(1)(a) to (ca). See section 78A.

Note 3:       If the Minister decides to revoke a decision under subsection (1) and substitute a new decision for it, the Minister is not required to carry out the processes referred to in sections 73 and 74 again before making the new decision.

Reversing decision that provision of Part 3 is not controlling provision

             (2)  A provision of Part 3 letting an action be taken if the Minister has decided that a particular provision (the **_prohibiting provision_**) of that Part is not a controlling provision for the action does not prevent the Minister from acting under subsection (1) to revoke a decision that the prohibiting provision is not a controlling provision for an action and substitute a decision that the prohibiting provision is a controlling provision for the action.

Decision not to be revoked after approval granted or refused or action taken

             (3)  The Minister must not revoke the first decision after:

                     (a)  the Minister has granted or refused an approval of the taking of the action; or

                     (b)  the action is taken.

General effect of change of decision

             (4)  When the first decision is revoked and a new decision is substituted for it:

                     (a)  any provisions of this Chapter that applied in relation to the action because of the first decision cease to apply in relation to the action; and

                     (b)  any provisions of this Chapter that are relevant because of the new decision apply in relation to the action.

Change of designation of proponent

             (5)  If the Minister believes a person (the **_first proponent_**) designated under section 75 as proponent of an action is no longer an appropriate person to be the designated proponent of the action, the Minister may revoke the designation and designate another person (the **_later proponent_**) as proponent of the action.

Consent to designation

             (6)  The Minister may designate the other person as proponent of the action only if:

                     (a)  he or she consents to it and the person proposing to take the action agrees to it; or

                     (b)  the other person is the person proposing to take the action.

Effect of change of designated proponent

             (7)  If the Minister revokes the designation of the first proponent and designates the later proponent:

                     (a)  the provisions of this Chapter that applied to the first proponent cease to apply to the first proponent in relation to the action but apply to the later proponent; and

                     (b)  for the purposes of those provisions the later proponent is taken to have done anything the first proponent did in relation to the action; and

                     (c)  for the purposes of those provisions anything done in relation to the first proponent in relation to the action is taken to have been done in relation to the later proponent.

##### <a id="78A"></a>78A  Request for reconsideration of decision by person other than State or Territory Minister

             (1)  A person (other than a Minister of a State or self-governing Territory) may request the Minister to reconsider a decision made under subsection 75(1) about an action on the basis of a matter referred to in any of paragraphs 78(1)(a) to (ca).

Note:          Section 79 deals with requests for reconsideration by a Minister of a State or self-governing Territory.

             (2)  A request under subsection (1) must:

                     (a)  be in writing; and

                     (b)  set out the basis on which the person thinks the decision should be reconsidered; and

                     (c)  if the regulations specify other requirements for requests under subsection (1)—comply with those requirements.

             (3)  If a request is made under subsection (1) in relation to a decision that an action is a controlled action, or that particular provisions are controlling provisions for an action, then:

                     (a)  if the request is made by the designated proponent of the action—Part 8 ceases to apply in relation to the action until the Minister makes a decision in relation to the request; but

                     (b)  if the request is made by another person—the application of Part 8 in relation to the action is not affected by the making of the request (subject to the outcome of the reconsideration).

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  because of paragraph (3)(a), Part 8 has ceased to apply in relation to an action; and

                     (b)  the Minister confirms the decision that is the subject of the request under subsection (1);

then:

                     (c)  the application of Part 8 in relation to the action resumes (as does any assessment process under that Part that had previously commenced in relation to the action); and

                     (d)  for the purposes of the resumed application of Part 8, a day is not to be counted as a business day if it is:

                              (i)  on or after the day the Minister received the request; and

## Part 8—Assessing impacts of controlled actions

### Division 1—Simplified outline of this Part

##### <a id="80"></a>80  Simplified outline of this Part

                   The following is a simplified outline of this Part:

* * *

This Part provides for the assessment of impacts of controlled actions, to provide information for decisions whether or not to approve the taking of the actions. However, this Part does not apply to actions that a bilateral agreement or Ministerial declaration says are to be assessed in another way.

For actions that are to be assessed under this Part, the Minister must choose one of the following methods of assessment:

               (a)     an accredited assessment process;

             (aa)     an assessment on referral information (see Division 3A);

               (b)     an assessment on preliminary documentation (see Division 4);

               (c)     a public environment report (see Division 5);

               (d)     an environmental impact statement (see Division 6);

               (e)     a public inquiry (see Division 7).

* * *

### Division 2—Application of this Part

##### <a id="81"></a>81  Application

             (1)  This Part applies to the assessment of the relevant impacts of an action that the Minister has decided under Division 2 of Part 7 is a controlled action.

             (2)  This section has effect subject to sections 83 and 84.

             (3)  This section does not limit section 82.

##### <a id="82"></a>82  What are the _relevant impacts_ of an action?

If the Minister has decided the action is a controlled action

             (1)  If the Minister has decided under Division 2 of Part 7 that an action is a controlled action, the **_relevant impacts_** of the action are the impacts that the action:

                     (a)  has or will have; or

                     (b)  is likely to have;

on the matter protected by each provision of Part 3 that the Minister has decided under that Division is a controlling provision for the action.

If the Minister has not decided whether the action is controlled

             (2)  If an action is a controlled action or would be apart from Division 1, 2, 3 or 3A of Part 4 (which provide that approval under Part 9 is not needed for an action covered by a bilateral agreement or declaration)—the **_relevant impacts_** of the action are impacts that the action:

                     (a)  has or will have; or

                     (b)  is likely to have;

on the matter protected by each provision of Part 3 that is a controlling provision for the action or would be apart from whichever of those Divisions is relevant.

Relationship between subsections (1) and (2)

             (3)  Subsection (1) has effect despite subsection (2).

             (4)  For the purposes of subsections (1) and (2), if subsection 15B(3), 15C(5), 15C(6), 23(1), 24A(1), 26(1) or 27A(1) is, or would be, a controlling provision for the action, then the impacts of the action on the matter protected by that provision are only those impacts that the part of the action that is taken in or on a Commonwealth area, a Territory, a Commonwealth marine area or Commonwealth land:

                     (a)  has or will have; or

                     (b)  is likely to have;

on the matter.

             (5)  For the purposes of subsections (1) and (2), if subsection 24B(1) or 24C(1) or (3) is or would be a controlling provision for the action, then the impacts of the action on the matter protected by that provision are only those impacts that the part of the action that is taken in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park:

                     (a)  has or will have; or

                     (b)  is likely to have;

on the matter.

##### <a id="83"></a>83  This Part does not apply if action covered by bilateral agreement

             (1)  This Part does not apply in relation to an action if:

                     (a)  the action is to be taken in a State or self-governing Territory; and

                     (b)  a bilateral agreement between the Commonwealth and the State or Territory declares that actions in a class that includes the action need not be assessed under this Part; and

                     (c)  the provision of the bilateral agreement making the declaration is in operation in relation to the action.

Note 1:       Subsection (1) also applies to actions to be taken in an area offshore from a State or the Northern Territory. See section 157.

Note 2:       Section 47 deals with bilateral agreements making declarations described in paragraph (1)(b).

Note 2A:    An action will be in a class of actions declared not to need assessment under this Part only if the action has been assessed in a manner specified in the bilateral agreement.

Note 3:       Division 3 of Part 5 explains how the operation of a bilateral agreement may be ended or suspended. Also, under section 49, bilateral agreements do not operate in relation to actions in Commonwealth areas or in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, or actions taken by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth agency, unless they expressly provide that they do.

             (2)  If the action is to be taken in 2 or more States or self-governing Territories, this section does not operate unless it operates in relation to each of those States or Territories.

##### <a id="84"></a>84  This Part does not apply if action covered by declaration

When this Part does not apply

             (1)  This Part does not apply in relation to an action if:

                     (a)  the Minister has declared in writing that actions in a class that includes the action need not be assessed under this Part; and

                     (b)  the declaration is in operation.

Note:          An action will be in a class of actions declared not to need assessment under this Part only if the action has been assessed in a manner specified in the declaration.

Declaration

             (2)  The Minister may declare in writing that actions in a specified class of actions assessed by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth agency in a specified manner do not require assessment under this Part.

Prerequisites for making a declaration

             (3)  The Minister may make a declaration only if he or she is satisfied that:

                     (a)  assessment of an action in the specified manner will include assessment of the impacts the action:

                              (i)  has or will have; or

                             (ii)  is likely to have;

                            on each matter protected by a provision of Part 3; and

                     (b)  the specified manner of assessment meets the standards (if any) prescribed by the regulations; and

                     (c)  if the taking of an action assessed in the specified manner must be approved under Part 9, he or she will receive a report including, or accompanied by, enough information about the relevant impacts of the action to let him or her make an informed decision whether or not to approve under Part 9 (for the purpose of each controlling provision) the taking of the action.

Further requirements for making a declaration

          (3A)  Sections 34A, 34B, 34BA, 34C, 34D, 34E and 34F apply in relation to the making of a declaration under this section in the same way that they apply to the making of a declaration under section 33.

Specified manner of assessment

             (4)  The manner of assessment that may be specified in a declaration includes assessment by a Commonwealth agency under a law of the Commonwealth. This does not limit subsection (2).

Publishing declaration

             (5)  The Minister must publish a declaration in accordance with the regulations.

Revoking declaration

             (6)  The Minister may, by instrument in writing published in accordance with the regulations, revoke a declaration.

                     (a)  by a person for the purposes of trade between Australia and another country or between 2 States; or

                     (b)  by a constitutional corporation;

the Minister must not give preference (within the meaning of section 99 of the Constitution) to one State or part of a State over another State or part of a State.

### Division 3—Decision on assessment approach

#### Subdivision A—Simplified outline of this Division

##### <a id="85"></a>85  Simplified outline of this Division

                   The following is a simplified outline of this Division:

The Minister must choose one of the following ways of assessing the relevant impacts of an action the Minister has decided is a controlled action:

               (a)     an accredited assessment process;

             (aa)     an assessment on referral information;

               (b)     an assessment on preliminary documentation;

               (c)     a public environment report;

               (d)     an environmental impact statement;

               (e)     a public inquiry.

* * *

#### Subdivision B—Deciding on approach for assessment

##### <a id="87"></a>87  Minister must decide on approach for assessment

Minister must choose one assessment approach

             (1)  The Minister must decide which one of the following approaches must be used for assessment of the relevant impacts of an action that the Minister has decided is a controlled action:

                     (a)  assessment by an accredited assessment process;

                    (aa)  assessment on referral information under Division 3A;

                     (b)  assessment on preliminary documentation under Division 4;

                     (c)  assessment by public environment report under Division 5;

                     (e)  assessment by inquiry under Division 7.

Considerations in making choice

             (3)  In making the decision, the Minister must consider:

                     (a)  information relating to the action given to the Minister in the referral of the proposal to take the action; and

                     (b)  any other information available to the Minister about the relevant impacts of the action that the Minister considers relevant (including information in a report on the impacts of actions under a policy, plan or program under which the action is to be taken that was given to the Minister under an agreement under Part 10 (about strategic assessments)); and

                     (c)  any relevant information received in response to an invitation under subparagraph 74(2)(b)(ii); and

                     (d)  the matters (if any) prescribed by the regulations; and 

                     (e)  the guidelines (if any) published under subsection (6).

Accredited assessment process

             (4)  The Minister may decide on an assessment by an accredited assessment process only if the Minister is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the process is to be carried out under a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a self-governing Territory; and

                     (b)  the process and the law meet the standards (if any) prescribed by the regulations; and

                     (c)  the process will ensure that the relevant impacts of the action are adequately assessed; and

                     (d)  he or she will receive a report of the outcome of the process that will provide enough information on the relevant impacts of the action to let him or her make an informed decision whether or not to approve under Part 9 (for the purposes of each controlling provision) the taking of the action.

Assessment on referral information

          (4A)  The Minister may decide on an assessment on referral information under Division 3A only if the Minister is satisfied (after considering the matters in subsection (3)) that the action meets the criteria prescribed in the regulations for the purposes of this subsection.

Assessment on preliminary documentation

             (5)  The Minister may decide on an assessment on preliminary documentation under Division 4 only if the Minister is satisfied (after considering the matters in subsection (3)) that that approach will allow the Minister to make an informed decision whether or not to approve under Part 9 (for the purposes of each controlling provision) the taking of the action.

Guidelines for choosing assessment approach

             (6)  The Minister may publish in the _Gazette_ guidelines setting out criteria for deciding which approach must be used for assessing the relevant impacts of an action.

##### <a id="88"></a>88  Timing of decision on assessment approach

Initial decision

             (1)  The Minister must decide on the approach to be used for assessment of the relevant impacts of the action within 20 business days after the Minister receives the referral of the proposal to take the action.

Note:          Section 156 sets out rules about time limits.

When initial decision must be made

             (2)  The Minister must make the decision under subsection (1) on the same day as the Minister has decided, under subsection 75(1), that the action is a controlled action, unless the Minister has requested more information under subsection 76(3) or section 89 for the purposes of deciding on the approach to be used for assessment of the relevant impacts of the action.

Time does not run while further information sought

             (4)  If the Minister has requested more information in relation to the action under subsection 76(1), (2) or (3) or section 89, a day is not to be counted as a business day for the purposes of subsection (1) if it is:

                     (a)  on or after the day the Minister requested the information; and

                     (b)  on or before the day on which the Minister receives the last of the information requested.

Running of time may be suspended by agreement

             (5)  The Minister and the designated proponent of the action may agree in writing that days within a period worked out in accordance with the agreement are not to be counted as business days for the purposes of subsection (1). If the agreement is made, those days are not to be counted for the purposes of that subsection.

##### <a id="89"></a>89  Minister may request more information for making decision

             (1)  If the Minister believes on reasonable grounds that the information given to the Minister in relation to an action is not enough to allow the Minister to make an informed decision on the approach to be used for assessment of the relevant impacts of the action, the Minister may request the designated proponent to provide specified information relevant to making the decision.

             (2)  Without limiting subsection (1), if the action is to be taken in a State or self-governing Territory, the Minister may request the designated proponent of the action to provide information about:

                     (a)  whether the relevant impacts of the action have been, or are being, assessed by the State or Territory; and

                     (b)  if so, the method of assessment that was, or is being, used and what stage the assessment has reached.

             (3)  The Minister may make a request in relation to an action under this section even if the Minister has made a request under subsection 76(3) in relation to the action.

##### <a id="90"></a>90  Directing an inquiry after starting an assessment

Application

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  the Minister has made a decision (the **_first decision_**) under section 87 that the relevant impacts of an action must be assessed by:

                              (i)  assessment by public environment report under Division 5; or

                             (ii)  assessment by environmental impact statement under Division 6; and

                     (b)  the designated proponent publishes:

                              (i)  a draft report under section 98 (about public environment reports); or

                             (ii)  a draft statement under section 103 (about environmental impact statements).

Revoking and substituting decision

             (2)  The Minister may revoke the first decision and make another decision (the **_new decision_**) under section 87 (in substitution for the first decision) that the relevant impacts of the action must be assessed by an inquiry under Division 7.

Effect of revocation and substitution

             (3)  When the first decision is revoked and the new decision is substituted for it:

                     (a)  whichever of Divisions 5 and 6 applied in relation to the action because of the first decision ceases to apply in relation to the action; and

                     (b)  Division 7 applies in relation to the action.

##### <a id="91"></a>91  Notice of decision on assessment approach

             (1)  Within 10 business days after making a decision on the approach to be used for assessment of the relevant impacts of an action, the Minister must:

                     (a)  give written notice of the decision to:

                              (i)  the person proposing to take the action; and

                            (ia)  the designated proponent of the action (if the designated proponent is not the person proposing to take the action); and

                             (ii)  if the action is to be taken in a State or self-governing Territory and a controlling provision for the action is in Division 1 of Part 3 (which deals with matters of national environmental significance)—the appropriate Minister of the State or Territory; and

                     (b)  publish notice of the decision in accordance with the regulations.

Note 1:       Section 156 sets out rules about time limits.

Note 2:       Subparagraph (1)(a)(ii) also applies to actions to be taken in an area offshore from a State or the Northern Territory. See section 157.

             (2)  If the Minister decided that the relevant impacts of the action are to be assessed by an accredited assessment process, the written notice and the published notice must specify the process.

### Division 3A—Assessment on referral information

                     (b)  inspect any material on the land, or on or in the building or place.

             (2)  However, the commissioner or authorised person may not make the inspection if:

                     (a)  the person occupying or in charge of the land, building or place asks the commissioner or authorised person to produce his or her identity card or other written evidence of his or her identity; and

                              (i)  the decision the Minister proposes to make; and

                             (ii)  if the Minister proposes to approve the taking of the action—any conditions the Minister proposes to attach to the approval; and

                     (b)  invite each person informed under paragraph (a) to give the Minister, within 10 business days (measured in Canberra), comments in writing on the proposed decision and any conditions.

             (2)  If the Minister proposes not to approve, for the purposes of a controlling provision, the taking of the action, the Minister must provide to each person informed under paragraph (1)(a), with the invitation given under paragraph (1)(b):

             (3)  The Minister is not required to provide under subsection (2):

                     (a)  information that is in the public domain; or

                     (b)  a copy of so much of a document as in the public domain; or

                     (c)  in the case of information referred to in paragraph (2)(b) or (c)—any conclusions or recommendations relating to that information included in documents or other material prepared by the Secretary for the Minister.

             (4)  The Minister must not provide under subsection (2):

                     (a)  a copy of so much of a document as:

                              (i)  is an exempt document under the _Freedom of Information Act 1982_ on the grounds of the security of the Commonwealth or its providing advice to the Minister; or

                             (ii)  the Minister is satisfied contains information that is commercial-in-confidence; or

                     (b)  information that:

                              (i)  is of such a nature that its inclusion in a document would cause that document to be an exempt document of the kind referred to in subparagraph (a)(i); or

                             (ii)  the Minister is satisfied is commercial-in-confidence.

             (5)  The Minister must not be satisfied that information (including information in a document) is commercial-in-confidence unless a person demonstrates to the Minister that:

                     (a)  release of the information would cause competitive detriment to the person; and

                     (b)  the information is not in the public domain; and

                     (c)  the information is not required to be disclosed under another law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; and

                     (d)  the information is not readily discoverable.

             (6)  In deciding whether or not to approve, for the purposes of a controlling provision, the taking of the action, the Minister must take into account any relevant comments given to the Minister in response to an invitation given under paragraph (1)(b).

             (7)  This section is taken to be an exhaustive statement of the requirements of the natural justice hearing rule in relation to:

                     (a)  the Minister’s decision under section 133 whether or not to approve, for the purposes of a controlling provision, the taking of the action; and

                     (b)  if the decision is to approve, for the purposes of a controlling provision, the taking of the action, and the Minister decides, under section 134, to attach conditions to the approval—the Minister’s decision under section 134 to attach those conditions to the approval.

##### <a id="131A"></a>131A  Inviting public comment before decision

                   Before the Minister decides whether or not to approve, for the purposes of a controlling provision, the taking of an action, and what conditions (if any) to attach to an approval, he or she may publish on the internet:

                     (a)  the proposed decision and, if the proposed decision is to approve the taking of the action, any conditions that the Minister proposes to attach to the approval; and

                     (b)  an invitation for anyone to give the Minister, within 10 business days (measured in Canberra), comments in writing on the proposed decision and any conditions.

##### <a id="132"></a>132  Requesting further information for approval decision

                   If the Minister believes on reasonable grounds that he or she does not have enough information to make an informed decision whether or not to approve for the purposes of a controlling provision the taking of an action, the Minister may request any of the following to provide specified information relevant to making the decision:

                     (a)  the person proposing to take the action;

                     (b)  the designated proponent of the action;

                     (c)  if a commission has conducted an inquiry under Division 7 of Part 8 relating to the action—the commission;

                     (d)  if:

                              (i)  the action is to be taken in a State or self-governing Territory; and

                             (ii)  a controlling provision for the action is in Division 1 of Part 3 (about matters of national environmental significance); and

                            (iii)  the relevant impacts of the action have been assessed under a law of the State or Territory;

                            the appropriate Minister of that State or Territory;

                     (e)  any other person the Minister considers appropriate.

##### <a id="132A"></a>132A  Requesting notice from appropriate State or Territory Minister about certain actions

             (1)  This section applies to an action that is to be taken in a State or self-governing Territory only if the action:

                     (a)  is to be taken by a person for the purposes of trade or commerce:

                              (i)  between Australia and another country; or

                             (ii)  between 2 States; or

                            (iii)  between a State and a Territory; or

                            (iv)  between 2 Territories; or

                     (b)  is to be taken by a constitutional corporation; or

                     (c)  is an action whose regulation is appropriate and adapted to give effect to Australia’s obligations under an agreement with one or more other countries.

Note:          This section also applies in relation to actions to be taken in an area offshore from a State or the Northern Territory. See section 157.

             (2)  However, this section does not apply to an action if:

                     (a)  the action:

                              (i)  is a nuclear action; or

                             (ii)  is to be taken entirely in a Commonwealth marine area; or

                            (iii)  is to be taken entirely on Commonwealth land; or

                            (iv)  is to be taken by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth agency; and

                     (b)  the relevant impacts of the action have been assessed under Part 8.

             (3)  Before the Minister (the **_Environment Minister_**) decides whether or not to approve for the purposes of a controlling provision the taking of the action, and what conditions (if any) to attach to an approval, the Environment Minister may request the appropriate Minister of the State or Territory to give the Environment Minister a notice stating the method that has been used to assess the certain and likely impacts of the action on things other than matters protected by the controlling provisions for the action.

##### <a id="133"></a>133  Grant of approval

Approval

             (1)  After receiving the assessment documentation relating to a controlled action, or the report of a commission that has conducted an inquiry relating to a controlled action, the Minister may approve for the purposes of a controlling provision the taking of the action by a person.

          (1A)  If the referral of the proposal to take the action included alternative proposals relating to any of the matters referred to in subsection 72(3), the Minister may approve, for the purposes of subsection (1), one or more of the alternative proposals in relation to the taking of the action.

Content of approval

             (2)  An approval must:

                     (a)  be in writing; and

                     (c)  name the person to whom the approval is granted; and

                     (d)  specify each provision of Part 3 for which the approval has effect; and

                     (e)  specify the period for which the approval has effect; and

Note:          The period for which the approval has effect may be extended. See Division 5.

Persons who may take action covered by approval

          (2A)  An approval granted under this section is an approval of the taking of the action specified in the approval by any of the following persons:

                     (a)  the holder of the approval;

                     (b)  a person who is authorised, permitted or requested by the holder of the approval, or by another person with the consent or agreement of the holder of the approval, to take the action.

                     (b)  provide a copy of the approval to a person who asks for it (either free or for a reasonable charge determined by the Minister).

Limit on publication of approval

             (4)  However, the Minister must not provide under subsection (3) a copy of so much of the approval as:

                     (a)  is an exempt document under the _Freedom of Information Act 1982_ on the grounds of commercial confidence; or

                     (b)  the Minister believes it is in the national interest not to provide.

The Minister may consider the defence or security of the Commonwealth when determining what is in the national interest. This does not limit the matters the Minister may consider.

Notice of refusal of approval

             (7)  If the Minister refuses to approve for the purposes of a controlling provision the taking of an action by the person who proposed to take the action, the Minister must give the person notice of the refusal.

Note:          Under section 13 of the _Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977_, the person may request reasons for the refusal, and the Minister must give them.

##### <a id="134"></a>134  Conditions of approval

Condition to inform persons taking action of conditions attached to approval

          (1A)  An approval of the taking of an action by a person (the **_first person_**) is subject to the condition that, if the first person authorises, permits or requests another person to undertake any part of the action, the first person must take all reasonable steps to ensure:

                     (a)  that the other person is informed of any condition attached to the approval that restricts or regulates the way in which that part of the action may be taken; and

                     (b)  that the other person complies with any such condition.

For the purposes of this Chapter, the condition imposed by this subsection is attached to the approval.

Generally

             (1)  The Minister may attach a condition to the approval of the action if he or she is satisfied that the condition is necessary or convenient for:

                     (a)  protecting a matter protected by a provision of Part 3 for which the approval has effect (whether or not the protection is protection from the action); or

                     (b)  repairing or mitigating damage to a matter protected by a provision of Part 3 for which the approval has effect (whether or not the damage has been, will be or is likely to be caused by the action).

Conditions to protect matters from the approved action

             (2)  The Minister may attach a condition to the approval of the action if he or she is satisfied that the condition is necessary or convenient for:

                     (a)  protecting from the action any matter protected by a provision of Part 3 for which the approval has effect; or

                     (b)  repairing or mitigating damage that may or will be, or has been, caused by the action to any matter protected by a provision of Part 3 for which the approval has effect.

This subsection does not limit subsection (1).

Examples of kinds of conditions that may be attached

             (3)  The conditions that may be attached to an approval include:

                    (aa)  conditions requiring specified activities to be undertaken for:

                              (i)  protecting a matter protected by a provision of Part 3 for which the approval has effect (whether or not the protection is protection from the action); or

                             (ii)  repairing or mitigating damage to a matter protected by a provision of Part 3 for which the approval has effect (whether or not the damage may or will be, or has been, caused by the action); and

                    (ab)  conditions requiring a specified financial contribution to be made to a person for the purpose of supporting activities of a kind mentioned in paragraph (aa); and

                     (a)  conditions relating to any security to be given by the holder of the approval by bond, guarantee or cash deposit:

                              (i)  to comply with this Act and the regulations; and

                             (ii)  not to contravene a condition attached to the approval; and

                            (iii)  to meet any liability of a person whose taking of the action is approved to the Commonwealth for measures taken by the Commonwealth under section 499 (which lets the Commonwealth repair and mitigate damage caused by a contravention of this Act) in relation to the action; and

                     (b)  conditions requiring the holder of the approval to insure against any specified liability of the holder to the Commonwealth for measures taken by the Commonwealth under section 499 in relation to the approved action; and

                     (c)  conditions requiring a person taking the action to comply with conditions specified in an instrument (including any kind of authorisation) made or granted under a law of a State or self-governing Territory or another law of the Commonwealth; and

                     (d)  conditions requiring an environmental audit of the action to be carried out periodically by a person who can be regarded as being independent from any person whose taking of the action is approved; and

                     (e)  conditions requiring the preparation, submission for approval by the Minister, and implementation of a plan for managing the impacts of the approved action on a matter protected by a provision of Part 3 for which the approval has effect such as a plan for conserving habitat of a species or ecological community; and

                      (f)  conditions requiring specified environmental monitoring or testing to be carried out; and

                     (g)  conditions requiring compliance with a specified industry standard or code of practice; and

                     (h)  conditions relating to any alternative proposals in relation to the taking of the action covered by the approval (as permitted by subsection 133(1A)).

This subsection does not limit the kinds of conditions that may be attached to an approval.

Certain conditions require consent of holder of approval

          (3A)  The following kinds of condition cannot be attached to the approval of an action unless the holder of the approval has consented to the attachment of the condition:

                     (a)  a condition referred to in paragraph (3)(aa), if the activities specified in the condition are not reasonably related to the action;

                     (b)  a condition referred to in paragraph (3)(ab).

          (3B)  If the holder of the approval has given consent, for the purposes of subsection (3A), to the attachment of a condition:

                     (a)  the holder cannot withdraw that consent after the condition has been attached to the approval; and

                     (b)  any person to whom the approval is later transferred under section 145B is taken to have consented to the attachment of the condition, and cannot withdraw that consent.

Conditions attached under paragraph (3)(c)

          (3C)  A condition attached to an approval under paragraph (3)(c) may require a person taking the action to comply with conditions specified in an instrument of a kind referred to in that paragraph:

                     (a)  as in force at a particular time; or

                     (b)  as is in force or existing from time to time;

even if the instrument does not yet exist at the time the approval takes effect.

Considerations in deciding on condition

             (4)  In deciding whether to attach a condition to an approval, the Minister must consider:

                     (a)  any relevant conditions that have been imposed, or the Minister considers are likely to be imposed, under a law of a State or self-governing Territory or another law of the Commonwealth on the taking of the action; and

                    (aa)  information provided by the person proposing to take the action or by the designated proponent of the action; and

                     (b)  the desirability of ensuring as far as practicable that the condition is a cost-effective means for the Commonwealth and a person taking the action to achieve the object of the condition.

Effect of conditions requiring compliance with conditions specified in another instrument

          (4A)  If:

                     (a)  a condition (the **_principal condition_**) attached to an approval under paragraph (3)(c) requires a person taking the action to comply with conditions (the **_other conditions_**) specified in an instrument of a kind referred to in that paragraph; and

                     (b)  the other conditions are in excess of the power conferred by subsection (1);

the principal condition is taken to require the person to comply with the other conditions only to the extent that they are not in excess of that power.

Validity of decision

             (5)  A failure to consider information as required by paragraph (4)(aa) does not invalidate a decision about attaching a condition to the approval.

##### <a id="135"></a>135  Certain approvals and conditions must not give preference

             (1)  This section deals with the approval:

                     (a)  for the purposes of section 21 or 22A of a nuclear action:

                             (ii)  by a constitutional corporation; or

                     (b)  for the purposes of section 25 of an action that is prescribed for the purposes of subsection 25(1) and is taken:

                             (ii)  by a constitutional corporation.

             (2)  The Minister must not grant the approval, or attach a condition to the approval, that has the effect of giving preference (within the meaning of section 99 of the Constitution) to one State or part of a State over another State or part of a State.

##### <a id="135A"></a>135A  Publication of recommendation reports

             (1)  This section applies in relation to the following reports:

             (2)  Subject to subsections (3) and (4), the Secretary must provide a copy of a report to which this section applies to a person who asks for it (either at no charge or at a reasonable charge determined by the Secretary).

             (3)  The Secretary is not required to provide a copy of the report under subsection (2) to anyone until after the Minister has decided, for the purposes of each controlling provision, whether or not to approve the taking of the action concerned.

             (4)  The Secretary may refuse to provide, under subsection (2), a copy of so much of the report as:

                     (a)  is an exempt document under the _Freedom of Information Act 1982_ on the grounds of the security of the Commonwealth or its providing advice to the Minister; or

                     (b)  the Secretary is satisfied is commercial-in-confidence.

             (5)  The Secretary must not be satisfied that a part of the report is commercial-in-confidence unless a person demonstrates to the Secretary that:

                     (a)  release of the information in that part would cause competitive detriment to the person; and

                     (b)  the information in that part is not in the public domain; and

                     (c)  the information in that part is not required to be disclosed under another law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; and

                     (d)  the information in that part is not readily discoverable.

#### Subdivision B—Considerations for approvals and conditions

##### <a id="136"></a>136  General considerations

Mandatory considerations

             (1)  In deciding whether or not to approve the taking of an action, and what conditions to attach to an approval, the Minister must consider the following, so far as they are not inconsistent with any other requirement of this Subdivision:

                     (b)  economic and social matters.

Factors to be taken into account

             (2)  In considering those matters, the Minister must take into account:

                     (a)  the principles of ecologically sustainable development; and

                     (b)  the assessment report (if any) relating to the action; and

                    (ba)  if Division 3A of Part 8 (assessment on referral information) applies to the action—the finalised recommendation report relating to the action given to the Minister under subsection 93(5); and

                    (bc)  if Division 4 of Part 8 (assessment on preliminary documentation) applies to the action:

                              (i)  the documents given to the Minister under subsection 95B(1), or the statement given to the Minister under subsection 95B(3), as the case requires, relating to the action; and

                             (ii)  the recommendation report relating to the action given to the Minister under section 95C; and

                             (ii)  the recommendation report  relating to the action given to the Minister under section 105; and

                     (d)  if an inquiry was conducted under Division 7 of Part 8 in relation to the action—the report of the commissioners; and

                     (e)  any other information the Minister has on the relevant impacts of the action (including information in a report on the impacts of actions taken under a policy, plan or program under which the action is to be taken that was given to the Minister under an agreement under Part 10 (about strategic assessments)); and

                      (f)  any relevant comments given to the Minister in accordance with an invitation under section 131 or 131A; and

                     (g)  if a notice relating to the action was given to the Minister under subsection 132A(3)—the information in the notice.

Note:          The Minister must also take into account any relevant comments given to the Minister in response to an invitation under paragraph 131AA(1)(b). See subsection 131AA(6).

Person’s environmental history

             (4)  In deciding whether or not to approve the taking of an action by a person, and what conditions to attach to an approval, the Minister may consider whether the person is a suitable person to be granted an approval, having regard to:

                     (a)  the person’s history in relation to environmental matters; and

                     (b)  if the person is a body corporate—the history of its executive officers in relation to environmental matters; and

                     (c)  if the person is a body corporate that is a subsidiary of another body or company (the **_parent body_**)—the history in relation to environmental matters of the parent body and its executive officers.

Minister not to consider other matters

                              (i)  the action has had a significant impact that was not identified in assessing the action on any matter protected by a provision of Part 3 for which the approval has effect, or the Minister believes the action will have such an impact;

                    (ba)  all of the following conditions are satisfied:

                             (ii)  repairing or mitigating damage to a matter protected by a provision of Part 3 for which the approval has effect (whether or not the damage has been, will be or is likely to be caused by the action).

             (2)  The Minister may, by written instrument, revoke any condition (other than the condition referred to in subsection 134(1A)) attached to an approval under this Part of an action if the Minister is satisfied that the condition is not needed to protect any matter protected by a provision of Part 3 for which the approval has effect.

             (3)  In deciding whether or not to revoke, vary or add to any conditions attached to the approval of the taking of an action by a person, the Minister may have regard to:

                              (i)  the approval would not have been granted without that condition being attached; or

             (3)  In deciding whether or not to revoke an approval of the taking of an action by a person, the Minister may have regard to:

                     (a)  the person’s history in relation to environmental matters; and

                     (b)  is likely to have;

                    <a name="endorsed-polici-plan-program"></a>**_endorsed policy, plan or program_** means a policy, plan or program that has been endorsed by the Minister in accordance with an agreement as mentioned in paragraph 146(2)(f).

##### <a id="146B"></a>146B  Minister may approve taking of actions in accordance with endorsed policy, plan or program

             (1)  Subject to Subdivision C, the Minister may approve the taking of an action or a class of actions in accordance with an endorsed policy, plan or program.

Note:          Subdivision C sets out matters that the Minister must take into account in deciding whether or not to approve the taking of an action or a class of actions in accordance with an endorsed policy, plan or program.

             (4)  However, the Minister must not provide under subsection (3) a copy of so much of the approval as:

                     (a)  is an exempt document under the _Freedom of Information Act 1982_ on the grounds of commercial confidence; or

                     (b)  the Minister believes it is in the national interest not to provide.

The Minister may consider the defence or security of the Commonwealth when determining what is in the national interest. This does not limit the matters the Minister may consider.

             (5)  An approval given under subsection (1) is not a legislative instrument.

##### <a id="146C"></a>146C  Inviting comments from other Ministers before deciding whether or not to approve taking of actions in accordance with endorsed policy, plan or program

             (1)  Before the Minister (the **_Environment Minister_**) decides whether or not to approve the taking of an action or a class of actions in accordance with an endorsed policy, plan or program, he or she must:

Note:          Section 134 deals with conditions of approvals, Division 2 of Part 9 deals with compliance with conditions, Division 3 of Part 9 deals with variation of conditions and suspension and revocation of approvals and Division 4 of Part 9 deals with transfer of approvals.

             (4)  Subsection 145A(4) applies in relation to a decision whether or not to reinstate an approval of the taking of an action that is taken to have been given under Part 9 because of paragraph (1)(b), as if:

             (3)  In considering, for the purposes of subsection (2), whether or not the character of the varied proposal is substantially the same as the character of the original proposal, the Minister must have regard to the change (if any) in:

                     (a)  the nature of the activities proposed to be carried out in taking the action; and

                     (b)  the nature and extent of the impacts (if any) the action:

                              (i)  has or will have; or

                             (ii)  is likely to have;

                            on the matter protected by each provision of Part 3.

##### <a id="156C"></a>156C  Minister may request further information in relation to a varied proposal

             (1)  If the Minister believes on reasonable grounds that a request under subsection 156A(1) to accept a varied proposal to take an action does not include enough information for the Minister to decide whether or not to accept the varied proposal, the Minister may request the person proposing to take the action to provide specified information relevant to making the decision.

             (2)  If the Minister has requested more information under subsection (1), a day is not to be counted as a business day for the purposes of subsection 156B(1) if it is:

                     (a)  on or after the day the Minister requested the information; and

                     (b)  on or before the day on which the Minister receives the last of the information requested.

                     (a)  any provisions of this Chapter that, because of subsection 156A(4), have ceased to apply in relation to the original proposal start to apply in relation to the varied proposal; and

                     (b)  for the purpose of the application of those provisions, anything done in relation to the original proposal is taken to have been done in relation to the varied proposal.

             (2)  If the Minister decides not to accept a varied proposal to take an action, any provisions of this Chapter that, because of subsection 156A(4), have ceased to apply in relation to the original proposal start to apply in relation to that proposal.

             (3)  For the purpose of the application of the provisions of this Chapter in relation to the varied proposal under subsection (1), or in relation to the original proposal under subsection (2), a day is not to be counted as a business day if it is:

                     (a)  the person proposing to take the action; and

                     (b)  the designated proponent of the action (if the designated proponent of the action is not the person proposing to take the action).

             (2)  If:

the Minister must also, within the period referred to in subsection (1), give written notice of the decision to the appropriate Minister of the State or Territory.

             (3)  If the Minister decided to accept the varied proposal, the Minister must, within the period referred to in subsection (1), publish the request to accept the varied proposal and notice of the decision in accordance with the regulations.

### Division 4—Application of Chapter to actions that are not controlled actions

#### Subdivision A—Minister’s advice on authorising actions

##### <a id="159"></a>159  Simplified outline of this Subdivision

                   The following is a simplified outline of this Subdivision:

* * *

A Commonwealth agency or employee must consider advice from the Minister before authorising one of the following actions with a significant impact on the environment:

               (a)     providing foreign aid;

               (b)     managing aircraft operations in airspace;

               (c)     adopting or implementing a major development plan for an airport;

               (d)     an action prescribed by the regulations.

The agency or employee must inform the Minister of the proposal to authorise the action.

The environmental impacts of the action must be assessed in accordance with a declaration made by the Minister accrediting a Commonwealth assessment process, or by one of the following methods chosen by the Minister:

               (a)     a specially accredited process;

             (aa)     an assessment on referral information under Division 3A;

               (e)     an inquiry under Division 7 of Part 8.

The Minister must give the agency or employee advice on protecting the environment from the action, within 30 days of receiving the report of the assessment.

* * *

##### <a id="160"></a>160  Requirement to take account of Minister’s advice

Requirement

             (1)  Before a Commonwealth agency or employee of the Commonwealth gives an authorisation (however described) of an action described in subsection (2), the agency or employee must obtain and consider advice from the Minister in accordance with this Subdivision.

Note:          The giving of an authorisation for an action may be constituted by the renewal of an authorisation of the action or the variation of an authorisation for a different action.

Minister may decide advice is not required

          (1A)  Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to an authorisation of an action if:

                     (a)  the agency or employee has referred a proposal to give the authorisation to the Minister under subsection 161(1); and

                     (b)  the Minister has decided under subsection 161A(1) that this Subdivision does not apply in relation to the referral or the action.

Relevant actions

             (2)  Subsection (1) applies in relation to:

                     (a)  the entry by the Commonwealth, under Australia’s foreign aid program, into a contract, agreement or arrangement for the implementation of a project that has, will have or is likely to have a significant impact on the environment anywhere in the world; and

                     (b)  the adoption or implementation of a plan for aviation airspace management involving aircraft operations that have, will have or are likely to have a significant impact on the environment; and

                     (c)  the adoption or implementation of a major development plan (as defined in the _Airports Act 1996_); and

                     (d)  any other action prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph.

          (2A)  Regulations may prescribe an action for the purposes of paragraph (2)(d):

                     (a)  partly by reference to the action’s having, or being likely to have, a significant impact on the environment; or

                     (b)  partly by reference to a specified person believing that the action has, will have or is likely to have a significant impact on the environment; or

                     (c)  wholly or partly by reference to legislation under which the authorisation of the action is to be granted.

This does not limit the ways in which regulations may prescribe an action.

This section does not apply to actions like those already assessed

             (3)  Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to a particular authorisation (the **_later authorisation_**) if the agency or employee has complied with, or is complying with, this Subdivision in relation to another authorisation or proposed authorisation and is satisfied of one or both of the matters in subsection (4).

Which actions are like actions?

             (4)  For the purposes of subsection (3), the agency or employee must be satisfied that:

                     (a)  the Minister’s advice relating to the other authorisation deals or will deal with all the impacts that the action to which the later authorisation relates has, will have or is likely to have on the environment; or

                     (b)  the impacts that the action to which the later authorisation relates has, will have or is likely to have on the environment:

                              (i)  are an extension of the corresponding impacts of the action to which the other authorisation relates; and

                             (ii)  are not significantly different in nature from those corresponding impacts; and

                            (iii)  do not significantly add to those corresponding impacts.

State law excluded in relation to aviation

             (5)  A law of a State or Territory does not apply in relation to the assessment of the certain or likely environmental impacts of an action described in paragraph (2)(b) if subsection (1) applies in relation to authorisation of the action, or would apply apart from subsection (3).

##### <a id="161"></a>161  Seeking the Minister’s advice

Requirement for referral

             (1)  If a Commonwealth agency or employee of the Commonwealth proposing to give an authorisation (however described) of an action thinks the agency or employee is required by section 160 (disregarding subsection 160(1A)) to obtain and consider the Minister’s advice before giving the authorisation, the agency or employee must:

                     (a)  refer the proposal to the Minister; and

                     (b)  nominate a person to act as designated proponent of the action.

Minister may request referral

             (2)  The Minister may request a Commonwealth agency or employee of the Commonwealth to:

                     (a)  refer to the Minister a proposal to give an authorisation (however described) of an action; and

                     (b)  nominate a person to act as designated proponent of the action;

if the Minister thinks the agency or employee is required by section 160 (disregarding subsection 160(1A)) to obtain and consider the Minister’s advice before giving the authorisation.

Complying with Minister’s request

             (3)  The Commonwealth agency or employee must comply with the Minister’s request.

Content of referral

             (4)  A referral must include the information prescribed by the regulations.

##### <a id="161A"></a>161A  Minister may decide that advice is not required

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  the Minister receives a referral under subsection 161(1) of a proposal by a Commonwealth agency or employee of the Commonwealth to give an authorisation of an action; and

                     (b)  the Minister is satisfied, on the basis of the information in the referral, that the action does not have, will not have or is not likely to have a significant impact on the environment;

the Minister may decide, in writing, that this Subdivision does not apply in relation to the referral or the action.

             (2)  If the Minister decides that this Subdivision does not apply in relation to the referral or the action, this Act (other than Divisions 2 and 3 of Part 7) applies as if the Minister had decided under Division 2 of Part 7 that the action is not a controlled action.

             (3)  If the Minister decides that this Subdivision does not apply in relation to the referral or the action, the Minister must:

                     (a)  give written notice of the decision to the agency or employee who referred the proposal to give an authorisation of the action; and

                     (b)  publish notice of the decision in accordance with the regulations.

##### <a id="161B"></a>161B  Certain provisions of other Acts not to apply if Minister decides that advice is not required

             (1)  This section applies in relation to a provision of another Act that is expressed to apply if:

                     (a)  the advice of the Minister is sought under this Subdivision in relation to a proposal to give an authorisation (however described) of an action; or

                     (b)  a proposal to give an authorisation (however described) of an action is referred to the Minister under this Subdivision.

             (2)  The provision does not apply in relation to an action if:

                     (b)  the Minister has decided under section 161A that this Subdivision does not apply in relation to the referral or the action.

Note:          See, for example, subsections 94(6A) and 95(3A) of the _Airports Act 1996_ and subsections 16(5) and 29(5) of the _Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1989_.

##### <a id="162"></a>162  Assessment of the action

                   Part 8 (except sections 82, 83 and 84) and the other provisions of this Act (so far as they relate to that Part) apply in relation to the action proposed to be authorised as if:

                     (a)  the referral of the proposal to give the authorisation were a referral of a proposal to take the action; and

                     (b)  the Minister had decided under Division 2 of Part 7 that the action was a controlled action when the proposal to give the authorisation was referred to the Minister; and

                     (c)  the person nominated to act as the designated proponent had been designated as the proponent of the action by the Minister under section 75; and

                     (d)  a reference in Part 8 or those provisions to the relevant impacts of the action were a reference to the impact that the action has, will have or is likely to have on the environment; and

                     (e)  a reference in Part 8 or those provisions to making an informed decision on approving under Part 9 (for the purposes of each controlling provision) the taking of the action were a reference to giving informed advice about the proposal to give an authorisation of the action.

##### <a id="163"></a>163  Providing advice

             (1)  The Minister must give advice on the following matters to the Commonwealth agency or employee of the Commonwealth who referred the proposal to give an authorisation of the action:

                     (a)  whether the agency or employee should give the authorisation;

                     (b)  what conditions (if any) should be attached to the authorisation (if possible) to protect the environment;

                     (c)  any other matter relating to protection of the environment from the action.

##### <a id="164"></a>164  Reporting on response to advice

                   As soon as practicable after considering the Minister’s advice, the Commonwealth agency or employee of the Commonwealth must give the Minister a report stating:

                     (a)  what action has been taken in relation to the Minister’s advice; and

                     (b)  if the agency or employee did not give effect to some or all of the Minister’s advice—why the agency or employee did not do so.

#### Subdivision C—Assessment under agreement with State or Territory

##### <a id="166"></a>166  This Subdivision applies if Ministers agree it should

             (1)  This Subdivision applies if the Minister and a Minister of a State or self-governing Territory agree that it should apply in relation to an action that:

                     (a)  is to be taken in the State or Territory by a constitutional corporation; or

                     (b)  if the agreement is with a Minister of a Territory—is to be taken in the Territory; or

             (2)  This section applies to the adoption or implementation of a policy, plan or program in the same way as it applies to any other action.

             (3)  Despite subsection (1), this Subdivision does not apply in relation to an action to be taken in 2 or more States or self-governing Territories unless there is an agreement between the Minister and a Minister of each of those States and Territories that this Subdivision should apply in relation to the action.

##### <a id="167"></a>167  Making an agreement

Power to make agreement

#### Subdivision AA—The nomination and listing process

##### <a id="194A"></a>194A  Simplified outline

                   The following is a simplified outline of this Subdivision:

* * *

This Subdivision sets out the usual process for including an item in a list referred to in section 178, 181 or 183, or transferring an item from one category in one of those lists to another category in the list.

The usual process involves an annual cycle that revolves around 12-month periods known as assessment periods. The Minister determines the start of the first assessment period (see section 194C).

The usual process involves the following steps for each assessment period for a list:

               (a)     the Minister may determine conservation themes (this step is optional) (see section 194D);

               (b)     the Minister invites people to nominate items for inclusion in the list referred to in section 178, 181 or 183, and gives the nominations to the Scientific Committee (see sections 194E and 194F);

               (c)     the Scientific Committee prepares, and gives to the Minister, a list of items (which will mostly be items that have been nominated) that it thinks should be assessed (see sections 194G to 194J);

               (d)     the Minister finalises the list of items that are to be assessed (see sections 194K and 194L);

               (e)     the Scientific Committee invites people to make comments about the item in the finalised list (see section 194M);

               (f)     the Scientific Committee assesses the item in the finalised list, and gives the assessments to the Minister (see sections 194N and 194P);

               (g)     the Minister decides whether an item that has been assessed should be included in the list referred to in section 178, 181 or 183 (see section 194Q).

The steps mentioned in paragraphs (a) to (d) will generally be completed before the start of the assessment period.

                     (b)  the Committee’s own views about what should be given priority in relation to the assessment period for the Subdivision A List; and

                     (c)  the Committee’s capacity to make assessments under this Division while still performing its other functions; and

                     (d)  any other matters that the Committee considers appropriate.

             (3)  An item is **_eligible for assessment consideration_** in relation to the assessment period for a Subdivision A List if:

                     (a)  the item has been nominated by a nomination referred to in subsection (1); or

                     (b)  the Committee itself wishes to nominate the item for inclusion in the Subdivision A List; or

                     (c)  the item was eligible for assessment consideration, otherwise than because of this paragraph, in relation to the immediately preceding assessment period (if any) for the Subdivision A List but was not included in the finalised priority assessment list for that assessment period for the Subdivision A List.

             (4)  Without limiting the generality of the Scientific Committee’s discretion under subsection (2), the Committee does not have to include in the proposed priority assessment list an item that has been nominated if the Committee considers that:

                     (a)  if the item is not on the Subdivision A List concerned—it is unlikely that the item is eligible to be included in the Subdivision A List; or

                     (b)  if the nomination is for the transfer of the item to another category in the Subdivision A List concerned—it is unlikely that the item is eligible to be included in that other category of the Subdivision A List.

             (5)  For the purposes of subsection (4), the Committee is not required to have regard to any information beyond the information that was included in the nomination.

             (6)  The proposed priority assessment list is not a legislative instrument.

                     (c)  any other information required by the regulations.

             (2)  The assessment completion time for an item must be either:

                     (a)  a time that is at or before the end of the assessment period for the proposed priority assessment list; or

                     (b)  if the Scientific Committee considers it likely that making an assessment in relation to the item will take a period that is longer than 12 months—the end of that longer period (calculated from the start of the assessment period for the proposed priority assessment list).

##### <a id="194J"></a>194J  Statement to be given to Minister with proposed priority assessment list

             (1)  When the Scientific Committee gives the Minister the proposed priority assessment list for an assessment period for a Subdivision A List, the Committee must also give the Minister a statement setting out such information as the Committee considers appropriate relating to:

                     (a)  for each item that is included in the proposed priority assessment list—why the Committee included the item in the list; and

                     (b)  for each item that is not included in the proposed priority assessment list but that was eligible for assessment consideration because of paragraph 194G(3)(a) or (c)—why the Committee did not include the item in the proposed priority assessment list.

             (2)  The statement must also identify, as items nominated by the Scientific Committee, any items that are included in the proposed priority assessment list because the Committee itself wishes to nominate them (see paragraph 194G(3)(b)).

##### <a id="194K"></a>194K  The finalised priority assessment list

             (1)  Within 20 business days after the Minister, under section 194G, receives the proposed priority assessment list for an assessment period for a Subdivision A List, the Minister may, in writing, make changes to the proposed priority assessment list as mentioned in subsection (2).

             (2)  The changes the Minister may make are as follows:

                     (b)  omitting an item from the proposed priority assessment list (and also omitting the matters referred to in subsection 194H(1));

                     (c)  changing the assessment completion time for an item in the proposed priority assessment list;

                     (d)  any other changes of a kind permitted by the regulations.
