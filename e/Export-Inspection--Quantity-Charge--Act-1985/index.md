## SECT
<sect>   8.(1) For the purposes of this Act, where:<lf>    (a) the amount of charge in respect of a prescribed commodity is calculated<lf> by reference to the weight, or the volume, of that prescribed commodity; and<lf>    (b) that prescribed commodity is, or is to be, packed<lf> in a covering;<lf> the weight, or the volume, of the covering itself, as the case requires, shall be disregarded for the purpose of calculating the weight, or the volume, of the prescribed commodity.<lf>   (2) For the purposes of this Act, where a covering, other than a can, contains a prescribed commodity, or more than one prescribed commodity, and matter other than that prescribed commodity or those prescribed commodities, the other matter shall be disregarded for the purpose of calculating the charge payable in respect of that prescribed commodity or those prescribed commodities and the total amount of charge payable shall be:<lf>    (a) where the covering contains a single prescribed commodity-the amount of<lf> charge payable in respect of that commodity; and<lf>    (b) where the covering contains more than one prescribed commodity-the sum<lf> of the amounts that are payable in respect of each of those prescribed commodities.<lf>   (3) Where a can contains a prescribed commodity and matter other than a prescribed commodity:<lf>    (a) the can shall be deemed to contain only the prescribed commodity; and<lf>    (b) for the purpose of calculating the amount of charge payable in respect<lf> of that prescribed commodity:<lf>          (i) if the rate of charge in respect of a prescribed commodity is<lf> described by reference to the weight of the prescribed commodity-the weight of the contents of the can shall be deemed to be the weight of that prescribed commodity;

and<lf>    (b) the rate of charge in respect of at least one of the prescribed<lf> commodities contained in the can is described by reference to the weight of that prescribed commodity;<lf> then, for the purposes of this Act:<lf>    (c) the can shall be deemed to contain only the prescribed commodity (in<lf> this subsection called the 'relevant commodity') that comprises the largest proportion of the total weight of the contents of the can; and<lf>    (d) for the purpose of calculating the amount of charge payable in respect<lf> of the relevant commodity, the weight of the contents of the can shall be deemed to be the weight of the relevant commodity.<lf>   (5) Where, in circumstances described in paragraphs (4) (a) and (b), there is no prescribed commodity in a can that exceeds the weight of the other, or of every other, prescribed commodity in the can because 2 or more prescribed commodities in the can (in this subsection referred to as 'major commodities') are of equal weight, then:<lf>    (a) in a case where, were one of those major commodities to be the only<lf> prescribed commodity in the can, a lesser amount of charge would be payable than would be the case if any other of those major commodities were to be the only prescribed commodity in the can-the can shall be deemed to contain only that one of those major commodities and, for the purpose of calculating the amount of charge payable in respect of that major commodity, the weight of the contents of the can shall be deemed to be the weight of that major commodity; and<lf>    (b) in any other case-the can shall be deemed to contain only those major<lf> commodities and, for the purpose of calculating the amount of charge payable in respect of those major commodities, the weight of the contents of the can shall be deemed to be the combined weight of those major commodities.<lf>   (6) Where:<lf>    (a) a can contains more than one prescribed commodity, whether or not it<lf> also contains matter other than a prescribed commodity; and<lf>    (b) the rate of charge in respect of each of the prescribed commodities<lf> contained in the can is described by reference to the volume of that prescribed commodity; then, for the purposes of this Act:<lf>    (c) the can shall be deemed to contain only the prescribed commodity (in<lf> this subsection called the 'relevant commodity') that comprises the largest proportion of the total volume of the contents of the can; and<lf>    (d)  for the purpose of calculating the amount of charge payable in respect<lf> of the relevant commodity, the volume of the contents of the can shall be deemed to be the volume of the relevant commodity.<lf>   (7) Where, in circumstances described in paragraphs (6) (a) and (b), there is no prescribed commodity in a can that exceeds the volume of the other, or of every other, prescribed commodity in the can because 2 or more prescribed commodities in the can (in this subsection referred to as 'major commodities') are of equal volume, then:<lf>    (a) in a case where, were one of those major commodities to be the only<lf> prescribed commodity in the can, a lesser amount of charge would be payable than would be the case if any other of those major commodities were to be the only prescribed commodity in the can-the can shall be deemed to contain only that one of those major commodities and, for the purpose of calculating the amount of charge payable in respect of that major commodity, the volume of the contents of the can shall be deemed to be the volume of that major commodity; and<lf>    (b) in any other case-the can shall be deemed to contain only those major<lf> commodities and, for the purpose of calculating the amount of charge payable in respect of those major commodities, the volume of the contents of the can shall be deemed to be the combined volume of those major commodities.<lf>   (8) Where alternative rates of charge, described in the one instance by reference to weight and in the other instance by reference to volume, are prescribed in respect of a prescribed commodity, then, in the application of subsections (4), (5), (6) and (7) to that prescribed commodity:<lf>    (a) if a lesser amount of charge would be imposed if charge were calculated<lf> by reference to the weight of that prescribed commodity-that prescribed commodity shall be taken to be a prescribed commodity in respect of which the rate of charge is described by reference to weight; and<lf>    (b) if a lesser amount of charge would be imposed if charge were calculated<lf> by reference to the volume of that prescribed commodity-that prescribed commodity shall be taken to be a prescribed commodity in respect of which the rate of charge is described by reference to volume.<lf>   (9) In this section:<lf>    (a) a reference to a prescribed commodity shall be construed as including a<lf> reference to a prescribed commodity that is included in a class of that prescribed commodity; and<lf>    (b) a reference to more than one prescribed commodity shall, in relation to<lf> each prescribed commodity that is included in that group of prescribed commodities (in this paragraph referred to as 'a relevant commodity'), be construed as including a reference to a relevant commodity that is included in a class of that relevant commodity.<lf>   (10) A reference in subsection (3), (6) or (7) to the volume of the contents of the can shall not be taken to include a reference to any gaseous matter in that can. </lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></sect>
