                     (a)  did not know; and

                     (b)  could not, with reasonable diligence, have ascertained;

that its group met the energy use threshold for the trigger year under section 10.

##### <a id="10"></a>10  Energy use threshold

             (1)  A controlling corporation’s group meets the **_energy use threshold_** for a financial year if in that year the total energy used by the entities that are members of the group is more than 0.5 petajoules.

             (1)  Subsection 9(1) does not apply to a controlling corporation in relation to a particular financial year if the corporation is covered by an exemption under subsection (5) for that year.

             (2)  A controlling corporation may apply to the Secretary for an exemption from the requirement to be registered under Part 4 in relation to a particular financial year if:

                     (a)  it is not already registered under Part 4; and

                     (b)  the controlling corporation’s group met the energy use threshold for the previous financial year (the **_trigger year_**) under section 10.

## Part 4—Registration

##### <a id="12"></a>12  The Register

          (1A)  The object of this section is to encourage compliance with this Act by providing for a register containing information about corporations registered under this Part and their compliance with this Act.

             (1)  The Secretary must cause a Register to be kept for the purposes of this Act.

             (2)  The Register is called the Register of Corporations for the Energy Efficiency Opportunities Scheme.

             (3)  The Secretary may cause the contents of part or all of the Register to be made available to the public by electronic or other means.

             (4)  The Secretary must cause the following information, and only that information, to be entered on the Register:

##### <a id="14"></a>14  Corporation may apply for deregistration

             (1)  A registered corporation may apply to the Secretary to be deregistered.

Note:          Section 70 of the _Crimes Act 1914_ creates an offence where Commonwealth officers (including persons performing services for or on behalf of the Commonwealth) disclose information in breach of a duty of confidentiality.

             (2)  The application must:

                     (a)  contain information required by the regulations; and

                     (b)  be in the form (if any) specified in the regulations.

          (2A)  Regulations made for the purposes of paragraph (2)(a) may only require information that is reasonably necessary for assessing applications made under this section.

             (3)  The Secretary must remove the name of the corporation from the Register if the Secretary is satisfied that the registered corporation’s group is not likely to meet the energy use threshold in section 10 for:

                     (a)  the financial year in which the application is made; and

                     (b)  the next 2 financial years.

             (4)  The corporation ceases to be registered under this Part when the Secretary has removed its name from the Register.

## Part 5—Assessment plan

##### <a id="15"></a>15  Registered corporation must submit assessment plan every 5 years

             (1)  A registered corporation must give the Secretary an assessment plan meeting the requirements in section 18.

Note:          Section 70 of the _Crimes Act 1914_ creates an offence where Commonwealth officers (including persons performing services for or on behalf of the Commonwealth) disclose information in breach of a duty of confidentiality.

             (2)  An assessment plan must be given to the Secretary at a time during each of the following periods:

                     (a)  the period of 18 months beginning on 1 July in the financial year in which the corporation was most recently required to make an application under section 9 to be registered under Part 4;

                     (b)  the period of 18 months beginning on every fifth anniversary of that 1 July.

Example:    A registered corporation’s trigger year under section 9 is the financial year 2005‑2006\. In the financial year 2006‑2007 the corporation is required to apply under that section to be registered under Part 4.

                   The corporation’s first assessment plan must be given during the period of 18 months beginning on 1 July 2006 and ending on 31 December 2007.

                   The corporation’s later assessment plans must be given during the period of 18 months beginning on 1 July 2011 and ending on 31 December 2012, and so on.

             (4)  To avoid doubt, a controlling corporation that has applied to be registered under Part 4, but is not yet registered, may give the Secretary an assessment plan for the purposes of complying with subsection (1).

             (5)  A registered corporation contravenes this subsection if it fails to comply with subsections (1) and (2).

Note:          Clause 3 of Schedule 1 provides for a civil penalty for failing to comply with this subsection.

##### <a id="16"></a>16  Approval of assessment plan

             (1)  This section applies if the Secretary has been given an assessment plan under section 15.

             (2)  If the Secretary is satisfied that the assessment plan substantially meets the requirements in section 18, the Secretary must:

                     (a)  approve the assessment plan; and

                     (b)  give the controlling corporation written notice of the approval.

             (3)  If the Secretary has not refused to approve the assessment plan within 6 months after receiving it, he or she:

                     (a)  is taken to be satisfied that it substantially meets the requirements in section 18; and

                     (b)  must deal with it under subsection (2) accordingly.

##### <a id="17"></a>17  Refusal to approve assessment plan

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  the Secretary has been given an assessment plan under section 15; and

                     (b)  he or she is not satisfied that the assessment plan substantially  meets the requirements in section 18.

             (2)  The Secretary must:

                     (a)  refuse to approve the assessment plan; and

                     (b)  give the controlling corporation written notice of the refusal.

             (3)  The Secretary must also:

                     (a)  prepare a revised assessment plan for the controlling corporation that  substantially  meets the requirements in section 18, to the satisfaction of the Secretary; and

                     (b)  give the controlling corporation a notice:

                              (i)  setting out the revised assessment plan; and

                             (ii)  inviting the controlling corporation to comment on the revised assessment plan within a specified period.

             (4)  At the end of the period specified in the invitation, the Secretary may:

                     (a)  approve the revised assessment plan; and

                     (b)  give the controlling corporation written notice of the approval.

             (5)  In making a decision under subsection (4), the Secretary must consider any written comments received from the controlling corporation within the period specified in the invitation.

             (6)  If the Secretary does not approve the revised assessment plan under subsection (4), this section applies in relation to that plan as if:

                     (a)  it were an assessment plan that the Secretary had been given under section 15; and

                     (b)  the Secretary were not satisfied that it substantially  met the requirements in section 18.

Note:          This means that the Secretary must prepare a new revised assessment plan, and send it to the controlling corporation for comment.

##### <a id="18"></a>18  Requirements for an assessment plan

             (1)  An assessment plan must set out a proposal for assessing the opportunities for improving the energy efficiency of the controlling corporation’s group for the period mentioned in this table:
