	(4)	If:
	(a)	a relevant authority is required by an Act other than this Act to prepare an annual report for presentation to the Parliament; and
	(b)	the annual report is lodged with the responsible Minister within 3 months after the end of the period to which a program report relates;
then the authority may, with the consent of the responsible Minister, include that program report in the annual report.
	(5)	Where an authority ceases to be a relevant authority, this section continues to apply, in relation to the final period, as if:
