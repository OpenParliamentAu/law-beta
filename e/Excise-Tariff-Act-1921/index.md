          (1B)  For the indexation period that commences on  1 February 2003 and any subsequent indexation period, this section does not apply to:

          (4A)  If the rate of duty worked out under subsection (4) in respect of an item or subitem of the Schedule (the **_prescribed rate_**) has more decimal places than the number of decimal places in the relevant rate, the prescribed rate is to be rounded in accordance with subsections (4B) and (4C).

          (4B)  If the prescribed rate worked out to one more decimal place than the relevant rate would end in a number less than 5, the rate worked out under subsection (4) is taken to be a rate of duty equal to the prescribed rate worked out to the same number of decimal places as the relevant rate.

          (4C)  If the prescribed rate worked out to one more decimal place than the relevant rate would end in 5 or a greater number, the rate of duty worked out under subsection (4) is taken to be a rate of duty equal to the prescribed rate worked out to the same number of decimal places as the relevant rate increased by:

 2—0.01; or

             (5)  The factor to be ascertained for the purposes of subsection (4) in relation to a relevant period:

                     (a)  is the number, calculated to 3 decimal places, ascertained by dividing:

                              (i)  if the relevant period commences on 1 February—the index number for the last preceding December quarter; or

                             (ii)  if the relevant period commences on 1 August—the index number for the last preceding June quarter;

                            by the highest index number in respect of a December or June quarter that preceded that quarter, not being a December or June quarter that occurred before the December quarter in the year 1983; or

                     (b)  if the number so ascertained would, if it were calculated to 4 decimal places, end in a number greater than 4—is the number so ascertained increased by 0.001.

             (6)  If an index number necessary for the calculation of the factor to be ascertained in relation to a relevant period in accordance with subsection (5) is not published by the Statistician more than 5 days before the first day of the period, subsection (4) has effect in relation to the period as if the reference in that subsection to the first day of the period were a reference to the day that is 5 days after the day on which the index number was published.

             (7)  Where by virtue of the application of this section, this Act has effect as if another rate of duty were substituted for a relevant rate on a particular day, the substitution, in so far as it affects duty payable in relation to goods, has effect in relation to goods entered for home consumption on or after that day.

             (8)  Where, by virtue of the application of this section, this Act is to have effect as if another rate of duty (in this subsection referred to as a **_substituted rate_**) were substituted for a relevant rate on a particular day, the CEO shall, on or as soon as practicable after that day, publish for the information of the public a notice in the _Gazette_ advertising the substituted rates and goods to which they are to apply.

### Note 2

Section 6A of the Act provides for the automatic indexation of the rate of duty of certain excise items. If a rate increases, subsection 6A(8) requires the Chief Executive Officer to publish a notice in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette of the new rate and the goods to which it applies as soon as practicable after the new rate takes effect. The Act is not updated to reflect the rates set out in the Gazette notices. The updated rates can be found at the Australian Taxation Office’s website, http://www.ato.gov.au – search on “excise rates”.
