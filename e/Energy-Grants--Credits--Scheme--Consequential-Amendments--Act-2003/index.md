1  Transitional extension of Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme  to certain fuel purchased or imported into Australia before 1&#160;July 2003

(1)	Subject to subitem&#160;(1A), this item applies if, during the period from the beginning of 1&#160;July 2000 until the end of 30&#160;June 2003, an entity purchased or imported into Australia on-road diesel fuel, on-road alternative fuel or off-road diesel fuel, within the meaning of the _Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme Act 2003_ as in force on 1&#160;July 2003 (including as affected by regulations under that Act commencing on that day)_._
 (1A)	This item does not apply if:

	(a)	the on-road alternative fuel is liquefied natural gas or biodiesel; or
 	(b)	the entity purchased or imported into Australia the off-road diesel fuel before 1&#160;July 2002 for a use mentioned in paragraph 53(4)(a) of the _Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme Act 2003_ as in force on 1&#160;July 2003.

Note:	The effect of subitem&#160;(2) will be to create entitlements to energy grants that, subject to subitem&#160;(3), can be claimed under section&#160;15 of the _Product Grants and Benefits Administration Act 2000_. However, because of the claim period requirements in that section, a claim will not be able to be made more than 3 years after the actual time of purchase or importation of the fuel concerned.

(3)	If, as a result of subitem&#160;(2), an entity becomes entitled to an energy grant under the _Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme Act 2003_, the entity is not entitled to make a claim for payment of the grant under section&#160;15 of the _Product Grants and Benefits Administration Act 2000_ if:

	(a)	the entity has made a claim (other than one that has been withdrawn) in respect of the same fuel under section&#160;15 of the _Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme Act 1999_, including in its operation in accordance with item&#160;2 of Schedule&#160;2 to this Act; or
 	(b)	the entity has made an application (other than one that has been withdrawn) in respect of the same fuel under section&#160;164 of the _Customs Act 1901_, including in its operation in accordance with item&#160;25 of Schedule&#160;3 to this Act; or
 	(c)	the entity has made an application (other than one that has been withdrawn) in respect of the same fuel under section&#160;78A of the _Excise Act 1901_, including in its operation in accordance with item&#160;18 of Schedule&#160;4 to this Act.
