## 1  Subsection 5(1)

Insert:

                    <a name="princip-carer"></a>**_principal carer_**, of a child, has the meaning given by subsections (15) to (24).

## 2  At the end of subsection 5(2)

Add:

Note:          For paragraph (a), see also subsection (16).

## 3  At the end of section 5

Add:

Principal carer

           (15)  A person is the **_principal carer_** of a child if:

                     (a)  the child is a dependent child of the person; and

                     (b)  the child has not turned 16.

Note:          The definition of **_dependent child_** in subsection (2) requires:

(a)           the adult to be legally responsible (whether alone or jointly with another person) for the day-to-day care, welfare and development of the child: subsection (16) deals with the circumstances in which a step-parent is taken to have such legal responsibility; and

(b)           a child to be in an adult’s care: subsection (17) deals with the circumstances in which a child is taken to remain in an adult’s care.

           (16)  For the purpose of determining whether a person is the **_principal carer_** of a child, the person is taken to be legally responsible (whether alone or jointly with another person) for the day-to-day care, welfare and development of the child if:

                     (a)  the person is the step-parent of the child; and

                     (b)  the person is living with the child and a parent of the child; and

                     (c)  the person and the parent are members of the same couple.

This subsection does not, by implication, affect the determination of whether a person is taken to be legally responsible (whether alone or jointly with another person) for the day-to-day care, welfare and development of a child in cases to which this subsection does not apply.

           (17)  For the purpose of determining whether a person is the **_principal carer_** of a child, the child is taken to remain in the person’s care if:

                     (a)  at the start of a period not exceeding 8 weeks, the child leaves the person’s care; and

                     (b)  throughout the period, the child is the dependent child of another person; and

                     (c)  the child returns, or the Secretary is satisfied that the child will return, to the first person’s care at the end of the period.

This subsection does not, by implication, affect the determination of whether a child is in the care of a person in cases to which this subsection does not apply (for example, if the period exceeds 8 weeks).

           (18)  Only one person at a time can be the principal carer of a particular child.

           (19)  If the Secretary is satisfied that, but for subsection (18), 2 or more persons (**_adults_**) would be principal carers of the same child, the Secretary must:

                     (a)  make a written determination specifying one of the adults as the principal carer of the child; and

                     (b)  give a copy of the determination to each adult.

           (20)  The Secretary may make the determination even if all the adults have not claimed a social security payment that is based on, or would be affected by, the adult being the principal carer of the child.

           (21)  If a child:

                     (a)  leaves Australia temporarily; and

                     (b)  continues to be absent from Australia for more than 13 weeks;

a person cannot be the principal carer of the child at any time after the 13 weeks while the child remains absent from Australia unless, at that time:

                     (c)  the child is in the company of a person to whom Division 2 of Part 4.2 applies; and

                     (d)  but for this subsection, the person would be the principal carer of the child; and

                     (e)  the person’s portability period (within the meaning of that Division) for a social security payment:

                              (i)  that the person was receiving immediately before the person’s absence from Australia; or

                             (ii)  the person’s claim for which was granted during the absence;

                            has not ended.

           (22)  For the purposes of subsection (21), in determining if an absence is temporary, regard must be had to the following factors:

                     (a)  the purpose of the absence;

                     (b)  the intended duration of the absence;

                     (c)  the frequency of such absences.

           (23)  If a child:

                     (a)  is born outside Australia; and

                     (b)  continues to be absent from Australia for a period of more than 13 weeks immediately following the child’s birth;

a person cannot be the principal carer of the child at any time after the 13 weeks while the child remains absent from Australia unless, at that time:

                     (c)  the child is in the company of a person to whom Division 2 of Part 4.2 applies; and

                     (d)  but for this subsection, the person would be the principal carer of the child; and

                     (e)  the person’s portability period (within the meaning of that Division) for a social security payment:

                              (i)  that the person was receiving immediately before the person’s absence from Australia; or

                             (ii)  the person’s claim for which was granted during the absence;

                            has not ended.

           (24)  If:

                     (a)  a person is not the principal carer of a child because of subsection (21) (absence from Australia) or (23) (birth outside Australia), or because of a previous application of this subsection; and

                     (b)  the child comes to Australia; and

                     (c)  the child leaves Australia less than 13 weeks later;

a person cannot be the principal carer of the child when the child leaves Australia as mentioned in paragraph (c).

## 4  After section 5A

Insert:

##### <a id="5B"></a>5B  Registered and active foster carers

             (1)  A person is a **_registered and active foster carer_** if the Secretary is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the person meets the requirements (if any) of the law of the State or Territory in which the person resides that the person must meet in order to be permitted, under the law of that State or Territory, to provide foster care in that State or Territory; and

                     (b)  the person is taken, in accordance with guidelines made under subsection (2), to be actively involved in providing foster care in that State or Territory.

             (2)  The Secretary may, by legislative instrument, make guidelines setting out the circumstances in which persons are taken, for the purposes of the social security law, to be actively involved in providing foster care in that State or Territory.

##### <a id="5C"></a>5C  Home educators

                   A person is a **_home educator_** of a child if the Secretary is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the child is receiving, in the person’s home, education that wholly or substantially replaces the education that the child would otherwise receive by attending a school; and

                     (b)  the person meets the requirements (if any) of the law of the State or Territory in which the person resides that the person must meet in order to be permitted, under the law of that State or Territory, to provide that education to the child; and

                     (c)  the person is suitably involved in providing and supervising that education.

##### <a id="5D"></a>5D  Distance educators

                   A person is a **_distance educator_** of a child if the Secretary is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the child is enrolled to receive education by undertaking a distance education curriculum; and

                     (b)  the child is undertaking that curriculum; and

                     (c)  the person is suitably involved in assisting and supervising the child in relation to that curriculum.

## 6  After section 16A

Insert:

##### <a id="16B"></a>16B  Partial capacity to work

             (1)  A person has a **_partial capacity to work_** if:

                     (a)  the person has a physical, intellectual or psychiatric impairment; and

                     (b)  the Secretary is satisfied that:

                              (i)  the impairment of itself prevents the person from doing 30 hours per week of work independently of a program of support within the next 2 years; and

                             (ii)  no training activity is likely (because of the impairment) to enable the person to do 30 hours per week of work independently of a program of support within the next 2 years.

             (2)  A person is treated as doing work **_independently of a program of support_** if the Secretary is satisfied that to do the work the person:

                     (a)  is unlikely to need a program of support that:

                              (i)  is designed to assist the person to prepare for, find or maintain work; and

                             (ii)  is funded (wholly or partly) by the Commonwealth or is of a type that the Secretary considers is similar to a program of support that is funded (wholly or partly) by the Commonwealth; or

                     (b)  is likely to need such a program of support provided occasionally; or

                     (c)  is likely to need such a program of support that is not ongoing.

             (3)  In deciding whether he or she is satisfied as mentioned in paragraph (1)(b), the Secretary is to have regard to the guidelines (if any) determined and in force under subsection (4).

             (4)  The Secretary may, by legislative instrument, determine guidelines to be complied with in deciding whether he or she is satisfied as mentioned in paragraph (1)(b).

             (4)  The Secretary must determine, by legislative instrument, kinds of requirements that agreements must not contain.

                     (a)  may be varied (in negotiation with the person) or suspended; and

                     (b)  if another Parenting Payment Activity Agreement is made with the person, may be cancelled; and

                     (a)  either:

                              (i)  if the person’s rate of parenting payment is worked out under the Pension PP (Single) Rate Calculator in section 1068A—because of the application of Module E of that rate calculator, the person is receiving a parenting payment at a rate that has been reduced; or

                             (ii)  if the person’s rate of parenting payment is worked out under the Benefit PP (Partnered) Rate Calculator in section 1068B—because of the application of Module D of that rate calculator, the person is receiving a parenting payment at a rate that has been reduced; or

                              (i)  it has been established that there is medical evidence that the person has an illness, disability or injury that would be aggravated by the conditions in which the work would be performed; or

                             (ii)  performing the work in the conditions in which the work would be performed would constitute a risk to health or safety or would contravene a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory relating to occupational health and safety; or

                     (c)  the person is at least 50 years of age and is not a person to whom subsection 28(4) applies.

             (2)  The Secretary may, by notice given to a person whom a Parenting Payment Activity Agreement requires to participate in an approved program of work for income support payment, revoke the requirement to participate in the program if the Secretary:

                     (a)  is satisfied that:

                              (i)  if the person’s rate of parenting payment is worked out under the Pension PP (Single) Rate Calculator in section 1068A—because of the application of Module E of that rate calculator, the person is receiving a parenting payment at a rate that has been reduced; or

             (3)  Upon the Secretary so notifying the person, the requirement is taken to have been revoked with effect from the day specified in the notice.

### Division 3—Additional participation requirements

##### <a id="502"></a>502  Secretary may impose additional participation requirements

             (1)  Subject to sections 502A and 502B, if the Secretary is of the opinion that, throughout a period, a person who:

                     (a)  is subject to participation requirements; and

                     (b)  is not covered by a participation exemption under Division 3A;

should undertake particular paid work, other than paid work that is unsuitable to be done by the person, the Secretary may notify the person that the person is required to act in accordance with the opinion.

Note 1:       For when a person is **_subject to participation requirements_** see subsection 23(1).

Note 2:       See subsection (4) on what paid work is unsuitable.

             (2)  To avoid doubt, the work that the person is required to undertake under subsection (1) may involve a number of hours per week that differs from the number of hours of work per week that the person is required to seek to comply with a Parenting Payment Activity Agreement between the Secretary and the person.

             (3)  The person can be taken not to have complied with requirements notified to the person under subsection (1) whether or not the person has complied with requirements to enter into a Parenting Payment Activity Agreement and comply with its terms.

             (4)  Subject to subsections (7) and (8), for the purposes of this section, particular paid work is unsuitable for a person if and only if, in the Secretary’s opinion:

                     (a)  the person lacks the particular skills, experience or qualifications that are needed to perform the work and no training will be provided by the employer; or

                     (b)  it has been established that there is medical evidence that the person has an illness, disability or injury that would be aggravated by the conditions in which the work would be performed; or

                     (c)  the person does not have access to appropriate care and supervision, for the one or more children for whom the person is the principal carer, at the times when the person would be required to undertake the work; or

Note:       For **_principal carer_** see subsections 5(15) to (24).

                     (d)  performing the work in the conditions in which the work would be performed would constitute a risk to health or safety and would contravene a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory relating to occupational health and safety; or

                     (e)  the work would be covered by the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard, but the terms and conditions for the work would be less generous than the minimum terms and conditions for the work under the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard; or

                      (f)  the work would not be covered by the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard, but, if it were so covered, the terms and conditions for the work would be less generous than the minimum terms and conditions for the work under the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard; or

                     (g)  commuting between the person’s home and the place of work would be unreasonably difficult; or

                     (h)  the work would require enlistment in the Defence Force or the Reserves; or

                      (i)  the work requires the person to move from a home in one place to a home in another place; or

                      (j)  for any other reason, the work is unsuitable for the person.

          (4A)  The Secretary must, by legislative instrument, determine matters that the Secretary must take into account in deciding whether, for the purposes of paragraph (4)(j), particular paid work is unsuitable for a person.

          (4B)  To avoid doubt, a determination under subsection (4A) does not limit the matters that the Secretary may take into account in deciding whether, for the purposes of paragraph (4)(j), particular paid work is unsuitable for a person.

             (5)  A person has, for the purposes of paragraph (4)(c), access to appropriate care and supervision for a child at a particular time if, at that time:

                     (a)  the child could be provided with care by an approved child care service (within the meaning of the Family Assistance Administration Act), and provision of that care would, in the Secretary’s opinion, be appropriate in the circumstances; or

                     (b)  the child could be provided with other care that the person considers to be suitable; or

                     (c)  the child could be attending school, and attendance at that school would, in the Secretary’s opinion, be appropriate in the circumstances.

             (6)  For the purposes of paragraph (4)(c), a time when the person would be required to undertake the work includes reasonable amounts of time that would be needed for the person to travel from the person’s home to the place of work and from the place of work to the person’s home.

             (7)  If:

                     (a)  a person seeks work in an area (the **_new area_**) that is outside the area (the **_old area_**) in which the person’s home is situated; and

                     (b)  the person is offered permanent work (whether or not work of the kind sought) in the new area;

the work offered is not unsuitable for the person because of paragraph (4)(g) or (i) unless:

                     (c)  the person is under the age of 18; or

                     (d)  the person or the person’s partner is pregnant; or

                     (e)  the person or the person’s partner has a severe medical condition and the condition makes it unreasonable for the person to accept the offer; or

                      (f)  the acceptance of the offer would jeopardise the current employment, or the employment prospects, of the person’s partner; or

                     (g)  the person or the person’s partner has a child under the age of 16 years who is living with them or is living somewhere else in the old area; or

                     (h)  the person or the person’s partner has significant caring responsibilities in the old area; or

                      (i)  the educational, cultural or religious background of the person makes it unreasonable for the person to accept the offer; or

                      (j)  it is more appropriate for the person to participate in education or training than to accept the offer; or

                     (k)  the person would suffer severe financial hardship if the person were to accept the offer.

             (8)  Without affecting what would otherwise constitute a person seeking work outside the area in which the person’s home is situated, if a person, when seeking employment through an employment service provider, represents to the provider that the person is willing to undertake work outside the area in which the person’s home is situated, the person is taken for the purposes of subsection (7) to seek work outside the area at the time when the representation is made.

             (9)  A reference in subsection (4) to remuneration for work is a reference to any income derived from the work that is income from personal exertion.

Note:          For **_income from personal exertion_** see subsection 8(1).

##### <a id="502A"></a>502A  People 55 and over who are engaged in work

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), the Secretary must not notify under subsection 502(1) a person in respect of a period (the **_relevant period_**) if the person has reached 55 years and:

                     (a)  is engaged in approved unpaid voluntary work for an approved organisation for at least 30 hours in the period; or

Extending the meaning of who is unemployed

                     (c)  fails to comply with a requirement to undertake another activity referred to in paragraph 576A(1)(b).

Reasonable excuse

             (2)  Despite subsection (1), a failure of a kind referred to in that subsection is not an austudy participation failure if the person satisfies the Secretary that the person had a reasonable excuse for the failure.

          (2A)  The Secretary must, by legislative instrument, determine matters that the Secretary must take into account in deciding whether, for the purposes of subsection (2), a person had a reasonable excuse for committing an austudy participation failure.

          (2B)  To avoid doubt, a determination under subsection (2A) does not limit the matters that the Secretary may take into account in deciding whether, for the purposes of subsection (2), a person had a reasonable excuse for committing the austudy participation failure referred to in subsection (1).

Subsequent failures in the same instalment period

             (3)  Despite subsection (1), if a failure of a kind referred to in that subsection occurs in an instalment period of the person in which the person has already committed an austudy participation failure, the failure is not an austudy participation failure if:

                     (a)  the instalment period is the person’s first instalment period for austudy payment; or

                     (b)  on that commencement, the activity test non-payment period had not ended;

the activity test non-payment period continues to apply to the person after that commencement as if that Subdivision had not been repealed by this Act.

(2)        In this item:

**_activity test breach_** has the same meaning as it had in section 576A of the _Social Security Act 1991_ before the commencement of this item.

## 4  Transitional provision relating to repeated breaches

(1)        The reference in subsection 577(1) of the _Social Security Act 1991_ as amended by this Act to austudy participation failures committed by a person during the period of 12 months preceding an austudy participation failure includes a reference to any activity test failures committed by the person:

                     (a)  during that period of 12 months; and

                     (b)  before the commencement of this item.

(2)        In this item:

                             (ii)  Subdivision B of Division 5 of Part 2.11A of that Act.

## 7  Saving provision relating to activity test breach rate reduction periods

(1)        If:

                     (b)  on that commencement, the activity test breach rate reduction period had not ended;

the activity test breach rate reduction period continues to apply to the person after that commencement as if that Subdivision had not been repealed by this Act.

(2)        The fact that an activity test breach rate reduction period is applying to the person because of this item does not prevent the application to the person, at the same time, of a period during which austudy payment is not payable because of Subdivision E or F of Division 2 of Part 2.11A of the _Social Security Act 1991_ as amended by this Act.

(3)        In this item:

                     (b)  on that commencement, the administrative breach rate reduction period had not ended;

the administrative breach rate reduction period continues to apply to the person after that commencement as if that section had not been repealed by this Act.

sections 583A to 583G of the _Social Security Act 1991_ continue to apply to the administrative breach rate reduction period after that commencement as if they had not been repealed by this Act.

(2)        The fact that an administrative breach rate reduction period is applying to the person because of this item does not prevent the application to the person, at the same time, of a period during which austudy payment is not payable because of Subdivision E or F of Division 2 of Part 2.11A of the _Social Security Act 1991_ as amended by this Act.

(3)        In this item:

             (4)  Despite subsection (1), a failure of a kind referred to in that subsection is not a newstart participation failure if it results in newstart allowance not being payable to the person under section 615.

          (2B)  To avoid doubt, a determination under subsection (2A) does not limit the matters that the Secretary may take into account in deciding whether, for the purposes of paragraph (2)(a), a person had a reasonable excuse for the failure referred to in paragraph (1)(c).

             (3)  The **_participation failure instalment period_** for the newstart participation failure is:

             (2)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), disregard any earlier failure that is a failure to which subsection 626(1) does not apply because of subsection 626(2).

##### <a id="740"></a>740  Special benefit participation failures

             (1)  A person who is a nominated visa holder commits a **_special benefit participation failure_** if the person:

                     (a)  fails to comply with a requirement:

                              (i)  that was notified to the person under subsection 63(2) or 64(2) of the Administration Act; and

                             (ii)  that was reasonable; and

                            (iii)  the notification of which included a statement to the effect that a failure to comply with the requirement could constitute a special benefit participation failure; or

                     (b)  fails to satisfy the activity test; or

                     (c)  fails to comply with a requirement to enter into a Special Benefit Activity Agreement; or

                     (d)  fails to comply with a term of a Special Benefit Activity Agreement between the Secretary and the person; or

                     (e)  fails to attend a job interview; or

                      (f)  fails:

                              (i)  to commence, complete or participate in an approved program of work for income support payment that the person is required to undertake; or

                             (ii)  to comply with the conditions of such a program; or

                     (g)  fails to continue his or her involvement in a labour market program because he or she:

                              (i)  voluntarily ceases to take part in the program; or

                             (ii)  is dismissed from the program for misconduct; or

                     (h)  is issued with a notice under subsection 741(1) and fails to comply with it within the period specified in the notice; or

                     (k)  fails to comply with a requirement to undertake another activity referred to in paragraph 742(1)(b).

             (2)  Despite subsection (1), a failure of a kind referred to in that subsection is not a special benefit participation failure if the person satisfies the Secretary that the person had a reasonable excuse for the failure.

          (2A)  The Secretary must, by legislative instrument, determine matters that the Secretary must take into account in deciding whether, for the purposes of subsection (2), a person had a reasonable excuse for committing a special benefit participation failure.

          (2B)  To avoid doubt, a determination under subsection (2A) does not limit the matters that the Secretary may take into account in deciding whether, for the purposes of subsection (2), a person had a reasonable excuse for committing the special benefit participation failure referred to in subsection (1).

             (3)  Despite subsection (1), if a failure of a kind referred to in that subsection occurs in an instalment period of the person in which the person has already committed a special benefit participation failure, the failure is not a special benefit participation failure if:

                     (a)  the instalment period is the person’s first instalment period for special benefit; or

                     (b)  the instalment period is not the person’s first instalment period for special benefit, and:

                             (ii)  in respect of each special benefit participation failure that the person committed in the immediately preceding instalment period of the person, the person acted in accordance with a requirement of the Secretary notified in respect of that failure.

             (4)  Paragraph (1)(f) does not apply to a failure if:

                     (a)  the person is under 60; and

                     (b)  a determination under paragraph 28(4)(b) is in force in relation to the person.

             (5)  Paragraph (1)(j) does not limit the scope of paragraph (1)(d).

##### <a id="741"></a>741  Requiring a person to apply for job vacancies

             (1)  The Secretary may notify a person who:

                     (a)  is a nominated visa holder (other than a person who is not required to satisfy the activity test); and

                     (b)  is receiving special benefit;

that the person must apply for a particular number of advertised job vacancies in the period specified in the notice.

             (2)  The person must give the Secretary a written statement from each employer whose job vacancy the person applied for that confirms that the person applied for that job vacancy.

             (3)  The statement from the employer must be in a form approved by the Secretary.

             (4)  Subsection (2) does not apply to the person if the Secretary is satisfied that there are special circumstances in which it is not reasonable to expect the person to give the statement referred to in that subsection.

                     (b)  the Secretary requires the person:

                              (i)  to comply with the requirement, or undertake the activity, to which the special benefit participation failure relates; or

                             (ii)  to comply with a particular requirement, or undertake a particular activity, in place of the requirement or activity to which the failure relates;

                            during the participation failure instalment period for the failure, or at a particular time during that period; and

                     (c)  the person fails to comply with the requirement.

However, paragraphs (b) and (c) do not apply in relation to a special benefit participation failure of a kind referred to in paragraph 740(1)(h), (i) or (j).

             (2)  This section does not apply in relation to the failure if:

                     (a)  the Secretary is satisfied that the person had a reasonable excuse for the failure referred to paragraph (1)(c); or

                     (b)  the Secretary is for any other reason satisfied that subsection (1) should not apply to the failure.

          (2B)  To avoid doubt, a determination under subsection (2A) does not limit the matters that the Secretary may take into account in deciding whether, for the purposes of paragraph (2)(a), a person had a reasonable excuse for the failure referred to in paragraph (1)(c).

             (3)  The **_participation failure instalment period_** for the special benefit participation failure is:

                     (a)  if the failure is a failure of a kind referred to in paragraph 740(1)(h) or (i)—the next instalment period of the person to start after the end of the period specified in the notice under subsection 741(1) to which the failure relates; or

                     (b)  if the failure is a failure of a kind referred to in paragraph 740(1)(j)—the next instalment period of the person to start after the end of the period referred to in subparagraph 740(1)(j)(iii); or

                     (c)  otherwise—the next instalment period of the person to start after the day on which the Secretary first became aware that the person committed the failure.

             (4)  This section does not apply to a special benefit participation failure if section 745 applies to the failure.

##### <a id="743"></a>743  When the period of non-payment starts

                   The period for which special benefit is not payable to the person because of section 742 is taken to have started at the start of the participation failure instalment period for the special benefit participation failure.

                     (b)  in accordance with a requirement of the Secretary that the person undertake another activity in place of the requirement or activity to which the special benefit participation failure related, the person has undertaken the other activity; or

                             (ii)  to comply with the conditions of such a program.

          (1B)  To avoid doubt, a determination under subsection (1A) does not limit the matters that the Secretary may take into account in deciding whether, for the purposes of paragraph (1)(d), a person had a reasonable excuse for refusing or failing to accept a suitable offer of employment referred to in that paragraph.

             (2)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), disregard any earlier failure that is a failure to which subsection 742(1) does not apply because of subsection 742(2).
