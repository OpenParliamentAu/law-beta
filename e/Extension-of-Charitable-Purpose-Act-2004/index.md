##### <a id="1"></a>1  Short title<span style="font-size:9.0pt; font-weight:normal"> [_see_ Note 1]</span>

                   This Act may be cited as the _Extension of Charitable Purpose Act 2004_.

##### <a id="2"></a>2  Commencement

                   This Act commences, or is taken to have commenced, on 1 July 2004.

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Definitions

                   In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears:

                    <a name="alloc"></a>**_allocation_** has the same meaning as in the _National Rental Affordability Scheme Act 2008_.

                    <a name="chariti"></a>**_charity_** means a charitable institution, a charitable fund or any other kind of charitable body.

                    <a name="entiti"></a>**_entity_** has the same meaning as in the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

                    <a name="first-nra-year"></a>**_first 2 NRAS years_** means:

                     (a)  the period referred to in paragraph (a) of the definition of **_NRAS year_** in the _National Rental Affordability Scheme Act 2008_; and

                     (b)  the year beginning on 1 May 2009.

                    <a name="incent-period"></a>**_incentive period_** has the same meaning as in the _National Rental Affordability Scheme Act 2008_.

                    <a name="instrum"></a>**_instrument_** means any instrument (including rules, regulations or by‑laws) made, granted or issued under an Act.

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Provision of child care services is a charitable purpose

             (1)  Without limiting what constitutes a charitable purpose, **_charitable purpose_** includes the provision of child care services on a non‑profit basis.

             (2)  This section applies:

                     (a)  for the purposes of a provision of an Act or instrument; and

                     (b)  for the purpose of determining whether an institution or fund is, for the purposes of a provision of an Act or instrument, a charity.

             (3)  The fact that, because of this section, a purpose of an institution or fund is a charitable purpose does not affect the question whether that purpose is for the public benefit.

##### <a id="4A"></a>4A  Provision of a rental dwelling under National Rental Affordability Scheme is a charitable purpose

             (1)  Without limiting what constitutes a charitable purpose, **_charitable purpose_** includes the provision of a rental dwelling if:

                     (a)  the rental dwelling is provided by an entity that is:

                              (i)  endorsed as exempt from income tax by the Commissioner of Taxation under section 50‑105 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

                             (ii)  an approved participant in the National Rental Affordability Scheme; and

                     (b)  either:

                              (i)  an allocation in relation to the rental dwelling has been made to the approved participant by the Secretary that specifies a date in the first 2 NRAS years from which the allocation will operate or is taken to have operated; or

                             (ii)  an allocation in relation to the rental dwelling has been reserved and it is genuinely intended by the approved participant that the conditions on which the allocation has been reserved will be fulfilled in the first 2 NRAS years.

             (2)  To avoid doubt, the provision of the rental dwelling by the entity has effect as a charitable purpose only during the incentive period for the allocation.

             (3)  This section applies:

                     (a)  for the purposes of a provision of a taxation law or any instrument made, granted or issued under a taxation law; and

                     (b)  for the purpose of determining whether an entity that has been endorsed as exempt from income tax by the Commissioner of Taxation under section 50‑105 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, remains, for the purposes of a provision of a taxation law or any instrument made, granted or issued under a taxation law, entitled to be so endorsed.

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Self‑help groups and closed or contemplative religious orders are for the public benefit

             (1)  Without limiting what constitutes a public benefit, an institution has a purpose that is for the public benefit to the extent that the institution is:

                     (a)  an open and non‑discriminatory self‑help group (see subsection (2)); or

                     (b)  a closed or contemplative religious order that regularly undertakes prayerful intervention at the request of members of the public.

             (2)  An institution is an **_open and non‑discriminatory self‑help group_** if:

                     (a)  it is an association of individuals that has an open and non‑discriminatory membership; and

                     (b)  it is established for the purpose of assisting individuals affected by:

                              (i)  a particular disadvantage or discrimination; or

                             (ii)  a need, arising out of a particular disadvantage or discrimination, that is not being met; and

                     (c)  it is made up of, and controlled by, individuals who are affected by the disadvantage or discrimination; and

                     (d)  all of its criteria for membership relate to its purpose; and

                     (e)  its membership is open to any individual who satisfies the criteria.

             (3)  This section applies for the purpose of determining whether an institution is a charity, for the purposes of a provision of an Act or instrument.

             (4)  The fact that, because of this section, a purpose of an institution is for the public benefit does not affect the question whether that purpose is a charitable purpose.
