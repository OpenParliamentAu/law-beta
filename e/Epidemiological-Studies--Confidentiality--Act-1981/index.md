                             (ii)  a physical or mental state; or

                            (iii)  a condition, circumstance, occurrence, activity, form of behaviour, course of conduct, or state of affairs, that is or may be disadvantageous to, or result in a disadvantage to, the person concerned or to the community; or

             (2)  A reference in this Act to a person who has assisted, or is assisting, in the conduct of an epidemiological study includes a reference to a person who has conducted, or is conducting, or has supervised or is supervising the conduct of, the study but does not include a reference to a person who has assisted, or is assisting, in the conduct of the study by reason only that he or she was or is one of the persons to whom the study related or relates or has provided, or is providing, information about one of the persons (whether himself, herself or another person) to whom the study related or relates.

             (3)  A reference in this Act to information concerning the affairs of a person shall be read as including:
