## SCH
<sch>                                  THE  SCHEDULE<lf>         CONSTITUTION  OF  THE  UNITED  NATIONS  EDUCATIONAL,  SCIENTIFIC<lf>                           AND  CULTURAL  ORGANIZATION<lf>        THE  GOVERNMENTS  OF  THE  STATES  PARTIES  TO  THIS  CONSTITUTION<lf>                     ON  BEHALF  OF  THEIR  PEOPLES  DECLARE,<lf>   that since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the<lf> defences of peace must be constructed;<lf>   that ignorance of each other's ways and lives has been a common cause,<lf> throughout the history of mankind, of that suspicion and mistrust between the<lf> peoples of the world through which their differences have all too often broken<lf> into war;<lf>   that the great and terrible war which has now ended was a war made possible by <lf> the denial of the democratic principles of the dignity, equality and mutual<lf> respect of men, and by the propagation, in their place, through ignorance and<lf> prejudice, of the doctrine of the inequality of men and races;<lf>   that the wide diffusion of culture, and the education of humanity for justice<lf> and liberty and peace are indispensable to the dignity of man and constitute a<lf> sacred duty which all the nations must fulfil in a spirit of mutual assistance<lf> and concern;<lf>   that a peace based exclusively upon the political and economic arrangements of <lf> governments would not be a peace which could secure the unanimous, lasting and<lf> sincere support of the peoples of the world, and that the peace must therefore<lf> be founded, if it is not to fail, upon the intellectual and moral solidarity of<lf> mankind.<lf> 

                              FOR  THESE  REASONS,<lf>   the States parties to this Constitution, believing in full and equal<lf> opportunities for education for all, in the unrestricted pursuit of objective<lf> truth, and in the free exchange of ideas and knowledge, are agreed and<lf> determined to develop and to increase the means of communication between their<lf> peoples and to employ these means for the purposes of mutual understanding and a <lf> truer and more perfect knowledge of each other's lives;<lf>                             IN  CONSEQUENCE  WHEREOF<lf>   they do hereby create the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural<lf> Organization for the purpose of advancing, through the educational and<lf> scientific and cultural relations of the peoples of the world, the objectives of <lf> international peace and of the common welfare of mankind for which the United<lf> Nations Organization was established and which its Charter proclaims.<lf> <p>                                   ARTICLE  I<lf>                              Purposes and Functions<lf>   1\. The purpose of the Organization is to contribute to peace and security by<lf> promoting collaboration among the nations through education, science and culture <lf> in order to further universal respect for justice, for the rule of law and for<lf> the human rights and fundamental freedoms which are affirmed for the peoples of<lf> the world, without distinction of race, sex, language or religion, by the<lf> Charter of the United Nations.<lf> <p>  2\. To realize this purpose the Organization will:<lf>   (a)  collaborate in the work of advancing the mutual knowledge and<lf> understanding of peoples, through all means of mass communication and to that<lf> end recommend such international agreements as may be necessary to promote the<lf> free flow of ideas by word and image;<lf>   (b)  give fresh impulse to popular education and to the spread of culture;<lf> by collaborating with Members, at their request, in the development of<lf> educational activities;<lf> by instituting collaboration among the nations to advance the ideal of equality<lf> of educational opportunity without regard to race, sex or any distinctions,<lf> economic or social;<lf> by suggesting educational methods best suited to prepare the children of the<lf> world for the responsibilities of freedom;<lf>   (c)  maintain, increase and diffuse knowledge;<lf> by assuring the conservation and protection of the world's inheritance of books, <lf> works of art and monuments of history and science, and recommending to the<lf> nations concerned the necessary international conventions;<lf> by encouraging cooperation among the nations in all branches of intellectual<lf> activity, including the international exchange of persons active in the fields<lf> of education, science and culture and the exchange of publications, objects of<lf> artistic and scientific interest and other materials of information;<lf> by initiating methods of international cooperation calculated to give the people <lf> of all countries access to the printed and published materials produced by any<lf> of them.<lf> <p>  3\.

The General Conference shall have power to adopt by a two-thirds majority<lf> rules of procedure for carrying out the provisions of this Article.<lf> <p>                                  ARTICLE  XIV<lf>                                  Interpretation<lf>   1\. The English and French texts of this Constitution shall be regarded as<lf> equally authoritative.<lf> <p>  2\. Any question or dispute concerning the interpretation of this Constitution<lf> shall be referred for determination to the International Court of Justice or to<lf> an arbitral tribunal, as the General Conference may determine under its rules of <lf> procedure.<lf> <p>                                  ARTICLE  XV<lf>                                 Entry into Force<lf>   1\.
