##### <a id="5LA"></a>5LA  _Principal home_ definition for the purpose of the assets test

Principal home

             (1)  A reference in this Act to the **_principal home_** of a person includes a reference to:

                     (a)  if the principal home is a dwelling-house—the land adjacent to the dwelling-house to the extent that:

                              (i)  the land is held on the same title document as the land on which the dwelling-house is located; and

                             (ii)  the private land use test in subsection (3) is satisfied in relation to the land or, if the person is one to whom the extended land use test applies in relation to the land, the extended land use test in subsection (6) is satisfied in relation to the land; or

                     (b)  if the principal home is a flat or home unit—a garage or storeroom that is used primarily for private or domestic purposes in association with the flat or home unit.

             (2)  The Commission may determine that land is to be treated, for the purpose of subparagraph (1)(a)(i), as if it were held on the same title document as other land if any of the following apply:

                     (a)  the dwelling-house is located on both blocks of land;

                     (b)  the dwelling-house is located on one of the blocks of land but that block and the other block, taken together, are a place, or are part of a place, that is protected under a law of the Commonwealth, or of a State or Territory, because of its natural, historic or indigenous heritage;

                     (c)  the alienation of one of the blocks of land without the other would seriously undermine the function of the house as a dwelling.

Note:          A mere loss of amenity, such as the loss of a swimming pool, garden, tennis court or view, would not seriously undermine the function of a house as a dwelling.

Private land use test

             (3)  The **_private land use test_** is satisfied in relation to land if:

                     (a)  the area of land, together with the area of the ground floor of the dwelling-house, is not more than 2 hectares; and

                     (b)  the land is used primarily for private or domestic purposes in association with the dwelling-house.

To whom does the extended land use test apply?

             (4)  The extended land use test applies to a person in relation to land adjacent to the dwelling-house if:

                     (a)  the person has reached the qualifying age; and

                     (b)  the person is eligible to receive a service pension or income support supplement and that pension or supplement is payable to the person; and

                     (c)  the dwelling-house has been the person’s principal home for 20 years or more continuously.

Note:          For **_qualifying age_** see section 5Q.

             (5)  Where a person (the **_first person_**) to whom the extended land use test applies in relation to land adjacent to the dwelling-house in which the person lives is a member of a couple:

                     (a)  the extended land use test applies to the first person’s partner (the **_second person_**); and

                     (b)  the extended land use test continues to apply to the second person if the first person and the second person cease to be members of a couple for any reason, provided the dwelling-house continues to be the second person’s principal home.

Extended land use test

             (6)  The **_extended land use test_** is satisfied in relation to land if:

                     (a)  the area of the land, together with the area of the ground floor of the dwelling-house, is more than 2 hectares; and

                     (b)  the Commission determines that, given the circumstances of the person to whom the test is applied in relation to the land, the person is making effective use of the land.

             (7)  In determining whether a person is making effective use of the land, the Commission is to take into account the following matters:

                     (a)  where the land is located;

                     (b)  the size of the block of land;

                     (c)  the person’s family situation;

                     (d)  the person’s health;

                     (e)  whether the land contains a dwelling-house occupied by a family member of the person, or a child of a family member of the person, receiving an income support payment (within the meaning of the _Social Security Act 1991_);

                      (f)  whether the land is being used to support:

                              (i)  a family member of the person; or

                             (ii)  a child of a family member of the person;

                     (g)  any current commercial use of the land;

                     (h)  any potential commercial use of the land;

                      (i)  whether the person’s capacity to make commercial use of the land is diminished because the person, or the person’s partner, has responsibility for the care of another person;

                      (j)  whether the block of land is an amalgamation of 2 or more blocks and, if so:

                              (i)  when the amalgamation occurred; and

                             (ii)  whether the amalgamation reduced the potential for the land to produce personal income or to support the person;

                     (k)  environmental issues relating to the land;

                      (l)  any other matter that the Commission considers relevant.

                              (i)  the person is accruing a liability to pay an accommodation charge (or would be accruing such a liability, assuming that no sanctions under Part 4.4 of the _Aged Care Act 1997_ were currently being imposed on the provider of the care concerned); and

                             (ii)  the person, or the person’s partner, is earning, deriving or receiving rent for the residence from another person; and

Compensation

             (2)  For the purposes of Part IIIC, **_compensation_** means:

                     (a)  a payment of damages or compensation; or

                     (b)  a payment under a scheme of insurance or compensation under a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory, or under a contract entered into under such a scheme; or

                     (c)  a payment (with or without admission of liability) in settlement of a claim for damages or of a claim under such an insurance scheme;

made wholly or partly in respect of lost earnings or lost capacity to earn. The payment may be in the form of a lump sum (or part of a lump sum) or in the form of periodic payments and may be made either within or outside Australia, but it does not include any payment that, under subsection (3), (4), (5), (6) or (6A), is excluded from the application of this subsection.

Note:          Under section 59O, a person may be treated as having received compensation that the person would have received but for the effect of a State or Territory law.

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not apply to a periodic payment or a lump sum payment referred to in paragraph 26(1)(b) or (2)(b) or subsection 30(3).

             (4)  Subsection (2) does not apply to a compensation payment if:

                     (a)  the recipient has made contributions (for example, by way of insurance premiums) towards the payment; and

                     (b)  either:

                              (i)  the agreement under which the contributions are made does not provide for the amounts that would otherwise be payable under the agreement being reduced or not payable because the recipient is eligible for or receives the compensation affected pension under this Act; or

                             (ii)  the agreement does so provide but the compensation payment has been calculated without reference to the provision.

             (5)  Subsection (2) does not apply to any payment of compensation made to a person that was taken into account under Division 5A of Part II to reduce the amount, or stop the payment, of a pension that, apart from that Division, would have been payable to the person under that Part.

             (6)  Subsection (2) does not apply to any payment of compensation made to a person that was taken into account under Division 4 of Part IV to reduce the amount, or stop the payment, of a pension that, apart from that Division, would have been payable to the person under that Part.

          (6A)  A payment under a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory that provides for the payment of compensation for a criminal injury does not constitute **_compensation_** for the purposes of this Act.

          (6B)  The reference in subsection (6A) to a **_criminal injury_** is a reference to a personal injury suffered, or a disease or condition contracted, as a result of the commission of an offence.

Compensation part of a lump sum

             (7)  Subject to subsection (8), for the purposes of Part IIIC, the **_compensation part of a lump sum compensation payment_** is:

                     (a)  50% of the payment if the following circumstances apply:

                              (i)  the payment is made (either with or without admission of liability) in settlement of a claim that is, in whole or in part, related to a disease, injury or condition; and

                             (ii)  the claim was settled, either by consent judgment being entered in respect of the settlement or otherwise; or

                     (b)  50% of the payment if the following circumstances apply:

                              (i)  the payment represents that part of a person’s entitlement to periodic compensation payments that the person has chosen to receive in the form of a lump sum; and

                             (ii)  the entitlement to periodic compensation payments arose from the settlement (either with or without admission of liability) of a claim that is, in whole or in part, related to a disease, injury or condition; and

                            (iii)  the claim was settled, either by consent judgment being entered in respect of the settlement or otherwise; or

                     (c)  if paragraphs (a) and (b) do not apply—so much of the payment as is, in the Commission’s opinion, in respect of lost earnings or lost capacity to earn, or both.

             (8)  If a person:

                     (a)  has received periodic compensation payments in respect of lost earnings or lost capacity to earn; and

                     (b)  after receiving those payments, receives a lump sum compensation payment in respect of the lost earnings or lost capacity to earn (the **_LSP_**); and

                     (c)  because of receiving the LSP, becomes liable to repay an amount (the **_Repaid Periodic Compensation Payment_**—**_RPCP_**) equal to the periodic compensation payments received;

then, for the purposes of subsection (7), the amount of the lump sum compensation payment is:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00064/Html/VetsEntitlmnts1986Vol01_WD02_image005.gif)

             (9)  For the purposes of Part IIIC, a payment of arrears of periodic compensation payments is not a lump sum compensation payment.

Note:          For the treatment of a payment of arrears of periodic compensation payments where, at the time of the event that gave rise to the compensation payments, the person was receiving a payment under this Act that is covered by Part IIIC, see point SCH6-E4.

Receives compensation

           (10)  A person **_receives compensation_** whether he or she receives it directly or whether another person receives it, on behalf of, or at the direction of the first person.

Event giving rise to entitlement

           (11)  For the purposes of Part IIIC, the **_event that gives rise to a person’s entitlement to compensation_** for a disease, injury or condition is:

                     (a)  if the disease, injury or condition was caused by an accident—the accident; or

                     (b)  in any other case—the disease, injury or condition first becoming apparent;

and is not, for example, the decision or settlement under which the compensation is payable.

Insurer

           (12)  A reference in Part IIIC to an **_insurer who is, under a contract of insurance, liable to indemnify_** a compensation payer or a potential compensation payer against a liability arising from a claim for compensation includes a reference to:

                     (a)  an authority of a State or Territory that is liable to indemnify a compensation payer against such a liability, whether the authority is so liable under a contract, a law or otherwise; or

                     (b)  an authority of a State or Territory that determines to make a payment to indemnify a compensation payer against such a liability, whether or not the authority is liable to do so.

                     (b)  the person has a transferable legal right or a transferable licence to occupy the farm for a particular purpose of the farm enterprise; or

                     (c)  as the mortgagor of a legal estate or interest in the farm (being an estate or interest that is not registered under a relevant State land law), the person has an equitable estate or interest in the farm; or

                     (d)  the person is a shareholder in a proprietary company that has a legal estate or interest in the farm; or

                     (e)  the value of the person’s assets includes an amount calculated (in accordance with section 52ZZR) by reference to the value of the farm.

Note:          The eligible interest in a sugarcane farm that is relevant for the operation of Division 8A of Part IIIB is the interest held by a person immediately before that interest is transferred to an eligible descendant. So, for example, to find out whether an interest is covered by paragraph (e), the provisions of Division 11A of Part IIIB must be applied in relation to the person’s circumstances as they were immediately before the transfer.

             (6)  A person has an **_eligible interest_** in a relevant sugarcane farm asset if:

                     (a)  the person has a legal interest in the relevant farm asset; or

                     (c)  the value of the person’s assets includes an amount calculated (in accordance with section 52ZZR) by reference to the value of the relevant farm asset.

Note:          The eligible interest in a relevant sugarcane farm asset that is relevant for the operation of Division 8A of Part IIIB is the interest held by a person immediately before that interest is transferred to an eligible descendant. So, for example, to find out whether an interest is covered by paragraph (c), the provisions of Division 11A of Part IIIB must be applied in relation to the person’s circumstances as they were immediately before the transfer.

             (7)  Subject to subsections (8), (10), (11) and (12), an eligible interest that a person has in a sugarcane farm is **_transferred_** to another person if, and only if, the eligible interest:

                     (a)  ceases to be vested in the person; and

                     (b)  becomes vested in the other person.

             (8)  To avoid any doubt, it is stated that if a person who transfers a legal estate or interest in a sugarcane farm to another person is, under a relevant State land law, registered as being the proprietor (whether that word or any other word is used) of that estate or interest, the legal estate or interest in the farm is taken not to have become vested in the other person unless and until the transfer is registered in accordance with that law.

Note:          For **_relevant State land law_** see subsection 5P(1).

             (9)  Subject to subsections (11) and (12), an eligible interest that a person has in a relevant sugarcane farm asset is **_transferred_** to another person if, and only if, the eligible interest:

                     (a)  ceases to be vested in the person; and

                     (b)  becomes vested in the other person.

           (10)  If, as the mortgagor of a legal estate or interest in a sugarcane farm (see paragraph (5)(c)), a person has an eligible interest in the farm, the person is taken to have **_transferred_** that eligible interest in the farm to another person only if the person:

                     (a)  has, under a relevant State land law, become registered as the proprietor (whether that word or any other word is used) of the legal estate or interest in the farm; and

                     (b)  has then transferred that legal estate or interest to the other person.

           (11)  If a person has an eligible interest in a sugarcane farm or a relevant sugarcane farm asset because (see paragraphs (5)(d) and (6)(b)) the person is a shareholder in a proprietary company that has a legal estate or interest in the farm, or a legal interest in the relevant farm asset (as the case may be), the person is taken to have **_transferred_** to another person his or her eligible interest in the farm or relevant farm asset only if the person:

                     (a)  has acquired the company’s legal estate or interest in the farm or the company’s legal interest in the relevant farm asset; and

                     (b)  has then transferred it to the other person.

           (12)  An eligible interest that a person (the **_first person_**) has in a sugarcane farm or a relevant sugarcane farm asset because (see paragraphs (5)(e) and (6)(c)) the value of the first person’s assets includes an amount calculated (in accordance with section 52ZZR) by reference to the value of the farm or relevant farm asset is **_transferred_** to another person if:

                     (a)  the first person is divested of that eligible interest; and

                     (b)  as a result, the other person gains an eligible interest in the farm or relevant farm asset of a value that is referrable to the full value of the eligible interest divested.

           (13)  To avoid doubt, if:

                     (a)  a person is able to transfer an eligible interest under either subsection (11) or (12); and

                     (b)  the person transfers that interest under subsection (12);

the person is not required to meet the requirements of subsection (11) in relation to the transfer.

                     (d)  in the case of an injury—it resulted from an accident that would not have occurred:

                              (i)  but for the rendering of that service by the person; or

Definition of **relates to service**for aggravations and material contributions

          (1C)  For the purposes of this Act, an aggravation of, or a material contribution to, an injury or disease **_relates to service_** rendered by a person if:

                     (a)  it resulted from an occurrence that happened while the person was rendering that service; or

                     (b)  it arose out of, or was attributable to, that service; or

                     (c)  it resulted from an accident that occurred while the person was travelling, while rendering that service but otherwise than in the course of duty, on a journey:

                              (i)  to a place for the purpose of performing duty; or

                             (ii)  away from a place of duty upon having ceased to perform duty; or

                     (d)  in the case of an aggravation of, or a material contribution to, an injury—it resulted from an accident that would not have occurred:

                              (i)  but for the rendering of that service by the person; or

                             (ii)  but for changes in the person’s environment consequent upon his or her having rendered that service; or

                     (e)  in the case of an aggravation of, or a material contribution to, a disease—it would not have occurred:

                              (i)  but for the rendering of that service by the person; or

                             (ii)  but for changes in the person’s environment consequent upon his or her having rendered that service.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  a person’s usual place of residence is in the remote area; and

                     (b)  the person is absent from the remote area for a period;

the person is to be taken to be **_physically present in the remote area_** during:

                     (c)  if the period does not exceed 8 weeks—the whole of that period; or

                     (d)  if the period exceeds 8 weeks—the first 8 weeks of that period.

Note:          the rule set out in subsection (2) may be modified by a determination under subsection 5R(11) or 5R(12).

             (3)  In determining whether a person has left Australia temporarily or otherwise, regard is to be had to the following:

                     (a)  the purpose for which the person left Australia;

                     (b)  the intended duration of the person’s absence from Australia;

                     (c)  the frequency of the occasions on which the person has left Australia.

             (4)  In determining whether a person is absent from Australia temporarily or otherwise, regard is to be had to the following:

                     (a)  the purpose of the absence;

                     (b)  the intended duration of the absence;

                     (c)  the frequency of such absences.

             (5)  For the purposes of this Act, if under a provision of this Act one person is the child of another person because the person is a child of the other person within the meaning of the _Family Law Act 1975_, relationships traced to or through the person are to be determined on the basis that the person is the child of the other person.

Note:          Paragraph 10(1)(b) and paragraph (b) of the definition of **_child_** in section 52ZO are examples of provisions under which one person may be the child of another person because the person is a child of the other person within the meaning of the _Family Law Act 1975_.

             (6)  Subsection (5) does not apply for the purposes of determining when a person and his or her partner are within a prohibited relationship under subsection 5E(6). However, this does not prevent expressions used in subsection 5E(6) from having their ordinary meaning.

##### <a id="5R"></a>5R  Determinations having interpretative effect

Continuous full-time service determination; member of unit of Defence Force determination

             (1)  The Minister may, by notice in writing published in the _Gazette_, make, in respect of a person, or of persons included in a class of persons, specified in the notice, all or any of the following determinations:

                     (a)  a determination that this Act, or specified provisions of this Act, are to apply to and in relation to the person, or a person included in that class of persons, as if he or she was, while he or she was rendering service of a kind specified in the notice (in this subsection referred to as **_relevant service_**), a member of the Defence Force who was rendering continuous full-time service;

                     (b)  a determination that this Act, or specified provisions of this Act, are to apply to and in relation to the person (being a member of the Defence Force), or a person included in that class of persons (being members of the Defence Force), as if he or she was, while he or she was rendering relevant service, rendering continuous full-time service;

                     (c)  a determination that this Act, or specified provisions of this Act, are to apply to and in relation to the person, or a person included in that class of persons, as if he or she was, while he or she was rendering relevant service, a member of a specified unit of the Defence Force;

and, if the Minister does so, this Act applies, or the specified provisions of this Act apply, as the case may be, accordingly.

Note:          for **_continuous full-time service_** and **_member of a unit of the Defence Force_** see subsection 5C(1).

Allied veteran determination

             (2)  If a person who is a claimant for an age service pension or an invalidity service pension satisfies the Commission:

                     (a)  that the person had been appointed or enlisted as a member of the forces or services of:

                              (i)  an allied country, being forces or services of a kind referred to in the definition of **_defence force established by an allied country_**; or

                             (ii)  the government-in-exile of an allied country, being forces or services of a kind referred to in subsection 5C(3); and

                     (b)  that those forces or services were raised and operated in such a manner that the members of those forces and services:

                              (i)  were formally appointed to, or enlisted in, those forces or services; and

                             (ii)  were subject to the rules and conventions of warfare; and

                     (c)  that the person was not required, as such a member, to wear a uniform or insignia distinguishing the person as a member of those forces or services or to carry arms at all or to carry arms openly; and

                     (d)  that it would have been unreasonable, having regard to the conditions existing, at the time the person served in those forces or services, in the parts of that country in which the person so could serve, for the person to have been required to wear a uniform or insignia or to carry arms or to carry arms openly;

the Commission must determine that the person is, for the purposes of the definition of **_allied veteran_** in subsection 5C(1) to be treated as a person who has been appointed or enlisted as a member of the defence force established by that allied country or that government-in-exile.

Person may be treated as not being a member of a couple

             (3)  The Commission may determine, for any special reason, that a person who is a member of a couple is not to be treated as a member of a couple for the purposes of this Act.

Note:          for **_member of a couple_** see subsection 5E(2).

             (4)  The determination must be in writing.

Illness separated couple determination

             (5)  If the Commission is satisfied that:

                     (a)  2 people are members of a couple; and

                     (b)  they are unable to live together in their home as a result of the illness or infirmity of either or both of them; and

                     (c)  because of that inability to live together, their living expenses are, or likely to be greater than they would otherwise be; and

                     (d)  that inability is likely to continue indefinitely;

the Commission may make a written determination that the 2 people are members of an **_illness separated couple_** for the purposes of this Act.

Respite care couple determination

             (6)  If the Commission is satisfied that:

                     (a)  2 people are members of a couple; and

                     (b)  one of the members of the couple is in respite care; and

                     (c)  the member who is in respite care has remained, or is likely to remain, in that care for at least 14 consecutive days;

the Commission may make a written determination that the 2 people are members of a **_respite care couple_** for the purposes of this Act.

Note:          For **_in respite care_**, see subsection 5NC(8).

             (7)  A determination under subsection (6) takes effect from the day specified by the Commission in the determination, being a day not earlier than 3 months before the Commission is notified that the person is in respite care.

Remote area determination—current or future absence from remote area

           (11)  If the Commission is satisfied that:

                     (a)  a person’s age or invalidity service pension or income support supplement includes an amount of remote area allowance; and

                     (b)  the person’s remote area allowance includes an amount for an FTB child or a regular care child; and

                     (d)  the absence is, or is likely to be, longer than 8 weeks; and

                     (e)  the absence is due to special circumstances (for example, the person’s medical treatment or the person’s attendance at a rehabilitation or training course);

the Commission may make a written determination that, despite that absence, the person’s rate of pension or income support supplement continues to include remote area allowance for the period specified in the determination while the person has an FTB child, or a regular care child, (as the case requires).

Note 1:       For an **_FTB child_** and a **_regular care child_** see subsection 5F(1).

Note 2:       a person whose absence from a remote area is longer than 8 weeks would not normally continue to be entitled to remote area allowance (see subsection 5Q(2)).

Remote area determination—past absence from remote area

           (12)  If the Commission is satisfied that, in relation to a period:

                     (a)  a person is receiving an age or invalidity service pension or income support supplement; and

                     (b)  the person’s usual place of residence is in a remote area; and

                     (c)  because the person is absent from the remote area for longer than 8 weeks, the person’s rate of service pension or income support supplement ceases to include an amount by way of remote area allowance; and

                     (d)  immediately before the person’s rate ceases to include remote area allowance, the remote area allowance includes an amount for an FTB child or a regular care child;

the Commission may make a written determination that, despite that absence, the person’s rate of pension or income support supplement continues to include remote area allowance for the period specified in the determination while the person has an FTB child, or a regular care child, (as the case requires).

Note 1:       For an **_FTB child_** and a **_regular care child_** see subsection 5F(1).

Note 2:       a person whose absence from a remote area is longer than 8 weeks would not normally continue to be entitled to remote area allowance (see subsection 5Q(2)).

           (13)  The period specified by the Commission in a determination under subsection (12) must not commence earlier than 3 months before the Commission is notified that the person is absent from the remote area.

Sale leaseback agreement determination

           (14)  The Commission may determine that an agreement is a sale leaseback agreement if the Commission is satisfied that the agreement is substantially similar in its effect to an agreement referred to in subsection 5MB(2).

           (15)  The determination must be in writing.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  War-caused death

             (1)  Subject to this section and section 9A, for the purposes of this Act, the death of a veteran shall be taken to have been war-caused if:

                     (a)  the death of the veteran resulted from an occurrence that happened while the veteran was rendering operational service;

                     (b)  the death of the veteran arose out of, or was attributable to, any eligible war service rendered by the veteran;

                     (c)  the death of the veteran resulted from an accident that occurred while the veteran was travelling, while rendering eligible war service but otherwise than in the course of duty, on a journey to a place for the purpose of performing duty or away from a place of duty upon having ceased to perform duty;

                     (d)  in the opinion of the Commission, the death of the veteran was due to an accident that would not have occurred, or to a disease that would not have been contracted, but for his or her having rendered eligible war service or but for changes in the veteran’s environment consequent upon his or her having rendered eligible war service; or

                     (e)  the injury or disease from which the veteran died:

                              (i)  was suffered or contracted while the veteran was rendering eligible war service, but did not arise out of that service; or

                             (ii)  was suffered or contracted before the commencement of the period, or last period, of eligible war service rendered by the veteran, but not while the veteran was rendering eligible war service;

                            and, in the opinion of the Commission, the injury or disease was contributed to in a material degree by, or was aggravated by, any eligible war service rendered by the veteran, being service rendered after the veteran suffered that injury or contracted that disease; or

                      (f)  the injury or disease from which the veteran died is an injury or disease that has been determined in accordance with section 9 to have been a war-caused injury or a war-caused disease, as the case may be;

Note:       The effect of paragraph (f) is that, if the veteran has died from an injury or disease that has already been determined by the Commission to be war-caused, the death is to be taken to have been war-caused. Accordingly the Commission is not required to relate the death to eligible war service rendered by the veteran and sections 120A and 120B do not apply.

but not otherwise.

             (2)  Paragraph (1)(a), (b), (c) or (d) does not apply to the death of a veteran if the death:

                     (a)  resulted from the veteran’s serious default or wilful act; or

                     (b)  arose from:

                              (i)  a serious breach of discipline committed by the veteran; or

                             (ii)  an occurrence that happened while the veteran was committing a serious breach of discipline.

             (3)  Subsection (1) does not apply to the death of a veteran if the death of the veteran resulted from the serious default or wilful act of the veteran that happened after the veteran ceased, or last ceased, to render eligible war service.

             (4)  Paragraph (1)(c) does not apply:

                     (a)  to an accident that occurred while the veteran was travelling on a journey from the veteran’s place of duty in a case where the veteran had delayed commencing the journey for a substantial time after he or she ceased to perform duty at that place (otherwise than for a reason connected with the performance of the veteran’s duties) unless, in the circumstances of the particular case, the nature of the risk of sustaining an injury, or contracting a disease, was not substantially changed, and the extent of that risk was not substantially increased, by that delay or by anything that happened during that delay;

                     (b)  to an accident that occurred while the veteran was travelling on a journey, or a part of a journey, by a route that was not reasonably direct having regard to the means of transport used unless:

                              (i)  the journey, or that part of the journey, was made by that route for a reason connected with the performance of the veteran’s duties; or

                             (ii)  in the circumstances of the particular case, the nature of the risk of sustaining an injury, or contracting a disease, was not substantially changed, and the extent of that risk was not substantially increased, by reason that the journey, or that part of the journey, was made by that route; or

                     (c)  to an accident that occurred while the veteran was travelling on a part of a journey made after a substantial interruption of the journey, being an interruption made for a reason unconnected with the performance of the veteran’s duties, unless, in the circumstances of the particular case, the nature of the risk referred to in subparagraph (b)(ii) was not substantially changed, and the extent of that risk was not substantially increased, by reason of that interruption.

             (5)  Paragraph (1)(e) does not apply to the death of a veteran from an injury or disease, being injury or disease that has been contributed to in a material degree by, or aggravated by, eligible war service rendered by the veteran, unless the veteran has rendered operational service or the period of the eligible war service rendered by the veteran that so contributed to the injury or disease, or by which the injury or disease was aggravated, was 6 months or longer.

             (6)  Despite subsection (1), the death of a veteran is taken not to have been war-caused if the veteran’s death is related to the veteran’s eligible war service only because:

                     (a)  in the case of a veteran who had not used tobacco products before 1 January 1998—the veteran used tobacco products after 31 December 1997; or

                     (b)  in the case of a veteran who had used tobacco products before 1 January 1998—the veteran increased his or her use of tobacco products after 31 December 1997.

##### <a id="9"></a>9  War-caused injuries or diseases

                     (c)  the injury suffered, or disease contracted, by the veteran resulted from an accident that occurred while the veteran was travelling, while rendering eligible war service but otherwise than in the course of duty, on a journey to a place for the purpose of performing duty or away from a place of duty upon having ceased to perform duty;

                     (d)  the injury suffered, or disease contracted, by the veteran is to be deemed by subsection (2) to be a war-caused injury or a war-caused disease;

                     (e)  the injury suffered, or disease contracted, by the veteran:

                              (i)  was suffered or contracted while the veteran was rendering eligible war service, but did not arise out of that service; or

                             (ii)  was suffered or contracted before the commencement of the period, or last period, of eligible war service rendered by the veteran, but not while the veteran was rendering eligible war service;

                            and, in the opinion of the Commission, the injury or disease was contributed to in a material degree by, or was aggravated by, any eligible war service rendered by the veteran, being service rendered after the veteran suffered that injury or contracted that disease;

but not otherwise.

             (2)  For the purposes of this Act, where any incapacity of a veteran was, in the opinion of the Commission, due to an accident that would not have occurred, or due to a disease that would not have been contracted, but for his or her having rendered eligible war service or but for changes in the veteran’s environment consequent upon his or her having rendered eligible war service:

                     (a)  if that incapacity was due to an accident—that incapacity shall be deemed to have arisen out of the injury suffered by the veteran as a result of the accident and the injury so suffered shall be deemed to be a war-caused injury suffered by the veteran; or

                     (b)  if the incapacity was due to a disease—the incapacity shall be deemed to have arisen out of that disease and that disease shall be deemed to be a war-caused disease contracted by the veteran.

             (3)  Paragraph (1)(a), (b), (c) or (d) does not apply to an injury suffered, or disease contracted, by a veteran if the injury or disease:

                     (a)  resulted from the veteran’s serious default or wilful act; or

                     (b)  arose from:

                              (i)  a serious breach of discipline committed by the veteran; or

                             (ii)  an occurrence that happened while the veteran was committing a serious breach of discipline.

             (4)  Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply to an injury suffered, or disease contracted, by a veteran if the incapacity of the veteran from that injury or disease resulted from the serious default or wilful act of the veteran that happened after the veteran ceased, or last ceased, to render eligible war service.

             (5)  Paragraph (1)(c) does not apply:

                     (a)  to an accident that occurred while the veteran was travelling on a journey from the veteran’s place of work in a case where the veteran had delayed commencing the journey for a substantial period after he or she ceased to perform duty at that place (otherwise than for a reason connected with the performance of the veteran’s duties) unless, in the circumstances of the particular case, the nature of the risk of sustaining an injury, or contracting a disease, was not substantially changed, and the extent of that risk was not substantially increased, by that delay or by anything that happened during that delay;

                     (b)  to an accident that occurred while the veteran was travelling on a journey, or a part of a journey, by a route that was not reasonably direct having regard to the means of transport used, unless:

             (6)  Paragraph (1)(e) does not apply to an injury suffered, or disease contracted, by a veteran (being an injury or disease that has been contributed to in a material degree by, or aggravated by, eligible war service rendered by the veteran):

                     (a)  if the aggravation of the injury or disease:

                              (i)  resulted from the veteran’s serious default or wilful act;

                     (b)  in the case of a veteran who had used tobacco products before 1 January 1998—the veteran increased his or her use of tobacco products after 31 December 1997.

##### <a id="9A"></a>9A  Most war-caused injuries, diseases and deaths no longer covered by this Act

             (1)  A veteran’s injury, disease or death is taken not to be war-caused if:

                     (a)  the injury is sustained, the disease is contracted, or the death occurs, on or after the MRCA commencement date; and

                     (b)  the injury, disease or death either:

                              (i)  relates to service rendered by the person on or after that date; or

                             (ii)  relates to service rendered by the person before, and on or after, that date.

Note 1:       some dependants do not have to make a claim (see section 13A).

Note 2:       if it is uncertain whether a person is a dependant and as a result a pension is not payable to the person under section 13A, the person may make a claim for the pension under section 14\. The Commission will determine whether the person is entitled to be granted a pension (see subsection 19(3)).

             (2)  Where a determination under this Act is in force determining that any incapacity from which a veteran is suffering resulted from war-caused injury or war-caused disease, or both, but a pension was not granted to the veteran on the ground that the extent of the incapacity was insufficient to justify the grant of a pension, subsection (1) does not apply to a claim for a pension in respect of that incapacity.

             (3)  A claim for a pension:

                     (a)  shall be in writing and in accordance with a form approved by the Commission;

                     (b)  shall be accompanied by such evidence available to the claimant as the claimant considers may be relevant to the claim; and

             (2)  Where there is in force in respect of the incapacity of a veteran a determination of a kind referred to in subsection 14(2) but a pension has not been granted to the veteran on the ground that the extent of the incapacity is insufficient to justify the grant of a pension under this Part, the veteran may make application, in accordance with subsection (3) of this section, for a pension on the ground that the incapacity of the veteran has increased since the grant of a pension in respect of the incapacity was refused or last refused.

                     (b)  a decision that has been made in respect of the application was subject to some form of appeal or review, but the period within which such an appeal or review could be instituted has ended without an appeal or review having been instituted.

             (3)  The Commission may determine that the degree of incapacity of a veteran from war-caused injury or war-caused disease, or both, is less than 10% (including 0%), and, where it does so, it shall not assess a rate of pension, but shall refuse to grant a pension to the veteran on the ground that the extent of the incapacity of the veteran from that war-caused injury or war-caused disease, or both, is insufficient to justify the grant of a pension.

##### <a id="22"></a>22  General rate of pension and extreme disablement adjustment

             (1)  This section applies to a veteran who is being paid, or is eligible to be paid, a pension under this Part, other than a veteran to whom section 23, 24 or 25 applies.

             (2)  Subject to this Division, the rate at which pension is payable to a veteran to whom this section applies in respect of the incapacity of the veteran from war-caused injury or war-caused disease, or both, is the rate per fortnight that constitutes the same percentage of the general rate as the percentage determined by the Commission in accordance with section 21A to be the degree of incapacity of the veteran from that war-caused injury or war-caused disease, or both, as the case may be.

             (3)  For the purposes of this section, the maximum rate per fortnight is $338.94 per fortnight.

                     (b)  the veteran’s incapacity from war-caused injury or war-caused disease, or both, is, of itself alone, of such a nature as to render the veteran incapable of undertaking remunerative work otherwise than on a part-time basis or intermittently; and

                     (c)  the veteran is, by reason of incapacity from war-caused injury or war-caused disease, or both, alone, prevented from continuing to undertake remunerative work that the veteran was undertaking and is, by reason thereof, suffering a loss of salary or wages, or of earnings on his or her own account, that the veteran would not be suffering if the veteran were free from that incapacity; and

                     (e)  because the veteran is so prevented from undertaking his or her last paid work, the veteran is suffering a loss of salary or wages, or of earnings on his or her own account, that he or she would not be suffering if he or she were free from that incapacity; and

                      (f)  the veteran was undertaking his or her last paid work after the veteran had turned 65; and

                     (g)  when the veteran stopped undertaking his or her last paid work, the veteran:

             (1)  Subject to subsections (1A) and (2), if the Commonwealth is or becomes liable to pay a pension to a veteran at the rate applicable under section 23 or 24, that rate continues, while a pension continues to be payable to the veteran, to apply to the veteran unless:

                     (b)  if the veteran were so incapacitated permanently, the veteran would be a veteran to whom section 24 applies;

the Commission shall determine the period during which, in its opinion, that incapacity is likely to continue and this section applies to the veteran in respect of that period.

             (2)  Where this section applies to a veteran in respect of a period, the rate at which pension is payable to the veteran in respect of that period is the rate applicable under subsection 24(4), (5) or (6).

             (1)  This section applies to a veteran:

                     (a)  to whom section 23, 24 or 25 applies; or

                     (b)  who is granted a temporary incapacity allowance under section 107 or a loss of earnings allowance under section 108;

for a war-caused injury or a war-caused disease if the veteran has received an amount of compensation, whether before or after the commencement of this section, under section 24, 25 or 27 of the _Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988_ for some other injury or disease.

             (2)  That amount of compensation is to be converted to a fortnightly amount in accordance with advice from the Australian Government Actuary.

             (1)  Where:

                     (a)  a veteran is entitled to receive, or is in receipt of, a pension in respect of incapacity from war-caused injury or war-caused disease, or both; and

                              (i)  under the law of a foreign country; or

                             (ii)  under the law of a State;

                            in respect of incapacity resulting from his or her employment in connection with war-like operations in which the Crown was engaged, being incapacity only from injury or disease or both referred to in paragraph (a);

the rate of the pension referred to in paragraph (a) shall be assessed at the rate per year at which it would, but for this subsection, be assessed, reduced by the rate per year of the periodical payments referred to in paragraph (b) or an amount per year determined by the Commission to be the periodical payment equivalent of that lump-sum payment, as the case may be.

             (2)  Where:

                     (a)  a veteran is entitled to receive, or is in receipt of, a pension in respect of incapacity from war-caused injury or war-caused disease, or both; and

                     (b)  the veteran is also entitled to receive, or is also in receipt of, periodical payments, or a lump-sum payment:

                              (i)  under the law of a foreign country; or

                             (ii)  under the law of a State;

                            in respect of incapacity resulting from his or her employment in connection with war-like operations in which the Crown was engaged, not being incapacity only from the injury or disease, or both, referred to in paragraph (a);

the rate of those periodical payments, or the amount of that lump-sum payment, as the case may be, shall be taken into account in assessing the rate of the pension referred to in paragraph (a) so that the total of the payments by way of that pension and of the payments or payment referred to in paragraph (b) do not exceed the total of the payments that the veteran would be entitled to receive by way of pension under this Part in respect of the incapacity referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b), assuming, for the purposes only of this subsection, that the incapacity referred to in paragraph (b) was wholly incapacity from war-caused injury for the purposes of this Part.

             (3)  Where:

                     (a)  the rate per year by which the rate of a veteran’s pension is required by subsection (1) to be reduced exceeds the rate that, but for that subsection, would be the rate per year of that pension; or

                     (b)  the rate of the periodical payments or amount of the lump sum payment that is required by subsection (2) to be taken into account in assessing the rate of a veteran’s pension is such as to require the assessment of the rate of that pension at a rate that does not exceed nought per centum;

the veteran is not entitled to be paid pension.

##### <a id="27"></a>27  Increased rates of pension in certain cases

             (1)  This section applies to a veteran (other than a veteran to whom section 24 applies) who is being paid, or is eligible to be paid, a pension under this Part in respect of incapacity from a war-caused injury or a war-caused disease of a kind described in column 1 of the following table:

             (2)  Subject to subsection (3), the rate at which pension is payable under section 22, 23 or 25 to a veteran to whom this section applies is a rate equal to the sum of:

                     (a)  the rate applicable to that pension under section 22, 23 or 25, as the case requires; and

                     (b)  the rate specified in column 2 of the table in subsection (1) of this section opposite to the description of the kind of incapacity described in column 1 from which the veteran is suffering.

             (3)  If the rate calculated in accordance with subsection (2) in respect of the pension payable to a veteran exceeds:

                     (a)  if section 25A applies to the veteran—the rate specified in subsection 24(6); or

                     (b)  otherwise—the rate specified in subsection 24(4);

the rate must be reduced by the amount of the excess.

             (4)  For the purpose of the application of a table in subsection (1) to and in relation to a veteran:

                     (a)  amputation of an arm of a veteran below the elbow shall, if the elbow action is lost as a result of the amputation, be treated as if an arm of the veteran had been amputated above the elbow;

                     (b)  amputation of a leg of a veteran below the knee shall, if the knee action is lost as a result of the amputation, be treated as if a leg of the veteran had been amputated above the knee;

                     (c)  amputation of a foot of a veteran shall be treated as amputation of a leg of the veteran below the knee;

                     (d)  amputation of a hand of a veteran shall be treated as amputation of an arm of the veteran below the elbow; and

                     (e)  a leg, foot, hand or arm that has been rendered permanently and wholly useless shall be treated as having been amputated.

##### <a id="27A"></a>27A  Calculation of arrears of pension

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a pension becomes payable, or becomes payable at an increased rate, under this Part to a veteran from a date (the **_operative date_**) before the date on which a decision to grant the pension, or to increase the rate of the pension, (the **_decision_**) is made; and

                     (b)  the veteran is a member of a couple or was a member of a couple at any time during the period (the **_arrears period_**) between:

                              (i)  the operative date; and

                             (ii)  immediately before the first pension period during which an instalment of the pension, or an instalment of the pension at the increased rate, is paid to the person; and

                     (c)  the veteran’s partner was receiving:

                              (i)  a social security pension or benefit; or

                            (ia)  a service pension; or

                             (ii)  income support supplement;

                            at any time during the arrears period; and

                     (d)  the rate at which the social security pension or benefit, service pension or income support supplement is payable to the veteran’s partner is reduced as a result of the pension becoming payable to the veteran, or becoming payable to the veteran at an increased rate, as the case requires; and

                     (e)  an amount (the **_recovered amount_**), or no amount, in respect of that reduction has been deducted under section 205 or section 205AA _._

Note:          The amount of arrears of pension payable to a veteran may also be affected by section 205 or 205AA.

             (2)  The amount of the pension payable to the veteran in respect of the arrears period is reduced by an amount calculated as follows:

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.    Work out the total amount of the pension that would have been paid to the veteran during the arrears period if the decision had been made on the operative date.

Step 2.    Work out the total amount (if any) of the pension that was paid to the veteran during the arrears period.

Step 3.    Subtract the amount obtained in Step 2 from the amount obtained in Step 1\. The result is called the _provisional arrears_.

Step 4.    Work out the total amount of social security pension or benefit, service pension or income support supplement that was paid to the veteran’s partner during the arrears period.

Step 5.    Work out the total amount (if any) of social security pension or benefit, service pension or income support supplement that would have been payable to the veteran’s partner during the arrears period if the decision had been made on the operative date.

Step 6.    Subtract the amount obtained in step 5 from the amount obtained in step 4\. The result is called the **_notional excess payment_**.

Step 6A. Subtract the recovered amount (if any) from the notional excess payment. The result is called the **_excess payment_**.

Step 7.    If the excess payment is equal to or more than the provisional arrears, the pension payable to the veteran in respect of the arrears period is reduced by the amount of the provisional arrears.

Step 8.    If the excess payment is less than the provisional arrears, the amount of the pension payable to the veteran in respect of the arrears period is reduced by the amount of the excess payment.

             (5)  The percentage of incapacity of a veteran from war-caused injury or war-caused disease, or both, ascertained in accordance with the methods referred to in paragraph (1)(b) may be nought per centum.

             (6)  In preparing criteria by reference to which the extent of incapacity of a veteran from war-caused injury or war-caused disease, or both, shall be assessed, or in varying those criteria, the Commission shall have regard to medical opinion concerning the nature and effect (including possible effect) of the injury or disease and the extent (if any) to which incapacity resulting from the injury or disease may reasonably be capable of being reduced or removed.

             (8)  The Commission shall make copies of the Guide to the Assessment of Rates of Veterans’ Pensions that has been approved by the Minister, and of any variation of that Guide that has been so approved, available upon application and payment of the prescribed fee (if any).

                     (b)  but for this subsection, pension referred to in paragraph (1)(c), (2)(c) or (3)(c) would be payable to the person at a particular rate per fortnight;

after the lump sum payment is made, the rate per fortnight of the pension is to be reduced by the rate per fortnight of compensation.

             (5)  If, under subsection (4), the rate per fortnight of compensation is equal to or exceeds the rate per fortnight of pension, pension is not payable to the person.

Pension payable to 2 or more persons

             (6)  If:

                     (c)  apart from this subsection, pensions under this Part in respect of the incapacity of the veteran from that injury or disease, or that death, would be payable to 2 or more persons at particular rates per fortnight;

after the lump sum payment is made, the sum of those rates per fortnight of pensions is to be reduced by the rate per fortnight of compensation that the person is, or the sum of the rates per fortnight of compensation that the persons are, taken to be in receipt of.

Note:          Subsections (8), (9) and (10) set out how the reduction is to be made.

How reduction is to be made

             (8)  In giving effect to subsection (6), if:

                     (a)  pensions are payable to 2 or more persons; and

                     (b)  one pension is to be preferred to another under subsection (12);

           (11)  If:

                     (a)  an amount of damages payable to a veteran, or to a dependant of a veteran, is paid to the Commonwealth under section 30G or 30H; or

                     (b)  the liability of the Commonwealth to pay damages to a veteran or to a dependant of a veteran, is, under section 30K, taken to have been discharged to the extent of a particular amount;

subsection (1) of this section applies to the veteran or the dependant as if pension commences to be payable, only after the veteran or dependant receives payments by way of instalments of pension equal to the amount referred to in paragraph (a) or (b).

Preferred pensions

           (12)  For the purposes of this section:

                     (a)  a pension payable under this Part to the veteran is to be preferred to such a pension payable to a dependant of the veteran; and

the rate per fortnight of the person’s pension that would, apart from this subsection, be payable to the person for the periodic payments period is to be reduced by the rate per fortnight of the periodic compensation.

Note 1:       For **_periodic payments period_** see subsection (10).

Note 2:       Pensions under this Part are payable in respect of the incapacity of a veteran from a war-caused injury or disease or in respect of the death of the veteran (see section 13).

             (2)  If, under subsection (1), the rate per fortnight of the periodic compensation is equal to or exceeds the rate per fortnight of pension, pension is not payable to the person.

Pension payable to 2 or more persons

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  periodic payments of compensation are made to a person or persons in respect of the incapacity of a veteran from injury or disease or the death of the veteran; and

                     (b)  apart from this subsection, pensions under this Part in respect of the incapacity of the veteran from that injury or disease, or the death of the veteran, would be payable to 2 or more persons for the periodic payments period at particular rates per fortnight;

the sum of those rates per fortnight of pensions for the periodic payments period is to be reduced by the rate per fortnight of the periodic compensation or the sum of the rates per fortnight of the periodic compensation.

Note:          Subsections (5), (6) and (7) set out how the reduction is to be made.

             (4)  If, under subsection (3), the rate or the sum of the rates per fortnight of periodic compensation is equal to or exceeds the sum of the rates per fortnight of pensions, pensions are not payable to the persons.

How reduction is to be made

             (5)  In giving effect to subsection (3), if:

                     (a)  pensions are payable to 2 or more persons; and

                     (b)  one pension is to be preferred to another under subsection (8);

the preferred pension is not to be reduced until the other pension ceases to be payable because its rate per fortnight is reduced to nil.

             (6)  In giving effect to subsection (3), if:

                     (a)  the rate of a pension or the rates of 2 or more pensions are reduced to nil under subsection (5); and

                     (b)  there are 2 or more pensions that are not to be preferred to each other;

the reduction in the rate per fortnight for each of those pensions is to be worked out using the following formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00064/Html/VetsEntitlmnts1986Vol01_WD02_image009.gif)

where:

                    <a name="excess-compens-payabl"></a>**_excess compensation payable_** is the rate per fortnight of periodic compensation that is payable after the pension or pensions referred to in paragraph (a) are reduced to a nil rate.

             (7)  If:

                     (a)  pensions are payable to 2 or more persons; and

                     (b)  subsections (5) and (6) do not apply;

the reduction in the rate per fortnight for each pension is to be worked out using the following formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00064/Html/VetsEntitlmnts1986Vol01_WD02_image010.gif)

where:

                    <a name="pension-ruced"></a>**_pension to be reduced_** is the rate per fortnight of the pension to be reduced.

                    <a name="pension-payabl"></a>**_pensions payable_** is the sum of the rates per fortnight of pensions payable to the persons.

                    <a name="compens-payabl"></a>**_compensation payable_** is the sum of the rates per fortnight of periodic compensation that is payable to the persons.

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not prevent the recovery of the amount in a manner other than the one provided for in that subsection. An amount is not to be recovered as provided and also in a manner that is not provided for in subsection (2).

##### <a id="31"></a>31  Review by Commission

             (1)  Where:

                     (a)  the time has not expired for making application to the Board under section 135 for a review of a decision of the Commission with respect to:

                              (i)  a claim for a pension in accordance with section 14;

                             (ii)  an application for an increased pension, or for a pension, in accordance with section 15; or

                            (iii)  an application for attendant allowance under section 98; or

                     (b)  an application has been duly made to the Board under section 135 for a review of such a decision of the Commission but has not been determined by the Board;

the Commission may, in its discretion, review that decision and, if it varies that decision, it may approve as the date as from which the variation shall operate a date not earlier than the earliest date as from which the decision as so varied could have operated if it had been made by the Board, in substitution for the original decision, upon a review of the original decision.

             (2)  Where application has been duly made, otherwise than by the Commission, to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal under section 175 for a review of:

                     (a)  a decision of the Commission that has been affirmed by the Board; or

                     (b)  a decision made by the Board in substitution for a decision of the Commission;

but the review has not been determined, the Commission may, in its discretion, review that decision and, with the consent of the applicant, vary that decision and, if it varies that decision, it may approve as the date as from which the variation shall operate a date not earlier than the earliest date as from which the decision as so varied could have operated if the variation had been made by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal upon a review of the decision.

             (3)  The Commission may, for the purpose only of correcting a manifest error, vary the date approved by the Board as the date as from which a decision of the Board made in substitution for a decision of the Commission is to operate.

             (4)  Where the Commission is satisfied that evidence before the Commission when it made a decision was false in a material particular, the Commission may, in its discretion, review the decision and, if it varies the decision, it may approve as the date as from which the variation shall operate a date, which may be a date before or after the commencement of the review, considered by the Commission to be appropriate in all the circumstances.

             (5)  For the purposes only of approving a date under subsection (1) as the date as from which a variation of a decision to which paragraph (1)(a) applies shall operate, the Commission shall assume that an application had been made to the Board to review the decision on the date on which the Commission commenced its review of the decision.

          (5A)  The Commission may, for the purpose of reviewing a decision under this section, of exercising its powers under subsection (6) for a reason specified in paragraph (6)(a) or (b) or of exercising its powers under subsection (8), by notice in writing served on a veteran who is in receipt of a pension under this Part, request the veteran:

                     (a)  to undergo, as provided in the notice, a medical examination for the purpose of the review, or the exercise of those powers, as the case may be; or

                     (b)  to consent to the release to the Commission of information concerning the veteran of a kind described in the notice, being information that, in the opinion of the Commission, may be relevant to the review, or the exercise of those powers, as the case may be.

             (6)  Where the Commission is satisfied that:

                     (a)  having regard to any matter that affects the payment of a pension or attendant allowance, being a matter that was not before the Commission, the Board or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, as the case requires, when the decision to grant the pension or attendant allowance, or a decision to vary the rate of the pension or attendant allowance, was made;

                     (b)  by reason of a refusal or failure of any person to comply with a provision of this Act;

                     (c)  by reason of a refusal or failure of a veteran to comply with a notice served on the veteran under subsection (5A) or with a request made under paragraph 32(1)(c); or

                     (d)  by reason of the circumstances referred to in a paragraph of section 24A being applicable to the veteran;

in a case to which paragraph (a), (b) or (c) applies, a pension or attendant allowance should be cancelled or suspended or is being paid at a higher rate than it should be or, in a case to which paragraph (d) applies, a pension is being paid at a higher rate than it should be, the Commission may, by determination in writing, cancel or suspend or decrease the rate of the pension or attendant allowance, or decrease the rate of the pension, as the case may be, with effect, subject to subsection (7), from the day on which the determination was made or such later day as is specified in the determination.

          (6A)  Where the Commission is, under subsection (6), satisfied that the rate of a pension payable to a veteran is higher than it should be by reason that the degree of incapacity of the veteran from war-caused injury or war-caused disease, or both, is less than 10 per centum (including nought per centum), it shall cancel the pension that was payable to the veteran.

          (6B)  The cancellation of a pension payable to a veteran under subsection (6A) does not affect any decision of the Commission, the Board or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal that is in force determining that the veteran is suffering from a war-caused injury or a war-caused disease, or both.

             (7)  Where a determination is made under subsection (6):

                    (aa)  by reason of the Commission having regard to a matter that affects the payment of a pension or attendant allowance in the circumstances specified in paragraph (6)(a); or

                     (a)  by reason of the refusal or failure of a person to comply with a provision of this Act, other than:

                              (i)  subsection 127(4) in relation to a notice under paragraph 127(1)(f); or

                             (ii)  subsection 128(4); or

                     (b)  by reason that an amount has been paid by way of pension or attendant allowance that, but for the false statement or misrepresentation of any person, would not have been paid;

a date earlier than the date of the determination may be specified in the determination as the date as from which the cancellation, suspension or decrease, as the case may be, is to take effect.

          (7A)  Subsection (7) does not apply to a determination made under subsection (6) for a reason set out in paragraph (6)(c).

             (8)  Where the Commission is satisfied that, having regard to any matter that affects the payment of a pension or attendant allowance, the rate of the pension or attendant allowance is less than it should be, the Commission may, by determination in writing, increase the rate of the pension or attendant allowance with effect from the date of the determination, or such earlier date, or such later date, as is specified in the determination.

             (9)  Where the Commission determines that a pension or attendant allowance be suspended:

                     (a)  the Commission may, in the same determination, fix the date of re-commencement of the pension or attendant allowance; or

                     (b)  if the Commission does not so fix the date of re-commencement, the Commission shall, in a subsequent determination, fix the date of re-commencement of the pension or attendant allowance unless it makes a further determination cancelling the pension or attendant allowance.

           (10)  If the Commission refuses or fails to review, under this section, a decision in relation to a pension or attendant allowance, the refusal or failure is not subject to review by the Board or by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

           (11)  A decision by the Commission upon its review under this section of a decision in relation to a pension or attendant allowance is not subject to review by the Board or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal unless the Commission cancels or suspends the pension or attendant allowance, or varies the decision, reviewed by the Commission.

           (12)  This section applies to and in relation to a decision made before or after the commencement of this section but does not apply to or in relation to a decision of the Board referred to in subsection 154(1), or a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal referred to in subsection 178(1), that is binding on the Commission by reason that the period specified in that subsection has not expired.
