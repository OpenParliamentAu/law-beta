Division&#160;1&#151;Introduction

118N  Simplified outline

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

		The following is a simplified outline of this Part:

 </dl></dl>

This Part is about payment of:

	(a)	Defence Force Income Support Allowance (_DFISA_); and
 	(b)	DFISA bonus; and
 	(c)	DFISA-like payments under regulations made under this Part.

_DFISAsee Division 2_

DFISA is payable to a person if the rate of the person's social security pension or benefit has been reduced (including to nil) because the person, or the person's partner, has been paid adjusted disability pension (within the meaning of this Part).
 Payment of DFISA is automatic: a person does not need to make a claim for it.

_DFISA bonussee Division 3_

DFISA bonus is payable to a person if the amount of the person's social security pension bonus has been reduced (including to nil) because the person, or the person's partner, has been paid adjusted disability pension (within the meaning of this Part).
 Payment of DFISA bonus is also automatic.

_DFISA-like paymentssee Division 4_

Regulations made under this Part may provide for DFISA-like payments to be paid to a person if adjusted disability pension (within the meaning of this Part) payable to the person, or the person's partner, reduces the amount of a payment payable to the person under a Commonwealth Act, regulations or an instrument made under such an Act, or a Commonwealth administered program.

	(a)	Part&#160;3.14 of the Social Security Act (compensation recovery) applies to reduce the rate of the primary payment on that day (in which case see method statement 2 in subsection&#160;(2)); or

_Method Statement 1_

_Step 1_.	Work out the daily provisional payment rate for the primary payment on that day.

	Note:	For _daily provisional payment rate_ see subsection&#160;(4).

_Step 2_.	Work out what would have been the daily provisional payment rate (the _notional rate_) for the primary payment on that day if both of the following assumptions were made:
 	_First assumption_
 	The first assumption is that the adjusted disability pension payable to the person, or the person's partner, were an excluded amount (see section&#160;118NA).

	Note:	This will mean the adjusted disability pension will not be treated as income when calculating the notional rate.

	_Second assumption_
 	The second assumption is that, if an amount of rent assistance was included in the primary payment, that amount were reduced (but not to less than nil) by the rent reduction amount.

	Note:	For _rent assistance_ and _rent reduction amount_ see subsection&#160;(4).

_Step 3_.	Subtract the daily provisional payment rate under step 1 from the notional rate under step 2\. The difference is the rate of DFISA on that day.

_Step 2_.	Work out the amount by which Part&#160;3.14 of the Social Security Act reduces the daily primary payment rate on that day.
 _Step 3_.	Subtract the amount in step 2 from the rate in step 1.
 _Step 4_.	Work out what would have been the daily provisional payment rate (the _notional rate_) for the primary payment on that day if the 2 assumptions referred to in step 2 of method statement 1 in subsection&#160;(1) were made.
 _Step 5_.	Work out the amount by which Part&#160;3.14 of the Social Security Act would have reduced the notional rate on that day if that rate had been the daily primary payment rate.
 _Step 6_.	Subtract the amount in step 5 from the rate in step 4.
 _Step 7_.	Subtract the amount in step 3 from the amount in step 6\. The difference is the rate of DFISA on that day.

_daily provisional payment rate_ means the provisional payment

referred to in the Rate Calculator used under the Social Security Act to work

out the rate of the primary payment, converted to a daily rate by dividing the

rate by 364 (for a provisional annual payment rate) or 14 (for a provisional

fortnightly payment rate). _rent assistance_ has the same meaning as in the Social Security Act. _rent reduction amount_ is the amount that would be a person's income reduction under the Social Security Act if that income reduction were worked out by applying the same income test or ordinary income test that was used under that Act in calculating the person's primary payment, but applying that test on the basis that the adjusted disability pension payable to the person, or the person's partner, were the person's only ordinary income for the purposes of that Act.  </dl></dl>
