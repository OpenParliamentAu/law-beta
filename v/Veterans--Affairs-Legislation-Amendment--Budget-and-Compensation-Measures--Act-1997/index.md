<dl compact="">

</dd> </dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>the person has received an advance payment of that pension or of another

<dt>(c)</dt><dd>the amount of the advance payment that has not been repaid is not a debt

		Subject to sections 79N, 79O, 79P and 79Q, the advance payment deduction for

an advance payment of a pension is the amount of the advance payment divided by

13.

 </dl>

79N  Person may request larger advance payment deduction

<dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>Subject to subsection (2) and sections 79O, 79P and 79Q, a person's

advance payment deduction may be increased to a larger amount if the person

asks the Commission in writing for the advance payment deduction to be the

larger amount.</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>Subsection (1) does not apply if the Commission is satisfied that the person would suffer severe financial hardship if the advance payment deduction were the larger amount. </dd> </dl>

79O  Reduction of advance payment deduction in cases of severe financial hardship

<dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>Subject to subsection (2) and sections 79P and 79Q, if:

</dd> </dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>a person applies in writing to the Commission for an advance payment

deduction to be decreased, or to be stopped, because of severe financial

hardship; and</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>the Commission is satisfied that:

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(i)</dt><dd>the person's circumstances are exceptional and could not reasonably have

been foreseen at the time of the person's application for the advance payment;

<dt>(ii)</dt><dd>the person would suffer severe financial hardship if the advance payment

deduction that would otherwise apply were to continue;

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl></dl>

the Commission may determine in writing that, for the period stated in the determination, the advance payment deduction is to be the lesser amount (which may be a nil amount) stated in the determination.

<dl compact="">

<dt>(2)</dt><dd>At any time while the determination is in force, the Commission may:

</dd> </dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>vary the determination so as to require to be deducted from the person's

rate of  pension an advance payment deduction larger than the deduction

(if any) previously applying under the determination, but smaller than the

deduction applying immediately before the determination; or</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>revoke the determination;

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

but only if the Commission is satisfied that the person would not suffer severe financial hardship because of the variation or revocation.

<dl compact="">

<dt>(3)</dt><dd>A variation or revocation of a determination must be in writing.

</dd> </dl>

79P  The final advance payment deduction

<dl compact="">

		If an advance payment deduction that would otherwise be deducted from a

person's rate of pension exceeds the part of the advance payment that the

person has not yet repaid (by previous deductions under this Division or

otherwise), the amount of that advance payment deduction equals the part that

the person has not yet repaid.

 </dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Example:	 Facts:	Anne has been paid an advance of $450\. Anne's payment deduction is worked out under section 79M as follows:  </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

	This amount is rounded under section 79R to $34.60\. 	Anne has requested that the advance payment deduction be the larger amount of $55 (see section 79N), so that the advance will be repaid sooner. Result:	If $55 is deducted from Anne's fortnightly rate of pension, $440 will have been repaid after 8 successive fortnights, leaving $10 unpaid. Under this section, the final advance payment deduction will be $10\.  </dl></dl>

79Q  Payment rate insufficient to cover advance payment deduction

<dl compact="">

		If the rate of pension (excluding remote area allowance in the case of a

pension payable under Part III or income support supplement) is less than the

amount that would be the advance payment deduction apart from this section, the

advance payment deduction is taken to be equal to that rate of pension.

 </dl>

79R  Rounding of amounts

<dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>If an amount worked out under this Division is not a multiple of 10 cents,

the amount is, subject to subsection (2), to be increased or decreased to the

79S  Unrepaid advance payments to deceased partner to be disregarded

<dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>In calculating, for the purposes of this Act, an amount of pension that

would have been paid to a deceased person if the person had not died, any

advance payment of pension that has been made to the person and has not been

repaid is to be disregarded.</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>Subsection (1) does not affect the liability of the estate of the deceased person to repay to the Commonwealth so much of the advance payment as has not been repaid. </dd> </dl>
