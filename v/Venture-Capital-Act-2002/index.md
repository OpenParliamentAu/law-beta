## Part 2—Registration of limited partnerships

### Division 7—A guide to this Part

##### <a id="7‑1"></a>7‑1  What this Part is about

* * *

Innovation Australia can register limited partnerships as venture capital limited partnerships, early stage venture capital limited partnerships or Australian venture capital funds of funds.

Registration is one of the requirements before investments of venture capital through a limited partnership can attract the operation of:

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•     the

capital gains tax exemption relating to venture capital under Subdivision 118‑F

of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (and the related provisions about

similar income gains and losses); and</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•     the

income tax exemption under section 51‑52 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (if the partnership is an early stage venture capital limited

partnership); and</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•     the

“flow‑through” treatment, under Division 5 of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, of the income of limited partnerships.</li>

Broadly speaking, Innovation Australia will register a limited partnership under Division 13 if an application meets the requirements of Division 11, unless Innovation Australia is satisfied that the partnership does not meet the applicable registration requirements of Division 9.

Conditional registration is an option if an application does not meet the requirements of Division 11.

                   Note:             Conditional registration becomes important if full registration is achieved. Registration is then backdated at least to the time of conditional registration.

Innovation Australia can revoke a registration under Division 17\. Broadly speaking, the grounds for revocation are:

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•     failure

to meet the applicable registration requirements of Division 9; and</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•     failure

to provide information as required under Division 15.</li>

                     (a)  the investment plan set out in the document that the notice under subsection 13‑1(3) specifies; or

                     (b)  if that plan has been replaced under this section, that plan as so replaced.

             (3)  A * general partner of an * ESVCLP may, by writing, request Innovation Australia to approve a new plan as a replacement for the ESVCLP’s * approved investment plan.

             (4)  The request must state why the * ESVCLP wants the replacement plan.

             (5)  If * Innovation Australia is satisfied that the replacement plan is appropriate, it must grant the request and approve the replacement plan.

Note:          Section 13‑20 deals with deciding whether a replacement plan is appropriate.

             (6)  If * Innovation Australia approves the replacement plan, the ESVCLP’s * approved investment plan is replaced accordingly on the giving of the approval.

             (8)  * Innovation Australia must give the * general partner who made the request written notice of its decision on the request as soon as practicable after the decision is made.

                     (g)  the requirements of this Act relating to an * ESVCLP making and holding investments; and

                     (h)  whether the partnership’s * committed capital can only be used in relation to early stage venture capital, and whether it can be transferred to other entities; and

                      (i)  whether the investment plan is connected with other plans for investment that, if combined with the investment plan, would lead to the partnership exceeding the limit on * committed capital under subparagraph 9‑3(1)(d)(ii); and

                      (j)  any additional matters specified in guidelines made under subsection (2).

             (2)  * Innovation Australia may, by legislative instrument, make guidelines specifying additional matters that it must take into account in deciding, for the purposes of paragraph 13‑1(1A)(c) or subsection 13‑15(5), whether it is satisfied that:

## Part 3—Registration of eligible venture capital investors

### Division 21—Registration of eligible venture capital investors

#### Guide to Division 21

##### <a id="21‑1"></a>21‑1  What this Division is about

* * *

Innovation Australia can register entities as eligible venture capital investors, and revoke their registration.

Registration is one of the requirements before investments of venture capital by an entity directly (rather than through a limited partnership) can attract the operation of section 118‑415 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (and the related provisions about similar income gains and losses).

* * *

Note:          Section 118‑415 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ gives to an individual investor an equivalent capital gains tax exemption to the one that the investor could have, under section 118‑405 or 118‑410 of that Act, from investing through a limited partnership registered under Part 2 of this Act.
