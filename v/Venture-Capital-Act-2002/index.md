## An Act relating to venture capital investments, and for related purposes

## Part 1—Preliminary

1-10          Interpretation

1-15          Identifying defined terms

##### <a id="1-1"></a>1-1  Short title <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 13.0pt">[_see_ Note 1]</span>

                   This Act may be cited as the _Venture Capital Act 2002_.

##### <a id="1-5"></a>1-5  Commencement <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 13.0pt">[_see_ Note 1]</span>

                   This Act commences on the day on which it receives the Royal Assent.

##### <a id="1-10"></a>1-10  Interpretation

             (1)  An expression has the same meaning in this Act as in the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

             (2)  Division 950 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (which contains rules for interpreting that Act) applies to this Act as if the provisions of this Act were provisions of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

##### <a id="1-15"></a>1-15  Identifying defined terms

             (1)  Many of the terms in this Act are defined in the Dictionary, starting at section 995-1, to the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

             (2)  Most of the terms that are defined in that Dictionary are identified by an asterisk appearing at the start of the term: as in * PDF Board. The footnote with the asterisk contains a signpost to that Dictionary.

             (3)  An asterisk usually identifies the first occurrence of a term in a section (if not divided into subsections), subsection or definition. Later occurrences of the term in the same provision are not usually asterisked.

             (4)  Terms are not asterisked in headings, notes, examples, explanatory tables, guides, outline provisions or diagrams.

             (5)  If a term is not identified by an asterisk, disregard that fact in deciding whether or not to apply to that term a definition or other interpretation provision.

### Division 3—A guide to this Act

##### <a id="3-1"></a>3-1  What this Act is about

                   This Act provides for some administrative measures that are needed for the operation of:

                     (a)  the capital gains tax exemption relating to venture capital under Subdivision 118-F of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (and the related provisions about similar income gains and losses); and

                     (b)  the “flow-through” treatment, under Division 5 of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, of the income of limited partnerships that are used as vehicles for making venture capital investments.

Note:          The PDF Board is responsible for the operation of these measures. The _Pooled Development Funds Act 1992_ provides for the establishment and operation of the PDF Board.

##### <a id="3-5"></a>3-5  Registration of venture capital limited partnerships and Australian venture capital funds of funds (Part 2)

                   Part 2 provides for:

                     (a)  the registration requirements for venture capital limited partnerships and Australian venture capital funds of funds; and

                     (b)  applications for registration; and

                     (c)  registration of limited partnerships by the PDF Board, including conditional registration; and

                     (d)  the obligations imposed on general partners of partnerships that are registered; and

                     (e)  revocation of registration.

##### <a id="3-10"></a>3-10  Registration of eligible venture capital investors (Part 3)

                   Part 3 provides for registration of entities as eligible venture capital investors, their obligations while registered, and revocation of registration.

##### <a id="3-15"></a>3-15  Determinations by the PDF Board concerning certain investments (Part 4)

                   Part 4 provides for the PDF Board to make determinations that are relevant to whether certain investments can be eligible venture capital investments.

##### <a id="3-20"></a>3-20  Review of decisions (Part 5)

                   Part 5 provides for review of the PDF Board’s decisions under this Act.

##### <a id="3-25"></a>3-25  Miscellaneous (Part 6)

                   Part 6 deals with miscellaneous matters.

## Part 2—Registration of venture capital limited partnerships and Australian venture capital funds of funds

### Division 7—A guide to this Part

##### <a id="7-1"></a>7-1  What this Part is about

<div style="BORDER-RIGHT: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-RIGHT: 5pt; BORDER-TOP: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-LEFT: 5pt; PADDING-BOTTOM: 5pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 2cm; BORDER-LEFT: windowtext 1pt solid; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0cm; PADDING-TOP: 5pt; BORDER-BOTTOM: windowtext 1pt solid; mso-border-alt: solid windowtext .75pt">

The PDF Board can register limited partnerships as venture capital limited partnerships or Australian venture capital funds of funds.

Registration is one of the requirements before investments of venture capital through a limited partnership can attract the operation of:

<li class="BoxList" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 21.25pt">•     the capital gains tax exemption relating to venture capital under Subdivision 118-F of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (and the related provisions about similar income gains and losses); and</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 21.25pt">•     the “flow-through” treatment, under Division 5 of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, of the income of limited partnerships.</li>

Broadly speaking, the PDF Board will register a limited partnership under Division 13 if an application meets the requirements of Division 11, unless the PDF Board is satisfied that the partnership does not meet the applicable registration requirements of Division 9.

Conditional registration is an option if an application does not meet the requirements of Division 11.

                   Note:             Conditional registration becomes important if full registration is achieved. Registration is then backdated to the time of conditional registration. However, this only backdates the “flow-through” treatment of the partnership income. The other tax consequences operate from the time of unconditional registration.

The PDF Board can revoke a registration under Division 17\. Broadly speaking, the grounds for revocation are:

<li class="BoxList" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 21.25pt">•     failure to meet the applicable registration requirements of Division 9; and</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 21.25pt">•     failure to provide information as required under Division 15.</li></div>

The PDF Board can register entities as eligible venture capital investors, and revoke their registration.

Registration is one of the requirements before investments of venture capital by an entity directly (rather than through a limited partnership) can attract the operation of section 118-415 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (and the related provisions about similar income gains and losses).</div>

Note:          Section 118-415 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ gives to an individual investor an equivalent capital gains tax exemption to the one that the investor could have, under section 118-405 or 118-410 of that Act, from investing through a limited partnership registered under Part 2 of this Act.
