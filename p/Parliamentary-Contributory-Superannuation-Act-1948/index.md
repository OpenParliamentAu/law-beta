##### <a id="4A"></a>4A  Transfer value payable in respect of previous employment

             (1)  In this Act:

                     (a)  a reference, in relation to a member, to a transfer value payable to or in respect of the member under a superannuation scheme applicable in relation to any employment in which he or she was employed at any time before the date on which he or she became a member is a reference to a benefit by way of a lump sum payable to or in respect of the member under that scheme upon the termination of the employment otherwise than on the ground of invalidity or of physical or mental incapacity to perform the duties of the employment, being a benefit that was based wholly upon contributions under the scheme by the employer or was based partly upon such contributions and partly upon contributions under the scheme by the member; and

                     (b)  a reference to the amount of a transfer value:

                              (i)  if the transfer value was based in part upon an amount or amounts paid to or in respect of the member under this Act—is a reference to so much only of the lump sum constituting the transfer value as exceeded that amount or the total of those amounts; and

                             (ii)  does not include a reference to any part of the lump sum constituting the transfer value that was based upon contributions by the member that were, or were of a similar nature to, contributions under the _Superannuation Act 1922_ for reserve units of pension or contributions under section 48 of the _Superannuation Act 1976_; and

                            (iii)  does not include a reference to any part of the lump sum constituting the transfer value that was based upon any excess contribution multiple within the meaning of the _Superannuation Act 1990_ of the member.

             (2)  If, after a transfer value became payable to or in respect of a person under a superannuation scheme, the whole or any part of that transfer value was paid to a person administering another superannuation scheme:

                     (a)  where the whole of the transfer value was so paid—that transfer value shall be disregarded for the purposes of this Act; or

                     (b)  where part of the transfer value was so paid—the amount of that transfer value shall be deemed, for the purposes of this Act, to be reduced by the amount so paid.

             (3)  Subject to subsection (4), a transfer value shall be deemed for the purposes of this Act to have become payable in respect of a person under a superannuation scheme upon the termination of any employment if, upon the termination of that employment, the person was the owner of a life policy, or was entitled to have the rights of the owner of a life policy assigned to him or her, being a policy the premiums for which were, while the person was employed in that employment, paid in whole or in part by the person’s employer, and, in that case, the surrender value of the policy as at the date of the termination of the employment shall be taken to be the amount of the transfer value.

             (4)  Where a transfer value is, by virtue of subsection (3), deemed for the purposes of this Act to have become payable in respect of a person upon the termination of any employment by reason that, upon the termination of that employment, the person was the owner of a life policy, or was entitled to have the rights of the owner of a life policy assigned to him or her, a transfer value shall not be deemed, for those purposes, to have become payable in respect of the person upon the termination of any previous employment by reason that, upon the termination of that previous employment, the person was the owner of that policy, or was entitled to have the rights of the owner of that policy assigned to him or her.

##### <a id="4B"></a>4B  Marital or couple relationship

             (1)  For the purposes of this Act, a person had a **_marital or_** **_couple relationship_** with another person at a particular time if the person ordinarily lived with that other person as that other person’s husband or wife or partner on a permanent and _bona fide_ domestic basis at that time.

             (2)  For the purpose of subsection (1), a person is to be regarded as ordinarily living with another person as that other person’s husband or wife or partner on a permanent and _bona fide_ domestic basis at a particular time only if:

                     (a)  the person had been living with that other person as that other person’s husband or wife or partner for a continuous period of at least 3 years up to that time; or

                     (b)  the person had been living with that other person as that other person’s husband or wife or partner for a continuous period of less than 3 years up to that time and the Trust, having regard to any relevant evidence, is of the opinion that the person ordinarily lived with that other person as that other person’s husband or wife or partner on a permanent and _bona fide_ domestic basis at that time;

whether or not the person was legally married to that other person.

             (3)  For the purposes of this Act, a marital or couple relationship is taken to have begun at the beginning of the continuous period mentioned in paragraph (2)(a) or (b).

             (4)  For the purpose of subsection (2), relevant evidence includes, but is not limited to, evidence establishing any of the following:

                     (a)  the person was wholly or substantially dependent on that other person at the time;

                     (b)  the persons were legally married to each other at the time;

                   (ba)  the persons’ relationship was registered under a law of a State or Territory prescribed for the purposes of section 2E of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_, as a kind of relationship prescribed for the purposes of that section;

                     (c)  the persons had a child who was:

                              (i)  born of the relationship between the persons; or

                     (d)  the persons jointly owned a home which was their usual residence.

             (5)  For the purposes of this section, a person is taken to be living with another person if the Trust is satisfied that the person would have been living with that other person except for a period of:

the percentage of the rate of parliamentary allowance applicable in relation to the person in accordance with the scale set out in subsection (6) shall be increased by an additional percentage (calculated to 3 decimal places) of that rate ascertained by multiplying the number of those complete days or 364, whichever is the less, by .00685.

             (8)  Where the additional percentage ascertained in accordance with subsection (7) in relation to a person would, if it were calculated to 4 decimal places, end with a number greater than 4, that additional percentage shall be taken to be the percentage calculated to 3 decimal places in accordance with that subsection and increased by 0.001.

### Division 2—Benefits for non‑member spouse

##### <a id="22CD"></a>22CD  Associate annuity for non‑member spouse

             (1)  This section applies to a superannuation interest under this Act (the **_original interest_**)if:

                     (a)  the Secretary receives a splitting agreement or splitting order in respect of the original interest; and

                     (b)  the original interest is not an entitlement to an annuity under section 19AA; and

                     (c)  the member spouse and the non‑member spouse are both alive at the operative time; and

                     (d)  if a base amount applies—the base amount at the operative time is not more than the family law value or the scheme value.

Immediate annuity if operative time in payment phase

             (2)  If, at the operative time, standard allowance or annuity is payable in respect of the original interest, then the non‑member spouse is entitled to an associate immediate annuity from the operative time, at the rate calculated under the Orders by reference to the transfer amount.

Deferred annuity if operative time in growth phase

             (3)  If, at the operative time, standard allowance or annuity is not payable in respect of the original interest, then the non‑member spouse is entitled to an associate deferred annuity in accordance with section 22CE.

##### <a id="22CE"></a>22CE  Associate deferred annuity

             (1)  The associate deferred annuity is payable at an annual rate calculated under the Orders by reference to the transfer amount.

             (2)  The annuity is payable from the later of:

                     (a)  the operative time; and

                     (b)  the earliest of the following dates:

                              (i)  if the Trust is satisfied that the non‑member spouse has become permanently incapacitated—the date that the Trust considers to have been the date on which the person became permanently incapacitated;

                             (ii)  a date notified to the Secretary under subsection (3);

                            (iii)  the 65th anniversary of the non‑member spouse’s birth.

             (3)  The non‑member spouse may give a written notice to the Secretary specifying a date that is not earlier than the 55th anniversary of the non‑member spouse’s birth. However, the notice has no effect if section 26B would prevent the annuity being paid to the non‑member spouse from the specified date.

Note:          Section 26B applies the preservation requirements of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations.

             (4)  The annuity is not payable unless:

                     (a)  a written application has been made requesting payment of the benefit; and

                     (b)  the applicant has provided any information that is necessary to determine whether the benefit is payable.

             (5)  An application for payment on the ground of incapacity must be accompanied by the following:

                     (a)  a certificate given by a medical practitioner nominated by the Trust;

                     (b)  a certificate given by a medical practitioner nominated by, or on behalf of, the non‑member spouse;

                     (c)  such additional information or documents as the Trust requires.

             (6)  The certificates mentioned in paragraphs (5)(a) and (b) must include a statement to the effect that, in the opinion of the medical practitioner concerned, the non‑member spouse is permanently incapacitated, as defined in this section.

             (7)  If the non‑member spouse dies before the annuity becomes payable, an amount calculated under the Orders must be paid to the legal personal representative or, if no legal personal representative can be found, to any individual or individuals that the Trust determines.

             (8)  For the purposes of this section, a person is **_permanently incapacitated_** if, and only if, the person suffers from **_permanent incapacity_** within the meaning of the _Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations 1994_.

##### <a id="22CF"></a>22CF  Commutation of small associate annuity

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  the annual rate of associate immediate annuity that becomes payable to the non‑member spouse is less than the amount determined under the Orders; or

                     (b)  the annual rate of associate deferred annuity that becomes payable to the non‑member spouse is less than the amount determined under the Orders;

then the non‑member spouse may elect to commute the annuity.

             (2)  The election must be made in writing to the Secretary not later than 3 months after the annuity becomes payable.

             (3)  If the non‑member spouse makes the election, then the non‑member spouse is entitled instead to:

                     (a)  if paragraph (1)(a) applies—a lump sum equal to the transfer amount; or

                     (b)  if paragraph (1)(b) applies—a lump sum calculated under the Orders.

### Division 3—Reduction of benefits for member spouse

##### <a id="22CG"></a>22CG  Operative time during growth phase—reduction of lump sum

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  at the operative time, standard allowance or annuity is not payable in respect of the original interest; and

                     (b)  the original interest is not an entitlement to an associate annuity.

             (2)  The contributions in respect of the original interest are reduced, with effect from the operative time, by the amount calculated using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00555/Html/4d258f63-43c0-4ac9-bbea-f6d0ebfbc5c4_files/image016.gif)

where:

                    <a name="contribut-ot"></a>**_contributions at OT_** means the amount of the contributions, ascertained at the operative time.

Note:          Under subsections 20A(2) and 22Q(3), certain amounts are deemed to be contributions (in addition to contributions under Part IV).

             (3)  Any section 16A amount in respect of the original interest is reduced, with effect from the operative time, by the amount calculated using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00555/Html/4d258f63-43c0-4ac9-bbea-f6d0ebfbc5c4_files/image017.gif)

where:

                    <a name="section-16a-amount-ot"></a>**_section 16A amount at OT_** means the section 16A amount, ascertained at the operative time.

             (4)  Any section 22Q amount in respect of the original interest is reduced, with effect from the operative time, by the amount calculated using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00555/Html/4d258f63-43c0-4ac9-bbea-f6d0ebfbc5c4_files/image018.gif)

where:

                    <a name="section-22q-amount-ot"></a>**_section 22Q amount at OT_** means the section 22Q amount, ascertained at the operative time.

##### <a id="22CH"></a>22CH  Operative time during growth phase—reduction of retiring allowance

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  at the operative time, standard allowance or annuity is not payable in respect of the original interest; and

                     (b)  after the operative time, a retiring allowance (the **_affected benefit_**) becomes payable to the member spouse in respect of the original interest.

Note:          If the member spouse dies before becoming entitled to a retiring allowance, then subsection (1) will nevertheless result in an indirect reduction of any annuity under paragraph 19(1)(a) to a surviving spouse. This happens because the amount of that annuity is based on the amount of retiring allowance that would have become payable to the member spouse if he or she had not died.

Reduction of basic percentage

             (2)  In calculating the annual rate of the affected benefit, the applicable basic percentage is replaced by the percentage calculated using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00555/Html/4d258f63-43c0-4ac9-bbea-f6d0ebfbc5c4_files/image019.gif)

where:

                    <a name="bsf-ot"></a>**_BSF at OT_** means the basic service factor at the operative time.

                    <a name="bsf-pt"></a>**_BSF at PT_** means the basic service factor at the payment time.

Reduction of additional percentage

             (3)  In calculating the annual rate of the affected benefit, each applicable additional percentage is replaced by the percentage calculated using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00555/Html/4d258f63-43c0-4ac9-bbea-f6d0ebfbc5c4_files/image020.gif)

where:

                    <a name="asf-ot"></a>**_ASF at OT_** means the additional service factor at the operative time for the office concerned.

                    <a name="asf-pt"></a>**_ASF at PT_** means the additional service factor at the payment time for the office concerned.

             (4)  Subsection (3) does not apply to an applicable additional percentage for an office if:

                     (a)  the period of service in the office began after the operative time; and

                     (b)  paragraph 18(10B)(b) does not apply.

Multiple interest splits for same original interest

             (5)  If, before the affected benefit becomes payable, the original interest has been split more than once (that is to say, section 22CD has applied more than once), then the calculations under subsections (2) and (3) are modified as set out in subsections (6) and (7).

Note:          If the same superannuation interest is subject to 2 or more payment splits, then section 22CD applies separately in relation to each of those splits.

             (6)  In applying the formula in subsection (2), the component (BSF at OT ´ Transfer factor) is to be replaced by the number calculated using the following steps, based on the chronological order of the operative times (starting with the earliest):

                     (a)  calculate a factor (the **_interim factor_**) for the first split using the formula:

                            ![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00555/Html/4d258f63-43c0-4ac9-bbea-f6d0ebfbc5c4_files/image021.gif)

                     (b)  calculate a factor (the **_interim factor_**) for the next split (the **_current split_**), using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00555/Html/4d258f63-43c0-4ac9-bbea-f6d0ebfbc5c4_files/image022.gif)

                     (c)  calculate a factor for each remaining split (if any), using the formula in paragraph (b);

                     (d)  add together the factors calculated under paragraphs (a) to (c).

Example:    Assume 2 splits, with the first split having a basic service factor (BSF) of 0.4 and a transfer factor of 0.5 and the second split having a basic service factor of 0.6 and a transfer factor of 0.5\. Applying the above steps, the replacement number for the formula is 0.4, that is:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00555/Html/4d258f63-43c0-4ac9-bbea-f6d0ebfbc5c4_files/image023.gif)

             (7)  In applying the formula in subsection (3), the component (ASF at OT ´ Transfer factor) is to be replaced by the number calculated using the following steps, based on the chronological order of the operative times (starting with the earliest):

                     (a)  calculate a factor (the **_interim factor_**) for the first split using the formula:

                            ![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00555/Html/4d258f63-43c0-4ac9-bbea-f6d0ebfbc5c4_files/image024.gif)

                     (b)  calculate a factor (the **_interim factor_**) for the next split (the **_current split_**), using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00555/Html/4d258f63-43c0-4ac9-bbea-f6d0ebfbc5c4_files/image025.gif)

                     (c)  calculate a factor for each remaining split (if any), using the formula in paragraph (b);

                     (d)  add together the factors calculated under paragraphs (a) to (c).

Reduction not to affect later non‑standard annuity

             (8)  A reduction under this section is to be disregarded in calculating the amount of any non‑standard annuity that later becomes payable.

Note:          For example, the reduction will be disregarded in calculating the amount of annuity payable under section 19AA in respect of a child of the member spouse after the member spouse’s death.

##### <a id="22CI"></a>22CI  Operative time during growth phase—reduction where original interest is entitlement to associate deferred annuity

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  at the operative time, standard allowance or annuity is not payable in respect of the original interest; and

                     (b)  the original interest is an entitlement to an associate deferred annuity.

             (2)  The annual rate of that associate annuity (when it becomes payable) is reduced to the amount calculated under the Orders.

Note:          Although an associate immediate annuity becomes payable at the operative time, an associate deferred annuity will often not become payable until some time after the operative time.

##### <a id="22CJ"></a>22CJ  Operative time during payment phase—reduction of standard allowance or annuity

             (1)  If, at the operative time, standard allowance or annuity is payable in respect of the original interest, then the annual rate of that allowance or annuity is reduced to the amount calculated under the Orders.

             (2)  A reduction under subsection (1) is to be disregarded in calculating the amount of any non‑standard annuity that later becomes payable.

Note:          For example, the reduction will be disregarded in calculating the amount of annuity payable under section 19AA in respect of a child of the member spouse after the member spouse’s death.

### Division 4—Miscellaneous

                     (a)  started before the polling day for the transitional general election; and

                     (b)  ended at the time of the cessation that gave rise to the person’s entitlement to the retiring allowance.

Note:          Under section 18, a person’s entitlement to a retiring allowance arises because the person ceases to be entitled to parliamentary allowance.

                     (b)  was elected as a member of the Senate within 3 months after so ceasing to be a member of the House of Representatives;

then the person is taken to have been entitled to parliamentary allowance from the time the person so ceased to be a member of the House of Representatives until the time the person first became entitled to parliamentary allowance after being so elected as a member of the Senate.

             (5)  If the person:

                     (a)  resigned as a member of the Senate; and

                     (b)  was elected as a member of the House of Representatives within 3 months after the resignation;

then the person is taken to have been entitled to parliamentary allowance from the time the person resigned as a member of the Senate until the time the person was elected as a member of the House of Representatives.

then the Trust may make a written determination to that effect.

             (2)  An invalidity determination takes effect on the day it is made, or on an earlier day specified in the determination (not being earlier than the day on which the application was made).

             (3)  If the Trust makes a decision refusing to make an invalidity determination, the Trust must give the applicant a written notice of the refusal.

##### <a id="22DE"></a>22DE  Effect of invalidity determination

The day must not be earlier than the day on which the notice was given.

             (4)  If the deferring member:

                             (ii)  accommodation; or

                            (iii)  the purchase of food or drink; or

## Part VI—Miscellaneous

##### <a id="22T"></a>22T  Treatment of decreases in rates used to calculate retiring allowance

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  after 2 March 1996, the rate of any of the following payments (the **_underlying payment_**) is decreased:

                              (i)  parliamentary allowance payable to a member;

                             (ii)  salary payable to a Minister of State in respect of an office;

                            (iii)  allowance by way of salary payable to an office holder in respect of that office; and

                     (b)  at a time after the decrease, retiring allowance is payable to a person, or would have been payable to a person if he or she had not died, who was receiving the underlying payment at a time before the decrease;

this section applies for the purposes of calculating the rate of the retiring allowance after the decrease. The rate of the underlying payment immediately before the decrease is the **_preserved rate_**.

Note 1:       For the purposes of applying paragraph (b), it does not matter if the retiring allowance was or would also have been payable to the person before the decrease.

Note 2:       For the purposes of applying paragraph (b), the time when the person was receiving the underlying payment may be a time before or after 2 March 1996.

          (1A)  For the purpose of paragraph (1)(a), any reductions under Part 1 of Schedule 3 to the _Remuneration and Allowances Act 1990_ (about salary sacrifice) of a particular member’s entitlement to parliamentary allowance are to be disregarded.

             (2)  In calculating the rate of the retiring allowance, the rate of the underlying payment is to be taken to remain at the preserved rate until the actual rate of the payment increases to at least the preserved rate.

             (3)  If the actual rate of the underlying payment is further decreased before increasing to at least the preserved rate, this section does not apply separately in relation to that further decrease.

             (4)  If a decrease of a payment is expressed to have effect from a particular time before the taking of the decision to decrease the payment, this section applies as if the payment had actually been decreased at that earlier time.

             (5)  To avoid doubt, if:

                     (a)  a determination under subsection 7(1A) or (1B) of the _Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973_; and

                     (b)  a determination under subsection 7(1) of that Act;

take effect at the same time in relation to the same allowance referred to in subparagraph (1)(a)(i) or (iii) of this section, the net effect of the determinations is taken into account, for the purposes of this section, as a single alteration of the allowance.

             (6)  To avoid doubt, if:

                     (a)  a determination is made under subsection 7(2A) of the _Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973_; and

                     (b)  the determination states that it relates to an alteration in salary referred to in subparagraph (1)(a)(ii) of this section;

the net effect of the determination and the alteration is taken into account, for the purposes of this section, as a single alteration of the salary.

##### <a id="23"></a>23  Notional salaries etc. for certain offices

                   Where a person is entitled to additional retiring allowance under subsection 18(9) in respect of an office in respect of which a salary or an allowance by way of salary was not or is not being paid at any relevant time, whether for the reason that there was not or is not any such office at that time or for any other reason, then, for the purposes of this Act, salary or allowance by way of salary, as the case may be, shall be deemed to have been or to be paid in respect of that office at that time at such annual rate as the Minister determines by instrument in writing.

##### <a id="24"></a>24  Benefits not assignable

             (1)  Retiring allowances, annuities and other benefits under this Act shall be absolutely inalienable, whether by way of, or in consequence of, sale, assignment, charge, execution, bankruptcy, or otherwise howsoever.

             (2)  Subsection (1) has effect subject to subsection 24AA(4).

##### <a id="24AA"></a>24AA  Recoverable payments

             (1)  If, apart from this subsection, the Commonwealth does not have power under this Act to pay an amount (the **_relevant amount_**) to a person (the **_recipient_**) purportedly as a benefit, then the Commonwealth may pay the relevant amount to the recipient.

Recovery

             (2)  If a payment is made under subsection (1) to the recipient, the relevant amount:

                     (a)  is a debt due to the Commonwealth by the recipient; and

                     (b)  may be recovered by the Secretary of the Department, on behalf of the Commonwealth, in a court of competent jurisdiction.

Note:          See also section 47 of the _Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997_ (duty to pursue recovery of a debt).

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  a payment is made under subsection (1) to the recipient; and

                     (b)  the recipient is receiving, or is entitled to receive, a benefit;

then:

                     (c)  the relevant amount; or

                     (d)  such part of the relevant amount as the Secretary of the Department determines;

may, if the Secretary of the Department so directs, be recovered by deduction from that benefit.

Note:          See also section 47 of the _Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997_ (duty to pursue recovery of a debt).

Benefit

             (4)  For the purposes of this section, **_benefit_** means a retiring allowance, annuity or other benefit under this Act.

                     (a)  the relevant amount is deposited to an account kept in the name of a deceased person;

                     (b)  the relevant amount is deposited to an account kept in the names of a deceased person and another person;

                     (c)  the relevant amount is paid by way of a cheque made out to a deceased person;

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Entitlement to a retiring allowance at a preserved percentage

             (4)  The **_preserved additional percentage_** for a relevant office is, from the end of a new scheme contribution period of the person to the start of the next (if any) new scheme contribution period of the person, the percentage that was applied to:

             (6)  Nothing in this clause entitles the person to additional retiring allowance at a rate that exceeds:

                     (a)  if the person is entitled to additional retiring allowance in respect of one relevant office only—75% of the rate, for the time being, at which salary or allowance by way of salary, as the case may be, is payable in respect of that office; or

                     (b)  if a person is entitled to additional retiring allowance in respect of 2 or more relevant offices—75% of the rate that is the highest rate, for the time being, at which salary or allowance by way of salary, as the case may be, is payable in respect of either or any of those offices.

             (3)  Subject to Division 1 and this Division, this Act applies in relation to additional retiring allowance (the **_preserved additional allowance_**) to which the person is entitled under clause 5 in the same way as it applies in relation to an additional retiring allowance under subsection 18(9).
