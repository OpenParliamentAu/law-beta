                              (i)  the name of a prescribed depositary institution from which samples of the micro‑organism are obtainable as provided by the rules relating to micro‑organisms; and

                            (iii)  the file, accession or registration number of the deposit given by the institution; and

                     (d)  at all times since the date of filing of the specification, samples of the micro‑organism have been obtainable from a prescribed depositary institution as provided by those rules.

[_Note: see sections 41 and 42_]

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Novelty and inventive step

Novelty

             (1)  For the purposes of this Act, an invention is to be taken to be novel when compared with the prior art base unless it is not novel in the light of any one of the following kinds of information, each of which must be considered separately:

                     (a)  prior art information (other than that mentioned in paragraph (c)) made publicly available in a single document or through doing a single act;

                     (b)  prior art information (other than that mentioned in paragraph (c)) made publicly available in 2 or more related documents, or through doing 2 or more related acts, if the relationship between the documents or acts is such that a person skilled in the relevant art would treat them as a single source of that information;

                     (c)  prior art information contained in a single specification of the kind mentioned in subparagraph (b)(ii) of the definition of **_prior art base_** in Schedule 1.

Inventive step

             (2)  For the purposes of this Act, an invention is to be taken to involve an inventive step when compared with the prior art base unless the invention would have been obvious to a person skilled in the relevant art in the light of the common general knowledge as it existed in the patent area before the priority date of the relevant claim, whether that knowledge is considered separately or together with the information mentioned in subsection (3).

             (3)  The information for the purposes of subsection (2) is:

                     (a)  any single piece of prior art information; or

                     (b)  a combination of any 2 or more pieces of prior art information;

being information that the skilled person mentioned in subsection (2) could, before the priority date of the relevant claim, be reasonably expected to have ascertained, understood, regarded as relevant and, in the case of information mentioned in paragraph (b), combined as mentioned in that paragraph.

Innovative step

             (4)  For the purposes of this Act, an invention is to be taken to involve an innovative step when compared with the prior art base unless the invention would _,_ to a person skilled in the relevant art, in the light of the common general knowledge as it existed in the patent area before the priority date of the relevant claim, only vary from the kinds of information set out in subsection (5) in ways that make no substantial contribution to the working of the invention.

             (5)  For the purposes of subsection (4), the information is of the following kinds:

                     (a)  prior art information made publicly available in a single document or through doing a single act;

                     (b)  prior art information made publicly available in 2 or more related documents, or through doing 2 or more related acts, if the relationship between the documents or acts is such that a person skilled in the relevant art would treat them as a single source of that information.

             (6)  For the purposes of subsection (4), each kind of information set out in subsection (5) must be considered separately.

[_Notes:   (1)   For the meaning of document see section 2B of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901._

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Disclosure in basic applications

                   Subject to the regulations, account must not be taken, for the purposes of this Act, of a disclosure in a specification or other document filed in respect of, and at the same time as, a basic application unless the following documents are filed within the prescribed period:

                     (a)  a copy of the specification or document;

                     (b)  if the specification or document is not in English—a translation of the specification or document into English.

[_Note: basic application is defined in Schedule 1: see also Part 2 of Chapter 8_.]

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Secret use

                   For the purposes of this Act, the following acts are not to be taken to be secret use of an invention in the patent area:

                     (a)  any use of the invention by or on behalf of, or with the authority of, the patentee or nominated person, or his or her predecessor in title to the invention, for the purpose of reasonable trial or experiment only;

                     (b)  any use of the invention by or on behalf of, or with the authority of, the patentee or nominated person, or his or her predecessor in title to the invention, being use occurring solely in the course of a confidential disclosure of the invention by or on behalf of, or with the authority of, the patentee, nominated person, or predecessor in title;

                     (c)  any other use of the invention by or on behalf of, or with the authority of, the patentee or nominated person, or his or her predecessor in title to the invention, for any purpose other than the purpose of trade or commerce;

                     (d)  any use of the invention by or on behalf of the Commonwealth, a State, or a Territory where the patentee or nominated person, or his or her predecessor in title to the invention, has disclosed the invention, so far as claimed, to the Commonwealth, State or Territory.

[_Note: See also paragraph 18(1)(d)_]

##### <a id="10"></a>10  Certain international applications to be taken to have been given an international filing date

             (1)  Where:

                     (a)  an international application specifies Australia as a designated State under Article 4(1)(ii) of the PCT; and

                     (b)  the receiving Office does not give the application an international filing date; and

                     (c)  the Commissioner is satisfied that the application should, under Article 25(2)(a) of the PCT, be treated as if it had been given an international filing date;

the application is to be taken, for the purposes of this Act, to have been given an international filing date under Article 11 of the PCT.

             (2)  This section does not apply to an international application that was not filed in the receiving Office in English unless a translation of the application into English, verified in accordance with the regulations, has been filed.

             (3)  Where this section applies, the international filing date of the application is to be taken to be the date that, in the opinion of the Commissioner, should have been given to the application as its international filing date under the PCT.

[_Note: international filing date is defined in Schedule 1: see also Chapter 8_.]

##### <a id="11"></a>11  Act binds the Crown

examine the complete specification relating to an innovation patent.

##### <a id="101B"></a>101B  Examination of an innovation patent

What the Commissioner must do in examining a patent

             (1)  If the Commissioner examines an innovation patent under section 101A, the Commissioner must:

                     (a)  examine the complete specification relating to the patent to determine if the patent is invalid and should be revoked because a ground set out in subsection (2), (4), (5), (6) or (7) is made out; and

                     (b)  report on the grounds set out in those subsections.

These are the only grounds for revocation under this section.

Grounds for revocation relating to validity

             (2)  The grounds for revocation under subsection (1) include the following:

                     (a)  that the specification does not comply with section 40;

                     (b)  that the invention, so far as claimed, does not comply with paragraph 18(1A)(a) or (b);

                     (c)  that the invention is not a patentable invention under subsection 18(2) or (3);

                     (d)  that the use of the invention would be contrary to law.

             (3)  For the purposes of working out whether the invention does not comply with paragraph 18(1A)(b), the prior art base (referred to in that paragraph) is to be taken not to include information made publicly available only through the doing of an act (whether in or out of the patent area).

Revocation on ground that invention claims a substance capable of being used as food or medicine etc.

             (4)  A further ground for revocation is that the patent claims as an invention:

                     (a)  a substance that is capable of being used as food or medicine (whether for human beings or animals and whether for internal or external use) and is a mere mixture of known ingredients; or

                     (b)  a process producing such a substance by mere admixture.

Revocation on ground that patent includes a name

             (5)  A further ground for revocation is that the patent contains a claim that includes the name of a person as the name, or part of the name, of the invention so far as it is claimed in that claim.

Revocation on grounds of multiple patents for one invention

             (6)  A further ground for revocation is that:

                     (a)  the innovation patent claims an invention that is the same as an invention that is the subject of a patent and is made by the same inventor; and

                     (b)  the relevant claim or claims in respect of each patent  have the same priority date or dates.

Revocation for grounds set out in the regulations

             (7)  A further ground for revocation is that the complete specification does not comply with such other matters (if any) as are prescribed.

##### <a id="101C"></a>101C  How and when examination to be carried out

                   The examination under section 101B must be carried out:

                              (i)  a ground for the revocation of the patent (other than a ground in respect of paragraph 18(1A)(b)) has not been made out; or

                             (ii)  any such ground has been removed; and

                     (b)  had abandoned (except temporarily) the steps to exploit the product, method or process in the patent area.

Limit for product, method or process derived from patentee

             (3)  Subsection (1) does not apply to a product, method or process the person derived from the patentee or the patentee’s predecessor in title in the patented invention unless the person derived the product, method or process from information that was made publicly available:

                     (b)  through any publication or use of the invention in the prescribed circumstances mentioned in paragraph 24(1)(a).

Exemption for successors in title

             (4)  A person (the **_disposer_**) may dispose of the whole of the disposer’s entitlement under subsection (1) to do an act without infringing a patent to another person (the **_recipient_**). If the disposer does so, this section applies in relation to the recipient as if the references in subsections (1), (2) and (3) to the person were references to:

                     (a)  the disposer; or

                     (b)  if the disposer’s entitlement arose because of one or more previous applications of this subsection—the first person:

                              (i)  who was entitled under subsection (1) (applying of its own force) to do an act without infringing the patent; and

                             (ii)  to whom the disposer’s entitlement is directly or indirectly attributable.
