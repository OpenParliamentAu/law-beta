                            (iii)  the file, accession or registration number of the deposit given by the institution; and

                     (d)  at all times since the date of filing of the specification, samples of the micro‑organism have been obtainable from a prescribed depositary institution as provided by those rules.

[_Note: see sections 41 and 42_]

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Novelty and inventive step

Novelty

             (1)  For the purposes of this Act, an invention is to be taken to be novel when compared with the prior art base unless it is not novel in the light of any one of the following kinds of information, each of which must be considered separately:

                     (a)  prior art information (other than that mentioned in paragraph (c)) made publicly available in a single document or through doing a single act;

                     (b)  prior art information (other than that mentioned in paragraph (c)) made publicly available in 2 or more related documents, or through doing 2 or more related acts, if the relationship between the documents or acts is such that a person skilled in the relevant art would treat them as a single source of that information;

                     (c)  prior art information contained in a single specification of the kind mentioned in subparagraph (b)(ii) of the definition of **_prior art base_** in Schedule 1.

Inventive step

             (2)  For the purposes of this Act, an invention is to be taken to involve an inventive step when compared with the prior art base unless the invention would have been obvious to a person skilled in the relevant art in the light of the common general knowledge as it existed in the patent area before the priority date of the relevant claim, whether that knowledge is considered separately or together with the information mentioned in subsection (3).

             (3)  The information for the purposes of subsection (2) is:

                     (a)  any single piece of prior art information; or

                     (b)  a combination of any 2 or more pieces of prior art information;

being information that the skilled person mentioned in subsection (2) could, before the priority date of the relevant claim, be reasonably expected to have ascertained, understood, regarded as relevant and, in the case of information mentioned in paragraph (b), combined as mentioned in that paragraph.

Innovative step

             (4)  For the purposes of this Act, an invention is to be taken to involve an innovative step when compared with the prior art base unless the invention would _,_ to a person skilled in the relevant art, in the light of the common general knowledge as it existed in the patent area before the priority date of the relevant claim, only vary from the kinds of information set out in subsection (5) in ways that make no substantial contribution to the working of the invention.

             (5)  For the purposes of subsection (4), the information is of the following kinds:

                     (a)  prior art information made publicly available in a single document or through doing a single act;

                     (b)  prior art information made publicly available in 2 or more related documents, or through doing 2 or more related acts, if the relationship between the documents or acts is such that a person skilled in the relevant art would treat them as a single source of that information.

             (6)  For the purposes of subsection (4), each kind of information set out in subsection (5) must be considered separately.

[_Notes:   (1)   For the meaning of document see section 2B of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901._

_(2)   See also the definitions of prior art base and prior art information in Schedule 1: see also paragraph 18(1)(b) and subsection 98(1)._]

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Disclosure in basic applications

                   Subject to the regulations, account must not be taken, for the purposes of this Act, of a disclosure in a specification or other document filed in respect of, and at the same time as, a basic application unless the following documents are filed within the prescribed period:

                     (a)  a copy of the specification or document;

                     (b)  if the specification or document is not in English—a translation of the specification or document into English.

[_Note: basic application is defined in Schedule 1: see also Part 2 of Chapter 8_.]

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Secret use

                   For the purposes of this Act, the following acts are not to be taken to be secret use of an invention in the patent area:

                     (a)  any use of the invention by or on behalf of, or with the authority of, the patentee or nominated person, or his or her predecessor in title to the invention, for the purpose of reasonable trial or experiment only;

                     (b)  any use of the invention by or on behalf of, or with the authority of, the patentee or nominated person, or his or her predecessor in title to the invention, being use occurring solely in the course of a confidential disclosure of the invention by or on behalf of, or with the authority of, the patentee, nominated person, or predecessor in title;

                     (c)  any other use of the invention by or on behalf of, or with the authority of, the patentee or nominated person, or his or her predecessor in title to the invention, for any purpose other than the purpose of trade or commerce;

                     (d)  any use of the invention by or on behalf of the Commonwealth, a State, or a Territory where the patentee or nominated person, or his or her predecessor in title to the invention, has disclosed the invention, so far as claimed, to the Commonwealth, State or Territory.

[_Note: See also paragraph 18(1)(d)_]

##### <a id="10"></a>10  Certain international applications to be taken to have been given an international filing date

             (1)  Where:

                     (a)  an international application specifies Australia as a designated State under Article 4(1)(ii) of the PCT; and

                     (b)  the receiving Office does not give the application an international filing date; and

                     (c)  the Commissioner is satisfied that the application should, under Article 25(2)(a) of the PCT, be treated as if it had been given an international filing date;

# Chapter 9A—Examination, re‑examination and opposition‑innovation patents

## Part 1—Examination of innovation patents

##### <a id="101A"></a>101A  Examination may be requested or Commissioner may decide to examine

                   After the grant of an innovation patent, the Commissioner:

                     (a)  may, if the Commissioner decides to do so; and

                     (b)  must, if asked to do so, in writing, by the patentee or any other person;

examine the complete specification relating to an innovation patent.

##### <a id="101B"></a>101B  Examination of an innovation patent

What the Commissioner must do in examining a patent

             (1)  If the Commissioner examines an innovation patent under section 101A, the Commissioner must:

                     (a)  examine the complete specification relating to the patent to determine if the patent is invalid and should be revoked because a ground set out in subsection (2), (4), (5), (6) or (7) is made out; and

                     (b)  report on the grounds set out in those subsections.

These are the only grounds for revocation under this section.

Grounds for revocation relating to validity

             (2)  The grounds for revocation under subsection (1) include the following:

                     (a)  that the specification does not comply with section 40;

                     (b)  that the invention, so far as claimed, does not comply with paragraph 18(1A)(a) or (b);

                     (c)  that the invention is not a patentable invention under subsection 18(2) or (3);

                     (d)  that the use of the invention would be contrary to law.

             (3)  For the purposes of working out whether the invention does not comply with paragraph 18(1A)(b), the prior art base (referred to in that paragraph) is to be taken not to include information made publicly available only through the doing of an act (whether in or out of the patent area).

Revocation on ground that invention claims a substance capable of being used as food or medicine etc.

             (4)  A further ground for revocation is that the patent claims as an invention:

                     (a)  a substance that is capable of being used as food or medicine (whether for human beings or animals and whether for internal or external use) and is a mere mixture of known ingredients; or

                     (b)  a process producing such a substance by mere admixture.

Revocation on ground that patent includes a name

             (5)  A further ground for revocation is that the patent contains a claim that includes the name of a person as the name, or part of the name, of the invention so far as it is claimed in that claim.

Revocation on grounds of multiple patents for one invention

             (6)  A further ground for revocation is that:

                     (a)  the innovation patent claims an invention that is the same as an invention that is the subject of a patent and is made by the same inventor; and

                     (b)  the relevant claim or claims in respect of each patent  have the same priority date or dates.

Revocation for grounds set out in the regulations

             (7)  A further ground for revocation is that the complete specification does not comply with such other matters (if any) as are prescribed.

##### <a id="101C"></a>101C  How and when examination to be carried out

                   The examination under section 101B must be carried out:

                     (a)  any documentary searches by, or on behalf of, a foreign patent office, other than searches prescribed by the regulations;

                     (b)  the documentary searches prescribed by the regulations.

             (2)  Subsection (1) only applies to searches completed before the issue of a certificate of examination in respect of the patent.

             (3)  In subsection (2):

                    <a name="complet"></a>**_completed_**, in relation to a search, has the meaning prescribed by the regulations.

##### <a id="101E"></a>101E  Certificate of examination

                   If:

                     (a)  after examining a patent under section 101B, the Commissioner decides in writing that he or she is satisfied that the invention, so far as claimed, complies with paragraph 18(1A)(b); and

                    (aa)  after so examining the patent, the Commissioner also decides in writing that he or she considers that:

                              (i)  a ground for the revocation of the patent (other than a ground in respect of paragraph 18(1A)(b)) has not been made out; or

                             (ii)  any such ground has been removed; and

                     (b)  the patent has not ceased under section 143A;

the Commissioner must:

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  the Commissioner considers that, after examining a patent under section 101B, a ground for the revocation of a patent has been made out and that the ground has not been removed; and

                     (b)  the patent has not ceased under section 143A;

the Commissioner must revoke the patent.

                     (b)  by using the patented invention in the construction or working of a foreign aircraft or foreign land vehicle, or in the accessories of the aircraft or vehicle, if the aircraft or vehicle comes into the patent area only temporarily or accidentally.

##### <a id="119"></a>119  Infringement exemptions: prior use

             (1)  A person may, without infringing a patent, do an act that exploits a product, method or process and would infringe the patent apart from this subsection, if immediately before the priority date of the relevant claim the person:

                     (a)  was exploiting the product, method or process in the patent area; or

                     (b)  had taken definite steps (contractually or otherwise) to exploit the product, method or process in the patent area.

Note 1:       This section applies in relation to a patent granted as a result of an application filed on or after the commencement of Schedule 6 to the _Intellectual Property Laws Amendment Act 2006_ (which repealed and substituted this section).

Note 2:       Section 119 of this Act as in force before the commencement of that Schedule continues to apply in relation to patents granted as a result of earlier applications.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply if, before the priority date, the person:

                     (a)  had stopped (except temporarily) exploiting the product, method or process in the patent area; or

                     (b)  had abandoned (except temporarily) the steps to exploit the product, method or process in the patent area.

Limit for product, method or process derived from patentee

             (3)  Subsection (1) does not apply to a product, method or process the person derived from the patentee or the patentee’s predecessor in title in the patented invention unless the person derived the product, method or process from information that was made publicly available:

                     (a)  by or with the consent of the patentee or the patentee’s predecessor in title; and

                     (b)  through any publication or use of the invention in the prescribed circumstances mentioned in paragraph 24(1)(a).

Exemption for successors in title

             (4)  A person (the **_disposer_**) may dispose of the whole of the disposer’s entitlement under subsection (1) to do an act without infringing a patent to another person (the **_recipient_**). If the disposer does so, this section applies in relation to the recipient as if the references in subsections (1), (2) and (3) to the person were references to:

                     (a)  the disposer; or

                     (b)  if the disposer’s entitlement arose because of one or more previous applications of this subsection—the first person:

                              (i)  who was entitled under subsection (1) (applying of its own force) to do an act without infringing the patent; and

                             (ii)  to whom the disposer’s entitlement is directly or indirectly attributable.

Definition

             (5)  In this section:

                    <a name="exploit"></a>**_exploit_** includes:

                     (a)  in relation to a product:

                              (i)  make, hire, sell or otherwise dispose of the product; and

                             (ii)  offer to make, hire, sell or otherwise dispose of the product; and

                            (iii)  use or import the product; and

                            (iv)  keep the product for the purpose of doing an act described in subparagraph (i), (ii) or (iii); and

                     (b)  in relation to a method or process:

                              (i)  use the method or process; and

                             (ii)  do an act described in subparagraph (a)(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) with a product resulting from the use of the method or process.

##### <a id="119A"></a>119A  Infringement exemptions: acts for obtaining regulatory approval of pharmaceuticals

             (1)  The rights of a patentee of a pharmaceutical patent are not infringed by a person exploiting an invention claimed in the patent if the exploitation is solely for:

                     (a)  purposes connected with obtaining the inclusion in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods of goods that:

                              (i)  are intended for therapeutic use; and

                             (ii)  are not medical devices, or therapeutic devices, as defined in the _Therapeutic Goods Act 1989_; or

                     (b)  purposes connected with obtaining similar regulatory approval under a law of a foreign country or of a part of a foreign country.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply to the export from Australia of goods for purposes described in paragraph (1)(b) unless the term of the patent has been extended under Part 3 of Chapter 6 and the goods consist of or contain:

                     (a)  a pharmaceutical substance _per se_ that is in substance disclosed in the complete specification of the patent and in substance falls within the scope of the claim or claims of that specification; or

                     (b)  a pharmaceutical substance when produced by a process that involves the use of recombinant DNA technology, that is in substance disclosed in the complete specification of the patent and in substance falls within the scope of the claim or claims of that specification.

Note:          Part 3 of Chapter 6 provides for the extension of the term of standard patents claiming pharmaceutical substances.

             (3)  In this section:

                    <a name="pharmaceut-patent"></a>**_pharmaceutical patent_** means a patent claiming:

                     (a)  a pharmaceutical substance; or

                     (b)  a method, use or product relating to a pharmaceutical substance, including any of the following:

                              (i)  a method for producing a raw material needed to produce the substance;

                             (ii)  a product that is a raw material needed to produce the substance;

                            (iii)  a product that is a pro‑drug, metabolite or derivative of the substance.

##### <a id="120"></a>120  Infringement proceedings

             (1)  Subject to subsection (1A), infringement proceedings may be started in a prescribed court, or in another court having jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter, by the patentee or an exclusive licensee.

          (1A)  Infringement proceedings in respect of an innovation patent cannot be started unless the patent has been certified.

             (2)  If an exclusive licensee starts infringement proceedings, the patentee must be joined as a defendant unless joined as a plaintiff.

             (3)  A patentee joined as a defendant is not liable for costs unless the patentee enters an appearance and takes part in the proceedings.

             (4)  Infringement proceedings must be started within:

                     (a)  3 years from the day on which the relevant patent is granted; or

                     (b)  6 years from the day on which the infringing act was done;

whichever period ends later.

##### <a id="121"></a>121  Counter‑claim for revocation of patent

             (1)  A defendant in infringement proceedings may apply by way of counter‑claim in the proceedings for the revocation of the patent.

             (2)  The provisions of this Act relating to proceedings for the revocation of a patent apply, with the necessary changes, to a counter‑claim.

##### <a id="121A"></a>121A  Burden of proof—infringement of patent for a process

             (1)  This section applies only to a patent for a process for obtaining a product.

             (2)  If, in proceedings for infringement of a patent started by the patentee or the exclusive licensee:

                     (a)  the defendant alleges that he or she has used a process different from the patented process to obtain a product (**_defendant’s product_**) identical to the product obtained by the patented process; and

                     (b)  the court is satisfied that:

                              (i)  it is very likely that the defendant’s product was made by the patented process; and

                             (ii)  the patentee or exclusive licensee has taken reasonable steps to find out the process actually used by the defendant but has not been able to do so;

                            then, in the absence of proof to the contrary the onus for which is on the defendant, the defendant’s product is to be taken to have been obtained by the patented process.

             (3)  In deciding how the defendant is to adduce evidence for the purposes of subsection (2), the court is to take into account the defendant’s legitimate interests in having business and manufacturing secrets protected.

##### <a id="122"></a>122  Relief for infringement of patent

             (1)  The relief which a court may grant for infringement of a patent includes an injunction (subject to such terms, if any, as the court thinks fit) and, at the option of the plaintiff, either damages or an account of profits.

          (1A)  A court may include an additional amount in an assessment of damages for an infringement of a patent, if the court considers it appropriate to do so having regard to:

                     (a)  the flagrancy of the infringement; and

                     (b)  the need to deter similar infringements of patents; and

                     (c)  the conduct of the party that infringed the patent that occurred:

                              (i)  after the act constituting the infringement; or

                             (ii)  after that party was informed that it had allegedly infringed the patent; and

                     (d)  any benefit shown to have accrued to that party because of the infringement; and

                     (e)  all other relevant matters.

             (2)  On the application of either party, the court may make such order for the inspection of any thing in or on any vehicle, vessel, aircraft or premises, and may impose such terms and give such directions about the inspection, as the court thinks fit.

##### <a id="123"></a>123  Innocent infringement

             (1)  A court may refuse to award damages, or to make an order for an account of profits, in respect of an infringement of a patent if the defendant satisfies the court that, at the date of the infringement, the defendant was not aware, and had no reason to believe, that a patent for the invention existed.

             (2)  If patented products, marked so as to indicate that they are patented in Australia, were sold or used in the patent area to a substantial extent before the date of the infringement, the defendant is to be taken to have been aware of the existence of the patent unless the contrary is established.

             (3)  Nothing in this section affects a court’s power to grant relief by way of an injunction.

## Part 2—Non‑infringement declarations

##### <a id="124"></a>124  Interpretation

                   In this Part:

                    <a name="patente"></a>**_patentee_** includes an exclusive licensee.

##### <a id="125"></a>125  Application for non‑infringement declaration

             (1)  A person who wishes to exploit an invention may apply to a prescribed court for a declaration that the exploitation of the invention would not infringe a claim of a particular complete specification.

             (2)  An application may be made:

                     (a)  at any time after the complete specification has become open to public inspection; and

                     (b)  whether or not the nominated person or patentee has made any assertion to the effect that the exploitation of the invention would infringe the claim.

             (3)  The nominated person or patentee must be joined as a respondent in the proceedings.

##### <a id="126"></a>126  Proceedings for non‑infringement declarations

             (1)  A prescribed court must not make a non‑infringement declaration unless a patent has been granted in respect of the relevant invention and:

                     (a)  the applicant for the declaration:

                              (i)  has asked the nominated person or patentee in writing for a written admission that the proposed exploitation would not infringe a claim of the complete specification; and

                             (ii)  has given the nominated person or patentee full written particulars of the proposed exploitation; and

                            (iii)  has undertaken to pay a reasonable sum for the nominated person’s or patentee’s expenses in obtaining advice about whether the proposed exploitation would infringe the claim; and

                     (b)  the nominated person or patentee has refused or failed to make the admission; and 

                     (c)  if the patent is an innovation patent—the patent has been certified.

             (2)  The validity of a claim cannot be questioned in proceedings for a non‑infringement declaration.

             (3)  The costs of all parties in proceedings for a non‑infringement declaration must be paid by the applicant for the declaration unless the court otherwise orders.

##### <a id="127"></a>127  Effect of non‑infringement declarations

                   If:

                     (a)  a nominated person or patentee has given a person a written admission that the exploitation of an invention would not infringe a claim, or a prescribed court has made a non‑infringement declaration in respect of an invention; and

                     (b)  the patentee later gets an injunction restraining the person from exploiting the invention as specified in the admission, or the declaration is revoked;

the person is not liable:

                     (c)  to account to the patentee for any profits, made by the person before the date on which the injunction was granted or the declaration was revoked, from the exploitation of the invention as specified in the admission or declaration; or

                     (d)  to pay damages for any loss suffered by the patentee before that date as a result of that exploitation.

## Part 3—Unjustified threats of infringement proceedings

##### <a id="128"></a>128  Application for relief from unjustified threats

             (1)  Where a person, by means of circulars, advertisements or otherwise, threatens a person with infringement proceedings, or other similar proceedings, a person aggrieved may apply to a prescribed court, or to another court having jurisdiction to hear and determine the application, for:

                     (a)  a declaration that the threats are unjustifiable; and

                     (b)  an injunction against the continuance of the threats; and

                     (c)  the recovery of any damages sustained by the applicant as a result of the threats.

             (2)  Subsection (1) applies whether or not the person who made the threats is entitled to, or interested in, the patent or a patent application.

##### <a id="129"></a>129  Court’s power to grant relief if threats related to a standard patent or standard patent application

                   If an application under section 128 for relief relates to threats made in respect of a standard patent or an application for a standard patent, the court may grant the applicant the relief applied for unless the respondent satisfies the court that the acts about which the threats were made infringed, or would infringe:

                     (a)  a claim that is not shown by the applicant to be invalid; or

                     (b)  rights under section 57 in respect of a claim that is not shown by the applicant to be a claim that would be invalid if the patent had been granted.

##### <a id="129A"></a>129A  Threats related to an innovation patent application or innovation patent and court’s power to grant relief

Certain threats of infringement proceedings are always unjustifiable

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a person:

                              (i)  has applied for an innovation patent, but the application has not been determined; or

                             (ii)  has an innovation patent that has not been certified; and

                     (b)  the person, by means of circulars, advertisements or otherwise, threatens a person with infringement proceedings or other similar proceedings in respect of the patent applied for, or the patent, as the case may be;

then, for the purposes of an application for relief under section 128 by the person threatened, the threats are unjustifiable.

Courts power to grant relief in respect of threats made by the applicant for an innovation patent or the patentee of an uncertified innovation patent

             (2)  If an application under section 128 for relief relates to threats made in respect of an innovation patent that has not been certified or an application for an innovation patent, the court may grant the applicant the relief applied for.

Courts power to grant relief in respect of threats made by the patentee of a certified innovation patent

             (3)  If an application under section 128 for relief relates to threats made in respect of a certified innovation patent, the court may grant the applicant the relief applied for unless the respondent satisfies the court that the acts about which the threats were made infringed, or would infringe, a claim that is not shown by the applicant to be invalid.

##### <a id="130"></a>130  Counter‑claim for infringement

             (1)  The respondent in proceedings under section 128 may apply, by way of counter‑claim, for relief to which the respondent would be entitled in separate proceedings for an infringement by the applicant of the patent to which the threats relate.

             (2)  Where the respondent applies by way of counter‑claim, the applicant may, without making a separate application under Chapter 12, apply in the proceedings for the revocation of the patent.

             (3)  The provisions of this Act relating to infringement proceedings apply, with the necessary changes, to a counter‑claim.

Note:          Infringement proceedings cannot be commenced in respect of an innovation patent unless the patent has first been certified (see subsection 120(1A)).

             (4)  The provisions of this Act relating to proceedings under section 138 for the revocation of a patent apply, with the necessary changes, to an application under subsection (2).

Note:          Revocation proceedings under section 138 cannot be commenced in respect of an innovation patent unless the patent has first been certified (see subsection 138(1A))_._

##### <a id="131"></a>131  Notification of patent not a threat

                   The mere notification of the existence of a patent, or an application for a patent, does not constitute a threat of proceedings for the purposes of section 128.

##### <a id="132"></a>132  Liability of legal practitioner or patent attorney

                   A legal practitioner or a registered patent attorney is not liable to proceedings under section 128 in respect of an act done in his or her professional capacity on behalf of a client.

# Chapter 12—Compulsory licences and revocation of patents

##### <a id="133"></a>133  Compulsory licences

             (1)  Subject to subsection (1A), a person may apply to the Federal Court, after the end of the prescribed period, for an order requiring the patentee to grant the applicant a licence to work the patented invention.

          (1A)  A person cannot apply for an order in respect of an innovation patent unless the patent has been certified.

             (2)  After hearing the application, the court may, subject to this section, make the order if satisfied that:

                     (a)  all the following conditions exist:

                              (i)  the applicant has tried for a reasonable period, but without success, to obtain from the patentee an authorisation to work the invention on reasonable terms and conditions;

                             (ii)  the reasonable requirements of the public with respect to the patented invention have not been satisfied;

                            (iii)  the patentee has given no satisfactory reason for failing to exploit the patent; or

                     (b)  the patentee has contravened, or is contravening, Part IV of the _Competition and Consumer Act 2010_ or an application law (as defined in section 150A of that Act) in connection with the patent.

             (3)  An order must direct that the licence:

                     (a)  is not to give the licensee, or a person authorised by the licensee, the exclusive right to work the patented invention; and

                     (b)  is to be assignable only in connection with an enterprise or goodwill in connection with which the licence is used;

and may direct that the licence is to be granted on any other terms specified in the order.

          (3B)  If the patented invention cannot be worked by the applicant without his or her infringing another patent:

                     (a)  the court is to make the order only if the court is further satisfied that the patented invention involves an important technical advance of considerable economic significance on the invention (**_other invention_**) to which the other patent relates; and

                     (b)  the court must further order that the patentee of the other invention:

                              (i)  must grant to the applicant a licence to work the other invention insofar as is necessary to work the patented invention; and

                             (ii)  is to be granted, if he or she so requires, a cross‑licence on reasonable terms to work the patented invention; and

                     (c)  the court must direct that the licence granted by the patentee of the other invention may be assigned by the applicant:

                              (i)  only if he or she assigns the licence granted in respect of the patented invention; and

                             (ii)  only to the assignee of that licence.

             (4)  An order operates, without prejudice to any other method of enforcement, as if it were embodied in a deed granting a licence and executed by the patentee and all other necessary parties.

             (5)  The patentee is to be paid in respect of a licence granted to the applicant under an order:

                     (a)  such amount as is agreed between the patentee and the applicant; or

                     (b)  if paragraph (a) does not apply—such amount as is determined by the Federal Court to be just and reasonable having regard to the economic value of the licence and the desirability of discouraging contraventions of Part IV of the _Competition and Consumer Act 2010_ or an application law (as defined in section 150A of that Act).

             (6)  The patentee or the Federal Court may revoke the licence if:

                     (a)  the patentee and the licensee are agreed, or the court on application made by either party finds, that the circumstances that justified the grant of the licence have ceased to exist and are unlikely to recur; and

                     (b)  the legitimate interests of the licensee are not likely to be adversely affected by the revocation.

##### <a id="134"></a>134  Revocation of patent after grant of compulsory licence

             (1)  Where a compulsory licence relating to a patent is granted, an interested person may apply to the Federal Court, after the end of the prescribed period, for an order revoking the patent.

             (2)  After hearing the application, the court may make the order if satisfied that:

                     (a)  both:

                              (i)  the reasonable requirements of the public with respect to the patented invention have not been satisfied; and

                             (ii)  the patentee has given no satisfactory reason for failing to exploit the patent; or

                     (b)  the patentee is contravening Part IV of the _Competition and Consumer Act 2010_ or an application law (as defined in section 150A of that Act) in connection with the patent.

##### <a id="135"></a>135  Reasonable requirements of the public

             (1)  For the purposes of sections 133 and 134, the reasonable requirements of the public with respect to a patented invention are to be taken not to have been satisfied if:

                     (a)  an existing trade or industry in Australia, or the establishment of a new trade or industry in Australia, is unfairly prejudiced, or the demand in Australia for the patented product, or for a product resulting from the patented process, is not reasonably met, because of the patentee’s failure:

                              (i)  to manufacture the patented product to an adequate extent, and supply it on reasonable terms; or

                             (ii)  to manufacture, to an adequate extent, a part of the patented product that is necessary for the efficient working of the product, and supply the part on reasonable terms; or

                            (iii)  to carry on the patented process to a reasonable extent; or

                            (iv)  to grant licences on reasonable terms; or

                     (b)  a trade or industry in Australia is unfairly prejudiced by the conditions attached by the patentee (whether before or after the commencing day) to the purchase, hire or use of the patented product, the use or working of the patented process; or

                     (c)  if the patented invention is not being worked in Australia on a commercial scale, but is capable of being worked in Australia.

             (2)  If, where paragraph (1)(c) applies, the court is satisfied that the time that has elapsed since the patent was sealed has, because of the nature of the invention or some other cause, been insufficient to enable the invention to be worked in Australia on a commercial scale, the court may adjourn the hearing of the application for the period that the court thinks sufficient for that purpose.

##### <a id="136"></a>136  Orders to be consistent with international agreements

                   An order must not be made under section 133 or 134 that is inconsistent with a treaty between the Commonwealth and a foreign country.

##### <a id="136A"></a>136A  Dealing with allegation of contravention of application law

                   Proceedings under section 133 or 134 involving an allegation of contravention of an application law that is a law of a State must be dealt with as if the law were a law of the Commonwealth.

Note:          Those proceedings are in the Federal Court, which can only exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth. This section lets the court deal comprehensively with the proceedings without the need for a court of the State to determine whether the application law has been contravened.

##### <a id="137"></a>137  Revocation on surrender of patent

             (1)  A patentee may, at any time, by written notice to the Commissioner, offer to surrender the patent.

             (2)  The Commissioner must give notice of an offer in accordance with the regulations.

             (3)  After hearing all interested persons who notify the Commissioner in accordance with the regulations of their wish to be heard, the Commissioner may accept the offer and revoke the patent.

             (4)  Where relevant proceedings in relation to a patent are pending, the Commissioner must not accept an offer to surrender the patent without either the leave of the court or the consent of the parties to the proceedings.

             (5)  Where a compulsory licence is in force in relation to a patent, the Commissioner must not accept an offer to surrender the patent.

##### <a id="138"></a>138  Revocation of patents in other circumstances

             (1)  Subject to subsection (1A), the Minister or any other person may apply to a prescribed court for an order revoking a patent.

          (1A)  A person cannot apply for an order in respect of an innovation patent unless the patent has been certified.

             (2)  At the hearing of the application, the respondent is entitled to begin and give evidence in support of the patent and, if the applicant gives evidence disputing the validity of the patent, the respondent is entitled to reply.

             (3)  After hearing the application, the court may, by order, revoke the patent, either wholly or so far as it relates to a claim, on one or more of the following grounds, but on no other ground:

                     (a)  that the patentee is not entitled to the patent;

                     (b)  that the invention is not a patentable invention;

                     (d)  that the patent was obtained by fraud, false suggestion or misrepresentation;

                     (e)  that an amendment of the patent request or the complete specification was made or obtained by fraud, false suggestion or misrepresentation;

                      (f)  that the specification does not comply with subsection 40(2) or (3).

# Chapter 14—Contracts

##### <a id="144"></a>144  Void conditions

             (1)  A condition in a contract relating to the sale or lease of, or a licence to exploit, a patented invention is void if the effect of the condition would be:

                     (a)  to prohibit or restrict the buyer, lessee or licensee from using a product or process (whether patented or not) supplied or owned by a person other than the seller, lessor or licensor, or a nominee of the seller, lessor or licensor; or

                     (b)  to require the buyer, lessee or licensee to acquire a product not protected by the patent from the seller, lessor or licensor, or a nominee of the seller, lessor or licensor.

          (1A)  A condition in a contract relating to the sale or lease of, or a licence to exploit, an invention the subject of an innovation patent is void if the effect of the condition would be to:

                     (a)  prohibit the buyer, lessee or licensee from applying for examination of the patent; or

                     (b)  impose restrictions on the circumstances in which the buyer, lessee or licensee may apply for examination of the patent.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply if:

                     (a)  the seller, lessor or licensor proves that, at the time the contract was made, the buyer, lessee or licensee had the option of buying the product, or obtaining a lease or licence, on reasonable terms without the condition; and

                     (b)  the contract entitles the buyer, lessee or licensee to be relieved of the liability to comply with the condition on giving the other party 3 months’ notice in writing and paying, in compensation for the relief:

                              (i)  in the case of a sale—such sum as is fixed by an arbitrator appointed by the Minister; or

                             (ii)  in the case of a lease or licence—such rent or royalty as is so fixed for the rest of the term of the contract.

             (3)  A person is not stopped from applying for or obtaining relief in any proceedings under this Act merely because of an admission made by the person about the reasonableness of terms offered to the person as mentioned in paragraph (2)(a).

             (4)  It is a defence to proceedings for infringement of a patent that the patented invention is, or was when the proceedings were started, the subject of a contract containing a provision, inserted by the patentee, that is void under this section.

             (5)  If the patentee offers the other parties to a contract mentioned in subsection (4) a new contract that does not contain the void condition but that otherwise gives the parties the same rights as the existing contract, then, whether or not the other parties accept the new contract in place of the existing contract, subsection (4) ceases to apply, but the patentee is not entitled to damages or an account of profit for an infringement of the patent committed before the offer of the new contract.

##### <a id="145"></a>145  Termination of contract after patent ceases to be in force

             (1)  A contract relating to the lease of, or a licence to exploit, a patented invention may be terminated by either party, on giving 3 months’ notice in writing to the other party, at any time after the patent, or all the patents, by which the invention was protected at the time the contract was made, have ceased to be in force.

             (2)  Subsection (1) applies despite anything to the contrary in that contract or in any other contract.

##### <a id="146"></a>146  Effect of Chapter

                   Nothing in this Chapter:

                     (a)  affects a condition in a contract that prohibits a person from selling products other than those of a particular person; or

                     (b)  validates a contract that would otherwise be invalid; or

                     (c)  affects a right to terminate a contract, or to terminate a condition of a contract, being a condition exercisable independently of this section; or

                     (d)  affects a condition in a contract for the lease of, or a licence to exploit, a patented product, that reserves to the lessor or licensor the right to supply new parts of the patented product that are required to put or keep it in repair.

**_new law_** means the _Patents Act 1990_ as amended by this Act.

**_old law_** means the _Patents Act 1990_, and the regulations made under it, in force immediately before this Act commences.

**_petty patent_** means letters patent for an invention granted under section 62 of the old law.

## 2  Saving and application provisions relating to old law

(1)       Despite the amendments and repeals made by this Act, the old law continues to apply, with the exceptions set out in the following subitems, to:

                     (a)  petty patents in force immediately before the commencement day; and

                     (b)  petty patents the term of which has expired before the commencement day; and

                     (c)  applications for petty patents made before the commencement day but not decided upon by the Commissioner before that day; and

                     (d)  petty patents granted on or after the commencement day on applications for a patent made before the commencement day.

The old law continues to apply as if those amendments and repeals had not been made.

Exception—fees payable in respect of petty patents after the commencement day

(2)       The amendments made by items 89 and 90 of Schedule 1 are incorporated into the old law in relation to fees payable in respect of petty patents on or after the commencement day.

Exception—under subsection 33(2) of the old law only innovation patents may be granted

(3)       Despite subsection 33(2) of the old law providing that the Commissioner may grant a person who applies for a petty patent if the matters listed in paragraphs 33(2)(a), (b) and (c) are satisfied, the Commissioner, on or after the commencement day, may only grant the person an innovation patent.

Exception—under sections 34, 35 and 36 of the old law only innovation patents or standard patents may be granted

(4)       Despite section 34, 35 and 36 of the old law providing that the Commissioner may grant a person a patent, the Commissioner, on or after the commencement day, may only grant a person an innovation patent or a standard patent.

_Note:       Under the old law, patent means a standard patent or a petty patent. This subitem overrides that meaning for grants of patent that the Commissioner makes on or after the commencement day._

Exception—divisional applications made after commencement day

(5)       Despite subsection 39(1) of the old law providing that a further complete application may be made for a standard patent or a petty patent, on or after the commencement day a further complete application may only be made, as provided for in that subsection, for a standard patent or an innovation patent.

(6)       Despite subsection 39(2) of the old law providing that a patentee of a petty patent may make a further complete application for a petty patent, on or after the commencement day a further complete application may only be made as provided for in that subsection for an innovation patent.

                     (a)  a person files a complete application in respect of a petty patent; and

                     (b)  a patent has not been accepted in respect of that application;

then, after that day, the person may convert the application, as provided for under subsection 104(2) of the old law.

(2)       However, despite subsection 104(2) of the old law providing that the application may be for a standard patent or a petty patent, an application may only be made for a standard patent or an innovation patent.

## 4  Transitional—Register of Patents

Despite the continuation of section 186 of the old law by subitem 2(1):

                     (a)  entries on the Register of Patents immediately before the commencement day relating to petty patents are included, after that day, in the Register in the part dealing with standard patents; and

                     (b)  after that day, entries relating to petty patents are to be entered in the Register in the part dealing with standard patents.

_Note:       Section 186 of the new law provides for the Register of Patents to have 2 parts: one dealing with entries relating to standard patents and the other dealing with entries relating to innovation patents._

## 5  Continuity of Register of Patents not affected

To avoid doubt, the continuity of the Register of Patents and the entries on it, are unaffected by the amendments made by this Act.

## 6  Other transitional matters relating to innovation patents and petty patents may be provided for in the regulations

The Governor‑General may make regulations, not inconsistent with this Act or the new law _,_ prescribing other transitional matters, apart from transitional matters provided for in this Schedule, that are necessary or convenient for carrying out or giving effect to:
