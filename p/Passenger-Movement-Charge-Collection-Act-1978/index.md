## Table A

### Application, saving or transitional provisions

_Timor Gap Treaty (Transitional Arrangements) Act 2000 (No. 25, 2000)_

## 4  The transition time

                   In this Act:

                    <a name="transition-time"></a>**_transition time_** means 1.23 am Australian Central Standard Time on 26 October 1999.

Note:          This time corresponds to the time in New York when the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1272 (1999), which established UNTAET and gave it responsibility for the administration of East  Timor. In 2000 the text of the Resolution was available in the Library of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and accessible on the Internet through the Department’s or the United Nations’ world-wide web site.

## 5  Validity of things done by the Ministerial Council and the Joint Authority

             (1)  Any thing done by the Ministerial Council or the Joint Authority, during the period commencing on the transition time and ending on 5.55 pm Australian Central Standard Time on 10 February 2000, is not invalid:

                     (a)  merely because the Republic of Indonesia ceased to be a party to the Treaty, and UNTAET became a party to the Treaty, at the transition time; or

                     (b)  merely because of an invalidity in the membership of the Ministerial Council or the Joint Authority.

             (2)  In this section:

                    <a name="ministeri-council"></a><a name="joint-author"></a>**_Joint Authority_** and **_Ministerial Council_** have the meanings given them by subsection 5(1) of the _Petroleum (Timor Gap Zone of Cooperation) Act 1990_.

                    <a name="treati"></a>**_Treaty_** has the meaning given by subsection 5(1) of the _Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia Zone of Cooperation) Act 1990_ (as in force immediately before the transition time).

                    <a name="untaet"></a>**_UNTAET_** means the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor.

## 6  Protection against retrospective criminal liability

                   A person does not commit an offence if the person would not have committed the offence had the amendments made by the items in Schedules 1 and 2 (other than items 18 to 25 of Schedule 2) commenced on the day on which this Act received the Royal Assent (rather than commencing at the transition time).

* * *

_Criminal Code Amendment (Theft, Fraud, Bribery and Related Offences) Act 2000 (No. 137, 2000)_

## Schedule 2

## 418  Transitional—pre-commencement offences

(1)        Despite the amendment or repeal of a provision by this Schedule, that provision continues to apply, after the commencement of this item, in relation to:

                     (a)  an offence committed before the commencement of this item; or

                     (b)  proceedings for an offence alleged to have been committed before the commencement of this item; or

                     (c)  any matter connected with, or arising out of, such proceedings;

as if the amendment or repeal had not been made.

(2)        Subitem (1) does not limit the operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

## 419  Transitional—pre-commencement notices

If:

                     (a)  a provision in force immediately before the commencement of this item required that a notice set out the effect of one or more other provisions; and

                     (b)  any or all of those other provisions are repealed by this Schedule; and

                     (c)  the first-mentioned provision is amended by this Schedule;

the amendment of the first-mentioned provision by this Schedule does not affect the validity of such a notice that was given before the commencement of this item.

* * *

_Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Act 2001 (No. 24, 2001)_

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Application of amendments

             (1)  Subject to subsection (3), each amendment made by this Act applies to acts and omissions that take place after the amendment commences.

             (2)  For the purposes of this section, if an act or omission is alleged to have taken place between 2 dates, one before and one on or after the day on which a particular amendment commences, the act or omission is alleged to have taken place before the amendment commences.
