Part 4—Regulation of PDFs
Division 1—Making investments
19  Investments to be in accordance with this Division
	(1)	A PDF must not make an investment, other than an unregulated investment, except in accordance with this Division.
	(2)	There are 3 kinds of investment that a PDF is allowed to make under this Division:
	(a)	subscribing for or buying shares (see section 20);
	(b)	acquiring non‑transferable options to buy shares (see section 20A);
	(c)	lending money to companies (see section 20B).
	(3)	The other sections of this Division (sections 21 to 28A) apply to each of those kinds of investment.
Note:	In particular, section 27 provides that, unless the Board otherwise approves, immediately after an investment of any of the above kinds is made, the total of all amounts paid on the shares in the investee company held by the PDF must be at least 10% of the total of all amounts paid on the issued shares in the investee company. (This means that the PDF must hold at least 10% of the paid‑up share capital in the investee company before the PDF can acquire non‑transferable options in the company or lend it money.)
20  First kind of allowed investment: acquiring shares
	(1)	A PDF may make an investment by subscribing for or buying:
	(a)	ordinary shares in a company (in this Division called the investee company); or
	(b)	some other kind of shares in a company (in this Division also called the investee company) that the Board approves the PDF investing in.
	(2)	Unless the Board otherwise approves, the shares must not be pre‑owned shares.
	(3)	The Board may give an approval for the purposes of subsection (2) only if it is satisfied:
	(a)	that it is in the investee company’s best interests for the person who holds the shares to which the investment relates to cease to hold shares in the investee company; and
	(b)	that that person proposes to dispose of all shares in the investee company that the person holds; and
	(c)	that the value of the investee company will be increased by the PDF acquiring the shares to which the investment relates; and
	(d)	that either:
	(i)	the PDF already holds other shares in the investee company, some or all of which are not pre‑owned shares; or
	(ii)	the PDF will, in connection with acquiring the shares, acquire other shares in the investee company, some or all of which are not pre‑owned shares.
	(4)	A reference in this Part to all amounts paid on shares held by a PDF is, in so far as the shares are pre‑owned shares, a reference to:
	(a)	the amount that the PDF paid for the shares; and
	(b)	the amounts (if any) paid on the shares since the PDF acquired them.
	(5)	In this section:
pre‑owned shares means shares that were issued or allotted to a person other than the PDF, but does not include any such shares that:
	(a)	were issued:
	(i)	to an underwriter or sub‑underwriter of the share issue; or
	(ii)	to a person for the purpose of being offered for sale; and
	(b)	were still held by the underwriter, sub‑underwriter or person immediately before being acquired by the PDF.
20A  Second kind of allowed investment: acquiring non‑transferable options
	(1)	A PDF may make an investment by acquiring an option to subscribe for or buy shares in a company (in this Division also called the investee company).
Note:	However, section 27 provides that, unless the Board otherwise approves, a PDF cannot make such an investment unless it first holds shares in the investee company. The total of all amounts paid on those shares must be at least 10% of the total of all amounts paid on the issued shares in the investee company.
	(2)	The option must be exercisable only by the PDF. It must not be capable of being transferred to another person.
	(3)	If the PDF later wishes to exercise the option by subscribing for or buying any of those shares, it must comply with section 20 and the other provisions of this Division that relate to section 20 investments: the exercise of the option is treated as a new investment that is separate from the acquisition of the option.
20B  Third kind of allowed investment: lending money to existing investee companies
	(1)	A PDF may make an investment by lending money to a company (in this Division also called the investee company) under an agreement with the investee company.
Note:	However, section 27 provides that, unless the Board otherwise approves, a PDF cannot make such an investment unless it first holds shares in the investee company. The total of all amounts paid on those shares must be at least 10% of the total of all amounts paid on the issued shares in the investee company.
	(2)	Immediately after the agreement is entered into, the total of the outstanding amounts of loans that the PDF has made (other than the amounts of unregulated investments) must not exceed 20% of the shareholders’ funds of the PDF.
21  Intended use by investee company of money invested by PDF
	(1)	The PDF must believe, on reasonable grounds, that:
	(aa)	if the investment is covered by section 20 (shares)—the shares concerned are being, or were, issued or allotted for the sole or principal purpose of raising money; or
	(ab)	if the investment is covered by section 20A (options)—the money paid as consideration for the option concerned is being raised solely or principally; or
	(ac)	if the investment is covered by section 20B (loans)—the loan money concerned is being borrowed solely or principally;
for use in doing one or more of the following:
	(a)	establishing an eligible business carried on, or to be carried on, by the investee company, whether alone or together with any other person or persons;
	(b)	substantially expanding:
	(i)	the production capacity; or
	(ii)	the capacity to supply services;
		 of an established eligible business so carried on;
	(c)	substantially expanding existing markets, or developing substantial new markets, for goods or services supplied in the course of an established eligible business so carried on.
	(2)	If the investment is authorised by a resolution of the PDF’s directors, the PDF is taken to believe as mentioned in subsection (1) if, and only if, each director who voted in favour of the resolution so believed when the resolution was passed.
	(3)	If the investment is not authorised by a resolution of the PDF’s directors, the PDF is taken to believe as mentioned in subsection (1) if, and only if:
	(a)	at least one of the following subparagraphs applies to each person who is a director of the PDF at the time when the investment is made:
	(i)	the person believes as mentioned in subsection (1) at that time;
	(ii)	the person believes at that time, on reasonable grounds, that a competent and reliable person:
	(A)	is responsible for ensuring that investments by the PDF (other than unregulated investments) are made in accordance with this Division; and
	(B)	is fulfilling that responsibility; and
	(b)	each person (whether or not an officer of the PDF) who is at that time responsible for so ensuring believes at that time, on reasonable grounds, as mentioned in subsection (1).
	(4)	This section does not apply to an investment (including the acquisition of an option) that relates to pre‑owned shares within the meaning of section 20.
22  Investee company must not be a PDF
	(1)	The investee company must not be a PDF.
	(2)	However, nothing in this Division prevents a PDF from making an investment that is allowed by section 32A (which deals with mergers of PDFs).
23  Primary activity of investee company must not be an excluded activity
	(1)	Unless the Board otherwise approves, the investee company’s primary activity must not be an excluded activity.
	(2)	The Board may give an approval for the purposes of subsection (1) only if:
	(a)	the Board is satisfied that the investee company intends to change its primary activity to an activity that is not an excluded activity; or
	(b)	the PDF already holds other shares in the investee company and the Board is satisfied that it is desirable that the investment be made in order to protect the PDF’s existing investment in the investee company.
24  Limit on size of investee company
	(1)	If the PDF does not already hold other shares in the investee company, the total value of the investee company’s assets, as determined in accordance with this section, must not exceed $50 million.
	(2)	If the PDF already holds other shares in the investee company, the total value of the investee company’s assets, as determined in accordance with this section, must not exceed $50 million unless the Board otherwise approves.
	(3)	The Board may give an approval for the purposes of subsection (2) only if it is satisfied that it is desirable that the investment be made (in spite of the value of the investee company’s assets) in order to protect the PDF’s existing investment in the investee company.
	(4)	Subject to subsections (5) and (6), for the purposes of this section, the total value of the investee company’s assets is the total value of its assets (both current and non‑current) as shown in the last audited accounts prepared in relation to the company for the purposes of Division 4 of Part 3.6 of the Corporations Act 2001 before the investment is made.
	(5)	If:
	(a)	no audited accounts of the kind referred to in subsection (4) have been so prepared within the period of 12 months ending when the investment is made; or
	(b)	the last such audited accounts so prepared relate to a period that ended more than 18 months before the investment is made;
then:
	(c)	the PDF must not make the investment unless it first obtains an audited statement showing the total value of the investee company’s assets as at a time not more than 12 months before the investment is made; and
	(d)	for the purposes of this section, the total value of the investee company’s assets is the total value as shown in that statement.
	(6)	If the PDF has reason to believe that the last audited accounts of the kind referred to in subsection (4) do not accurately reflect the total value of the investee company’s assets, then:
	(a)	subject to subsection (7), the PDF may, before making the investment, obtain an audited statement showing the total value of the investee company’s assets as at a time:
	(i)	after those last audited accounts were prepared; and
	(ii)	not more than 12 months before the investment is made; and
	(b)	if the PDF obtains such a statement, then, for the purposes of this section, the total value of the investee company’s assets is the total value as shown in that statement.
	(7)	The PDF must not make the investment without first obtaining a statement as mentioned in subsection (6) if an officer or investment manager of the PDF:
	(a)	performs duties in connection with the making of the investment; and
	(b)	has reason to believe that, since the last audited accounts of the kind referred to in subsection (4) were prepared, the total value of the investee company’s assets has, or may have, increased to an amount that exceeds $50 million.
	(8)	A reference in subsection (5) or (6) to an audited statement is a reference to a statement audited by a person or firm:
	(a)	who or that is appointed as the investee company’s auditor in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001; or
	(b)	who or that is eligible to consent to being so appointed.
25  PDF not to commit more than 30% of its committed capital to investee company
	(1)	Unless the Board otherwise approves, the investment must be such that, immediately after it is made, the total of:
	(a)	all amounts paid on the shares in the investee company held by the PDF; and
	(b)	all amounts remaining unpaid on those shares; and 
	(ba)	all amounts the PDF has paid to acquire options in the investee company that the PDF has not yet exercised; and

	(d)	all amounts remaining unpaid on the issued shares in the PDF.
	(2)	The Board must not give an approval under subsection (1) if the Board is satisfied that the investment is connected with a scheme or proposed scheme to which Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 applies or would apply, as the case requires.
	(3)	An expression used in subsection (2) of this section and in Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 has the same meaning in that subsection as it has in that Part.
27  Amount invested in investee company to be at least 10% of its paid‑up capital
		Unless the Board otherwise approves, the investment must be such that, immediately after it is made, the total of all amounts paid on the shares in the investee company held by the PDF is at least 10% of the total of all amounts paid on the issued shares in the investee company.
27A  PDF to notify Board of initial investments
		As soon as practicable, and in any event within 30 days, after a PDF invests in a particular investee company for the first time, the PDF must give the Board a written notice setting out full particulars of the investment.
28  Provisions relating to approvals by Board
	(1)	An approval for the purposes of an approval provision:
	(a)	must be given before the investment is made; and
	(b)	may be given subject to one or more of the following:

Division 2—Other provisions regulating the capital structure and activities of PDFs
29  PDF to carry on a business of making and holding PDF investments
	(1)	A PDF must carry on a business of making and holding PDF investments.
	(2)	A PDF must not enter into a transaction except:
	(a)	in the course of, or for the purposes of, carrying on a business of making and holding PDF investments; or
	(aa)	as allowed by section 32A (which deals with mergers of PDFs); or
	(b)	with the Board’s approval.
	(3)	Subsection (2) neither allows a PDF to do, nor empowers the Board to approve a PDF doing, something that the PDF is prohibited from doing under another provision of this Part.
	(4)	Subject to subsection (2), nothing in subsection (1) prevents a PDF from realising a particular investment.
	(5)	Nothing in this section prohibits a PDF from doing something in the course of, or for the purposes of:
	(a)	providing management assistance to a company in which the PDF holds a PDF investment; or
	(b)	complying with a direction under subsection 33(2), 34(1) or 35(1); or
	(c)	making, holding, or disposing of, an unregulated investment.
30  Restrictions on raising money etc.
	(1)	A PDF must not:
	(a)	borrow money; or
	(b)	accept a deposit of money; or
	(c)	issue a debenture; or
	(d)	issue a convertible note; or
	(e)	issue or make available an interest in a managed investment scheme.
	(2)	An expression has in subsection (1) the same meaning as in the Corporations Act 2001.
	(3)	Nothing in subsection (1) prohibits a PDF from making a permitted short‑term borrowing.
31  Limit on shareholding in a PDF
	(1)	Unless the Board otherwise approves, a person (not being an ADI, a life office or a widely‑held complying superannuation fund), together with associates (not being ADIs, life offices or widely‑held complying superannuation funds) of the person, must not hold more than 30% of the issued shares in a PDF.
	(2)	In this section:
associate, in relation to a person, means:
	(a)	a parent or remoter lineal ancestor, a child or remoter issue, or a brother or sister, of the person (including a person who is such a relation by adoption); or
	(b)	the spouse or a de facto spouse of the person; or
	(c)	if the person is a company:
	(i)	an officer of the company; or
	(ii)	an officer of a company that is related to the first‑mentioned company; or
	(iii)	a person who holds a substantial ownership interest in the company; or
	(d)	an officer of a company of which the person is an officer; or
	(e)	a person who is, because of this subsection, an associate of any other person who is an associate of the person (including a person who is an associate of the person by another application or other applications of this paragraph).
	(2A)	However, in determining whether a person is an associate of another person, disregard any connection those persons have with or through a PDF.
Example:	This means that, despite paragraph (1)(d), the fact that 2 persons are both officers of the same PDF does not make the officers associates of one another (although they would still be associates if they were both officers of the same non‑PDF company).
	(2B)	This section does not prevent a PDF from merging with another PDF as mentioned in section 32A.
	(3)	For the purposes of subparagraph (c)(ii) of the definition of associate in subsection (2), the question whether companies are related to each other is to be determined in the same manner as the question whether bodies corporate (within the meaning of the Corporations Act 2001) are related to each other is determined under the Corporations Act 2001.
	(4)	For the purposes of subparagraph (c)(iii) of the definition of associate in subsection (2), a person holds a substantial ownership interest in a company if the total of all amounts paid on the shares in the company in which the person holds interests equals or exceeds 15% of the total of all amounts paid on all shares in the company.
	(5)	For the purposes of subsection (4):
	(a)	a person holds an interest in a share if the person has any legal or equitable interest in the share; and
	(b)	without limiting the generality of paragraph (a), a person holds an interest in a share if the person, although not the registered holder of the share, is entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, a right attached to the share, otherwise than because the person has been appointed as a proxy or representative to vote at a meeting of members of a company or of a class of its members.
32  Timetable for investing funds raised by PDF
	(1)	In this section:
investment period, in relation to a payment day of a PDF, means:
	(a)	if, at the end of the period that would apart from this paragraph be the investment period after that payment day of the PDF, there is in force a determination by the Board that a specified longer period is the investment period after that payment day of the PDF—the specified period; or
	(b)	if paragraph (a) does not apply and the regulations, as in force at the start of that day, prescribe a period (other than 5 years)—the prescribed period; or
	(c)	otherwise—5 years.
payment day, in relation to a PDF, means a day on which an amount becomes due and payable to the PDF in respect of:
	(a)	an issue or allotment of shares in the PDF; or
	(b)	a call made in respect of such shares.
required amount, in relation to a payment day of a PDF, means an amount equal to the required percentage of the amount, or of the total of the amounts, that became due and payable to the PDF on that day as mentioned in the definition of payment day.
required percentage, in relation to a payment day of a PDF, means:
	(a)	if:
	(i)	at the end of the investment period after that payment day of the PDF there is in force a determination by the Board that a specified percentage is the required percentage for that payment day of the PDF; and
	(ii)	the specified percentage is lower than the percentage that would, apart from this paragraph, be the required percentage for that payment day of the PDF;
		the specified percentage; or
	(b)	if paragraph (a) does not apply and the regulations, as in force at the start of that day, prescribe a percentage (other than 65%)—the prescribed percentage; or
	(c)	otherwise—65%.
	(2)	Within the investment period after each payment day of a PDF, the PDF must invest, in accordance with Division 1, an amount or total equal to or greater than the required amount.
	(3)	In determining whether a PDF has complied with subsection (2) in relation to a particular day, so much of an amount invested as is taken into account in determining whether the PDF has complied with that subsection in relation to another day must be disregarded.
	(4)	However, if:
	(a)	the amount, or the total of the amounts, that may be taken into account in determining whether a PDF has complied with subsection (2) in relation to a particular payment day of the PDF exceeds the required amount in relation to that payment day of the PDF; and
	(b)	the first‑mentioned amount is, or amounts forming part of the first‑mentioned total are, invested during the investment period after another payment day of the PDF;
then, in determining whether the PDF has complied with subsection (2) in relation to the other day, so much of the first‑mentioned amount, or of the total of the amounts referred to in paragraph (b), as the case may be, as does not exceed the excess referred to in paragraph (a) is taken not to have been taken into account in determining whether the PDF complied with subsection (2) in relation to the day referred to in paragraph (a).
32A  PDFs may merge
	(1)	A PDF (the investor PDF) may acquire shares in another PDF (the investee PDF) if, and only if, the acquisition is part of a process of the 2 PDFs merging into one PDF.
	(2)	Any consideration given to the shareholders in the investee PDF for the acquisition must be in the form of:
	(a)	shares in the investor PDF; or
	(b)	a genuine dividend payable from any undistributed profits of the investee PDF;
or both.
	(3)	The investor PDF must give the Board written notice before making an acquisition allowed by this section.
