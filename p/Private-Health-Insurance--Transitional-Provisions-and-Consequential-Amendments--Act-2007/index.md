             (4)  Despite the repeal of the _Private Health Insurance Incentives Act 1998_, the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman may, under Part 6‑2 of the new Act, deal with a complaint about a matter that arose under that Act as if the complaint were about a matter that arose under Chapter 2 of the new Act.

Minister and rules may provide otherwise

             (5)  The Minister may, by writing, determine that subsection (1):

                     (a)  does not apply in relation to a specified thing done by, or in relation to, the old Ombudsman; or

#### Operative provisions

##### <a id="61‑205"></a>61‑205  Entitlement to the private health insurance tax offset

             (1)  If you are an individual (other than an individual in the capacity of an employer), you are entitled to a * tax offset for the 2007‑08 income year or a later income year if:

                     (a)  a premium, or an amount in respect of a premium, was paid by you, or by your employer as a * fringe benefit for you, under a complying private health insurance policy (within the meaning of the _Private Health Insurance Act 2007_), on or after 1 July 2007; and

                     (b)  the premium, or amount in respect of a premium, was paid during the income year; and

                     (c)  each person insured under the complying health insurance policy during the period covered by the premium or amount is, for the whole of the time that he or she is insured under the policy during that period, an eligible person within the meaning of section 3 of the _Health Insurance Act 1973_, or treated as such because of section 6, 6A or 7 of that Act.

             (2)  You are also entitled to the * tax offset if:

                     (a)  you are a trustee who is liable to be assessed under section 98 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ in respect of a share of the net income of a trust estate; and

                     (b)  the beneficiary who is presently entitled to the share of the income of the trust estate would be entitled to the tax offset because of subsection (1).

             (3)  However, you are not entitled to the * tax offset in respect of the payment of any premium, or any amount in respect of a premium, if:

                     (a)  you have received an amount under Division 26 of the _Private Health Insurance Act 2007_ in relation to the payment; or

                     (b)  the premium, or the amount in respect of a premium, was less than it would otherwise have been because of the operation of Division 23 of that Act.

Note:          In certain circumstances you can get a refund of the tax offset under Division 67.

##### <a id="61‑210"></a>61‑210  Amount of the private health insurance tax offset

             (1)  The amount of the * tax offset for an income year is the sum of:

                     (a)  30% of the amount of the premium, or of the amount in respect of a premium, paid by you, or by your employer as a * fringe benefit for you, under the policy in respect of days in the income year on which no person covered by the policy was aged 65 years or over; and

                     (b)  35% of the amount of the premium, or of the amount in respect of a premium, paid by you, or by your employer as a fringe benefit for you, under the policy in respect of days in the income year on which:

                              (i)  at least one person covered by the policy was aged 65 years or over; and

                             (ii)  no person covered by the policy was aged 70 years or over; and

                     (c)  40% of the amount of the premium, or of the amount in respect of a premium, paid by you, or by your employer as a fringe benefit for you, under the policy in respect of days in the income year on which at least one person covered by the policy was aged 70 years or over.

             (2)  However, if, before 1 January 1999, a person was registered, or eligible to be registered, under the _Private Health Insurance Incentives Act 1997_ in respect of the policy for the income year, the amount of the * tax offset for the income year is the greater of:

                     (a)  the amount worked out under subsection (1); and

                     (b)  the * incentive amount for the policy for the income year.

             (3)  If, because of the operation of Division 23 of the _Private Health Insurance Act 2007_, an amount paid by you, or by your employer as a * fringe benefit for you, under a policy was less than the amount that would otherwise have been payable, the * tax offset in respect of the amount paid is reduced by the amount of the difference.

##### <a id="61‑215"></a>61‑215  Tax offset after a person 65 years or over ceases to be covered by policy

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  at any time, the amount of a * tax offset in respect of premiums payable under an insurance policy (the **_original policy_**) was 35% or 40% of the premiums payable under the policy because a person aged 65 years or over (the **_entitling person_**) was insured under the original policy; and

                     (b)  at that time, another person (other than a dependent child) was insured under the original policy; and

                     (c)  the entitling person subsequently ceases to be insured under the policy;

subsections 61‑210(1) and (2) apply in relation to a complying health insurance policy (whether or not the original policy) under which the other person is insured (other than for the purposes of working out the * incentive amount) as if:

                     (d)  the entitling person were also insured under that policy; and

                     (e)  the entitling person were the same age as the age at which he or she ceased to be insured under the original policy.

             (2)  Subsection (1) ceases to apply if a person (other than a dependent child) who was not insured under the original policy at the time the entitling person ceased to be insured under it becomes insured under the complying health insurance policy.

             (3)  Subsection (1) does not apply if its application would result in the amount of the * tax offset under subsection 61‑210(1) or (2) being less than it would otherwise have been.

             (4)  Paragraph (1)(a) applies in relation to an amount of a * tax offset that is 35% or 40% of the premiums payable under an insurance policy whether the tax offset was available under this Subdivision or Subdivision 61‑H as in force before 1 July 2007.

             (5)  In this section:

                    <a name="compli-health-insur-polici"></a>**_complying health insurance policy_** has the same meaning as in the _Private Health Insurance Act 2007_.

                    <a name="depend-child"></a>**_dependent child_**:

                     (a)  has the meaning given in the _Private Health Insurance Act 2007_; and

                     (b)  in paragraph (1)(b), in relation to a time before 1 July 2007, includes a dependent child within the meaning of the _Private Health Insurance Incentives Act 1998_.

##### <a id="61‑220"></a>61‑220  How to work out the incentive amount

             (1)  The **_incentive amount_** for a complying private health insurance policy (within the meaning of the _Private Health Insurance Act 2007_) for an income year is the amount worked out under this table:
