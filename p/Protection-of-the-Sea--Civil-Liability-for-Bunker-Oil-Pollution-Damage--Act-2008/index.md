##### <a id="7"></a>7  Application of Part

                     (a)  pollution damage occurring in Australia or the exclusive economic zone of Australia; and

                     (b)  preventive measures, wherever they are taken, to prevent or minimise pollution damage occurring in Australia or the exclusive economic zone of Australia.

Note:          This Part also applies in relation to the coastal sea of Australia and an external Territory: see section 15B of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Overlap with Civil Liability Convention

                   This Part does not apply to pollution damage (within the meaning of the Civil Liability Convention), whether or not compensation is payable in respect of the damage under the _Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Act 1981_.

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Government ships

                   This Part applies in relation to a government ship only if it is being used for commercial purposes.

##### <a id="10"></a>10  Concurrent State or Territory laws

             (1)  This Part does not apply in relation to a domestic voyage ship if a law of a State or a Territory gives effect to Articles 3, 5 and 6, paragraph 10 of Article 7, and Article 8, of the Bunker Oil Convention in relation to the ship.

             (2)  However, subsection (1) does not apply in respect of an incident to which Article 5 of the Bunker Oil Convention applies involving:

                     (a)  one or more ships that are domestic voyage ships; and

                     (b)  one or more ships that are not domestic voyage ships.

             (3)  A **_domestic voyage ship_** is a ship that is:

                     (a)  a trading ship proceeding on a voyage other than an overseas voyage or an inter-State voyage; or

                     (b)  an Australian fishing vessel proceeding on a voyage other than an overseas voyage.

             (4)  For the purposes of this section, **_Australian fishing vessel_**, **_inter-State voyage_** and **_trading ship_** have the same respective meanings as they have in the _Navigation Act 1912_.

             (5)  For the purposes of this section, **_overseas voyage_** has the same meaning as in the _Navigation Act 1912_. However, if an Australian fishing vessel that is regularly engaged in making voyages from a port or ports in Queensland:

                     (a)  begins a voyage at a port in Queensland; and

                     (b)  ends the voyage at the same port or another port in Queensland;

that voyage is not taken to be an **_overseas voyage_** merely because, as an incidental part of its fishing operations on that voyage, the vessel calls at a port or ports in Papua New Guinea.

             (6)  For the purposes of this section, a ship is taken to be proceeding on a voyage from the time when it has got under way for the purpose of proceeding on the voyage until the time when it has got under way for the purpose of proceeding on another voyage.

### Division 2—Liability for pollution damage

##### <a id="11"></a>11  Liability for pollution damage

                   So far as this Part applies, Articles 3, 5 and 6, paragraph 10 of Article 7, and Article 8, of the Bunker Oil Convention have the force of law as part of the law of the Commonwealth.

Note 1:       Those provisions of the Bunker Oil Convention deal with the liability of shipowners for pollution damage and the making of claims against insurers or persons providing financial security for ships.

Note 2:       The _Admiralty Act 1988_ deals with the conferral of jurisdiction on courts to hear and determine claims under the applied provisions.

## Part 3—Insurance certificates relating to liability for pollution damage

### Division 1—Introduction

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Application of Part

             (1)  Subject to this section, this Part applies to a ship that has a gross tonnage of more than 1,000.

Overlap with Civil Liability Convention

Government ships

             (3)  This Part applies to a government ship only if it is being used for commercial purposes.

##### <a id="13"></a>13  Unregistered ships

                   This Part applies to a ship that is unregistered as if it were registered in the country whose flag the ship is entitled to fly.

##### <a id="14"></a>14  Concurrent State or Territory laws

                   This Part is not intended to exclude or limit the concurrent operation of a law of a State or Territory that gives effect to paragraphs 1, 2 and 4 of Article 7 of the Bunker Oil Convention in relation to a domestic voyage ship.

##### <a id="15"></a>15  Appropriate insurance certificate

                   For the purposes of this Act, an **_appropriate insurance certificate_** for a ship is worked out using the following table:
