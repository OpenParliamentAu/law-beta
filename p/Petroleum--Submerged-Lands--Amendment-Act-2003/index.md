Vessels or structures that are facilities

             (1)  Subject to subclauses (4) and (5), a vessel or structure (whether floating or fixed) is taken to be a facility for the purposes of this Schedule, whether or not it is capable of independent navigation, while that vessel or structure:

                     (a)  is located at a site in Commonwealth waters; and

                     (b)  is being used, or prepared for use, at that site:

                              (i)  for the recovery of petroleum, for the processing of petroleum, or for the storage and offloading of petroleum, or for any combination of those activities; or

                             (ii)  for the provision of accommodation for persons working on another facility, whether connected by a walkway to that other facility or not; or

                     (a)  any wells and associated plant and equipment by means of which petroleum processed or stored at the vessel or structure is recovered; and

             (5)  In determining when a vessel or structure that has the potential to be used for one or more of the purposes referred to in paragraph (1)(b) is in fact being so used, the vessel or structure is to be taken:

                     (a)  to commence to be so used only at the time when it arrives at the site where it is to be so used and any activities necessary to make it operational at that site are begun; and

                     (b)  to cease to be so used when operations cease, and the vessel or structure has been returned either to a navigable form or to a form in which it can be towed to another place.

Pipelines that are facilities
