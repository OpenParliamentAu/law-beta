## Part 2—The new parliamentary superannuation scheme

### Division 1—Commonwealth’s obligations to make contributions

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Persons to whom this Division applies

                   This Division applies to a person (the **_member_**) in respect of a month if all or part of the month is in a new scheme contribution period of the person.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  The Commonwealth’s obligations to make contributions

             (1)  If this Division applies to the member in respect of a month, the Commonwealth must make a contribution, in respect of the member, to the basic contributions fund of the member.

Note:          The **_basic contributions fund_** of the member is defined in section 3\. It will be either a fund, scheme or account chosen by the member under Division 2 or the default fund under Division 3.

             (2)  Subject to subsections (3) and (4), the amount of the contribution is an amount equal to 15.4% of the sum of:

                     (a)  the amount of parliamentary allowance to which the person is entitled in respect of the month; and

                     (b)  the amount (if any) of salary to which the member is entitled because he or she was a Minister of State for some or all of the month; and

                     (c)  the amount (if any) of allowance by way of salary to which the member is entitled because he or she was an office holder for some or all of the month.

             (3)  For the purpose of paragraph (2)(a), any reduction under Part 1 of Schedule 3 to the _Remuneration and Allowances Act 1990_ (about salary sacrifice) of the member’s entitlement to parliamentary allowance is to be disregarded.

             (4)  An amount of parliamentary allowance, salary, or allowance by way of salary, is not to be taken into account under subsection (2) to the extent (if any) that it does not count as salary or wages for the purposes of section 19 of the _Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992_.

             (5)  If:

                     (a)  this Division applies to the member in respect of one or more of the months in a quarter (as defined in the _Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992_); and

                     (b)  the Commonwealth makes contributions as required by this section in respect of the member and the month or months in the quarter in respect of which this Division applies; and

                     (c)  the Commonwealth would otherwise have an individual superannuation guarantee shortfall, in respect of the member and the quarter, for the purposes of the _Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992_;

then, for the purposes of the _Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992_, the Commonwealth is, by making those contributions, taken to have reduced its charge percentage for the quarter to nil under whichever of section 22 or 23 of that Act is applicable.

             (6)  Despite anything else in this section, the Commonwealth is not required by this section to pay contributions to the person’s basic contributions fund if, under the _Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993_(including the regulations under that Act), the basic contributions fund is not permitted to receive those contributions.
