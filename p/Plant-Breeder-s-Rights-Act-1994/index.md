	(b)	the breeding of the plant variety constitutes an invention for the purpose of paragraph 51(xviii) of the Constitution. 

Part 2—Plant breeder’s right 
  
11  General nature of PBR
		Subject to sections 16, 17, 18, 19 and 23, PBR in a plant variety is the exclusive right, subject to this Act, to do, or to license another person to do, the following acts in relation to propagating material of the variety:
	(a)	produce or reproduce the material;
	(b)	condition the material for the purpose of propagation;
	(c)	offer the material for sale;
	(d)	sell the material;
	(e)	import the material;
	(f)	export the material;
	(g)	stock the material for the purposes described in paragraph (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) or (f). 
12  Extension of PBR to cover essentially derived varieties
		Subject to section 23, if:
	(a)	PBR is granted to a person in a plant variety (the initial variety); and
	(b)	PBR is granted to another person in another plant variety; and
	(c)	the Secretary makes a declaration, on application by the first‑mentioned person, that the other plant variety is an essentially derived variety from the initial variety;
the right granted in the initial variety extends, with effect from the date of the declaration, to that other plant variety. 
13  Extension of PBR to cover certain dependent plant varieties
		Subject to section 23, if PBR is granted in a plant variety (the initial variety), the right extends to:
	(a)	any other plant variety that:
	(i)	is not clearly distinguishable from the initial variety; and
	(ii)	is clearly distinguishable from any plant variety that was a matter of common knowledge at the time of the grant of PBR in the initial variety; and
	(b)	any other plant variety that cannot be reproduced except by the repeated use of the initial variety or of a variety referred to in paragraph (a);
whether or not that other plant variety was in existence at the time PBR was granted in the initial variety. 
14  Extension of PBR to harvested material in certain circumstances
	(1)	If:
	(a)	propagating material of a plant variety covered by PBR is produced or reproduced without the authorisation of the grantee; and
	(b)	the grantee does not have a reasonable opportunity to exercise the grantee’s right in relation to the propagating material; and
	(c)	material is harvested from the propagating material;
section 11 operates as if the harvested material were propagating material. 
	(2)	Subsection (1) applies to so much of the material harvested by a farmer from propagating material conditioned and reproduced in the circumstances set out in subsection 17(1) as is not itself required by the farmer, for the farmer’s own use, for reproductive purposes. 
15  Extension of PBR to products obtained from harvested material in certain circumstances
		If:
	(a)	propagating material of a plant variety covered by PBR is produced or reproduced without authorisation of the grantee; and
	(b)	the grantee does not have a reasonable opportunity to exercise the grantee’s rights in relation to the propagating material; and
	(c)	material is harvested from plants grown from the propagating material but the grantee does not have, in the circumstances set out in section 14, a reasonable opportunity of exercising the grantee’s rights in the harvested material; and
	(d)	products are made from the harvested material;
section 11 operates as if those products were propagating material. 
16  Certain acts done for private, experimental or breeding purposes do not infringe PBR
		Any act done in relation to a plant variety covered by PBR that is done:
	(a)	privately and for non‑commercial purposes; or
	(b)	for experimental purposes; or
	(c)	for the purpose of breeding other plant varieties;
does not infringe the PBR. 
17  Conditioning and use of farm saved seed does not infringe PBR
	(1)	If:
	(a)	a person engaged in farming activities legitimately obtains propagating material of a plant variety covered by PBR either by purchase or by previous operation of this section, for use in such activities; and
	(b)	the plant variety is not included within a taxon declared under subsection (2) to be a taxon to which this subsection does not apply; and
	(c)	the person subsequently harvests further propagating material from plants grown from that first‑mentioned propagating material;
the PBR is not infringed by:
	(d)	the conditioning of so much of that further propagating material as is required for the person’s use for reproductive purposes; or
	(e)	the reproduction of that further propagating material. 
	(2)	The regulations may declare a particular taxon to be a taxon to which subsection (1) does not apply. 
18  Other acts that do not infringe PBR
	(1)	Despite the fact that a plant variety is covered by PBR, any act referred to in section 11:
	(a)	that is done in relation to the propagating material of plants of that variety; and
	(b)	that enables the use of that propagating material:
	(i)	as a food, food ingredient or fuel; or
	(ii)	for any other purpose that does not involve the production or reproduction of the propagating material;
does not infringe the PBR. 
	(2)	Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), for the purpose of that subsection, the use of propagating material of a plant by way of allowing it to sprout and then eating it, or using it in the preparation of food, before it has developed further, is not taken to be a use that involves the production or reproduction of propagating material. 
19  Reasonable public access to plant varieties covered by PBR
	(1)	Subject to subsection (11), the grantee of PBR in a plant variety must take all reasonable steps to ensure reasonable public access to that plant variety. 
	(2)	Reasonable public access to a plant variety covered by PBR is taken to be satisfied if propagating material of reasonable quality is available to the public at reasonable prices, or as gifts to the public, in sufficient quantities to meet demand. 
	(3)	For the purpose of ensuring reasonable public access to a plant variety covered by PBR, the Secretary may, on behalf of the grantee, in accordance with subsections (4) to (10), license a person whom the Secretary considers appropriate:
	(a)	to sell propagating material of plants of that variety; or
	(b)	to produce propagating material of plants of that variety for sale;
during such period as the Secretary considers appropriate and on such terms and conditions (including the provision of reasonable remuneration to the grantee) as the Secretary considers would be granted by the grantee in the normal course of business. 
	(4)	If, at any time more than 2 years after the grant of PBR in a plant variety, a person considers:
	(a)	that the grantee is failing to comply with subsection (1) in relation to the variety; and
	(b)	that the failure affects the person’s interests;
the person may make a written request to the Secretary to exercise a power under subsection (3) in relation to the variety. 
	(5)	A request must:
	(a)	set out the reasons why the person considers that the grantee is failing to comply with subsection (1); and
	(b)	give particulars of the way in which the person considers that the failure affects the person’s interests; and
	(c)	give an address of the person for the purposes of notifications under this section. 
	(6)	The Secretary must give the grantee:
	(a)	a copy of the request; and
	(b)	a written invitation to give the Secretary, within 30 days after giving the request, a written statement of the reasons the Secretary should be satisfied that the grantee:
	(i)	is complying with subsection (1) in relation to the variety; or
	(ii)	will so comply within a reasonable time.
	(7)	The Secretary must, after considering the request and any statement given by the grantee in response to the invitation under paragraph (6)(b):
	(a)	decide whether or not to exercise the power concerned; and
	(b)	within 30 days after so deciding, give written notice of the decision to the grantee and to the person making the request.
Note:	A decision under this subsection is reviewable by the AAT under section 77. 
	(8)	If the Secretary proposes to exercise a power under subsection (3) in relation to a plant variety, the Secretary must give public notice:
	(a)	identifying the variety; and
	(b)	setting out particulars of any licence the Secretary proposes to grant; and
	(c)	inviting persons to apply in writing to the Secretary, within 30 days of the publication of the notice, to be granted that licence. 
	(9)	The Secretary must not grant any such licence unless:
	(a)	the Secretary has considered all applications made in response to the invitation; and
	(b)	at least one month before granting any such licence, the Secretary has:
	(i)	given written notice to each such applicant of the name of the proposed licensee; and
	(ii)	given public notice of the name of the proposed licensee.
	(10)	If the Secretary:
	(a)	has granted a person a licence to produce propagating material of plants of a particular variety; and
	(b)	is satisfied that the person will be unable to obtain such propagating material at a reasonable price or without charge;
the Secretary may, on behalf of the grantee, make that propagating material available to the person from material stored at a genetic resource centre.
Note:	A decision under this subsection to make propagating material available is reviewable by the AAT under section 77. 
	(11)	This section does not apply in relation to a plant variety in respect of which the Secretary certifies, in writing, at the time of the grant of PBR, that he or she is satisfied that plants of that variety have no direct use as a consumer product.
Note:	A decision under this subsection is reviewable by the AAT under section 77. 
20  PBR is personal property
	(1)	PBR is personal property and, subject to any conditions imposed under section 49, is capable of assignment, or of transmission by will or by operation of law. 
	(2)	An assignment of PBR (otherwise than because of the order of a court) does not have effect unless it is in writing signed by, or on behalf of, the assignor and assignee. 
	(3)	If a grantee of PBR in a plant variety gives another person a licence in that right, the licence binds every successor in title to the interest of that grantee to the same extent as it was binding on that grantee of the PBR. 
21  Registrar must be notified of an assignment of PBR
	(1)	If a person (the claimant) claims that PBR was assigned or transmitted to the claimant, the claimant must inform the Registrar in writing that the claimant has acquired that right, giving particulars of the manner in which that right was acquired, within 30 days after acquiring that right. 
	(2)	If the Registrar is satisfied that the right has been so assigned or transmitted, the Registrar must amend the Register by entering the name of the claimant as the holder of that right. 
	(3)	If the Registrar enters the name of the claimant on the Register as the holder of PBR, the Registrar must, within 30 days after entering the name, give written notice to the claimant and to the person who was the holder before the entry was made, stating that the entry has been made. 
	(4)	If the Registrar is not satisfied that PBR has been assigned or transmitted to the claimant, the Registrar must, as soon as possible:
	(a)	give written notice to the claimant:
	(i)	telling the claimant that the Registrar is not so satisfied; and
	(ii)	setting out the reasons why the Registrar is not so satisfied; and
	(b)	give written notice to the person entered on the Register as the holder of the right:
	(i)	setting out particulars of the information given by the claimant; and
	(ii)	telling the claimant that the Registrar is not so satisfied; and
	(iii)	setting out the reasons why the Registrar is not so satisfied. 
	(5)	A claimant must include, in the notice to the Registrar informing of the assignment or transmission, an address in Australia for the service of documents in accordance with this Act.
Note:	A decision under this section to amend or to refuse to amend the Register is reviewable by the AAT under section 77. 
22  Duration of PBR
	(1)	Subject to subsections (4) and (5), PBR in a plant variety begins on the day that the grant of PBR in the variety is made. 
	(2)	Subject to subsections (3), (4) and (5), PBR in a plant variety lasts for:
	(a)	in the case of trees and vines—25 years; and
	(b)	for any other variety—20 years. 
	(3)	The regulations may provide that PBR in a plant variety included within a specified taxon lasts for a longer period than is specified in subsection (2). 
	(4)	PBR in a plant variety that is a dependent plant variety of another plant variety begins on:
	(a)	the day that the grant of PBR in the other plant variety is made; or
	(b)	the day that dependent variety comes into existence;
whichever occurs last, and ends when PBR in the other variety ceases. 
	(5)	If:
	(a)	PBR is held in a plant variety (the initial variety); and
	(b)	another plant variety is declared under section 40 to be an essentially derived variety of the initial variety;
PBR in the initial variety extends to the essentially derived variety from the day on which that declaration is made until the day on which PBR in the initial variety ends. 
23  Exhaustion of PBR
	(1)	PBR granted in a plant variety does not extend to any act referred to in section 11:
	(a)	in relation to propagating material of the variety; or
	(b)	in relation to propagating material of any essentially derived variety or dependent plant variety;
that takes place after the propagating material has been sold by the grantee or with the grantee’s consent unless that act:
	(c)	involves further production or reproduction of the material; or
	(d)	involves the export of the material:
	(i)	to a country that does not provide PBR in relation to the variety; and
	(ii)	for a purpose other than final consumption.
	(2)	If:
	(a)	a plant variety is declared to be an essentially derived variety of another plant variety (the initial variety); and
	(b)	PBR in the essentially derived variety is held both by the grantee of PBR in the essentially derived variety and by the grantee of PBR in the initial variety;
the reference in subsection (1) to propagating material sold by the grantee or with the grantee’s consent is a reference to propagating material sold by, or with the consent of, both of the grantees referred to in paragraph (b). 

Part 3—Application for plant breeder’s right
Division 1—The making of the application
24  Right to apply for PBR
	(1)	A breeder of a plant variety may make application to the Secretary for the grant of a PBR in the variety. 
	(2)	The breeder can make the application whether or not:
	(a)	the breeder is an Australian citizen; and
	(b)	the breeder is resident in Australia; and

	(b)	an application under this Act for PBR in the variety has been accepted;
the variety is not to be taken to have a particular characteristic unless subsection (2), (3), (4) or (5) applies to the variety. 
	(2)	This subsection applies to the subject variety if a test growing in Australia has demonstrated that the variety has the particular characteristic. 
	(3)	This subsection applies to the subject variety if:
	(a)	a test growing of the variety has been carried out outside Australia; and
	(b)	that test growing has demonstrated that the variety has the particular characteristic; and
	(c)	under an agreement between Australia and the country in which the test growing was carried out, Australia is required to accept that the variety has that particular characteristic. 
	(4)	This subsection applies to the subject variety if the Secretary is satisfied that:

	(5)	This subsection applies to the subject variety if the Secretary is satisfied that:
	(a)	a test growing of the variety carried out outside Australia has demonstrated that the variety has the particular characteristic; and
	(b)	any test growing of the variety carried out in Australia would probably demonstrate that the variety has that characteristic; and
	(c)	if a test growing of the variety in Australia sufficient to demonstrate whether the variety has that characteristic were to be carried out, it would take longer than 2 years.

Division 3—Provisional protection
39  Provisional protection
	(1)	When an application for PBR in a plant variety is accepted, the applicant is taken to be the grantee of that right for the purposes of Part 5 from the day the application is accepted until:
	(a)	the application is disposed of; or
	(b)	if the Secretary gives the applicant a notice under subsection (2)—the notice is disposed of;
whichever occurs first. 
	(2)	If the Secretary is satisfied in relation to an application for PBR in a plant variety, that:
	(a)	PBR will not be granted or is unlikely to be granted to the applicant; or
	(b)	the applicant has given an undertaking to a person (whether or not for consideration) not to commence proceedings for infringement of the right of which the applicant is deemed to be the grantee;
the Secretary may notify the applicant, in writing, that this section will cease to apply to that variety on a day specified in the notice unless, before that time the applicant has made a submission to the Secretary providing reasons why this section should not cease to apply.
Note:	A decision under this subsection to notify an applicant is reviewable by the AAT under section 77. 
	(3)	For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b) a notice referred to in that paragraph is not taken to be disposed of until:
	(a)	the end of the period within which application may be made to the AAT for a review of the giving of the notice; or
	(b)	if such an application is made to the AAT—the application is withdrawn or finally determined, whether by the AAT or a court. 
	(4)	As soon as practicable after a person ceases to be taken to be the grantee of PBR under this section, the Secretary must give public notice that the person has ceased to be so taken. 
	(5)	Nothing in this section affects the powers of the Federal Court under subsection 44A(2) of the AAT Act where an appeal is begun in that Court from a decision of the AAT. 
	(6)	A person who is taken to be the grantee of PBR in a plant variety is not entitled to begin an action or proceeding for an infringement of that right occurring during the period when the person is so taken unless and until that right is finally granted to the person under section 44. 

Division 4—Essential derivation
40  Applications for declarations of essential derivation
	(1)	If:
	(a)	a person is the grantee of PBR in a particular plant variety—(the initial variety); and
	(b)	another person is the grantee of, or has applied for, PBR in another plant variety (the second variety); and
	(c)	the grantee of PBR in the initial variety is satisfied that the second variety is, within the meaning of section 4, an essentially derived variety of the initial variety; and
	(d)	the initial variety has not itself been declared to be an essentially derived variety of another variety in which PBR has been granted;
the grantee of PBR in the initial variety may make written application to the Secretary for a declaration that the second variety is so derived. 
	(2)	Nothing in this section implies that a person who is the grantee of PBR in the initial variety may not, in relation to an application by another person for PBR in the second variety that has been accepted but not finally determined:
	(a)	make an objection, under section 35, to the granting of PBR in the second variety; and
	(b)	in the alternative, if PBR is granted to another person in the second variety—apply under subsection (1) for a declaration that the second variety is essentially derived from the initial variety. 
	(3)	If the second variety:
	(a)	is the subject of an application for PBR; and
	(b)	is also the subject of an application for a declaration of essential derivation;
then, unless and until the Secretary decides to grant the application for PBR:
	(c)	the Secretary must not make the declaration of essential derivation; but
	(d)	the Secretary may, in his or her discretion:
	(i)	examine both the application for PBR and the application for a declaration of essential derivation at the same time; and
	(ii)	for the purpose only of examining the application for a declaration of essential derivation–treat the applicant for PBR as the grantee of PBR in the variety. 
	(4)	An application for a declaration of essential derivation must:
	(a)	be in writing; and
	(b)	be in an approved form; and
	(c)	be lodged with the Secretary in a manner set out in the approved form; and
	(d)	be accompanied by the prescribed fee in respect of the application. 
	(5)	An application must contain such information relevant to establishing a prima facie case that the second variety is an essentially derived variety of the initial variety as is required by the form. 
	(6)	If the initial variety has itself been declared to be essentially derived from another variety, the Secretary must refuse to declare the second variety essentially derived from:
	(a)	the initial variety; and
	(b)	inform the applicant for the declaration in writing, to that effect, and give the applicant reasons for the decision. 
	(7)	If the initial variety has not been so declared, the Secretary must determine, on the basis of the application, whether the Secretary is satisfied that there is a prima facie case that the second variety is an essentially derived variety of the initial variety. 
	(8)	If the Secretary is satisfied of that prima facie case, the Secretary must:
	(a)	inform the applicant and the grantee of PBR in the second variety that the Secretary is so satisfied; and
	(b)	inform the grantee of PBR in the second variety that, unless the grantee establishes, within 30 days after being so informed or such longer period as the Secretary allows, that the second variety is not an essentially derived variety of the initial variety, the Secretary will, at the end of that period, declare the second variety to be such an essentially derived variety.
Note:	A decision under this subsection to refuse to extend the period of 30 days is reviewable by the AAT under section 77. 
	(9)	If the Secretary is not satisfied of that prima facie case, the Secretary must inform the applicant, in writing, to that effect, and give the applicant reasons for the decision. 
	(10)	If, after considering:
	(a)	the information presented by the grantee of PBR in the second variety; and
	(b)	any information obtained from a test growing conducted in accordance with section 41; and
	(c)	any other relevant information obtained by the Secretary;
the Secretary is not satisfied that the grantee of PBR in the second variety has rebutted the prima facie case, the Secretary must:
	(d)	declare, in writing, that the second variety is an essentially derived variety of the initial variety; and
	(e)	by notice in writing given to the grantee of PBR in the initial variety, tell that grantee of the declaration; and
	(f)	by notice in writing given to the grantee of PBR in the second variety, tell that grantee of the declaration and set out the reasons for not being satisfied that the prima facie case has been rebutted. 
	(11)	If, after considering the information referred to in paragraph (10)(a), (b) or (c), the Secretary is satisfied that the grantee of PBR in the second variety has rebutted the prima facie case, the Secretary must:
	(a)	by notice in writing given to the grantee of PBR in the initial variety, tell that grantee that he or she is so satisfied and set out the reasons for being so satisfied; and
	(b)	by notice in writing given to the grantee of PBR in the second variety, tell that grantee that he or she is so satisfied. 
	(12)	While a declaration that the second variety is essentially derived from the initial variety remains in force, section 19 applies in relation to the second variety as if:
	(a)	the references in that section to the grantee, in relation to that variety were references both to the person holding PBR in that variety and to the person holding PBR in the initial variety; and
	(b)	the reference in subsection 19(4) to 2 years after the grant of PBR were a reference to 2 years after the grant of PBR in the second variety whether or not the declaration of essential derivation was made at the same time or a later time; and
	(c)	a failure by the other person holding PBR in the initial variety or the person holding PBR in the second variety to co‑operate in making the second variety available to the public in accordance with the requirements of subsection 19(1) was a failure of the grantee to comply with the requirements of that subsection.
Note:	A decision under this section to declare, or not to declare, a plant variety essentially derived is reviewable by the AAT under section 77. 
41  Test growing associated with applications for declarations of essential derivation
	(1)	If:
	(a)	the grantee of PBR in a plant variety (the initial variety) applies for a declaration that another variety (the second variety) is an essentially derived variety of the initial variety; and
	(b)	in the course of that application the grantee of PBR in the initial variety establishes a prima facie case that the second variety is essentially derived; and
	(c)	on the basis of information supplied by the grantees of PBR in the initial variety and in the second variety, the Secretary comes to the view that a test growing or further test growing is necessary to determine whether the prima facie case has been rebutted;
the Secretary must give notice of that decision both to the grantee of PBR in the initial variety and in the second variety.
Note:	A decision under this subsection to require a test growing is reviewable by the AAT under section 77. 
	(2)	The notice must require:
	(a)	the grantee of PBR in the initial variety to supply the Secretary with sufficient plants or sufficient propagating material of plants of that variety and with any necessary information; and
	(b)	the grantee of PBR in the second variety to supply the Secretary with sufficient plants or sufficient propagating material of plants of that second variety and with any necessary information;
to enable the Secretary to arrange a test growing. 
	(3)	After completion of the test growing, any propagating material of a variety used in, or resulting from, the test growing that is capable of being transported must be delivered to the person by whom propagating material of that variety was supplied for the purpose of the test growing. 
	(4)	All costs associated with the test growing must be paid by the person who, without the test growing, failed to rebut the prima facie case of essential derivation, whether or not the test growing led to rebuttal of that case. 
	(5)	If the Secretary requires a test growing or further test growing, subsection 40(8) has effect as if the reference in that subsection to 30 days after being so informed were a reference to 30 days after being informed of the results of the test growing. 

Part 4—The grant and revocation of Plant Breeder’s Right
Division 1—Grant of Plant Breeder’s Right
42  PBR not to be granted in excluded varieties
	(1)	PBR must not be granted in any variety of plant in a taxon that the regulations declare to be a taxon to which this Act does not apply. 
	(2)	The Governor‑General must not make a regulation for the purposes of subsection (1) unless the Governor‑General has been informed by the Minister that the Minister has considered advice given by the Advisory Committee in relation to the desirability of making the regulation. 
	(3)	If:
	(a)	a plant variety is a hybrid; and
	(b)	each of the plant varieties from which it is derived is a plant variety included in a taxon to which this Act does not apply;
PBR must not be granted in the hybrid. 
43  Registrable plant varieties
	(1)	For the purposes of this Act, a plant variety in which an application for PBR is made is registrable if:

55  Declarations as to non‑infringement
	(1)	A person who proposes to perform an act described in a paragraph of section 11 in relation to the propagating material of a plant variety may, by an action in the Court against the grantee of PBR in a plant variety, apply for a declaration that the performance of that act would not constitute an infringement of that right. 
	(2)	A person may apply for a declaration whether or not there has been an assertion of an infringement of PBR by the grantee of that right. 
	(3)	The Court must not make such a declaration unless:
	(a)	the person proposing to perform the act:
	(i)	has applied in writing to the grantee of the PBR concerned for an admission that the proposed performance of the act would not infringe that right; and
	(ii)	has given the grantee full written particulars of the propagating material concerned; and

	(4)	The regulations may make provision in relation to the practice and procedure of the Court in actions under this Act, including provision prescribing the time within which any action may be begun, or any other act or thing may be done, and providing for the extension of any such time. 
	(5)	Subsection (4) does not limit the power of the Judges of the Court or a majority of them to make rules of Court under section 59 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 that are consistent with the regulations referred to in that subsection. 
57  Innocent infringement
	(1)	The Court may refuse to award damages, or to make an order for an account of profits, against a person in an action for infringement of PBR in a plant variety, if the person satisfies the Court that, at the time of the infringement, the person was not aware of, and had no reasonable grounds for suspecting, the existence of that right. 
	(2)	If the propagating material of plants of the plant variety, labelled so as to indicate that PBR is held in the variety in Australia, has been sold to a substantial extent before the date of the infringement, the person against whom the action for infringement is brought is taken to have been aware of the existence of PBR in the variety, unless the contrary is established.

	(i)	new,
	(ii)	distinct,
	(iii)	uniform and
	(iv)	stable.
	(2)	[Other conditions] The grant of the breeder’s right shall not be subject to any further or different conditions, provided that the variety is designated by a denomination in accordance with the provisions of Article 20, that the applicant complies with the formalities provided for by the law of the Contracting Party with whose authority the application has been filed and that he pays the required fees.
Article 6
Novelty
	(1)	[Criteria] The variety shall be deemed to be new if, at the date of filing of the application for a breeder’s right, propagating or harvested material of the variety has not been sold or otherwise disposed of to others, by or with the consent of the breeder, for purposes of exploitation of the variety
	(i)	in the territory of the Contracting Party in which the application has been filed earlier than one year before that date and
	(ii)	in a territory other than that of the Contracting Party in which the application has been filed earlier than four years or, in the case of trees or of vines, earlier than six years before the said date.
	(2)	[Varieties of recent creation] Where a Contracting Party applies this Convention to a plant genus or species to which it did not previously apply this Convention or an earlier Act, it may consider a variety of recent creation existing at the date of such extension of protection to satisfy the condition of novelty defined in paragraph (1) even where the sale or disposal to others described in that paragraph took place earlier than the time limits defined in that paragraph.
	(3)	[“Territory” in certain cases] For the purposes of paragraph (1), all the Contracting Parties which are member States of one and the same intergovernmental organization may act jointly, where the regulations of that organization so require, to assimilate acts done on the territories of the States members of that organization to acts done on their own territories and, should they do so, shall notify the Secretary‑General accordingly.
Article 7
Distinctness
The variety shall be deemed to be distinct if it is clearly distinguishable from any other variety whose existence is a matter of common knowledge at the time of the filing of the application. In particular, the filing of an application for the granting of a breeder’s right or for the entering of another variety in an official register of varieties, in any country, shall be deemed to render that other variety a matter of common knowledge from the date of the application, provided that the application leads to the granting of a breeder’s right or to the entering of the said other variety in the official register of varieties, as the case may be.
Article 8
Uniformity
The variety shall be deemed to be uniform if, subject to the variation that may be expected from the particular features of its propagation, it is sufficiently uniform in its relevant characteristics.
Article 9
Stability
The variety shall be deemed to be stable if its relevant characteristics remain unchanged after repeated propagation or, in the case of a particular cycle of propagation, at the end of each such cycle.
CHAPTER IV
APPLICATION FOR THE GRANT OF THE BREEDER’S RIGHT
Article 10
Filing of Applications
	(1)	[Place of first application] The breeder may choose the Contracting Party with whose authority he wishes to file his first application for a breeder’s right.
	(2)	[Time of subsequent applications] The breeder may apply to the authorities of other Contracting Parties for the grant of breeders’ rights without waiting for the grant to him of a breeder’s right by the authority of the Contracting Party with which the first application was filed.
	(3)	[Independence of protection] No Contracting Party shall refuse to grant a breeder’s right or limit its duration on the ground that protection for the same variety has not been applied for, has been refused or has expired in any other State or intergovernmental organization.
Article 11
Right of Priority
	(1)	[The right; its period] Any breeder who has duly filed an application for the protection of a variety in one of the Contracting Parties (the “first application”) shall, for the purpose of filing an application for the grant of a breeder’s right for the same variety with the authority of any other Contracting Party (the “subsequent application”), enjoy a right of priority for a period of 12 months. This period shall be computed from the date of filing of the first application. The day of filing shall not be included in the latter period.
	(2)	[Claiming the right] In order to benefit from the right of priority, the breeder shall, in the subsequent application, claim the priority of the first application. The authority with which the subsequent application has been filed may require the breeder to furnish, within a period of not less than three months from the filing date of the subsequent application, a copy of the documents which constitute the first application, certified to be a true copy by the authority with which that application was filed, and samples or other evidence that the variety which is the subject matter of both applications is the same.
	(3)	[Documents and material] The breeder shall be allowed a period of two years after the expiration of the period of priority or, where the first application is rejected or withdrawn, an appropriate time after such rejection or withdrawal, in which to furnish, to the authority of the Contracting Party with which he has filed the subsequent application, any necessary information, document or material required for the purpose of the examination under Article 12, as required by the laws of that Contracting Party.
	(4)	[Events occurring during the period] Events occurring within the period provided for in paragraph (1), such as the filing of another application or the publication or use of the variety that is the subject of the first application, shall not constitute a ground for rejecting the subsequent application. Such events shall also not give rise to any third‑party right.
Article 12
Examination of the Application
Any decision to grant a breeder’s right shall require an examination for compliance with the conditions under Articles 5 to 9. In the course of the examination, the authority may grow the variety or carry out other necessary tests, cause the growing of the variety or the carrying out of other necessary tests, or take into account the results of growing tests or other trials which have already been carried out. For the purposes of examination, the authority may require the breeder to furnish all the necessary information, documents or material.
Article 13
Provisional Protection
Each Contracting Party shall provide measures designed to safeguard the interests of the breeder during the period between the filing or the publication of the application for the grant of a breeder’s right and the grant of that right. Such measures shall have the effect that the holder of a breeder’s right shall at least be entitled to equitable remuneration from any person who, during the said period, has carried out acts which, once the right is granted, require the breeder’s authorization as provided in Article 14. A Contracting Party may provide that the said measures shall only take effect in relation to persons whom the breeder has notified of the filing of the application.

Article 16
Exhaustion of the Breeder’s Right
	(1)	[Exhaustion of right] The breeder’s right shall not extend to acts concerning any material of the protected variety, or of a variety covered by the provisions of Article 14(5), which has been sold or otherwise marketed by the breeder or with his consent in the territory of the Contracting Party concerned, or any material derived from the said material, unless such acts
	(i)	involve further propagation of the variety in question or
	(ii)	involve an export of material of the variety, which enables the propagation of the variety, into a country which does not protect varieties of the plant genus or species to which the variety belongs, except where the exported material is for final consumption purposes.
	(2)	[Meaning of “material”] For the purposes of paragraph (1), “material” means, in relation to a variety,
	(i)	propagating material of any kind,
	(ii)	harvested material, including entire plants and parts of plants, and

Article 18
Measures Regulating Commerce
The breeder’s right shall be independent of any measure taken by a Contracting Party to regulate within its territory the production, certification and marketing of material of varieties or the importing or exporting of such material. In any case, such measures shall not affect the application of the provisions of this Convention.

CHAPTER VI
VARIETY DENOMINATION
Article 20
Variety Denomination
	(1)	[Designation of varieties by denominations; use of the denomination] (a) The variety shall be designated by a denomination which will be its generic designation.
	(b)	Each Contracting Party shall ensure that, subject to paragraph (4), no rights in the designation registered as the denomination of the variety shall hamper the free use of the denomination in connection with the variety, even after the expiration of the breeder’s right.
	(2)	[Characteristics of the denomination] The denomination must enable the variety to be identified. It may not consist solely of figures except where this is an established practice for designating varieties. It must not be liable to mislead or to cause confusion concerning the characteristics, value or identity of the variety or the identity of the breeder. In particular, it must be different from every denomination which designates, in the territory of any Contracting Party, an existing variety of the same plant species or of a closely related species.
	(3)	[Registration of the denomination] The denomination of the variety shall be submitted by the breeder to the authority. If it is found that the denomination does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (2), the authority shall refuse to register it and shall require the breeder to propose another denomination within a prescribed period. The denomination shall be registered by the authority at the same time as the breeder’s right is granted.
	(4)	[Prior rights of third persons] Prior rights of third persons shall not be affected. If, by reason of a prior right, the use of the denomination of a variety is forbidden to a person who, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (7), is obliged to use it, the authority shall require the breeder to submit another denomination for the variety.
	(5)	[Same denomination in all Contracting Parties] A variety must be submitted to all Contracting Parties under the same denomination. The authority of each Contracting Party shall register the denomination so submitted, unless it considers the denomination unsuitable within its territory. In the latter case, it shall require the breeder to submit another denomination.
	(6)	[Information among the authorities of Contracting Parties] The authority of a Contracting Party shall ensure that the authorities of all the other Contracting Parties are informed of matters concerning variety denominations, in particular the submission, registration and cancellation of denominations. Any authority may address its observations, if any, on the registration of a denomination to the authority which communicated that denomination.
	(7)	[Obligation to use the denomination] Any person who, within the territory of one of the Contracting Parties, offers for sale or markets propagating material of a variety protected within the said territory shall be obliged to use the denomination of that variety, even after the expiration of the breeder’s right in that variety, except where, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (4), prior rights prevent such use.
	(8)	[Indications used in association with denominations] When a variety is offered for sale or marketed, it shall be permitted to associate a trademark, trade name or other similar indication with a registered variety denomination. If such an indication is so associated, the denomination must nevertheless be easily recognizable.
CHAPTER VII

	(i)	the breeder does not provide the authority with the information, documents or material deemed necessary for verifying the maintenance of the variety,
	(ii)	the breeder fails to pay such fees as may be payable to keep his right in force, or
	(iii)	the breeder does not propose, where the denomination of the variety is cancelled after the grant of the right, another suitable denomination.
