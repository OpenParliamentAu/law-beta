                     (a)  the person:

                              (i)  receives, possesses, conceals or disposes of money or other property; or

                             (ii)  imports money or other property into, or exports money or other property from, Australia; and

                     (b)  it is reasonable to suspect either or both of the following:

                             (ii)  the money or property is proceeds of crime, and the person’s conduct referred to in paragraph (a) takes place in circumstances referred to in subsection (3).

                    Penalty:  Imprisonment for 2 years, or 50 penalty units, or both.

                     (a)  the conduct referred to in paragraph (1)(a) involves a number of transactions that are structured or arranged to avoid the reporting requirements of the _Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988_ that would otherwise apply to the transactions; or

                     (b)  the conduct involves using one or more accounts held with ADIs in false names; or

                     (c)  the value of the money and property involved in the conduct is, in the opinion of the trier of fact, grossly out of proportion to the defendant’s income and expenditure; or

                     (d)  the conduct involves a significant cash transaction within the meaning of the _Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988_, and the defendant:

                              (i)  has contravened his or her obligations under that Act relating to reporting the transaction; or

                             (ii)  has given false or misleading information in purported compliance with those obligations; or

Note:          A defendant bears a legal burden in relation to the matter in subsection (5) (see section 13.4).

##### <a id="400.10"></a>400.10  Mistake of fact as to the value of money or property

             (1)  A person is not criminally responsible for an offence against section 400.3, 400.4, 400.5, 400.6 or 400.7 in relation to money or property if:

                     (a)  at or before the time of dealing with the money or property, the person considered what was the value of the money or property, and was under a mistaken but reasonable belief about that value; and

                     (b)  had the value been what the person believed it to be, the person’s conduct would have constituted another offence against this Division for which the maximum penalty, in penalty units, is less than the maximum penalty, in penalty units, for the offence charged.

Example:    Assume that a person deals with money or property that is the proceeds of crime. While the person believes it to be proceeds of crime, he or she is under a mistaken but reasonable belief that it is worth $90,000 when it is in fact worth $120,000.

                   That belief is a defence to an offence against subsection 400.4(1) (which deals with money or property of a value of $100,000 or more). However, the person would be guilty of an offence against subsection 400.5(1) (which deals with money or property of a value of $10,000 or more). Section 400.14 allows for an alternative verdict of guilty of an offence against subsection 400.5(1).

Note:          A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in subsection (1) (see subsection 13.3(3)).

             (2)  A person may be regarded as having considered what the value of the money or property was if:

                     (a)  he or she had considered, on a previous occasion, what the value of the money or property was in the circumstances surrounding that occasion; and

                     (b)  he or she honestly and reasonably believed that the circumstances surrounding the present occasion were the same, or substantially the same, as those surrounding the previous occasion.

##### <a id="400.11"></a>400.11  Proof of certain matters relating to kinds of offences not required

                   In a prosecution for an offence against a provision of this Division, it is not necessary to prove the existence of any fault element in relation to any of the following:

                     (a)  whether an offence may be dealt with as an indictable offence;

                     (b)  whether an offence is an indictable offence;

                     (c)  whether an offence is a Commonwealth indictable offence;

                     (d)  whether an offence is a foreign indictable offence.

##### <a id="400.12"></a>400.12  Combining several contraventions in a single charge

             (1)  A single charge of an offence against a provision of this Division may be about 2 or more instances of the defendant engaging in conduct (at the same time or different times) that constitutes an offence against a provision of this Division.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  a single charge is about 2 or more such instances; and

                     (b)  the value of the money and other property dealt with is an element of the offence in question;

that value is taken to be the sum of the values of the money and other property dealt with in respect of each of those instances.

##### <a id="400.13"></a>400.13  Proof of other offences is not required

             (1)  To avoid doubt, it is not necessary, in order to prove for the purposes of this Division that money or property is proceeds of crime, to establish:

                     (a)  a particular offence was committed in relation to the money or property; or

                     (b)  a particular person committed an offence in relation to the money or property.

             (2)  To avoid doubt, it is not necessary, in order to prove for the purposes of this Division an intention or risk that money or property will be an instrument of crime, to establish that:

                     (a)  an intention or risk that a particular offence will be committed in relation to the money or property; or

                     (b)  an intention or risk that a particular person will commit an offence in relation to the money or property.

##### <a id="400.14"></a>400.14  Alternative verdicts

                   If, on a trial for an offence against a provision of this Division (the **_offence charged_**), the trier of fact:

                     (a)  is not satisfied that the defendant is guilty of the offence charged; but

                     (b)  is otherwise satisfied that the defendant is guilty of another offence against this Division for which the maximum penalty, in penalty units, is less than the maximum penalty, in penalty units, for the offence charged;

the trier of fact may find the defendant not guilty of the offence charged but guilty of the other offence, so long as the person has been accorded procedural fairness in relation to that finding of guilt.

##### <a id="400.15"></a>400.15  Geographical jurisdiction

                   Section 15.2 (extended geographical jurisdiction—category B) applies to each offence against this Division.

##### <a id="400.16"></a>400.16  Saving of other laws

                   This Division is not intended to exclude or limit the operation of any other law of the Commonwealth or any law of a State or Territory.

                     (b)  if the applicant acquired the interest in the property at the time of or after the commission of such an offence—the property was neither:

                     (a)  a foreign country requests the Attorney‑General to make arrangements for the enforcement of:

                              (i)  a foreign forfeiture order, made in respect of a foreign serious offence, against property that is reasonably suspected of being located in Australia; or

                             (ii)  a foreign pecuniary penalty order, made in respect of a foreign serious offence, where some or all of the property available to satisfy the order is reasonably suspected of being located in Australia; and

                     (b)  the Attorney‑General is satisfied that:

                              (i)  a person has been convicted of the offence; and

                             (ii)  the conviction and the order are not subject to further appeal in the foreign country;

the Attorney‑General may authorise the DPP, in writing, to apply for the registration of the order in a specified court.

             (2)  If a foreign country that is specified in regulations made for the purposes of this subsection requests the Attorney‑General to make arrangements for the enforcement of:

                     (a)  a foreign forfeiture order that:

                              (i)  has the effect of forfeiting a person’s property on the basis that the property is, or is alleged to be, the proceeds or an instrument of a foreign serious offence (whether or not a person has been convicted of that offence); and

                             (ii)  is made against property that is reasonably suspected of being located in Australia; or

                     (b)  a foreign pecuniary penalty order in respect of which both of the following apply:

                              (i)  the order has the effect of requiring a person to pay an amount of money on the basis that the money is, or is alleged to be, the benefit derived from a foreign serious offence (whether or not the person has been convicted of that offence);

                             (ii)  some or all of the property available to satisfy the order is reasonably suspected of being located in Australia;

the Attorney‑General may authorise the DPP, in writing, to apply for the registration of the order in a specified court.

             (3)  If a foreign country requests the Attorney‑General to make arrangements for the enforcement of a foreign restraining order, against property that is reasonably suspected of being located in Australia, that is:

                     (a)  in any case—made in respect of a foreign serious offence for which a person has been convicted; or

                     (b)  if the foreign country is specified in regulations made for the purposes of subsection (2)—made in respect of the alleged commission of a foreign serious offence (whether or not the identity of the person who committed the offence is known);

the Attorney‑General may authorise the DPP, in writing, to apply for the registration of the order in a specified court.

             (4)  The court that the Attorney‑General specifies under subsection (1), (2) or (3) must be a court with proceeds jurisdiction in a State or Territory in which the property, or some or all of the property, is reasonably suspected of being located.

             (3)  However, the court must consider the application without notice having been given if the DPP requests the court to do so.

             (4)  If a foreign pecuniary penalty order or a foreign restraining order is registered in a court under this Subdivision:

             (2)  Part 3‑5 of the Proceeds of Crime Act applies to the application, and to any search warrant issued as a result.

##### <a id="34ZC"></a>34ZC  Seizure of other property and documents

             (1)  A search warrant issued under Part 3‑5 of the Proceeds of Crime Act in relation to a foreign serious offence authorises an authorised officer to seize property or a thing that he or she finds and that he or she believes on reasonable grounds to be:

                     (a)  proceeds or an instrument of the offence or a property‑tracking document in relation to the offence, although not of the kind specified in the warrant; or

                     (b)  proceeds or an instrument of, or a property‑tracking document in relation to, another foreign serious offence in relation to which a search warrant issued under that Part is in force; or

                     (c)  something that:

                              (i)  is relevant to a criminal proceeding in the foreign country in respect of the foreign serious offence; or

                             (ii)  will afford evidence as to the commission of an Australian criminal offence.

             (2)  However, this section only applies if the authorised officer believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary to seize the property or thing in order to prevent its concealment, loss or destruction or its use in committing an offence.

                     (a)  the applicant is entitled to possession of the property; and

                     (b)  the property is not proceeds or an instrument of the relevant foreign serious offence; and

                     (c)  the person who is believed or alleged to have committed the relevant foreign serious offence has no interest in the property.

             (4)  If the court makes such an order, the head of the authorised officer’s enforcement agency must arrange for the property to be returned to the applicant.

             (5)  This section does not apply to property that has been seized because it may afford evidence as to the commission of an Australian criminal offence.

##### <a id="34ZE"></a>34ZE  Dealing with seized property (other than property‑tracking documents)

the head of the enforcement agency whose authorised officer seized the property must, unless subsection (3), (5) or (7) applies, arrange for the property to be returned to the person from whose possession it was seized as soon as practicable after the end of that period.

Effect of restraining orders being registered or obtained

             (3)  If, before the end of that period:

                     (c)  if there is in force, at the end of that period, a direction by a court that the Official Trustee take custody and control of the property—must arrange for the property to be given to the Official Trustee in accordance with the direction; or

                     (d)  if there is in force at the end of that period an order under subsection (6) in relation to the property—must arrange for the property to be retained until it is dealt with in accordance with another provision of this Act or the Proceeds of Crime Act.

             (4)  If the property is subject to a direction of a kind referred to in paragraph (3)(c), the Proceeds of Crime Act applies to the property as if it were controlled property within the meaning of that Act.

Retaining property despite restraining orders

                     (b)  a restraining order has been made under Subdivision B in respect of the property in relation to the foreign serious offence;

             (6)  If the court is satisfied that the head of the enforcement agency requires the property to be dealt with in accordance with:

                     (a)  a request under section 34 that the restraining order be registered; or

                     (b)  a request under section 34J that the restraining order be obtained;

the court may make an order that the head of the enforcement agency may retain the property for so long as the property is so required.

Effect of foreign forfeiture orders being registered or obtained

             (7)  If, while the property is in the possession of the head of the enforcement agency whose authorised officer seized it, a foreign forfeiture order in respect of the property is registered in a court under Subdivision A, the head of the enforcement agency must deal with the property as required by the forfeiture order.

                              (i)  in a case where the acquittal occurs after the commencement of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_—at the end of the period of 28 days after the day of the acquittal; or

                             (ii)  otherwise—when the acquittal occurs;

Note:       After the commencement of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_, an application can be made under that Act (but not section 17) for a restraining order in relation to the offence, despite the acquittal.

## 9  After subsection 66(1)

Insert:

          (1A)  A police officer is not empowered to make an application under this section after the commencement of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_.

## 10  At the end of section 70

Add:

             (2)  A police officer is not empowered to do anything under this section after the commencement of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_ unless it is done under a search warrant issued under section 71 of this Act for which an application was made under that section before that commencement.

## 11  After subsection 73(1)

Insert:

          (1A)  A police officer is not empowered to make an application under this section after the commencement of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_.

## 12  Subsection 86(1)

After “interstate restraining order”, insert “made before the commencement of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_”.

## 13  Subsection 92(1)

After “interstate forfeiture order”, insert “made before the commencement of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_”.

## 14  Effect on existing applications and orders

The amendments made by this Part of this Schedule do not affect:

                     (a)  applications made under the _Proceeds of Crime Act 1987_ before the commencement of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_; or

                     (b)  orders made, or warrants or search warrants issued, under the _Proceeds of Crime Act 1987_ before or after that commencement.

## 15  Use of property etc. for purposes of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_

To avoid doubt, the fact that property, documents or information have:

                     (a)  been seized or otherwise obtained under the _Proceeds of Crime Act 1987_; or

                     (b)  been obtained as a direct or indirect result of action taken under that Act;

does not prevent the property, documents or information being used for the purposes of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_.

## 16  Obligations of financial institutions

Despite the repeal of Division 4 of Part IV of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 1987_ by Schedule 3 to this Act:

                     (a)  that Division continues to apply in relation to any document in relation to which it applied immediately before the commencement of sections 3 to 338 of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_; and

                     (b)  Part VIA of the _Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988_ does not apply to any such document.

Part 2—Application of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002

## 17  References to the commencement of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_

References in this Part to the commencement of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 are taken to be references to the commencement of sections 3 to 338 of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_.

## 18  Offences committed before the commencement of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_

(1)       An order made under Chapter 2 of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_ may, subject to this Part, relate to an offence committed before the commencement of that Act.

(2)       However, property cannot be forfeited under Part 2‑3 of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_ in relation to an offence of which a person is convicted before the commencement of that Act.

## 19  Applying for restraining orders

(1)       The DPP must not apply for a restraining order under Part 2‑1 of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_ covering property in respect of an offence if:

                     (a)  an application has been made under section 43 of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 1987_ for an order in respect of some or all of the property in respect of the offence; and

                     (b)  the application under section 43 of that Act is still pending.

(2)       The DPP must not apply for a restraining order under section 17 of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_ covering property in respect of an offence if an application under section 43 of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 1987_ for an order in respect of some or all of the property in respect of the offence has been refused.

(3)       The fact that an application has been made under section 43 of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 1987_ for an order does not in any other case prevent the DPP applying for a restraining order under Part 2‑1 of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_.

## 20  Applying for forfeiture orders

(1)       The DPP must not apply for a forfeiture order under Part 2‑2 of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_ covering property in respect of an offence if:

                     (a)  an application has been made under section 14 of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 1987_ for an order for the forfeiture of some or all of the property in respect of the offence; and

                     (b)  the application under section 14 of that Act is still pending.

(2)       The DPP must not apply for a forfeiture order under section 48 of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_ covering property in respect of an offence if an application under section 14 of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 1987_ for the forfeiture of some or all of the property in respect of the offence has been refused.

(3)       The fact that an application has been made under section 14 of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 1987_ for an order for the forfeiture of property in respect of an offence does not in any other case prevent the DPP applying for a forfeiture order under Part 2‑2 of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_ covering property in respect of the offence.

## 21  The effect on forfeiture under the _Proceeds of Crime Act 1987_ of convictions being quashed

(1)       If:

                     (a)  before or after the commencement of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_, an order was made under Division 2 of Part II of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 1987_, in relation to a person’s conviction of an offence, for the forfeiture of property; and

                     (b)  after the commencement of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_, the conviction is subsequently quashed;

Division 6 of Part 2‑2 of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_ applies in relation to the order in the same way that it would apply if the order had been made under Part 2‑2 of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_.

(2)       If:

                     (a)  before or after the commencement of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_, property was forfeited under section 30 of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 1987_ in relation to a person’s conviction of an offence; and

                     (b)  after the commencement of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_, the conviction is subsequently quashed;

Division 4 of Part 2‑3 of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_ applies in relation to the forfeiture in the same way that it would apply if the property had been forfeited under Part 2‑3 of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_.

## 22  Applying for pecuniary penalty orders

(1)       The DPP must not apply for a pecuniary penalty order under Part 2‑4 of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_ in respect of an offence if:

                     (a)  an application has been made under section 14 of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 1987_ for an order for the payment of a pecuniary penalty in respect of the offence; and

                     (b)  the application under section 14 of that Act is still pending.

(2)       The DPP must not apply for a pecuniary penalty order under section 116 of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_ covering property in respect of an offence if:

                     (a)  the application is made on the ground that a person has been convicted of the offence; and

                     (b)  an application under section 14 of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 1987_ for an order for the payment of a pecuniary penalty in respect of the offence has been refused.

(3)       The fact that an application has been made under section 14 of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 1987_ for an order for the payment of a pecuniary penalty in respect of the offence does not in any other case prevent the DPP applying for a pecuniary penalty order under Part 2‑4 of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_ in respect of the offence.

## 23  The effect on pecuniary penalty orders under the _Proceeds of Crime Act 1987_ of convictions being quashed

If:

                     (a)  before or after the commencement of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_, an order was made under section 26 of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 1987_ in relation to a person’s conviction of an offence; and

                     (b)  after the commencement of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_, the conviction is subsequently quashed;

Division 5 of Part 2‑4 of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_ applies in relation to the order in the same way that it would apply if the order had been made under Division 1 of that Part.

## 24  Registering interstate restraining orders

Division 1 of Part 4‑5 of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_ does not apply in relation to an interstate restraining order that has been registered under Division 1 of Part VI of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 1987_.

## 25  Registering interstate forfeiture orders

Division 2 of Part 4‑5 of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_ does not apply in relation to an interstate forfeiture order that has been registered under Division 2 of Part VI of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 1987_.

## 26  Continued application of regulations made under the _Proceeds of Crime Act 1987_

If:

                     (a)  immediately after the commencement of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_, regulations for the purposes of a provision of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_ specified in an item of the second column of the following table are not in force; and

                     (b)  immediately before that commencement, regulations for the purposes of a provision of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 1987_ specified in a corresponding item of the second column of the following table were in force;

the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_ has effect, until regulations for the purposes of that provision of the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_ come into force, as if the regulations referred to in paragraph (b) were regulations for the purposes of that provision.
