                    <a name="gazet-us"></a>**_gazetted use_**, in relation to gazetted oil, means a use of the oil that is declared by the Minister, by notice published in the _Gazette_, to be a gazetted use, being:

                     (a)  a use in the manufacture of a product:

                              (i)  that will not permit the oil to be recycled; and

                             (ii)  that constitutes only a low risk to the environment; or

                     (b)  a use in a process:

                              (i)  that will not permit the oil to be recycled; and

This means, for example, that people who acquire information under this Act are subject to the confidentiality obligations and exceptions in Division 355 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

## Part 2—Entitlement to product stewardship (oil) benefits

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Registration must precede a claim for product stewardship (oil) benefit

             (1)  Despite the other provisions of this Part, you are not entitled to a product stewardship (oil) benefit unless you were registered for entitlement to product stewardship (oil) benefits when you made a claim for payment of the product stewardship (oil) benefit.

Note:          You register for product stewardship (oil) benefits under the _Product Grants and Benefits Administration Act 2000_.

             (2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), if you make a claim in respect of an entitlement that is referred to in subsection 9(1):

                     (a)  after, or at the same time as, you apply for registration; but

                     (b)  before you are registered;

the claim is taken to have been made immediately after you are registered.

             (3)  For the purposes of subsection (1), if you make a claim in respect of an entitlement referred to in subsection 9(3):

                     (a)  after the introduction into the Parliament of the Bill for the _Product Stewardship (Oil) Legislation Amendment Act (No. 1) 2003_; but

the claim is taken to have been made immediately after you are registered.

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Entitlement to product stewardship (oil) benefits

             (1)  You are entitled to a product stewardship (oil) benefit for the sale or consumption of recycled oil that you have recycled in Australia.

             (2)  However, you are not entitled to a product stewardship (oil) benefit for the sale or consumption of recycled oil referred to in subsection (1) before the later of:

                     (a)  the commencement of this section; and

                     (b)  the date on which you applied for registration, in relation to product stewardship (oil) benefit, under the _Product Grants and Benefits Administration Act 2000_.

             (3)  You are entitled to a product stewardship (oil) benefit for the consumption in Australia of gazetted oil for a gazetted use.

             (4)  However, you are not entitled to a product stewardship (oil) benefit for the consumption of gazetted oil for a gazetted use before the introduction into the Parliament of the Bill for the _Product Stewardship (Oil) Legislation Amendment Act (No. 1) 2003_.

##### <a id="10"></a>10  Amounts of product stewardship (oil) benefit

             (1)  If you are entitled to a product stewardship (oil) benefit in respect of the sale or consumption of recycled oil, or the consumption of gazetted oil for a gazetted use, during a claim period, the amount of the product stewardship (oil) benefit for the claim period is worked out in accordance with the regulations.

             (2)  Without limiting the matters that may be taken into account under regulations made for the purposes of subsection (1) in respect of the sale or consumption of recycled oil, the matters may include:

                     (a)  the volume of the recycled oil that you sold or consumed; and

                     (b)  the quality of the recycled oil that you sold or consumed; and

                     (c)  the use of, or intended use for, the recycled oil.

          (2A)  Without limiting the matters that may be taken into account under regulations made for the purposes of subsection (1) in relation to the consumption of gazetted oil for a gazetted use, the matters may include:

                     (a)  the volume of the gazetted oil that you consumed for that use; and

                     (b)  the quality of the gazetted oil that you consumed for that use; and

                     (c)  particulars of the gazetted use to which you put the gazetted oil.

             (3)  To avoid doubt:

                     (a)  the regulations may provide that no benefit is payable in respect of recycled oil (including gazetted oil obtained through recycling) that is to undergo further recycling before it is to be sold to the end user or consumed; and

                     (b)  the amount of a benefit in respect of the sale or consumption of recycled oil, or of gazetted oil for a gazetted use, may be a nil amount.

             (4)  Before the Governor‑General makes a regulation under subsection (1), the Minister must take into consideration:

                     (a)  the total amount that it is estimated will be collected under relevant items in the _Customs Tariff Act 1995_ and the _Excise Tariff Act 1921_ in the relevant period; and

                     (b)  any relevant environmental matters relating to the recycling of oils or to the use of gazetted oil.

The Minister may also take into consideration any relevant recommendation made to the Minister by the Advisory Council.

             (5)  Despite section 14 of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_, regulations made for the purposes of subsection (1) may apply, adopt or incorporate any matter contained in a written instrument specifying:

                     (a)  oil testing methods; or

                     (b)  standards for the accreditation of laboratories undertaking oil testing;

as in force or existing from time to time.
