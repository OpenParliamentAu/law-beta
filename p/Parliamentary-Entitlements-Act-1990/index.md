                     (b)  benefits afforded by the Government to a Minister for the purpose of carrying out functions as a Minister.

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Entitlement to additional benefits

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00448/Html/cdae7ea7-fb8c-4d48-80a2-fc842dbbd897_files/image002.gif)

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Calculation of benefits

             (1)  A person is entitled to a benefit (other than a benefit for a Parliamentary office‑holder or a Minister) during the whole time when the person is entitled to an allowance under the _Parliamentary Allowances Act 1952_.

             (2)  A person is entitled to a benefit for a Parliamentary office‑holder only so long as the person is a Parliamentary office‑holder.

             (3)  A person is entitled to a benefit for a Minister only so long as the person is a Minister.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Validation

                   Where a benefit of a kind set out in Schedule 1 has been used by, or made available to, a person at any time before the commencement of this Act, the person is taken, by force of this section, to have been entitled to that benefit as if this Act had been in force at that time.

##### <a id="10"></a>10  Conflict between regulations and determination

             (1)  Where the regulations are inconsistent with a determination by the Remuneration Tribunal under paragraph 5(1)(a) or subsection 9(1), the regulations prevail and the determination is void to the extent of the inconsistency.

             (2)  Where the regulations are intended to cover the whole field in relation to a particular subject matter, then, for the purposes of subsection (1), any provision of a determination that deals with that subject matter is taken to be inconsistent with the regulations, whether or not they are capable of operating concurrently.

##### <a id="11"></a>11  Appropriation

                   The costs of benefits are to be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which is appropriated accordingly.

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Regulations

##### <a id="13"></a>13  Amendment of Remuneration Tribunal Act

             (2)  A determination under section 7 of the _Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973_ and in force immediately before the commencement of this Act continues in force as if it had been made under that Act as amended by this Act.

##### <a id="14"></a>14  Transitional: financial year 1989‑90

             (1)  In its application to the financial year 1989‑90, an amount (in this section called **_whole amount_**) referred to in Schedule 1 (other than item 3 in Part 1) is to be reduced to an amount worked out by the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00448/Html/cdae7ea7-fb8c-4d48-80a2-fc842dbbd897_files/image003.gif)

                    <a name="remain-number-dai"></a>where **_remaining number of days_** means the number of days in that financial year from and including the day on which this Act commences.

             (2)  In its application to the financial year 1989‑90, an amount referred to in item 3 of Part 1 of Schedule 1 is to be read as the amount (if any) by which $9,000 exceeds the amount spent by the member on postage in relation to Parliamentary or electorate business (other than party business) during the period beginning on 1 July 1989 and ending at the commencement of this Act.

             (3)  An amount worked out under subsection (1) must be rounded to the nearest whole number that is greater than zero.
