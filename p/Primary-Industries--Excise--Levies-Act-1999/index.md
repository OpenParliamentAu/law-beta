# Schedule 1—Beef production

##### <a id="1"></a>1  Definitions

                   In this Schedule:

                    <a name="cattl"></a>**_cattle_**means bovine animals other than buffalo.

                    <a name="cold-carcas-weight"></a>**_cold carcase weight_** means the weight of a carcase weighed 2 hours or more after slaughter.

                    <a name="hot-carcas-weight"></a>**_hot carcase weight_** means the weight of a carcase weighed within 2 hours after slaughtering.

                    <a name="weigh-period"></a>**_weighing period_**, in relation to a carcase, means the period of time between slaughter and the earlier of the following events:

                     (a)  the lodging of the monthly return (as required by the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection (Cattle and Live-stock) Regulations) in which the hot carcase weight of the carcase should be included;

                     (b)  levy on the carcase becomes due for payment (as provided in the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection (Cattle and Live-stock) Regulations).

##### <a id="2"></a>2  Imposition of levy

             (1)  Levy is imposed on the slaughter at an abattoir of cattle for human consumption, if the slaughter occurs after the commencement of this Schedule.

             (2)  Levy is not imposed by this Schedule on the slaughter of cattle the carcases of which are, under any applicable law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory, condemned or rejected as being unfit for human consumption.

             (3)  The regulations may provide that no amount of levy is payable by owners of cattle under this Schedule.

             (4)  Despite anything else in this Schedule, if a regulation of the kind referred to in subclause (3) is made, an amount of levy is not payable under this Schedule on the slaughter of cattle in respect of any period while the regulation is in force.

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Rate of levy

             (1)  The rate of levy imposed by this Schedule on the slaughter of cattle consists of the sum of the amounts, per kilogram of the carcase of each head of cattle slaughtered, that are referred to in the following paragraphs:

                     (a)  the prescribed amount (not exceeding 6 cents);

                     (b)  the prescribed amount (not exceeding 1 cent).

Note 1:       Paragraph (a) identifies amounts that, under the _Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act 1997_, are destined for the body declared under section 60 of that Act to be the meat processor marketing body.

Note 2:       Paragraph (b) identifies amounts that, under the _Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act 1997_, are destined for the body declared under section 60 of that Act to be the meat processor research body.

             (2)  For the purposes of the calculation of levy imposed by this Schedule, the weight of a carcase is its hot carcase weight.

             (3)  If an abattoir does not determine the hot carcase weight of a carcase, then, depending on which circumstance in the table is applicable, the hot carcase weight is taken to be the weight specified in the table, and that weight is taken to have been determined at the time of completing the slaughter.

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Who pays the levy

                     (b)  73 cents or, if another amount (not exceeding $4.00) is prescribed by the regulations, the other amount.

                     (b)  which has not been slaughtered but which, at the time of the leviable transaction or other dealing, had or has a liveweight that did not or does not exceed 80 kg; or

                     (c)  which has not been slaughtered or had its liveweight determined at the time of the leviable transaction or other dealing but which, in the opinion of the intermediary, would, if slaughtered at that time, have constituted or constitute a carcase whose dressed weight would not have exceeded or would not exceed 40 kg.

                    <a name="cattl"></a>**_cattle_** means bovine animals other than buffalo.
