##### <a id="441EA"></a>441EA  Sale of property subject to a possessory security interest

Scope

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a company is under administration; and

                     (b)  property of the company is subject to a possessory security interest; and

                     (c)  the property is in the possession of the secured party; and

                     (d)  the secured party sells the property.

Distribution of proceeds of sale

             (2)  The secured party is entitled to retain proceeds of the sale as follows:

                     (a)  if the net proceeds of sale equals the debt secured by the possessory security interest—the secured party is entitled to retain the net proceeds;

                     (b)  if the net proceeds of sale exceeds the debt secured by the possessory security interest—the secured party is entitled to retain so much of the net proceeds as equals the amount of the debt secured by the security interest, but must pay the excess to the administrator on behalf of the company;

                     (c)  if the net proceeds of sale fall short of the debt secured by the possessory security interest—the secured party is entitled to retain the net proceeds.

#### Subdivision C—Property not subject to security interests

##### <a id="441EB"></a>441EB  Scope of Subdivision

                   This Subdivision does not apply in relation to the enforcement of a right, or the performance or exercise of a function or power, if the enforcement, performance or exercise is authorised by (or because of) a transaction or dealing that gives rise to a security interest in the property concerned.

Example:    An example of a transaction or dealing in relation to which this Subdivision does not apply because of this section is a commercial consignment of personal property. Such a transaction gives rise to a PPSA security interest because of section 12 of the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_. The consigned property is PPSA retention of title property of the company (see sections 51F and 435B).

Note:          Subdivision B (property subject to security interests) may apply in relation to transactions or dealings to which this Subdivision does not apply because of this section. For example, Subdivision B would apply in relation to a commercial consignment of personal property, because such a transaction gives rise to a PPSA security interest.

Repeal the section, substitute:

##### <a id="442B"></a>442B  Dealing with property subject to circulating security interests

Scope

             (1)  This section applies if a security interest in property (the **_secured property_**) of a company under administration was a circulating security interest when the interest arose, but has stopped being a circulating security interest because:

                     (a)  in the case of a PPSA security interest—the property has stopped being a circulating asset (within the meaning of the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_); or

                     (b)  in the case of a security interest that was a floating charge when it arose—the floating charge has since become a fixed or specific charge.

Note 1:       A **_circulating security interest_** can be either a PPSA security interest to which a circulating asset has attached, or a floating charge, in the circumstances set out in section 51C.

Note 2:       For the meaning of **_circulating asset_**, see section 340 of the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_.

Security interest in circulating asset

             (2)  Subject to sections 442C and 442D, in the case of a PPSA security interest, the administrator may deal with any of the secured property in any way the company could deal with the secured property immediately before it stopped being a circulating asset.

Floating charge

             (3)  Subject to sections 442C and 442D, in the case of a security interest that was a floating charge when it arose, the administrator may deal with any of the secured property as if the security interest were still a floating charge.

Note:          Section 442C deals with the disposal of encumbered property by an administrator. Section 442D makes the administrator’s functions and powers subject to those of a secured party, receiver or controller.

## 89  Section 443E

Repeal the section, substitute:

##### <a id="443E"></a>443E  Right of indemnity has priority over other debts

General rule

             (1)  Subject to section 556, a right of indemnity under section 443D has priority over:

                     (a)  all the company’s unsecured debts; and

                     (b)  any debts of the company secured by a PPSA security interest in property of the company if, when the administration of the company begins, the security interest is vested in the company because of the operation of any of the following provisions:

                              (i)  section 267 or 267A of the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_ (property subject to unperfected security interests);

                             (ii)  section 588FL of this Act (collateral not registered within time); and

                     (c)  subject otherwise to this section—debts of the company secured by a circulating security interest in property of the company.

Debts secured by circulating security interests—receiver appointed before the beginning of administration etc.

             (2)  A right of indemnity under section 443D does not have priority over debts of the company under administration that are secured by a circulating security interest in property of the company, except so far as the secured party agrees, if:

                     (a)  before the beginning of the administration, the secured party:

                              (i)  appointed a receiver of property of the company under a power contained in an instrument relating to the security interest; or

                             (ii)  obtained an order for the appointment of a receiver of property of the company for the purpose of enforcing the security interest; or

                            (iii)  entered into possession, or assumed control, of property of the company for that purpose; or

                            (iv)  appointed a person so to enter into possession or assume control (whether as agent for the secured party or for the company); and

                     (b)  the receiver or person is still in office, or the secured party is still in possession or control of the property.

Debts secured by circulating security interests—receiver appointed during administration etc.

             (3)  Subsection (4) applies if:

                     (a)  debts of a company under administration are secured by a circulating security interest in property of the company; and

                     (b)  during the administration, the secured party, consistently with this Part:

                              (i)  appoints a receiver of property of the company under a power contained in an instrument relating to the security interest; or

                             (ii)  obtains an order for the appointment of a receiver of property of the company for the purpose of enforcing the security interest; or

                            (iii)  enters into possession, or assumes control, of property of the company for that purpose; or

                            (iv)  appoints a person so to enter into possession or assume control (whether as agent for the secured party or for the company).

             (4)  A right of indemnity of the administrator under section 443D has priority over those debts only in so far as it is a right of indemnity for debts incurred, or remuneration accruing, before written notice of the appointment, or of the entering into possession or assuming of control, as the case may be, was given to the administrator.

Debts secured by circulating security interests—priority over right of indemnity in relation to repayment of money borrowed etc.

             (5)  A right of indemnity under section 443D does not have priority over debts of the company under administration that are secured by a circulating security interest in property of the company, except so far as the secured party consents in writing, to the extent that the right of indemnity relates to debts incurred for:

                     (a)  the repayment of money borrowed; or

                     (b)  interest in respect of money borrowed; or

                     (c)  borrowing costs.

### Division 1—Introduction

##### <a id="319"></a>319  Guide to this Part

* * *

This Part deals with the transitional application of this Act.

This Part applies to transitional security interests, which are security interests provided for by security agreements (transitional security agreements) in force immediately before the registration commencement time. A transitional security interest may arise before, at or after the registration commencement time.

The registration commencement time is 1 February 2012 (the first day of the month that is 26 months after this Act was given the Royal Assent), or an earlier time determined by the Minister.

Division 2 is about the attachment, perfection and priority of transitional security interests. Transitional security interests are declared to be perfected until the end of the month that is 24 months after the registration commencement time, or until they are earlier perfected by other means (for example, by registration).

Division 6 is about the migration of data about personal property from Commonwealth, State and Territory registers onto the Personal Property Securities Register. The Registrar may register migrated data about transitional security interests with effect from the registration commencement time. Such transitional security interests are known as migrated security interests.

Migrated security interests are perfected under Division 2 from immediately before the registration commencement time.

Division 7 provides for preparatory registration with respect to transitional security interests in anticipation of the commencement of the Personal Property Securities Register. Other data may also be registered under this Division before the registration commencement time.

Transitional security interests that are registered in this way are perfected under Division 2 from immediately before the registration commencement time.

Division 8 provides rules for dealing with defective registrations with respect to transitional security interests. For example, omissions arising from the migration of data onto the Personal Property Securities Register will not automatically render the registration of the data ineffective.

                     (c)  for the priority between 2 security interests, one or both of which is a transitional security interest, if the priority comes to be determined after the end of the month that is 24 months after the registration commencement time in circumstances involving insolvency or bankruptcy, see section 324.

             (3)  In this section, a reference to a perfected transitional security interest is taken to be a reference to a transitional security interest that has been continuously perfected, at the time the priority comes to be determined, since immediately before the registration commencement time.

##### <a id="321"></a>321  Attachment rule

                   For the purposes of subparagraph 21(1)(b)(i) and section 55, a transitional security interest in collateral is taken to have attached to the collateral immediately before the registration commencement time, whether the security interest arises before, at or after the registration commencement time.

Note 1:       Subparagraph 21(1)(b)(i) provides that unless a security interest in collateral is perfected by force of this Act, the security interest must have attached to the collateral in order to be perfected.

Note 2:       Section 55 provides for the default rules for determining priority between security interests in the same collateral. In some cases, these rules depend on when a security interest attaches. For example, the priority between 2 unperfected security interests is generally determined by their order of attachment (see subsection 55(2)).

However, 2 unperfected transitional security interests have the priority they would have had between themselves if this Act had not been enacted (see section 323).

Note 3:       See section 320 for a general summary of priority rules as they affect transitional security interests.

##### <a id="322"></a>322  Perfection rule

Main rule

             (1)  A transitional security interest in collateral is perfected from immediately before the registration commencement time, whether the security interest arises before, at or after the registration commencement time (including a transitional security interest that arises after the end of the month that is 24 months after the registration commencement time).

Note 1:       As a result of this subsection, the priority time for a transitional security interest under subsection 55(4) will be immediately before the registration commencement time, as long as the security interest remains continuously perfected.

Note 2:       See section 320 for a general summary of priority rules as they affect transitional security interests.

             (2)  However, the transitional security interest stops being perfected under subsection (1) at the earliest of the following times:

                     (a)  when the security interest is perfected by registration under Division 6 (migration of personal property interests);

                     (b)  when the security interest is perfected by preparatory registration under Division 7;

                     (c)  when a registration under Division 6 or 7 is amended so that the registration perfects the security interest;

                     (d)  when the security interest is otherwise perfected by registration, or is perfected by possession or control;

                     (e)  when the security interest is otherwise perfected (but not temporarily perfected) by this Act, other than under this section;

                      (f)  the end of the month that is 24 months after the registration commencement time.

Note:          In the case of a transitional security interest in collateral that does not arise until after the end of the month that is 24 months after the registration commencement time, this section has the same effect as for other transitional security interests. In particular:

(a)    if a financing statement describing the collateral is registered before the end of that month, by the operation of sections 21, 55, 321 and this section, the security interest is continuously perfected from the registration time for the collateral until the registration stops being effective; and

(b)    if the security interest is not perfected (otherwise than under this section) at the end of the month that is 24 months after the registration commencement time, the security interest will become unperfected at that time.

Exception

             (3)  Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply to a transitional security interest in collateral if the interest is of a class prescribed by regulations made for the purposes of this subsection.

##### <a id="323"></a>323  Priority rule—priority otherwise undetermined

                   If the priority between 2 transitional security interests is not otherwise able to be determined under this Act, they have the priority between themselves that they would have had under the law that applied to such priority immediately before the registration commencement time, and as if this Act had not been enacted.

Note:          The priority between the following transitional security interests is not otherwise able to be determined under this Act:

(a)    2 unperfected transitional security interests (because of section 321, the order of attachment between these interests cannot be determined for the purposes of subsection 55(2));

(b)    2 transitional security interests that have been continuously perfected since immediately before the registration commencement time (because of sections 321 and 322, the order of the priority times for these interests cannot be determined for the purposes of subsection 55(4)).

##### <a id="324"></a>324  Priority rule—certain security interests upon insolvency or bankruptcy

             (1)  The priority between 2 security interests in the same collateral is to be determined under this Act, as if section 322 had not been enacted, if:

                     (a)  the priority between the security interests comes to be determined after the end of the month that is 24 months after the registration commencement time; and

                     (b)  either (or each) of the interests is a transitional security interest that has not been perfected, apart from under section 322; and

                     (c)  the grantor or secured party in relation to either (or each) of the security interests is insolvent or bankrupt.

             (2)  Subsection (1) is in addition to, and does not derogate from, any other provision of this Division.

## 122  Paragraph 333(3)(a)

Repeal the paragraph, substitute:

                     (a)  either:

                              (i)  if subsection (4) applies—state the transitional registration end time as the end time for the effective registration in respect of the personal property; or

                             (ii)  if subsection (4) does not apply—not state an end time for the effective registration in respect of the personal property; and

## 123  Subsection 333(4)

Repeal the subsection, substitute:

             (4)  This subsection applies if, in the Registrar’s opinion, the registration of the interest in the personal property in the transitional register would have ended at a particular time (the **_transitional registration end time_**) in accordance with the law under which the transitional register was maintained (as in force immediately before the migration time).

Registration time

             (5)  The **_registration time_** for the personal property is the registration commencement time.

Note:          However, the migrated security interest in the personal property is perfected from immediately before the registration commencement time (see section 322).

## 124  Section 336

Repeal the section, substitute:

##### <a id="336"></a>336  Preparatory registration—transitional security interests

Application for preparatory registration

             (1)  At or after the migration time, and before the registration commencement time, a person may apply to the Registrar, in the approved form, for the registration of any of the following:

                     (a)  a financing statement that describes collateral with respect to a transitional security interest;

                     (b)  a financing statement with respect to personal property prescribed by regulations made for the purposes of paragraph 148(c);

                     (c)  a financing change statement to amend a financing statement mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b) that is registered under this section.

             (2)  The Registrar may accept an application made under subsection (1), but only if:

                     (a)  in the case of a financing statement, or a financing change statement, with respect to a transitional security interest—the Registrar is satisfied on reasonable grounds that a transitional security interest will (whether before, at or after the registration commencement time) be:

                              (i)  attached to the collateral; and

                             (ii)  held by the applicant; and

                     (b)  in any case—in the Registrar’s opinion, it is operationally practicable for the Registrar to register the financing statement, or financing change statement, before the registration commencement time.

Registration

             (3)  If the Registrar accepts the application for registration, the Registrar may register the financing statement (or financing change statement), in accordance with the application, before the registration commencement time.

Note:          The Registrar must give a verification statement to a secured party affected by the registration.

             (4)  A registration under this section with respect to a transitional security interest must disclose that the collateral is covered by a transitional security agreement.

             (5)  In the case of a registration with respect to a transitional security interest, the **_registration time_** for the collateral is the registration commencement time.

Note:          However, a transitional security interest in the personal property arising under the agreement is perfected from immediately before the registration commencement time, no matter whether the security interest arises before, at or after that time (see section 322).

             (6)  Chapter 5 (registration) applies in relation to an application for registration under this section, and to such a registration, subject to this section.

## 125  Section 337

Repeal the section, substitute:

##### <a id="337"></a>337  Registration effective despite certain defects

Scope

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a registration describes collateral covered by a transitional security agreement; and

                     (b)  the transitional security agreement has given rise to a transitional security interest; and

                     (c)  the registration would not, apart from this section, be effective in respect of the collateral because of a defect in the registered data (including the omission of data); and

                     (d)  the Registrar has made a determination under subsection (2) in relation to defects of that type; and

                     (e)  the determination applies to the registration.

Note:          Sections 164 and 165 provide that serious or misleading defects in a registration, and certain particular types of defect, make a registration ineffective.

             (2)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(d), the Registrar may, by legislative instrument, determine that registrations in a stated class are effective despite stated types of defect.

             (3)  A determination under subsection (2) may provide that the determination does not apply in relation to a stated type of defect unless the registration includes particular data in relation to the defect (or in substitution for omitted data).

Registration temporarily unaffected by the defect

             (4)  Despite sections 164 and 165, the defect does not make the registration ineffective for the period starting at the registration time for the collateral and ending at the following time:

                     (a)  if the financing statement, as initially registered, states an end time—that end time (or an earlier end time, if the registration is amended to state an earlier end time);

                     (b)  if the financing statement, as initially registered, does not state an end time—the end of the month that is 60 months after the registration commencement time (or an earlier end time, if the registration is amended to state an end time).

Registration becomes ineffective

             (5)  However, the registration becomes ineffective under section 164 because of the defect immediately after the end of the period mentioned in subsection (4), unless, at or before that time, the registration is amended to correct the defect.

##### <a id="337A"></a>337A  Registration defective if collateral is not covered by transitional security agreement

                   Without limiting section 164 (defects in registration), a registration that discloses that collateral is covered by a transitional security agreement is ineffective to the extent that it describes collateral that is not covered by a transitional security agreement.
