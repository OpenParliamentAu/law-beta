  WHEREAS by a Development Credit Agreement of even date herewith between the<lf> International Development Association (hereinafter called the Association)<lf> and the Administration of the TERRITORY OF PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA (hereinafter<lf> called the Borrower) the Association has agreed to make available to the<lf> Borrower a development credit in various currencies equivalent to four million<lf> five hundred thousand dollars ($4,500,000), on the terms and conditions<lf> set forth in the Development Credit Agreement;<lf>   WHEREAS by a Loan Agreement of even date herewith between the Bank and the<lf> Borrower, the Bank has agreed to make to the Borrower a loan in various<lf> currencies equivalent to four million five hundred thousand dollars<lf> ($4,500,000), on the terms and conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement,<lf> but only on condition that the Guarantor agree to guarantee the obligations<lf> of the Borrower in respect of such loan as hereinafter provided; and<lf>   WHEREAS the Guarantor, in consideration of the Bank's entering into the<lf> Loan Agreement with the Borrower, has agreed so to guarantee such obligations<lf> of the Borrower;<lf>   NOW THEREFORE the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:<lf>                                   ARTICLE I<lf>   Section 1.01\.  The parties to this Guarantee Agreement accept all the<lf> provisions of the General Conditions Applicable to Loan and Guarantee<lf> Agreements of the Bank dated January 31, 1969, with the same force and<lf> effect as if they were fully set forth herein, subject, however, to the<lf> modifications thereof set forth in Schedule 2 to the Loan Agreement (said<lf> General Conditions Applicable to Loan and Guarantee Agreements, as so<lf> modified, being hereinafter called the General Conditions).<lf>   Section 1.02\.

Without limitation or restriction upon the provisions<lf> of section 2.01 of this Guarantee Agreement, the Guarantor specifically<lf> undertakes, whenever there is reasonable cause to believe that the<lf> funds available to the Borrower will be inadequate to meet the<lf> estimated expenditures required for carrying out the Project, to make<lf> arrangements, satisfactory to the Bank, promptly to provide the Borrower<lf> or cause the Borrower<lf> to be provided with such funds as are needed to meet such expenditures.<lf> <p>                                 ARTICLE III<lf>   Section 3.01\.

To that end the Guarantor<lf> undertakes that, except as the Bank shall otherwise agree, if any lien<lf> shall be created on any assets of the Guarantor or any agency of the<lf> Guarantor as security for any external debt, such lien shall equally<lf> and ratably secure the payment of the principal of an interest and other<lf> charges on the Loan and the Bonds, and that in the creation of any such<lf> lien express provision shall be made to that effect; and, within the<lf> limits of its constitutional powers, the Guarantor will make the<lf> foregoing undertaking effective with respect to liens on assets of the<lf> States and Territories of the Guarantor and their agencies (including<lf> local governing authorities). However, this Section shall not apply<lf> to: (i) any lien created on any property at the time of purchase thereof<lf> solely as security for the payment of the purchase price of such<lf> property; or (ii) any lien created by the Reserve Bank of Australia or<lf> the Commonwealth Trading Bank of Australia on any of their assets in the<lf> ordinary course of their banking business to secure any indebtedness<lf> maturing not more than one year after its date.<lf>   Section 3.02\. (a) The Guarantor and the Bank shall co-operate fully<lf> to assure that the purposes of the Loan will be accomplished.  To<lf> that end, each of them shall furnish to the other all such information<lf> as it shall reasonably request with regard to the general status of<lf> the Loan. On the part of the Guarantor, such information shall include<lf> information with respect to financial and economic conditions in the<lf> territories of the Guarantor and the international balance of payments<lf> position of the Guarantor.<lf>   (b) The Guarantor and the Bank shall from time to time exchange views<lf> through their representatives with regard to matters relating to the<lf> purposes of the Loan and the maintenance of the service thereof. The<lf> Guarantor shall promptly inform the Bank of any condition which<lf> interferes with, or threatens to interfere with, the accomplishment<lf> of the purposes of the Loan or the maintenance of the service thereof.<lf>   (c) The Guarantor shall afford all reasonable opportunity for<lf> accredited representatives of the Bank to visit any part of the<lf> territories of the Guarantor (including those of the Borrower) for<lf> purposes related to the Loan.<lf>   Section 3.03\. The principal of, and interest and other charges on,<lf> the Loan and the Bonds shall be paid without deduction for, and free<lf> from, any taxes, and free from all restrictions, imposed under the<lf> laws of the Guarantor or laws in effect in its territories; provided,<lf> however, that the provisions of this Section shall not apply to<lf> taxation of payments under any Bond to a holder thereof other than the<lf> Bank when such Bond is beneficially owned by an individual or corporate<lf> resident of the Guarantor or of its territories.<lf>   Section 3.04\. This Guarantee Agreement, the Loan Agreement and the<lf> Bonds shall be free from any taxes that shall be imposed under the<lf> laws of the Guarantor or laws in effect in its territories, on or<lf> in connection with the execution, issue, delivery, or registration<lf> thereof.<lf> <p>                                  ARTICLE  IV<lf>   Section 4.01\.

Payments on Bonds. The payment of the principal of any<lf> Bonds shall pro tanto discharge the obligation of the Borrower to repay<lf> the principal of the Loan; and the payment of interest on any Bonds and of the<lf> service charge, if any, provided for in Section 8.03, shall pro tanto<lf> discharge the obligation of the Borrower to pay interest in the Loan.<lf> <p>  Section 8.03\. Interest on Bonds; Service Charge. The Bonds shall bear<lf> interest at such rate or rates as the Bank shall request, not in excess,<lf> however, of the rate of interest on the loan. If the rate of interest on any<lf> Bond shall be less than the rate of interest on the Loan, the Borrower shall, in <lf> addition to the interest payable on such Bond, pay to the Bank a service charge<lf> on the principal amount of the Loan represented by such Bond at a rate equal to<lf> the difference between the interest rate on the Loan and the interest rate on<lf> such Bond. Such service charge shall be payable on the dates on which and in the <lf> currency in which such interest is payable.<lf> <p>  Section 8.04\. Currency in Which Bonds Are Payable.

Form of Bonds and Guarantee. The Bonds shall be fully<lf> registered bonds without coupons (hereinafter sometimes called registered Bonds) <lf> or bearer bonds with coupons for semi-annual interest attached (hereinafter<lf> sometimes called coupon Bonds).

Except as the Bank and<lf> the Borrower shall otherwise agree and subject to the provisions of Section 8.11 <lf> (b), the Bonds shall be either (a) printed or lithographed on an engraved base<lf> having an engraved border or (b) fully engraved in conformity with the<lf> requirements of the leading securities exchange in the country in whose currency <lf> such Bonds are payable.<lf> <p>  Section 8.08\. Date of Bonds. Each registered Bond shall be dated the<lf> semi-annual interest payment date on which or next preceding the date on which<lf> it shall be executed and delivered. Each coupon Bond shall be dated six months<lf> prior to the first semi-annual interest payment date after the Effective Date<lf> except as the Bank and the Borrower shall otherwise agree, and shall be<lf> delivered with all unmatured coupons attached. Upon any delivery of Bonds<lf> appropriate adjustment shall be made so that there shall be no loss to the Bank<lf> or to the Borrower in respect of commitment charge or interest and service<lf> charge, if any, on the principal amount of the Loan represented by such Bonds.<lf> <p>  Section 8.09\. Denominations of Bonds. The Borrower shall authorize the<lf> issuance of Bonds in such denominations as the Bank shall reasonably request.<lf> The Bonds delivered pursuant to any request under Section 8.01 or under Section<lf> 8.11 shall be in such authorized denominations as the Bank shall specify in such <lf> request.<lf> <p>  Section 8.10\. Execution of Bonds and Guarantee.<lf> <p>  (a)  The Bonds and the guarantee endorsed thereon shall be signed in the name<lf> and on behalf of the Borrower and the Guarantor, respectively, by their<lf> authorized representative or representatives designated in the Loan Agreement<lf> and in the Guarantee Agreement for the purposes of this Section. The signature<lf> of any such representative may be a facsimile signature if the Bonds, or the<lf> guarantee, as the case may be, are also manually countersigned by an authorized<lf> representative of the Borrower or of the Guarantor. Coupons attached to coupon<lf> Bonds shall be authenticated by the facsimile signature of an authorized<lf> representative of the Borrower.<lf> <p>  (b)  If any authorized representative of the Borrower or of the Guarantor, as<lf> the case may be, whose manual or facsimile signature shall be affixed to any<lf> Bond, coupon, or guarantee shall cease to be such authorized representative,<lf> such Bond, with such guarantee endorsed thereon, or coupon may nevertheless be<lf> delivered, and shall be valid and binding on the Borrower and the Guarantor as<lf> though the person whose manual or facsimile signature shall have been affixed to <lf> such Bond, coupon, or guarantee had not ceased to be such authorized<lf> representative.<lf> <p>  Section 8.11\. Exchange of Bonds. The Borrower shall, as soon as<lf> practicable after the Bank shall so request, execute and deliver to or on the<lf> order of the Bank, in exchange for Bonds theretofore executed and delivered to<lf> it, new Bonds in accordance with the following provisions:<lf>   (a)  Bonds bearing interest at one rate may be exchanged for Bonds bearing<lf> interest at any other rate not in excess of the rate of interest on the Loan.<lf> <p><lf>   (b)  Bonds initially issued which are not fully engraved in accordance with<lf> the provisions of Section 8.07 (b) may be exchanged for such fully engraved<lf> Bonds.<lf> <p><lf>   (c)  Bonds payable in one currency may, subject to the provisions of Sections<lf> 8.04 and 8.05, be exchanged for a like aggregate principal amount of Bonds<lf> payable in the same or any other currency in which the Loan is repayable.<lf> <p><lf>   (d)  The Bank shall reimburse the Borrower for the reasonable cost of any<lf> exchange made pursuant to paragraphs (a) or (c) above. Any exchange made<lf> pursuant to paragraph (b) above or any exchange by the Bank of registered Bonds<lf> in large denominations for registered or coupon Bonds in smaller authorized<lf> denominations for purposes of sale by the Bank shall be without charge to the<lf> Bank.<lf> <p><lf>   The foregoing rights of exchange are in addition to any rights of exchange<lf> provided in the Bonds. Except as in this Section expressly provided, exchanges<lf> of Bonds pursuant to this Section shall be subject to all provisions of the<lf> Bonds relating to exchanges.<lf> <p>  Section 8.12\.

Qualification and Listing of Bonds. The Borrower and the<lf> Guarantor shall promptly furnish to the Bank such information and execute such<lf> applications and other documents as the Bank shall reasonably request in order<lf> to enable the Bank to sell any of the Bonds in any country, or to list any of<lf> the Bonds on any securities exchange, in compliance with applicable laws and<lf> regulations. To the extent necessary to comply with the requirements of any such <lf> exchange, the Borrower and the Guarantor shall, if the Bank shall so request,<lf> appoint and maintain an agency for authentication of such Bonds.<lf> <p>  Section 8.14\. Guarantee by the Bank of Payments on Bonds. If the Bank<lf> shall sell any Bond and shall guarantee any payment thereunder, the Borrower or<lf> the Guarantor shall reimburse the Bank for any amount paid by the Bank under<lf> such guarantee by reason of any failure of the Borrower and the Guarantor to<lf> make payment in accordance with the terms of such Bond.<lf> <p>  Section 8.15\. Redemption of Bonds.<lf> <p>  (a)  The Bonds shall be subject to redemption prior to their maturity by the<lf> Borrower in accordance with their terms, at a redemption price equal to the<lf> principal amount thereof plus the interest accrued and unpaid thereon to the<lf> date fixed for the redemption thereof plus as a premium the percentages of said<lf> principal amount set forth in the amortization schedule to the Loan Agreement<lf> which shall be specified in the Bonds.<lf> <p>  (b)  If any Bond so to be redeemed shall bear interest at a rate less than the <lf> rate of interest on the Loan, the Borrower shall pay to the Bank on the date<lf> fixed for redemption the service charge provided for in Section 8.03 accrued and <lf> unpaid to such date on the principal amount of the Loan represented by such<lf> Bond.<lf> <p>  Section 8.16\. Rights of Holders of Bonds. No holder (other than the<lf> Bank) of any Bond shall, by virtue of being the holder thereof, be entitled to<lf> exercise any rights under the Loan Agreement or the Guarantee Agreement or be<lf> subject to any of the conditions or obligations imposed upon the Bank thereby.<lf> The provisions of this Section shall not impair or affect any rights or<lf> obligations under the terms of any Bond or of any guarantee endorsed thereon.<lf> <p>  Section 8.17\. Delivery of Promissory Notes in Lieu of Bonds. At the<lf> request of the Bank the Borrower shall execute and deliver to the Bank<lf> promissory notes in lieu of Bonds. Each note shall be payable to the order of<lf> such payee or payees, and at such place within the country in which the note is<lf> payable, as the Bank shall specify, and shall be dated the interest payment date <lf> next preceding the date of its delivery.

Legal Opinions. Upon the execution and delivery of any<lf> Bonds pursuant to this Article, the Borrower shall promptly at the Bank's<lf> request furnish to the Bank an opinion or opinions of counsel acceptable to the<lf> Bank confirming as of the date of delivery of such Bonds that such Bonds<lf> constitute valid and binding obligations of the Borrower in accordance with<lf> their terms and that the guarantee endorsed thereon constitutes a valid and<lf> binding obligation of the Guarantor in accordance with its terms.<lf> <p>                                  ARTICLE  IX<lf>            Enforceability of Loan Agreement and Guarantee Agreement;<lf>                     Failure to Exercise Rights; Arbitration<lf>   Section 9.01\. Enforceability. The rights and obligations of the Bank,<lf> the Borrower and the Guarantor under the Loan Agreement, the Guarantee Agreement <lf> and the Bonds shall be valid and enforceable in accordance with their terms<lf> notwithstanding the law of any state, or political subdivision thereof, to the<lf> contrary. Neither the Bank nor the Borrower nor the Guarantor shall be entitled<lf> in any proceeding under this Article to assert any claim that any provision of<lf> these General Conditions or of the Loan Agreement, the Guarantee Agreement or<lf> the Bonds is invalid or unenforceable because of any provision of the Articles<lf> of Agreement of the Bank or for any other reason.<lf> <p>  Section 9.02\.

Failure to Exercise Rights. No delay in exercising, or<lf> omission to exercise, any right, power or remedy accruing to any party under the <lf> Loan Agreement or Guarantee Agreement upon any default shall impair any such<lf> right, power or remedy or be construed to be a waiver thereof or an acquiescence <lf> in such default; nor shall the action of such party in respect of any default,<lf> or any acquiescence in any default, affect or impair any right, power or remedy<lf> of such party in respect of any other or subsequent default.<lf> <p>  Section 9.04\. Arbitration.<lf> <p>  (a)  Any controversy between the parties to the Loan Agreement or the parties<lf> to the Guarantee Agreement, and any claim by any such party against any other<lf> such party arising under the Loan Agreement, the Guarantee Agreement or the<lf> Bonds which shall not be determined by agreement of the parties shall be<lf> submitted to arbitration by an Arbitral Tribunal as hereinafter provided.<lf> <p>  (b)  The parties to such arbitration shall be the Bank on the one side and the <lf> Borrower and the Guarantor, on the other side.<lf> <p>  (c)  The Arbitral Tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators appointed as<lf> follows: one arbitrator shall be appointed by the Bank; a second arbitrator<lf> shall be appointed by the Borrower and the Guarantor or, if they shall not<lf> agree, by the Guarantor; and the third arbitrator (hereinafter sometimes called<lf> the Umpire) shall be appointed by agreement of the parties or, if they shall not <lf> agree, by the President of the International Court of Justice or, failing<lf> appointment by him, by the Secretary-General of the United Nations. If either<lf> side shall fail to appoint an arbitrator, such arbitrator shall be appointed by<lf> the Umpire. In case any arbitrator appointed in accordance with this Section<lf> shall resign, die or become unable to act, a successor arbitrator shall be<lf> appointed in the same manner as herein prescribed for the appointment of the<lf> original arbitrator and such successor shall have all the powers and duties of<lf> such original arbitrator.<lf> <p>  (d)  An arbitration proceeding may be instituted under this Section upon<lf> notice by the party instituting such proceeding to the other party. Such notice<lf> shall contain a statement setting forth the nature of the controversy or claim<lf> to be submitted to arbitration and the nature of the relief sought and the name<lf> of the arbitrator appointed by the party instituting such proceeding. Within 30<lf> days after the giving of such notice, the other party shall notify to the party<lf> instituting the proceeding the name of the arbitrator appointed by such other<lf> party.<lf> <p>  (e)  If within 60 days after the giving of such notice instituting the<lf> arbitration proceeding the parties shall not have agreed upon an Umpire, any<lf> party may request the appointment of an Umpire as provided in paragraph (c) of<lf> this Section.<lf> <p>  (f)  The Arbitral Tribunal shall convene at such time and place as shall be<lf> fixed by the Umpire.

Any question<lf> concerning the division of the costs of the Arbitral Tribunal or the procedure<lf> for payment of such costs shall be determined by the Arbitral Tribunal.<lf> <p>  (j)  The provisions for arbitration set forth in this Section shall be in lieu <lf> of any other procedure for the determination of controversies between the<lf> parties to the Loan Agreement and Guarantee Agreement or any claim by any such<lf> party against any other such party arising thereunder or under the Bonds.<lf> <p>  (k)  If within 30 days after counterparts of the award shall be delivered to<lf> the parties the award shall not be complied with, any party may enter judgment<lf> upon, or institute a proceeding to enforce, the award in any court of competent<lf> jurisdiction against any other party, may enforce such judgment by execution or<lf> may pursue any other appropriate remedy against such other party for the<lf> enforcement of the award, the provisions of the Loan Agreement, the Guarantee<lf> Agreement or the Bonds. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section shall not<lf> authorize any entry of judgment or enforcement of the award against any party<lf> that is a member of the Bank except as such procedure may be available otherwise <lf> than by reason of the provisions of this Section.<lf> <p>  (l)  Service of any notice or process in connection with any proceeding under<lf> this Section or in connection with any proceeding to enforce any award rendered<lf> pursuant to this Section may be made in the manner provided in Section 10.01.<lf> The parties to the Loan Agreement and the Guarantee Agreement waive any and all<lf> other requirements for the service of any such notice or process.<lf> <p>                                   ARTICLE  X<lf>                             Miscellaneous Provisions<lf>   Section 10.01\.

Currencies in which Principal and Service Charges are<lf> Payable. (a) The Borrower shall pay the principal amount of, and service<lf> charges on, the Credit in the currency specified in the Development Credit<lf> Agreement for the purposes of this Section or in such other eligible currency or <lf> currencies as may from time to time be designated or selected pursuant to<lf> paragraphs (c) or (e) of this Section.<lf> <p>  (b)  For the purposes of this Section, the term "eligible currency" means<lf> the currency of any member of the Association which the Association from time to <lf> time determines to be freely convertible or freely exchangeable by the<lf> Association for currencies of other members of the Association for the purposes<lf> of its operations.<lf> <p>  (c)  If at any time the Borrower shall desire that, commencing with a given<lf> future payment date, such principal and service charges shall be payable in an<lf> eligible currency other than that so specified or than one theretofore<lf> designated pursuant to this paragraph (c) or selected pursuant to paragraph (e)<lf> below, the Borrower shall deliver to the Association, not less than three nor<lf> more than five months prior to such payment date, a notice in writing to that<lf> effect and designating such other eligible currency, whereupon the currency so<lf> designated shall, commencing with such payment date, be the currency in which<lf> such principal and service charges shall be payable.<lf> <p>  (d)  If at any time the Association shall determine that a currency payable<lf> pursuant to the provisions of this Section is not an eligible currency, the<lf> Association shall so notify the Borrower in writing and furnish the Borrower<lf> with a list of eligible currencies.<lf> <p>  (e)  Within thirty days from the date of such notice, the Borrower shall<lf> notify the Association in writing of its selection from such list of a currency<lf> in which payment shall be made, failing which the Association shall select a<lf> currency for such purpose from such list, whereupon, in either case, such<lf> principal and service charges shall, commencing with the payment date next<lf> succeeding such thirty-day period, be payable in the currency so selected.<lf> <p>  Section 4.03\. Amount of Repayment. The principal amount of the Credit<lf> repayable shall be the equivalent (determined as of the date, or the respective<lf> dates, of repayment) of the value of the currency or currencies withdrawn from<lf> the Credit Account expressed in terms of United States dollars of the weight and <lf> fineness in effect on January 1, 1960, determined as of the respective dates of<lf> withdrawal; provided, however:<lf>    (i)  that if a uniform proportionate reduction in the par values of the<lf> currencies of all its members is made by the International Monetary Fund, the<lf> principal amount of the Credit then outstanding and repayable after such<lf> reduction shall be reduced by the same proportion; and<lf>   (ii)  that if the Association shall at any time determine that there has been<lf> a substantial reduction in the par value or the foreign exchange value of one or <lf> more major currencies of members of the Association in terms of United States<lf> dollars of the weight and fineness in effect on January 1, 1960, which in the<lf> opinion of the Association shall justify a general reduction in the principal<lf> amount repayable on development credits then outstanding, the principal amount<lf> of the Credit then outstanding and repayable after such determination shall be<lf> reduced by such proportion as the Association shall decide.<lf> <p><lf>   Section 4.04\.

Valuation of Currencies. Whenever it shall be necessary<lf> for the purpose of the Development Credit Agreement to determine the value of<lf> one currency in terms of another, such value shall be as reasonably determined<lf> by the Association.<lf> <p>  Section 4.06\. Exchange Restrictions. Any payment required under the<lf> Development Credit Agreement to be made to the Association in the currency of<lf> any country shall be made in such manner, and in currency acquired in such<lf> manner, as shall be permitted under the laws of such country for the purpose of<lf> making such payment and effecting the deposit of such currency to the account of <lf> the Association with a depository of the Association in such country.<lf> <p>                                   ARTICLE  V<lf>                        Withdrawal of Proceeds of Credits<lf>   Section 5.01\. Withdrawal from the Credit Account. The Borrower shall<lf> be entitled to withdraw from the Credit Account amounts expended or, if the<lf> Association shall so agree, amounts to be expended for the Project in accordance <lf> with the provisions of the Development Credit Agreement and of these General<lf> Conditions. Except as shall be otherwise agreed between the Borrower and the<lf> Association no withdrawals shall be made on account of (a) expenditures prior to <lf> the date of the Development Credit Agreement or (b) expenditures in the<lf> territories of any country which is not a member of the Bank (other than<lf> Switzerland) or for goods produced in, or services supplied from, such<lf> territories.<lf> <p>  Section 5.02\. Special Commitments by the Association. Upon the<lf> Borrower's request and upon such terms and conditions as shall be agreed upon<lf> between the Association and the Borrower, the Association may enter into special <lf> commitments in writing to pay amounts to the Borrower or others in respect of<lf> the cost of goods and services to be financed under the Development Credit<lf> Agreement notwithstanding any subsequent suspension or cancellation.<lf> <p>  Section 5.03\. Applications for Withdrawal or for Special Commitment.<lf> When the Borrower shall desire to withdraw any amount from the Credit Account or <lf> to request the Association to enter into a special commitment pursuant to<lf> Section 5.02, the Borrower shall deliver to the Association a written<lf> application in such form, and containing such statements and agreements, as the<lf> Association shall reasonably request. Applications for withdrawal, with the<lf> necessary documentation as hereinafter in this Article provided, shall be made<lf> promptly in relation to expenditures for the Project.<lf> <p>  Section 5.04\. Evidence of Authority to Sign Applications for Withdrawal.<lf>  The Borrower shall furnish to the Association evidence of the authority of<lf> the person or persons authorized to sign applications for withdrawals and the<lf> authenticated specimen signature of any such person.<lf> <p>  Section 5.05\. Supporting Evidence. The Borrower shall furnish to the<lf> Association such documents and other evidence in support of the application as<lf> the Association shall reasonably request, whether before or after the<lf> Association shall have permitted any withdrawal requested in the application.<lf> <p>  Section 5.06\. Sufficiency of Applications and Documents. Each<lf> application and the accompanying documents and other evidence must be sufficient <lf> in form and substance to satisfy the Association that the Borrower is entitled<lf> to withdraw from the Credit Account the amount applied for and that the amount<lf> to be withdrawn from the Credit Account is to be used only for the purposes<lf> specified in the Development Credit Agreement.<lf> <p>  Section 5.07\. Payment by the Association. Payment by the Association<lf> of amounts which the Borrower is entitled to withdraw from the Credit Account<lf> shall be made to or on the order of the Borrower.<lf> <p>                                  ARTICLE  VI<lf>                           Cancellation and Suspension<lf>   Section 6.01\. Cancellation by the Borrower.

Failure to Exercise Rights. No delay in exercising, or<lf> omission to exercise, any right, power or remedy accruing to either party under<lf> the Development Credit Agreement upon any default shall impair any such right,<lf> power or remedy or be construed to be a waiver thereof or an acquiescence in<lf> such default; nor shall the action of such party in respect of any default, or<lf> any acquiescence in any default, affect or impair any right, power or remedy of<lf> such party in respect of any other or subsequent default.<lf> <p>  Section 8.03\.

If, within 30 days after<lf> counterparts of the award shall be delivered to the parties, the award shall not <lf> be complied with by the Association, the Borrower may take any such action for<lf> the enforcement of the award against the Association.<lf> <p>  (l)  Service of any notice or process in connection with any proceeding under<lf> this Section or in connection with any proceeding to enforce any award rendered<lf> pursuant to this Section may be made in the manner provided in Section 9.01\.

Any modification or amplification of the<lf> provisions of the Development Credit Agreement may be agreed to on behalf of the <lf> Borrower by written instrument executed on behalf of the Borrower by the<lf> representative so designated or any person thereunto authorized in writing by<lf> him; provided, that, in the opinion of such representative, such modification or <lf> amplification is reasonable in the circumstances and will not substantially<lf> increase the obligations of the Borrower under the Development Credit Agreement. <lf> The Association may accept the execution by such representative or other person<lf> of any such instrument as conclusive evidence that in the opinion of such<lf> representative any modification or amplification of the provisions of the<lf> Development Credit Agreement effected by such instrument is reasonable in the<lf> circumstances and will not substantially increase the obligations of the<lf> Borrower thereunder.<lf> <p>  Section 9.04\.
