AGREEMENT, dated June 24, 1970, between THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA (hereinafter called the Guarantor) and INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT (hereinafter called the Bank).

WHEREAS by a Development Credit Agreement of even date herewith between the International Development Association (hereinafter called the Association) and the Administration of the TERRITORY OF PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA (hereinafter called the Borrower) the Association has agreed to make available to the Borrower a development credit in various currencies equivalent to four million five hundred thousand dollars ($4,500,000), on the terms and conditions set forth in the Development Credit Agreement; 

WHEREAS by a Loan Agreement of even date herewith between the Bank and the Borrower, the Bank has agreed to make to the Borrower a loan in various currencies equivalent to four million five hundred thousand dollars ($4,500,000), on the terms and conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement, but only on condition that the Guarantor agree to guarantee the obligations of the Borrower in respect of such loan as hereinafter provided; and 

WHEREAS the Guarantor, in consideration of the Bank’s entering into the Loan Agreement with the Borrower, has agreed so to guarantee such obligations of the Borrower;

NOW THEREFORE the parties hereto hereby agree as follows: 

ARTICLE I

Section 1.01\. The parties to this Guarantee Agreement accept all the provisions of the General Conditions Applicable to Loan and Guarantee Agreements of the Bank dated January 31, 1969, with the same force and effect as if they were fully set forth herein, subject, however, to the modifications thereof set forth in Schedule 2 to the Loan Agreement (said General Conditions Applicable to Loan and Guarantee Agreements, as so modified, being hereinafter called the General Conditions).

ARTICLE II

Section 2.01\. Without limitation or restriction upon any of the other covenants on its part in this Guarantee Agreement contained, the Guarantor hereby unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor and not as surety merely, the due and punctual payment of the principal of, and the interest and other charges on, the Loan, the principal of and interest on the Bonds, and the premium, if any, on the prepayment of the Loan or the redemption of the Bonds, all as provided in the Loan Agreement and in the Bonds. 

Section 2.02\. Without limitation or restriction upon the provisions of section 2.01 of this Guarantee Agreement, the Guarantor specifically undertakes, whenever there is reasonable cause to believe that the funds available to the Borrower will be inadequate to meet the estimated expenditures required for carrying out the Project, to make arrangements, satisfactory to the Bank, promptly to provide the Borrower or cause the Borrower to be provided with such funds as are needed to meet such expenditures. 

ARTICLE III

Section 3.01\. It is the mutual intention of the Guarantor and the Bank that no other external public debt shall enjoy any priority over the Loan by way of a lien on public assets. To that end the Guarantor undertakes that, except as the Bank shall otherwise agree, if any lien shall be created on any assets of the Guarantor or any agency of the Guarantor as security for any external debt, such lien shall equally and ratably secure the payment of the principal of an interest and other charges on the Loan and the Bonds, and that in the creation of any such lien express provision shall be made to that effect; and, within the limits of its constitutional powers, the Guarantor will make the foregoing undertaking effective with respect to liens on assets of the States and Territories of the Guarantor and their agencies (including local governing authorities). However, this Section shall not apply to: (i) any lien created on any property at the time of purchase thereof solely as security for the payment of the purchase price of such property; or (ii) any lien created by the Reserve Bank of Australia or the Commonwealth Trading Bank of Australia on any of their assets in the ordinary course of their banking business to secure any indebtedness maturing not more than one year after its date.

Section 3.02\. (a) The Guarantor and the Bank shall co‑operate fully to assure that the purposes of the Loan will be accomplished. To that end, each of them shall furnish to the other all such information as it shall reasonably request with regard to the general status of the Loan. On the part of the Guarantor, such information shall include information with respect to financial and economic conditions in the territories of the Guarantor and the international balance of payments position of the Guarantor.

(b) The Guarantor and the Bank shall from time to time exchange views through their representatives with regard to matters relating to the purposes of the Loan and the maintenance of the service thereof. The Guarantor shall promptly inform the Bank of any condition which interferes with, or threatens to interfere with, the accomplishment of the purposes of the Loan or the maintenance of the service thereof.

(c) The Guarantor shall afford all reasonable opportunity for accredited representatives of the Bank to visit any part of the territories of the Guarantor (including those of the Borrower) for purposes related to the Loan.

Section 3.03\. The principal of, and interest and other charges on, the Loan and the Bonds shall be paid without deduction for, and free from, any taxes, and free from all restrictions, imposed under the laws of the Guarantor or laws in effect in its territories; provided, however, that the provisions of this Section shall not apply to taxation of payments under any Bond to a holder thereof other than the Bank when such Bond is beneficially owned by an individual or corporate resident of the Guarantor or of its territories.

Section 3.04\. This Guarantee Agreement, the Loan Agreement and the Bonds shall be free from any taxes that shall be imposed under the laws of the Guarantor or laws in effect in its territories, on or in connection with the execution, issue, delivery, or registration thereof.

Cancellation and Suspension

Section 6.02\. _Suspension by the Bank_. If any of the following events shall have occurred and be continuing, the Bank may by notice to the Borrower and the Guarantor suspend in whole or in part the right of the Borrower to make withdrawals from the Loan Account: 

 (a)   The Borrower or the Guarantor shall have failed to make payment (notwithstanding the fact that such payment may have been made by a third party) of principal, interest, service charges or any other payment required under: (i) the Loan Agreement, the Guarantee Agreement or the Bonds, or (ii) any other loan or guarantee agreement with the Bank or any bond or similar instrument delivered pursuant to any such agreement, or (iii) any development credit agreement with the Association. 

(b)   The Borrower or the Guarantor shall have failed to perform any other obligation under the Loan Agreement, the Guarantee Agreement or the Bonds. 

 (c)   The Bank or the Association shall have suspended in whole or in part the right of the Borrower or the Guarantor to make withdrawals under any loan agreement with the Bank or any development credit agreement with the Association because of a failure by the Borrower or the Guarantor to perform any of its obligations under such agreement. 

 (d)   An extraordinary situation shall have arisen which shall make it improbable that the Project can be carried out or that the Borrower or the Guarantor will be able to perform its obligations under the Loan Agreement or the Guarantee Agreement or the Bonds. 

 (e)   The member of the Bank which is the Borrower or the Guarantor: (i) shall have been suspended from membership in or ceased to be a member of the Bank, or (ii) shall have ceased to be a member of the International Monetary Fund or shall have become, or shall have been declared ineligible to use the resources of said Fund. 

 (f)   After the date of the Loan Agreement and prior to the Effective Date any event shall have occurred which would have entitled the Bank to suspend the Borrower’s right to make withdrawals from the Loan Account if the Loan Agreement and the Guarantee Agreement had been effective on the date such event occurred. 

 (g)   Prior to the Effective Date, any material adverse change in the condition of the Borrower, as represented by the Borrower, shall have occurred. 

 (h)   A representation made by the Borrower or the Guarantor, in or pursuant to the Loan Agreement or the Guarantee Agreement or any statement furnished in connection therewith and intended to be relied upon by the Bank in making the Loan, shall have been incorrect in any material respect. 

 (i)    Any event specified in paragraphs (e) or (f) of Section 7.01 or in the Loan Agreement for the purposes of Section 7.01 shall have occurred. 

 (j)    Any other event specified in the Loan Agreement for the purposes of this Section shall have occurred. 

The right of the Borrower to make withdrawals from the Loan Account shall continue to be suspended in whole or in part, as the case may be, until the event or events which gave rise to such suspension shall have ceased to exist or until the Bank shall have notified the Borrower that the right to make withdrawals has been restored, whichever is the earlier; provided, however, that in case of any such notice of restoration, the right to make withdrawals shall be restored only to the extent and subject to the conditions specified in such notice, and no such notice shall affect or impair any right, power or remedy of the Bank in respect of any other or subsequent event described in this Section. 

Section 6.03\. _Cancellation by the Bank_. If (a) the right of the Borrower to make withdrawals from the Loan Account shall have been suspended with respect to any amount of the Loan for a continuous period of thirty days, or (b) at any time the Bank determines, after consultation with the Borrower, that an amount of the Loan will not be required to finance the Project’s costs to be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan, or (c) after the Closing Date an amount of the Loan shall remain unwithdrawn from the Loan Account, the Bank may by notice to the Borrower terminate the right of the Borrower to make withdrawals with respect to such amount. Upon the giving of such notice such amount of the Loan shall be cancelled. 

Section 6.04\. _Amounts Subject to Special Commitment Not Affected by Cancellation or Suspension by the Bank_.

ARTICLE VIII 

Bonds 

Section 8.01\. _Delivery of Bonds_. The Borrower shall, as soon as practicable and within such period not less than 60 days after the date of any request therefor as the Bank shall specify in such request, execute and deliver to or on the order of the Bank Bonds, having the guarantee of the Guarantor endorsed thereon, in the aggregate principal amount specified in such request, not exceeding, however, the aggregate principal amount of the Loan which shall have been withdrawn and shall be outstanding at the time of such request and for which Bonds shall not theretofore have been so delivered or requested. 

Section 8.02\. _Payments on Bonds_. The payment of the principal of any Bonds shall _pro tanto_ discharge the obligation of the Borrower to repay the principal of the Loan; and the payment of interest on any Bonds and of the service charge, if any, provided for in Section 8.03, shall _pro tanto_ discharge the obligation of the Borrower to pay interest in the Loan. 

Section 8.03\. _Interest on Bonds; Service Charge_. The Bonds shall bear interest at such rate or rates as the Bank shall request, not in excess, however, of the rate of interest on the loan. If the rate of interest on any Bond shall be less than the rate of interest on the Loan, the Borrower shall, in addition to the interest payable on such Bond, pay to the Bank a service charge on the principal amount of the Loan represented by such Bond at a rate equal to the difference between the interest rate on the Loan and the interest rate on such Bond. Such service charge shall be payable on the dates on which and in the currency in which such interest is payable. 

Section 8.04\. _Currency in Which Bonds Are Payable_. The Bonds shall be payable as to principal and interest in the several currencies in which the Loan is repayable. Each Bond delivered pursuant to any request under Section 8.01 or under Section 8.11 shall be payable in such currency as the Bank shall specify in such request except that the aggregate principal amount of Bonds payable in any currency shall at no time exceed the outstanding amount of the Loan repayable in such currency. 

Section 8.05\. _Maturities of Bonds_. (a) The maturities of the Bonds shall correspond to the maturities of instalments of the principal amount of the Loan set forth in the amortization schedule to the Loan Agreement. The Bonds delivered pursuant to any request under Section 8.01 or under Section 8.11 shall have such maturities as the Bank shall specify in such request except that the aggregate principal amount of Bonds of any maturity shall at no time exceed the corresponding instalment of the principal amount of the Loan. 

(b)   The Bank may, with the approval of the Guarantor, from time to time agree with the Borrower that some or all of the Bonds denominated in any currency shall have a single maturity date not later than the final maturity of the Loan set forth in the amortization schedule to the Loan Agreement and be subject to repurchase or redemption on such terms, not inconsistent with the obligation of the Borrower to make payments in such currency on the part of the Loan represented by such Bonds, as shall be agreed by the Bank and the Borrower. 

Section 8.06\. _Form of Bonds and Guarantee_. The Bonds shall be fully registered bonds without coupons (hereinafter sometimes called registered Bonds) or bearer bonds with coupons for semi‑annual interest attached (hereinafter sometimes called coupon Bonds). Bonds delivered to the Bank shall be registered Bonds or coupon Bonds as the Bank shall request. Registered Bonds payable in dollars shall be substantially in the form set forth in Schedule 1 to these General Conditions. Coupon Bonds payable in dollars shall be substantially in the same form with appropriate modifications to provide for payment to bearer, interest coupons and exchange for registered Bonds. The form of guarantee to be endorsed by the Guarantor upon the Bonds shall be substantially as set forth in Schedule 2 to these General Conditions. Bonds payable in any currency other than dollars and the guarantee endorsed thereon shall be substantially in the forms set forth in Schedules 1 and 2 to these General Conditions, except that they shall (a) provide for payment of principal, interest and premium on redemption, if any, in such other currency, (b) provide for such payment as the Bank shall specify, and (c) contain such other modifications as the Bank shall reasonably request in order to conform to the laws or to the financial usage of the place where they are payable. 

Section 8.07\. _Printing or Engraving of Bonds_. Except as the Bank and the Borrower shall otherwise agree and subject to the provisions of Section 8.11 (b), the Bonds shall be either (a) printed or lithographed on an engraved base having an engraved border or (b) fully engraved in conformity with the requirements of the leading securities exchange in the country in whose currency such Bonds are payable. 

Section 8.08\. _Date of Bonds_. Each registered Bond shall be dated the semi‑annual interest payment date on which or next preceding the date on which it shall be executed and delivered. Each coupon Bond shall be dated six months prior to the first semi‑annual interest payment date after the Effective Date except as the Bank and the Borrower shall otherwise agree, and shall be delivered with all unmatured coupons attached. Upon any delivery of Bonds appropriate adjustment shall be made so that there shall be no loss to the Bank or to the Borrower in respect of commitment charge or interest and service charge, if any, on the principal amount of the Loan represented by such Bonds. 

Section 8.09\. _Denominations of Bonds_. The Borrower shall authorize the issuance of Bonds in such denominations as the Bank shall reasonably request. The Bonds delivered pursuant to any request under Section 8.01 or under Section 8.11 shall be in such authorized denominations as the Bank shall specify in such request. 

Section 8.10\. _Execution of Bonds and Guarantee_. 

(a)   The Bonds and the guarantee endorsed thereon shall be signed in the name and on behalf of the Borrower and the Guarantor, respectively, by their authorized representative or representatives designated in the Loan Agreement and in the Guarantee Agreement for the purposes of this Section. The signature of any such representative may be a facsimile signature if the Bonds, or the guarantee, as the case may be, are also manually countersigned by an authorized representative of the Borrower or of the Guarantor. Coupons attached to coupon Bonds shall be authenticated by the facsimile signature of an authorized representative of the Borrower. 

(b)   If any authorized representative of the Borrower or of the Guarantor, as the case may be, whose manual or facsimile signature shall be affixed to any Bond, coupon, or guarantee shall cease to be such authorized representative, such Bond, with such guarantee endorsed thereon, or coupon may nevertheless be delivered, and shall be valid and binding on the Borrower and the Guarantor as though the person whose manual or facsimile signature shall have been affixed to such Bond, coupon, or guarantee had not ceased to be such authorized representative. 

Section 8.11\. _Exchange of Bonds_. The Borrower shall, as soon as practicable after the Bank shall so request, execute and deliver to or on the order of the Bank, in exchange for Bonds theretofore executed and delivered to it, new Bonds in accordance with the following provisions: 

 (a)   Bonds bearing interest at one rate may be exchanged for Bonds bearing interest at any other rate not in excess of the rate of interest on the Loan. 

 (b)   Bonds initially issued which are not fully engraved in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.07 (b) may be exchanged for such fully engraved Bonds. 

 (c)   Bonds payable in one currency may, subject to the provisions of Sections 8.04 and 8.05, be exchanged for a like aggregate principal amount of Bonds payable in the same or any other currency in which the Loan is repayable. 

 (d)   The Bank shall reimburse the Borrower for the reasonable cost of any exchange made pursuant to paragraphs (a) or (c) above. Any exchange made pursuant to paragraph (b) above or any exchange by the Bank of registered Bonds in large denominations for registered or coupon Bonds in smaller authorized denominations for purposes of sale by the Bank shall be without charge to the Bank. 

The foregoing rights of exchange are in addition to any rights of exchange provided in the Bonds. Except as in this Section expressly provided, exchanges of Bonds pursuant to this Section shall be subject to all provisions of the Bonds relating to exchanges. 

Section 8.12\. _Registration and Transfer of Registered Bonds_. The Borrower shall maintain, or cause to be maintained, books for the registration and transfer of registered Bonds. 

Section 8.13\. _Qualification and Listing of Bonds_. The Borrower and the Guarantor shall promptly furnish to the Bank such information and execute such applications and other documents as the Bank shall reasonably request in order to enable the Bank to sell any of the Bonds in any country, or to list any of the Bonds on any securities exchange, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. To the extent necessary to comply with the requirements of any such exchange, the Borrower and the Guarantor shall, if the Bank shall so request, appoint and maintain an agency for authentication of such Bonds. 

Section 8.14\. _Guarantee by the Bank of Payments on Bonds_. If the Bank shall sell any Bond and shall guarantee any payment thereunder, the Borrower or the Guarantor shall reimburse the Bank for any amount paid by the Bank under such guarantee by reason of any failure of the Borrower and the Guarantor to make payment in accordance with the terms of such Bond. 

Section 8.15\. _Redemption of Bonds_. 

(a)   The Bonds shall be subject to redemption prior to their maturity by the Borrower in accordance with their terms, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount thereof plus the interest accrued and unpaid thereon to the date fixed for the redemption thereof plus as a premium the percentages of said principal amount set forth in the amortization schedule to the Loan Agreement which shall be specified in the Bonds. 

(b)   If any Bond so to be redeemed shall bear interest at a rate less than the rate of interest on the Loan, the Borrower shall pay to the Bank on the date fixed for redemption the service charge provided for in Section 8.03 accrued and unpaid to such date on the principal amount of the Loan represented by such Bond. 

Section 8.16\. _Rights of Holders of Bonds_. No holder (other than the Bank) of any Bond shall, by virtue of being the holder thereof, be entitled to exercise any rights under the Loan Agreement or the Guarantee Agreement or be subject to any of the conditions or obligations imposed upon the Bank thereby. The provisions of this Section shall not impair or affect any rights or obligations under the terms of any Bond or of any guarantee endorsed thereon. 

Section 8.17\. _Delivery of Promissory Notes in Lieu of Bonds_. At the request of the Bank the Borrower shall execute and deliver to the Bank promissory notes in lieu of Bonds. Each note shall be payable to the order of such payee or payees, and at such place within the country in which the note is payable, as the Bank shall specify, and shall be dated the interest payment date next preceding the date of its delivery. Such note shall be in such customary form as the Bank and the Borrower shall mutually agree upon in order to conform to the laws or financial usage of the place where it is payable. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section or where the context otherwise requires, references in these General Conditions and the Loan Agreement and Guarantee Agreement to Bonds shall include any promissory notes executed and delivered under this Section. 

Section 8.18\. _Legal Opinions_. Upon the execution and delivery of any Bonds pursuant to this Article, the Borrower shall promptly at the Bank’s request furnish to the Bank an opinion or opinions of counsel acceptable to the Bank confirming as of the date of delivery of such Bonds that such Bonds constitute valid and binding obligations of the Borrower in accordance with their terms and that the guarantee endorsed thereon constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor in accordance with its terms.

The rights and obligations of the Bank, the Borrower and the Guarantor under the Loan Agreement, the Guarantee Agreement and the Bonds shall be valid and enforceable in accordance with their terms notwithstanding the law of any state, or political subdivision thereof, to the contrary. Neither the Bank nor the Borrower nor the Guarantor shall be entitled in any proceeding under this Article to assert any claim that any provision of these General Conditions or of the Loan Agreement, the Guarantee Agreement or the Bonds is invalid or unenforceable because of any provision of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank or for any other reason.

Section 9.03\. _Failure to Exercise Rights_. No delay in exercising, or omission to exercise, any right, power or remedy accruing to any party under the Loan Agreement or Guarantee Agreement upon any default shall impair any such right, power or remedy or be construed to be a waiver thereof or an acquiescence in such default; nor shall the action of such party in respect of any default, or any acquiescence in any default, affect or impair any right, power or remedy of such party in respect of any other or subsequent default. 

Section 9.04._Arbitration_. 

(a)   Any controversy between the parties to the Loan Agreement or the parties to the Guarantee Agreement, and any claim by any such party against any other such party arising under the Loan Agreement, the Guarantee Agreement or the Bonds which shall not be determined by agreement of the parties shall be submitted to arbitration by an Arbitral Tribunal as hereinafter provided.

If the parties shall not agree on such amount before the Arbitral Tribunal shall convene, the Arbitral Tribunal shall fix such amount as shall be reasonable under the circumstances. The Bank, the Borrower and the Guarantor shall each defray its own expenses in the arbitration proceedings. The costs of the Arbitral Tribunal shall be divided between and borne equally by the Bank on the one side and the Borrower and the Guarantor on the other.

(j)    The provisions for arbitration set forth in this Section shall be in lieu of any other procedure for the determination of controversies between the parties to the Loan Agreement and Guarantee Agreement or any claim by any such party against any other such party arising thereunder or under the Bonds. 

(k)   If within 30 days after counterparts of the award shall be delivered to the parties the award shall not be complied with, any party may enter judgment upon, or institute a proceeding to enforce, the award in any court of competent jurisdiction against any other party, may enforce such judgment by execution or may pursue any other appropriate remedy against such other party for the enforcement of the award, the provisions of the Loan Agreement, the Guarantee Agreement or the Bonds. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section shall not authorize any entry of judgment or enforcement of the award against any party that is a member of the Bank except as such procedure may be available otherwise than by reason of the provisions of this Section.

\[Name of Borrower]

\[Name of Bonds and Due Date]

\[Name of Borrower] (hereinafter called \[the Borrower]), for value received, hereby promises to pay to                            , or registered assigns, on the               day of              , 19      , at the office or agency of \[the Borrower] in the Borough of Manhattan, in The City of New York, the sum of                         DOLLARS in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for public and private debts, and to pay interest thereon from the date hereof at said office or agency in like coin or currency at the rate of               per centum (    %) per annum, payable semi‑annually on                         and                  until payment of said principal sum has been made or duly provided for. 

This Bond is one of an authorized issue of bonds in various currencies equivalent to an aggregate principal amount of                     , known as \[Name of Bonds] of \[the Borrower] (hereinafter called the Bonds), issued or to be issued under a Loan Agreement dated                        between International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (hereinafter called the Bank) and \[the Borrower] \[and guaranteed by (name of Guarantor) in accordance with the terms of a Guarantee Agreement dated                     between (name of Guarantor) and the Bank]. No reference herein to said Agreement\[s] shall confer upon the holder hereof any rights thereunder or impair the obligation of \[the Borrower], which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal and interest on this Bond at the times and place and in the amounts and in the currency herein prescribed. 

This Bond is transferable by the registered holder hereof, or by his attorney duly authorized in writing, at said office or agency of \[the Borrower] in the Borough of Manhattan, upon payment, if \[the Borrower] shall so require, of a charge calculated to reimburse \[the Borrower] for the cost of the transfer and upon surrender of this Bond for cancellation, duly endorsed or accompanied by a proper instrument or instruments of assignment and transfer. Upon any such transfer a new fully registered Bond or Bonds, without coupons, of authorized denominations, of the same maturity, payable in the same currency, and in the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the transferee in exchange for this Bond. 

Upon payment, if \[the Borrower] shall so require, of a charge calculated to reimburse \[the Borrower] for the cost of the exchange (1) bearer Bonds with interest coupons attached (hereinafter called coupon Bonds) of any maturity, together with all unmatured coupons thereto appertaining, may be exchanged upon presentation and surrender thereof at said office or agency in the Borough of Manhattan for coupon Bonds or other authorized denominations with all unmatured coupons thereto appertaining, or for fully registered Bonds without coupons (hereinafter called registered Bonds) of any authorized denominations, or both, of the same maturity, payable in the same currency, and in the same aggregate principal amount; and (2) registered Bonds of any maturity may be exchanged upon presentation and surrender at said office or agency, duly endorsed or accompanied by a proper instrument or instruments of assignment and transfer, for registered Bonds of other authorized denominations or for coupon Bonds of any authorized denominations with all unmatured coupons thereto appertaining, or both, of the same maturity, payable in the same currency, and in the same aggregate principal amount. 

\[The Borrower] shall not be required to make transfers or exchanges of any Bonds for a period of ten days next preceding any interest payment date thereof or of any Bonds called for redemption.

The Bonds are subject to redemption at the election of \[the Borrower], as hereinafter provided, at a redemption price for each Bond equal to the principal amount thereof, plus the interest accrued and unpaid thereon to the date fixed for the redemption thereof, plus as a premium the following respective percentages of such principal amount: \[insert percentages set forth in the amortization schedule to the Loan Agreement] . All the Bonds at the time outstanding of any one or more maturities may be so redeemed at any time, provided that, at the date fixed for the redemption of such Bonds, there shall not be outstanding any Bonds or any portion of the Loan provided for in said Loan Agreement maturing after the Bonds to be redeemed. If \[the Borrower] shall elect to redeem Bonds it shall give notice of intention to redeem all the Bonds, or all the Bonds of one or more designated maturities as hereinabove provided, as the case may be. Such notice shall designate the redemption date and shall state the redemption price or prices, determined as hereinbefore provided. Such notice shall be given by publication in two daily newspapers printed in the English language and published and of general circulation in said Borough of Manhattan at least once a week for three successive weeks, the first publication to be not less than 45 nor more than 60 days prior to said redemption date. Notice of election to redeem having been given as above provided, the Bonds so called for redemption shall become due and payable on said redemption date at their redemption price or prices, and upon presentation and surrender thereof on or after such date at said office or agency in said Borough of Manhattan, together with any appurtenant coupons maturing after said redemption date, shall be paid at the redemption price or prices aforesaid. All unpaid interest instalments represented by coupons which shall have matured on or prior to said redemption date shall continue to be payable to the bearers of such coupons severally and respectively, and the redemption price to the holders of coupon Bonds presented for redemption shall not include such unpaid instalments of interest unless coupons representing such instalments shall accompany the Bonds presented for redemption.

Except as the Borrower and the Association shall otherwise agree, the cost of goods and services financed out of the proceeds of the Credit shall be paid in the respective currencies of the countries from which such goods and services are acquired. Withdrawals from the Credit Account shall be made either in the respective currencies in which the cost of goods and services has been paid or is payable or in dollars, as the Association may from time to time elect; except that where withdrawals may be made in respect of expenditures in the currency of the Borrower, such withdrawals shall be made in such currency or currencies as the Association shall from time to time reasonably select. 

Section 4.02\. _Currencies in which Principal and Service Charges are Payable_.    (a)        The Borrower shall pay the principal amount of, and service charges on, the Credit in the currency specified in the Development Credit Agreement for the purposes of this Section or in such other eligible currency or currencies as may from time to time be designated or selected pursuant to paragraphs (c) or (e) of this Section. 

(b)   For the purposes of this Section, the term “eligible currency” means the currency of any member of the Association which the Association from time to time determines to be freely convertible or freely exchangeable by the Association for currencies of other members of the Association for the purposes of its operations. 

(c)   If at any time the Borrower shall desire that, commencing with a given future payment date, such principal and service charges shall be payable in an eligible currency other than that so specified or than one theretofore designated pursuant to this paragraph (c) or selected pursuant to paragraph (e) below, the Borrower shall deliver to the Association, not less than three nor more than five months prior to such payment date, a notice in writing to that effect and designating such other eligible currency, whereupon the currency so designated shall, commencing with such payment date, be the currency in which such principal and service charges shall be payable. 

(d)   If at any time the Association shall determine that a currency payable pursuant to the provisions of this Section is not an eligible currency, the Association shall so notify the Borrower in writing and furnish the Borrower with a list of eligible currencies. 

(e)   Within thirty days from the date of such notice, the Borrower shall notify the Association in writing of its selection from such list of a currency in which payment shall be made, failing which the Association shall select a currency for such purpose from such list, whereupon, in either case, such principal and service charges shall, commencing with the payment date next succeeding such thirty‑day period, be payable in the currency so selected. 

Section 4.03\. _Amount of Repayment_. The principal amount of the Credit repayable shall be the equivalent (determined as of the date, or the respective dates, of repayment) of the value of the currency or currencies withdrawn from the Credit Account expressed in terms of United States dollars of the weight and fineness in effect on January 1, 1960, determined as of the respective dates of withdrawal; provided, however: 

(i)    that if a uniform proportionate reduction in the par values of the currencies of all its members is made by the International Monetary Fund, the principal amount of the Credit then outstanding and repayable after such reduction shall be reduced by the same proportion; and 

(ii)   that if the Association shall at any time determine that there has been a substantial reduction in the par value or the foreign exchange value of one or more major currencies of members of the Association in terms of United States dollars of the weight and fineness in effect on January 1, 1960, which in the opinion of the Association shall justify a general reduction in the principal amount repayable on development credits then outstanding, the principal amount of the Credit then outstanding and repayable after such determination shall be reduced by such proportion as the Association shall decide. 

Section 4.04\. _Purchase of Currency of Withdrawal with Other Currency_. If withdrawal shall be made in any currency which the Association shall have purchased with another currency for the purpose of such withdrawal, the portion of the Credit so withdrawn shall be deemed to have been withdrawn from the Credit Account in such other currency for the purposes of Section 4.03\. 

Section 4.05\. _Valuation of Currencies_. Whenever it shall be necessary for the purpose of the Development Credit Agreement to determine the value of one currency in terms of another, such value shall be as reasonably determined by the Association. 

Section 4.06\. _Exchange Restrictions_. Any payment required under the Development Credit Agreement to be made to the Association in the currency of any country shall be made in such manner, and in currency acquired in such manner, as shall be permitted under the laws of such country for the purpose of making such payment and effecting the deposit of such currency to the account of the Association with a depository of the Association in such country. 

ARTICLE V 

Withdrawal of Proceeds of Credits 

Section 5.01\. _Withdrawal from the Credit Account_. The Borrower shall be entitled to withdraw from the Credit Account amounts expended or, if the Association shall so agree, amounts to be expended for the Project in accordance with the provisions of the Development Credit Agreement and of these General Conditions. Except as shall be otherwise agreed between the Borrower and the Association no withdrawals shall be made on account of (a) expenditures prior to the date of the Development Credit Agreement or (b) expenditures in the territories of any country which is not a member of the Bank (other than Switzerland) or for goods produced in, or services supplied from, such territories. 

Section 5.02\. _Special Commitments by the Association_. Upon the Borrower’s request and upon such terms and conditions as shall be agreed upon between the Association and the Borrower, the Association may enter into special commitments in writing to pay amounts to the Borrower or others in respect of the cost of goods and services to be financed under the Development Credit Agreement notwithstanding any subsequent suspension or cancellation. 

Section 5.03\. _Applications for Withdrawal or for Special Commitment_. When the Borrower shall desire to withdraw any amount from the Credit Account or to request the Association to enter into a special commitment pursuant to Section 5.02, the Borrower shall deliver to the Association a written application in such form, and containing such statements and agreements, as the Association shall reasonably request. Applications for withdrawal, with the necessary documentation as hereinafter in this Article provided, shall be made promptly in relation to expenditures for the Project. 

Section 5.04\. _Evidence of Authority to Sign Applications for Withdrawal_. The Borrower shall furnish to the Association evidence of the authority of the person or persons authorized to sign applications for withdrawals and the authenticated specimen signature of any such person.

Section 5.06\. _Sufficiency of Applications and Documents_. Each application and the accompanying documents and other evidence must be sufficient in form and substance to satisfy the Association that the Borrower is entitled to withdraw from the Credit Account the amount applied for and that the amount to be withdrawn from the Credit Account is to be used only for the purposes specified in the Development Credit Agreement. 

Section 5.07\. _Payment by the Association_. Payment by the Association of amounts which the Borrower is entitled to withdraw from the Credit Account shall be made to or on the order of the Borrower. 

ARTICLE VI 

Cancellation and Suspension 

Section 6.01\. _Cancellation by the Borrower_.

Section 6.02\. _Suspension by the Association_. If any of the following events shall have occurred and be continuing, the Association may by notice to the Borrower suspend in whole or in part the right of the Borrower to make withdrawals from the Credit Account: 

(a)   The Borrower shall have failed to make payment (notwithstanding the fact that such payment has been made by a third party) of principal, interest, service charges or any other payment required under: (i) the Development Credit Agreement, or (ii) any other development credit agreement with the Association, or (iii) any loan agreement or guarantee agreement with the Bank or any bond or any similar instrument delivered pursuant to any such agreement. 

(b)   The Borrower shall have failed to perform any other obligation under the Development Credit Agreement. 

(c)   (i)    The Association or the Bank shall have suspended in whole or in part the right of the Borrower to make withdrawals under any development credit agreement with the Association or any loan agreement with the Bank because of a failure by the Borrower to perform any of its obligations under such agreement; or (ii) the Bank shall have suspended in whole or in part the right of the borrower to make withdrawals under any loan agreement with the Bank guaranteed by the Borrower because of a failure by the Borrower to perform any of its obligations under such agreement. 

(d)   An extraordinary situation shall have arisen which shall make it improbable that the Project can be carried out or that the Borrower will be able to perform its obligations under the Development Credit Agreement. 

(e)   The Borrower: (i) shall have been suspended from membership in or ceased to be a member of the Association, or (ii) shall have ceased to be a member of the International Monetary Fund or shall have become, or shall have been declared ineligible to use the resources of said Fund. 

(f)   After the date of the Development Credit Agreement and prior to the Effective Date any event shall have occurred which would have entitled the Association to suspend the Borrower’s right to make withdrawals from the Credit Account if the Development Credit Agreement had been effective on the date such event occurred. 

(g)   A representation made by the Borrower, in or pursuant to the Development Credit Agreement, or any statement furnished in connection therewith, and intended to be relied upon by the Association in making the Credit shall have been incorrect in any material respect. 

(h)   Any event specified in the Development Credit Agreement for the purposes of Section 7.01 shall have occurred. 

(i)    Any other event specified in the Development Credit Agreement for the purposes of this Section shall have occurred. 

The right of the Borrower to make withdrawals from the Credit Account shall continue to be suspended in whole or in part, as the case may be, until the event or events which gave rise to such suspension shall have ceased to exist or until the Association shall have notified the Borrower that the right to make withdrawals has been restored, whichever is the earlier; provided, however, that in the case of any such notice of restoration, the right to make withdrawals shall be restored only to the extent and subject to the conditions specified in such notice, and no such notice shall affect or impair any right, power or remedy of the Association in respect of any other or subsequent event described in this Section. 

Section 6.03\. _Cancellation by the Association_. If (a) the right of the Borrower to make withdrawals from the Credit Account shall have been suspended with respect to any amount of the Credit for a continuous period of thirty days, or (b) at any time the Association determines, after consultation with the Borrower, that an amount of the Credit will not be required to finance the Project’s costs to be financed out of the proceeds of the Credit, or (c) after the Closing Date an amount of the Credit shall remain unwithdrawn from the Credit Account, the Association may by notice to the Borrower terminate the right of the Borrower to make withdrawals with respect to such amount. Upon the giving of such notice such amount of the Credit shall be cancelled. 

Section 6.04\. _Amounts Subject to Special Commitment Not Affected by Cancellation or Suspension by the Association_. No cancellation or suspension by the Association shall apply to amounts subject to any special commitment entered into by the Association pursuant to Section 5.02 except as expressly provided in such commitment. 

Section 6.05\. _Application of Cancellation to Maturities of the Credit_. Except as otherwise agreed between the Association and the Borrower, any cancellation shall be applied _pro rata_ to the several instalments of the principal amount of the Credit maturing after the date of such cancellation. 

Section 6.06\. _Effectiveness of Provisions after Suspension or Cancellation_. Notwithstanding any cancellation or suspension, all the provisions of the Development Credit Agreement and these General Conditions shall continue in full force and effect except as in this Article specifically provided. 

ARTICLE VII 

Acceleration of Maturity 

Section 7.01\. _Events of Default_. If any of the following events shall occur and shall continue for the period specified, if any, then at any subsequent time during the continuance thereof, the Association, at its option, may by notice to the Borrower declare the principal of the Credit then outstanding to be due and payable immediately together with the service charges thereon and upon any such declaration such principal, together with such charges, shall become due and payable immediately: 

(a)   A default shall occur in the payment of principal or any other payment required under the Development Credit Agreement and such default shall continue for a period of thirty days. 

(b)   A default shall occur in the payment of principal or interest or any other payment required under any other development credit agreement between the Association and the Borrower or under any loan agreement or under any guarantee agreement between the Borrower and the Bank or under any bond or similar instrument delivered pursuant to any such agreement and such default shall continue for a period of thirty days. 

(c)   A default shall occur in the performance of any other obligation on the part of the Borrower under the Development Credit Agreement, and such default shall continue for a period of sixty days after notice thereof shall have been given by the Association to the Borrower. 

(d)   Any other event specified in the Development Credit Agreement for the purposes of this Section shall have occurred and shall continue for the period, if any, specified in the Development Credit Agreement.

ARTICLE VIII 

Enforceability of Development Credit Agreement; Failure to Exercise Rights; Arbitration 

Section 8.01\. _Enforceability_. The rights and obligations of the Association and the Borrower under the Development Credit Agreement shall be valid and enforceable in accordance with their terms notwithstanding the law of any state, or political subdivision thereof, to the contrary. Neither the Association nor the Borrower shall be entitled in any proceeding under this Article to assert any claim that any provision of these General Conditions or the Development Credit Agreement is invalid or unenforceable because of any provision of the Articles of Agreement of the Association or for any other reason. 

Section 8.02\. _Failure to Exercise Rights_. No delay in exercising, or omission to exercise, any right, power or remedy accruing to either party under the Development Credit Agreement upon any default shall impair any such right, power or remedy or be construed to be a waiver thereof or an acquiescence in such default; nor shall the action of such party in respect of any default, or any acquiescence in any default, affect or impair any right, power or remedy of such party in respect of any other or subsequent default. 

Section 8.03\. _Arbitration_. (a)   Any controversy between the parties to the Development Credit Agreement and any claim by either such party against the other arising under the Development Credit Agreement which shall not be determined by agreement of the parties shall be submitted to arbitration by an Arbitral Tribunal as hereinafter provided. 

(b)   The parties to such arbitration shall be the Association and the Borrower. 

(c)   The Arbitral Tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators appointed as follows: one arbitrator shall be appointed by the Association; a second arbitrator shall be appointed by the Borrower; and the third arbitrator (hereinafter sometimes called the Umpire) shall be appointed by agreement of the parties or, if they shall not agree, by the President of the International Court of Justice or, failing appointment by him, by the Secretary‑General of the United Nations. If either of the parties shall fail to appoint an arbitrator, such arbitrator shall be appointed by the Umpire. In case any arbitrator appointed in accordance with this Section shall resign, die or become unable to act, a successor arbitrator shall be appointed in the same manner as herein prescribed for the appointment of the original arbitrator and such successor shall have all the powers and duties of such original arbitrator. 

(d)   An arbitration proceeding may be instituted under this Section upon notice by the party instituting such proceeding to the other party. Such notice shall contain a statement setting forth the nature of the controversy or claim to be submitted to arbitration, the nature of the relief sought, and the name of the arbitrator appointed by the party instituting such proceeding. Within 30 days after the giving of such notice, the other party shall notify to the party instituting the proceeding the name of the arbitrator appointed by such other party. 

(e)   If, within 60 days after the giving of such notice instituting the arbitration proceeding, the parties shall not have agreed upon an Umpire, either party may request the appointment of an Umpire as provided in paragraph (c) of this Section. 

(f)   The Arbitral Tribunal shall convene at such time and place as shall be fixed by the Umpire. Thereafter, the Arbitral Tribunal shall determine where and when it shall sit. 

(g)   Subject to the provisions of this Section and except as the parties shall otherwise agree, the Arbitral Tribunal shall decide all questions relating to its competence and shall determine its procedure. All decisions of the Arbitral Tribunal shall be by majority vote. 

(h)   The Arbitral Tribunal shall afford to the parties a fair hearing and shall render its award in writing. Such award may be rendered by default. An award signed by a majority of the Arbitral Tribunal shall constitute the award of such Tribunal. A signed counterpart of the award shall be transmitted to each party. Any such award rendered in accordance with the provisions of this Section shall be final and binding upon the parties to the Development Credit Agreement. Each party shall abide by and comply with any such award rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal in accordance with the provisions of this Section. 

(i)    The parties shall fix the amount of the remuneration of the arbitrators and such other persons as shall be required for the conduct of the arbitration proceedings. If the parties shall not agree on such amount before the Arbitral Tribunal shall convene, the Arbitral Tribunal shall fix such amount as shall be reasonable under the circumstances. Each party shall defray its own expenses in the arbitration proceedings. The costs of the Arbitral Tribunal shall be divided between and borne equally by the parties. Any question concerning the division of the costs of the Arbitral Tribunal or the procedure for payment of such costs shall be determined by the Arbitral Tribunal. 

(j)    The provisions for arbitration set forth in this Section shall be in lieu of any other procedure for the determination of controversies between the parties to the Development Credit Agreement and any claims by either party against the other party arising thereunder. 

(k)   The Association shall not be entitled to enter judgment against the Borrower upon the award, to enforce the award against the Borrower by execution or to pursue any other remedy against the Borrower for the enforcement of the award, except as such procedure may be available against the Borrower otherwise than by reason of the provisions of this Section. If, within 30 days after counterparts of the award shall be delivered to the parties, the award shall not be complied with by the Association, the Borrower may take any such action for the enforcement of the award against the Association. 

(l)    Service of any notice or process in connection with any proceeding under this Section or in connection with any proceeding to enforce any award rendered pursuant to this Section may be made in the manner provided in Section 9.01\. The parties to the Development Credit Agreement waive any and all other requirements for the service of any such notice or process. 

ARTICLE IX 

Miscellaneous Provisions 

Section 9.01\. _Notices and Requests_. Any notice or request required or permitted to be given or made under the Development Credit Agreement and any agreement between the parties contemplated by the Development Credit Agreement shall be in writing.
