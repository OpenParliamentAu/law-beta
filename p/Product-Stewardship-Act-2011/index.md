### Division 2—Guide to this Act

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Guide to this Act

* * *

This Act is about product stewardship.

Product stewardship is an approach to reducing the environmental and other impacts of products by encouraging or requiring manufacturers, importers, distributors and other persons to take responsibility for those products.

This Act provides a framework for 3 kinds of product stewardship.

_Voluntary product stewardship_

Part 2 is about voluntary product stewardship. This involves accrediting voluntary arrangements designed to further the objects of this Act in relation to products, and authorising the use of product stewardship logos in connection with such arrangements.

_Co‑regulatory product stewardship_

Part 3 is about co‑regulatory product stewardship. This involves requiring some manufacturers, importers, distributors and users of products (called liable parties), who have been specified in the regulations, to be members of co‑regulatory arrangements approved by the Minister.

These arrangements must have outcomes, specified in the regulations, that are designed to further the objects of this Act.

Administrators of approved co‑regulatory arrangements are required to take all reasonable steps to ensure those outcomes are achieved in accordance with the regulations.

_Mandatory product stewardship_

Part 4 is about mandatory product stewardship. This involves enabling regulations to be made that would require some persons to take, or not to take, specified action in relation to products.

_Objects of this Act and product stewardship criteria_

Before regulations are made specifying liable parties for a class of products under Part 3 (co‑regulatory product stewardship), or requiring action to be taken in relation to products under Part 4 (mandatory product stewardship), the Minister must be satisfied that:

               (a)     making the regulations will further the objects of this Act; and

              (b)     the product stewardship criteria are satisfied.

The objects of this Act and the product stewardship criteria are also relevant to determining whether to accredit a voluntary arrangement under Part 2\. They are set out in Division 3 of Part 1.

_Other introductory matters_

Part 1 also contains the Dictionary. The Dictionary is a list of every term that is defined in this Act. A term will either be defined in the Dictionary itself, or in another provision of this Act. If another provision defines the term, the Dictionary will have a signpost to that definition.

In addition, Part 1 deals with the application of this Act to the Crown and in the external Territories. It also deals with the relationship between this Act and State and Territory laws.

_Enforcing this Act_

Part 5 deals with enforcing this Act, including regulations and legislative instruments made under it.

Division 2 of that Part allows courts to order persons to pay pecuniary penalties for contravening provisions of this Act called civil penalty provisions.

Division 3 of that Part allows contraventions of this Act and adverse decisions (such as cancelling an arrangement’s accreditation or approval) to be publicised.

Division 4 of that Part deals with enforceable undertakings. If a person makes an undertaking relating to complying with this Act, the undertaking may be enforced by a court order.

Division 5 of that Part allows injunctions to be sought for contraventions, or potential contraventions, of this Act.

_Compliance powers_

Part 6 is about ensuring compliance with this Act.

Division 2 of that Part is about the powers of inspectors. These powers may be used for the purposes of determining whether a person is complying with this Act or for the purposes of investigating a possible contravention of this Act.

Division 3 of that Part is about gathering information for the purposes of investigating or preventing a possible contravention of a civil penalty provision or an offence provision in this Act.

_Reviewing decisions_

Part 7 is about reviewing some decisions made under this Act (called reviewable decisions).

Reviewable decisions (other than those made by the Minister personally) can be reviewed by the Minister (an internal review).

Reviewable decisions made by the Minister personally or on an internal review can be reviewed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

_Protecting information_

Part 8 is about protecting information (called protected information) obtained by or disclosed to persons in connection with this Act.

Disclosing protected information is an offence if it might substantially prejudice the commercial interests of a person, and the disclosure is not authorised by this Part.

There is also a limitation on the ability of courts and tribunals to require the disclosure of protected information.

_Miscellaneous matters_

Part 9 deals with a variety of miscellaneous matters, such as making applications, delegations and the power to make regulations.

### Division 3—Objects of this Act and product stewardship criteria

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Objects of this Act

Object—reducing impact of products

             (1)  It is an object of this Act to reduce the impact:

                     (a)  that products have on the environment, throughout their lives; and

                     (b)  that substances contained in products have on the environment, and on the health and safety of human beings, throughout the lives of those products.

             (2)  It is Parliament’s intention that this object be achieved by encouraging or requiring manufacturers, importers, distributors and other persons to take responsibility for those products, including by taking action that relates to the following:

                     (a)  avoiding generating waste from products;

                     (b)  reducing or eliminating the amount of waste from products to be disposed of;

                     (c)  reducing or eliminating hazardous substances in products and in waste from products;

                     (d)  managing waste from products as a resource;

                     (e)  ensuring that products and waste from products are reused, recycled, recovered, treated and disposed of in a safe, scientific and environmentally sound way.

Other objects

             (3)  The following are also objects of this Act:

                     (a)  to contribute to Australia meeting its international obligations concerning the impacts referred to in subsection (1);

                     (b)  to contribute to reducing the amount of greenhouse gases emitted, energy used and water consumed in connection with products and waste from products.

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Product stewardship criteria

                   The **_product stewardship criteria_** are satisfied in relation to a class of products if:

                     (a)  the products in the class are in a national market; and

                     (b)  at least one of the following applies in relation to the products in the class:

                              (i)  the products contain hazardous substances;

                             (ii)  there is the potential to significantly increase the conservation of materials used in the products, or the recovery of resources (including materials and energy) from waste from the products;

                            (iii)  there is the potential to significantly reduce the impact that the products have on the environment, or that substances in the products have on the environment, or on the health or safety of human beings.

Note:          Whether the product stewardship criteria are satisfied in relation to a class of products is relevant for determining whether:

(a)    to accredit a voluntary arrangement in relation to that class of products (see subsection 13(3)); or

(b)    regulations can be made under this Act in relation to the class of products (see sections 19 (co‑regulatory product stewardship—liable parties for class of products) and 39 (mandatory product stewardship requirements)).

## Part 2—Voluntary product stewardship

### Division 1—Guide to this Part

##### <a id="10"></a>10  Guide to this Part

* * *

This Part is about voluntary product stewardship.

This involves accrediting voluntary arrangements designed to further the objects of this Act in relation to products, and authorising the use of product stewardship logos in connection with such arrangements.

In accrediting a voluntary arrangement, the accrediting authority must have regard to matters such as:

               (a)     whether the arrangement’s outcomes will further the objects of this Act and are likely to be achieved; and

              (b)     whether the product stewardship criteria are satisfied in relation to the products to which the arrangement relates; and

               (c)     the appropriate use of product stewardship logos under the arrangement; and

              (d)     the public interest.

Other matters relating to accreditation can be dealt with in legislative instruments.

## Part 3—Co‑regulatory product stewardship

### Division 1—Guide to this Part

##### <a id="17"></a>17  Guide to this Part

* * *

This Part is about co‑regulatory product stewardship.

Under Division 2, some manufacturers, importers, distributors and users of products (called liable parties) are required to be members of co‑regulatory arrangements approved by the Minister (see section 18). Liable parties are specified in the regulations (see section 19).

These arrangements must have outcomes, specified in the regulations, that are designed to further the objects of this Act (see section 21).

Administrators of approved co‑regulatory arrangements are required to take all reasonable steps to ensure those outcomes are achieved in accordance with the regulations (see section 23).

Before regulations are made specifying liable parties in relation to a class of products, the Minister must be satisfied that, among other things:

               (a)     making the regulations will further the objects of this Act; and

              (b)     the product stewardship criteria are satisfied.

Division 2 also contains requirements for liable parties and administrators of co‑regulatory arrangements relating to record‑keeping, giving information and reporting (see section 24).

Division 3 deals with approving co‑regulatory arrangements.

Division 4 deals with reviewing co‑regulatory arrangements and cancelling approvals.

Division 5 contains special rules for enforcing approved co‑regulatory arrangements. These include the ability to give improvement notices to administrators, and requiring arrangements to be audited.

Division 6 deals with other matters relating to co‑regulatory product stewardship, such as anti‑avoidance, replacing the administrator of an arrangement and constitutional limitations.
