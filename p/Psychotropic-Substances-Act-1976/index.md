_Scope of control of substances_

1.    If a Party or the World Health Organization has information relating to a substance not yet under international control which in its opinion may require the addition of that substance to any of the Schedules of this Convention, it shall notify the Secretary‑General and furnish him with the information in support of that notification. The foregoing procedure shall also apply when a Party or the World Health Organization has information justifying the transfer of a substance from one Schedule to another among those Schedules, or the deletion of a substance from the Schedules.

2.    The Secretary‑General shall transmit such notification, and any information which he considers relevant, to the Parties, to the Commission and, when the notification is made by a Party, to the World Health Organization.

3.    If the information transmitted with such a notification indicates that the substance is suitable for inclusion in Schedule I or Schedule II pursuant to paragraph 4, the Parties shall examine, in the light of all information available to them, the possibility of the provisional application to the substance of all measures of control applicable to substances in Schedule I or Schedule II, as appropriate. 

4.    If the World Health Organization finds: 

          (a)   that the substance has the capacity to produce 

                     (i)    (1)   a state of dependence, and 

                            (2)   central nervous system stimulation or depression, resulting in halucinations or disturbances in motor function or thinking or behaviour or perception or mood, or

                     (ii)   similar abuse and similar ill effects as a substance in Schedule I, II, III or IV, and 

          (b)   that there is sufficient evidence that the substance is being or is likely to be abused so as to constitute a public health and social problem warranting the placing of the substance under international control, 

the World Health Organization shall communicate to the Commission an assessment of the substance, including the extent or likelihood of abuse, the degree of seriousness of the public health and social problem and the degree of usefulness of the substance in medical therapy, together with recommendations on control measures, if any, that would be appropriate in the light of its assessment. 

5.    The Commission, taking into account the communication from the World Health Organization, whose assessments shall be determinative as to medical and scientific matters, and bearing in mind the economic, social, legal, administrative and other factors it may consider relevant, may add the substance to Schedule I, II, III or IV. The Commission may seek further information from the World Health Organization or from other appropriate sources. 

6.    If a notification under paragraph 1 relates to a substance already listed in one of the Schedules, the World Health Organization shall communicate to the Commission its new findings, any new assessment of the substance it may make in accordance with paragraph 4 and any new recommendations on control measures it may find appropriate in the light of that assessment. The Commission, taking into account the communication from the World Health Organization as under paragraph 5 and bearing in mind the factors referred to in that paragraph, may decide to transfer the substance from one Schedule to another or to delete it from the Schedules.

7.    Any decision of the Commission taken pursuant to this article shall be communicated by the Secretary‑General to all States Members of the United Nations, to non‑member States Parties to this Convention, to the World Health Organization and to the Board. Such decision shall become fully effective with respect to each Party 180 days after the date of such communication, except for any Party which, within that period, in respect of a decision adding a substance to a Schedule, has transmitted to the Secretary‑General a written notice that, in view of exceptional circumstances, it is not in a position to give effect with respect to that substance to all of the provisions of the Convention applicable to substances in that Schedule. Such notice shall state the reasons for this exceptional action. Notwithstanding its notice, each Party shall apply, as a minimum, the control measures listed below:

8.  (a)   The decisions of the Commission taken under this article shall be subject to review by the Council upon the request of any Party filed within 180 days from receipt of notification of the decision. The request for review shall be sent to the Secretary‑General together with all relevant information upon which the request for review is based. 

(b) The Secretary‑General shall transmit copies of the request for review and the relevant information to the Commission, to the World Health Organization and to all the Parties, inviting them to submit comments within ninety days. All comments received shall be submitted to the Council for consideration. 

(c) The Council may confirm, alter or reverse the decision of the Commission. Notification of the Council’s decision shall be transmitted to all States Members of the United Nations, to non‑member States Parties to this Convention, to the Commission, to the World Health Organization and to the Board. 

(d) During pendency of the review, the original decision of the Commission shall, subject to paragraph 7, remain in effect. 

9.    The Parties shall use their best endeavours to apply to substances which do not fall under this Convention, but which may be used in the illicit manufacture of psychotropic substances, such measures of supervision as may be practicable. 

ARTICLE 3 

Special provisions regarding the control of preparations 

1.    Except as provided in the following paragraphs of this article, a preparation is subject to the same measures of control as the psychotropic substance which it contains, and, if it contains more than one such substance, to the measures applicable to the most strictly controlled of those substances.

2.    If a preparation containing a psychotropic substance other than a substance in Schedule I is compounded in such a way that it presents no, or a negligible, risk of abuse and the substance cannot be recovered by readily applicable means in a quantity liable to abuse, so that the preparation does not give rise to a public health and social problem, the preparation may be exempted from certain of the measures of control provided in this Convention in accordance with paragraph 3.

3.    If a Party makes a finding under the preceding paragraph regarding a preparation, it may decide to exempt the preparation, in its country or in one of its regions, from any or all of the measures of control provided in this Convention except the requirements of: 

     (a)   article 8 (licences), as it applies to manufacture; 

     (b)   article 11 (records), as it applies to exempt preparations; 

     (c)   article 13 (prohibition of and restrictions on export and import); 

     (d)   article 15 (inspection), as it applies to manufacture; 

     (e)   article 16 (reports to be furnished by the Parties), as it applies to exempt preparations; and 

     (f)   article 22 (penal provisions), to the extent necessary for the repression of acts contrary to laws or regulations adopted pursuant to the foregoing obligations. 

A Party shall notify the Secretary‑General of any such decision, of the name and composition of the exempt preparation, and of the measures of control from which it is exempted. The Secretary‑General shall transmit the notification to the other Parties, to the World Health Organization and to the Board.

4.    If a Party or the World Health Organization has information regarding a preparation exempted pursuant to paragraph 3 which in its opinion may require the termination, in whole or in part, of the exemption, it shall notify the Secretary‑General and furnish him with the information in support of the notification. The Secretary‑General shall transmit such notification, and any information which he considers relevant, to the Parties, to the Commission and, when the notification is made by a Party, to the World Health Organization. The World Health Organization shall communicate to the Commission an assessment of the preparation in relation to the matters specified in paragraph 2, together with a recommendation of the control measures, if any, from which the preparation should cease to be exempted. The Commission, taking into account the communication from the World Health Organization, whose assessment shall be determinative as to medical and scientific matters, and bearing in mind the economic, social, legal, administrative and other factors it may consider relevant, may decide to terminate the exemption of the preparation from any or all control measures. Any decision of the Commission taken pursuant to this paragraph shall be communicated by the Secretary‑General to all States Members of the United Nations, to non‑member States Parties to this Convention, to the World Health Organization and to the Board. All Parties shall take measures to terminate the exemption from the control measure or measures in question within 180 days of the date of the Secretary‑General’s communication. 

ARTICLE 4 

Other special provisions regarding the scope of control 

In respect of psychotropic substances other than those in Schedule I, the Parties may permit: 

     (a)   the carrying by international travellers of small quantities of preparations for personal use; each Party shall be entitled, however, to satisfy itself that these preparations have been lawfully obtained; 

     (b)   the use of such substances in industry for the manufacture of non‑psychotropic substances or products, subject to the application of the measures of control required by this Convention until the psychotropic substances come to be in such a condition that they will not in practice be abused or recovered; 

     (c)   the use of such substances, subject to the application of the measures of control required by this Convention, for the capture of animals by persons specifically authorized by the competent authorities to use such substances for that purpose. 

ARTICLE 5 

Limitation for use to medical and scientific purposes 

1.    Each party shall limit the use of substances in Schedule I as provided in article 7\. 

2.    Each Party shall, except as provided in article 4, limit by such measures as it considers appropriate the manufacture, export, import, distribution and stocks of, trade in, and use and possession of, substances in Schedules II, III and IV to medical and scientific purposes. 

3.    It is desirable that the Parties do not permit the possession of substances in Schedule II, III and IV except under legal authority. 

ARTICLE 6 

Special administration 

It is desirable that for the purpose of applying the provisions of this Convention, each Party establish and maintain a special administration, which may with advantage be the same as, or work in close co‑operation with, the special administration established pursuant to the provisions of conventions for the control of narcotic drugs. 

ARTICLE 7 

Special provisions regarding substances in Schedule I

In respect of substances in Schedule I, the Parties shall:

     (f)   prohibit export and import except when both the exporter and importer are the competent authorities or agencies of the exporting and importing country or region, respectively, or other persons or enterprises which are specifically authorized by the competent authorities of their country or region for the purpose. The requirements of paragraph 1 of article 12 for export and import authorizations for substances in Schedule II shall also apply to substances in Schedule I.

ARTICLE 8 

Licences 

1.    The Parties shall require that the manufacture of, trade (including export and import trade) in, and distribution of substances listed in Schedules II, III and IV be under licence or other similar control measure.

Provisions relating to international trade 

1.  (a)   Every Party permitting the export or import of substances in Schedule I or II shall require a separate import or export authorization, on a form to be established by the Commission, to be obtained for each such export or import whether it consists of one or more substances. 

(b)   Such authorization shall state the international non‑proprietary name, or, lacking such a name, the designation of the substance in the Schedule, the quantity to be exported or imported, the pharmaceutical form, the name and address of the exporter and importer, and the period within which the export or import must be effected. If the substance is exported or imported in the form of a preparation, the name of the preparation, if any, shall additionally be furnished. The export authorization shall also state the number and date of the import authorization and the authority by whom it has been issued.

(c)   Before issuing an export authorization the Parties shall require an import authorization, issued by the competent authority of the importing country or region and certifying that the importation of the substance or substances referred to therein is approved, and such an authorization shall be produced by the person or establishment applying for the export authorization. 

(d)   A copy of the export authorization shall accompany each consignment, and the Government issuing the export authorization shall send a copy to the Government of the importing country or region.

(e)   The Government of the importing country or region, when the importation has been effected, shall return the export authorization with an endorsement certifying the amount actually imported, to the Government of the exporting country or region. 

2.  (a)   The Parties shall require that for each export of substances in Schedule III exporters shall draw up a declaration in triplicate, on a form to be established by the Commission, containing the following information:

      (i)  the name and address of the exporter and importer; 

     (ii)  the international non‑proprietary name, or, failing such a name, the designation of the substance in the Schedule; 

    (iii)  the quantity and pharmaceutical form in which the substance is exported, and, if in the form of a preparation, the name of the preparation, if any; and 

    (iv)  the date of despatch. 

(b)   Exporters shall furnish the competent authorities of their country or region with two copies of the declaration. They shall attach the third copy to their consignment. 

(c)   A Party from whose territory a substance in Schedule III has been exported shall, as soon as possible but not later than ninety days after the date of despatch, send to the competent authorities of the importing country or region, by registered mail with return of receipt requested, one copy of the declaration received from the exporter. 

(d)   The Parties may require that, on receipt of the consignment, the importer shall transmit the copy accompanying the consignment, duly endorsed stating the quantities received and the date of receipt, to the competent authorities of his country or region. 

3.    In respect of substances in Schedules I and II the following additional provisions shall apply: 

     (a)   The Parties shall exercise in free ports and zones the same supervision and control as in other parts of their territory, provided, however, that they may apply more drastic measures.

     (c)   Exports to bonded warehouses of consignments of substances in Schedule I are prohibited. Exports of consignments of substances in Schedule II to a bonded warehouse are prohibited unless the Government of the importing country certifies on the import authorization, produced by the person or establishment applying for the export authorization, that it has approved the importation for the purpose of being placed in a bonded warehouse. In such case the export authorization shall certify that the consignment is exported for such purpose. Each withdrawal from the bonded warehouse shall require a permit from the authorities having jurisdiction over the warehouse and, in the case of a foreign destination, shall be treated as if it were a new export within the meaning of this Convention.

     (d)   Consignments entering or leaving the territory of a Party not accompanied by an export authorization shall be detained by the competent authorities. 

     (e)   A Party shall not permit any substances consigned to another country to pass through its territory, whether or not the consignment is removed from the conveyance in which it is carried, unless a copy of the export authorization for consignment is produced to the competent authorities of such Party. 

     (f)   The competent authorities of any country or region through which a consignment of substances is permitted to pass shall take all due measures to prevent the diversion of the consignment to a destination other than that named in the accompanying copy of the export authorization, unless the Government of the country or region through which the consignment is passing authorizes the diversion. The Government of the country or region of transit shall treat any requested diversion as if the diversion were an export from the country or region of transit to the country or region of new destination. If the diversion is authorized, the provisions of paragraph 1 (e) shall also apply between the country or region of transit and the country or region which originally exported the consignment. 

     (g)   No consignment of substances, while in transit or whilst being stored in a bonded warehouse, may be subjected to any process which would change the nature of the substance in question. The packing may not be altered without the permission of the competent authorities. 

     (h)   The provisions of sub‑paragraphs (e) to (g) relating to the passage of substances through the territory of a Party do not apply where the consignment in question is transported by aircraft which does not land in the country or region of transit. If the aircraft lands in any such country or region, those provisions shall be applied so far as circumstances require.

2.    Appropriate safeguards shall be taken by the country of registry to prevent the improper use of the substances referred to in paragraph 1 or their diversion for illicit purposes. The Commission, in consultation with the appropriate international organizations, shall recommend such safeguards.
