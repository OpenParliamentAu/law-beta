(a) The decisions of the Commission taken under this article<lf> shall be subject to review by the Council upon the request of<lf> any Party filed within 180 days from receipt of notification of<lf> the decision.

Notification of the Council's decision shall be<lf> transmitted to all States Members of the United Nations, to<lf> non-member States Parties to this Convention, to the<lf> Commission, to the World Health Organization and to the Board.<lf> (d) During pendency of the review, the original decision of the<lf> Commission shall, subject to paragraph 7, remain in effect.<lf> 9\. The Parties shall use their best endeavours to apply to<lf> substances which do not fall under this Convention, but which<lf> may be used in the illicit manufacture of psychotropic<lf> substances, such measures of supervision as may be practicable.<lf>                            ARTICLE 3<lf>    Special provisions regarding the control of preparations<lf> 1\. Except as provided in the following paragraphs of this<lf> article, a preparation is subject to the same measures of<lf> control as the psychotropic substance which it contains, and,<lf> if it contains more than one such substance, to the measures<lf> applicable to the most strictly controlled of those substances.<lf> 2\. If a preparation containing a psychotropic substance other<lf> than a substance in Schedule I is compounded in such a way that<lf> it presents no, or a negligible, risk of abuse and the<lf> substance cannot be recovered by readily applicable means in a<lf> quantity liable to abuse, so that the preparation does not give<lf> rise to a public health and social problem, the preparation may<lf> be exempted from certain of the measures of control provided in<lf> this Convention in accordance with paragraph 3.<lf> 3\. If a Party makes a finding under the preceding paragraph<lf> regarding a preparation, it may decide to exempt the<lf> preparation, in its country or in one of its regions, from any<lf> or all of the measures of control provided in this Convention<lf> except the requirements of:<lf> (a) article 8 (licences), as it applies to manufacture;<lf> (b) article 11 (records), as it applies to exempt preparations;<lf> (c) article 13 (prohibition of and restrictions on export and<lf> import);<lf> (d) article 15 (inspection), as it applies to manufacture;<lf> (e) article 16 (reports to be furnished by the Parties), as it<lf> applies to exempt preparations; and<lf> (f) article 22 (penal provisions), to the extent necessary for<lf> the repression of acts contrary to laws or regulations adopted<lf> pursuant to the foregoing obligations.<lf> A Party shall notify the Secretary-General of any such<lf> decision, of the name and composition of the exempt<lf> preparation, and of the measures of control from which it is<lf> exempted. The Secretary-General shall transmit the notification<lf> to the other Parties, to the World Health Organization and to<lf> the Board.<lf> 4\. If a Party or the World Health Organization has information<lf> regarding a preparation exempted pursuant to paragraph 3 which<lf> in its opinion may require the termination, in whole or in<lf> part, of the exemption, it shall notify the Secretary-General<lf> and furnish him with the information in support of the<lf> notification.

Exports of consignments of<lf> substances in Schedule II to a bonded warehouse are prohibited<lf> unless the Government of the importing country certifies on the<lf> import authorization, produced by the person or establishment<lf> applying for the export authorization, that it has approved the<lf> importation for the purpose of being placed in a bonded<lf> warehouse. In such case the export authorization shall certify<lf> that the consignment is exported for such purpose. Each<lf> withdrawal from the bonded warehouse shall require a permit<lf> from the authorities having jurisdiction over the warehouse<lf> and, in the case of a foreign destination, shall be treated as<lf> if it were a new export within the meaning of this Convention.<lf> (d) Consignments entering or leaving the territory of a Party<lf> not accompanied by an export authorization shall be detained by<lf> the competent authorities.<lf> (e) A Party shall not permit any substances consigned to<lf> another country to pass through its territory, whether or not<lf> the consignment is removed from the conveyance in which it is<lf> carried, unless a copy of the export authorization for<lf> consignment is produced to the competent authorities of such<lf> Party.<lf> (f) The competent authorities of any country or region through<lf> which a consignment of substances is permitted to pass shall<lf> take all due measures to prevent the diversion of the<lf> consignment to a destination other than that named in the<lf> accompanying copy of the export authorization, unless the<lf> Government of the country or region through which the<lf> consignment is passing authorizes the diversion. The Government<lf> of the country or region of transit shall treat any requested<lf> diversion as if the diversion were an export from the country<lf> or region of transit to the country or region of new<lf> destination. If the diversion is authorized, the provisions of<lf> paragraph 1 (e) shall also apply between the country or region<lf> of transit and the country or region which originally exported<lf> the consignment.<lf> (g) No consignment of substances, while in transit or whilst<lf> being stored in a bonded warehouse, may be subjected to any<lf> process which would change the nature of the substance in<lf> question. The packing may not be altered without the permission<lf> of the competent authorities.<lf> (h) The provisions of sub-paragraphs (e) to (g) relating to the<lf> passage of substances through the territory of a Party do not<lf> apply where the consignment in question is transported by<lf> aircraft which does not land in the country or region of<lf> transit. If the aircraft lands in any such country or region,<lf> those provisions shall be applied so far as circumstances<lf> require.<lf> (i) The provisions of this paragraph are without prejudice to<lf> the provisions of any international agreements which limit the<lf> control which may be exercised by any of the Parties over such<lf> substances in transit.<lf>                            ARTICLE 13<lf>      Prohibition of and restrictions on export and import<lf> 1\.

Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding paragraphs,<lf> a Party which has given notification pursuant to paragraph 1<lf> may authorize by special import licence in each case the import<lf> of specified quantities of the substances in question or<lf> preparations containing such substances. The issuing authority<lf> of the importing country shall send two copies of the special<lf> import licence, indicating the name and address of the importer<lf> and the exporter, to the competent authority of the exporting<lf> country or region, which may then authorize the exporter to<lf> make the shipment. One copy of the special import licence, duly<lf> endorsed by the competent authority of the exporting country or<lf> region, shall accompany the shipment.<lf>                            ARTICLE 14<lf>   Special provisions concerning the carriage of psychotropic<lf> substances in first-aid kits of ships, aircraft or other forms<lf>     of public transport engaged in international traffic<lf> 1\.

The<lf> Commission, in consultation with the appropriate international<lf> organizations, shall recommend such safeguards.<lf> 3\.

The denunciation, if received by the Secretary-General on or<lf> before the first day of July of any year, shall take effect on<lf> the first day of January of the succeeding year, and if<lf> received after the first day of July it shall take effect as if<lf> it had been received on or before the first day of July in the<lf> succeeding year.<lf> 3\.
