(a) The decisions of the Commission taken under this article shall be<lf> subject to review by the Council upon the request of any Party filed within 180<lf> days from receipt of notification of the decision. The request for review shall<lf> be sent to the Secretary-General together with all relevant information upon<lf> which the request for review is based.<lf> <p>  (b) The Secretary-General shall transmit copies of the request for review and<lf> the relevant information to the Commission, to the World Health Organization and <lf> to all the Parties, inviting them to submit comments within ninety days.

The Parties shall use their best endeavours to apply to substances which do <lf> not fall under this Convention, but which may be used in the illicit manufacture <lf> of psychotropic substances, such measures of supervision as may be practicable.<lf> <p>                                   ARTICLE  3<lf>             Special provisions regarding the control of preparations<lf>   1\. Except as provided in the following paragraphs of this article, a<lf> preparation is subject to the same measures of control as the psychotropic<lf> substance which it contains, and, if it contains more than one such substance,<lf> to the measures applicable to the most strictly controlled of those substances.<lf> <p>  2\.  If a preparation containing a psychotropic substance other than a<lf> substance in Schedule I is compounded in such a way that it presents no, or a<lf> negligible, risk of abuse and the substance cannot be recovered by readily<lf> applicable means in a quantity liable to abuse, so that the preparation does not <lf> give rise to a public health and social problem, the preparation may be exempted <lf> from certain of the measures of control provided in this Convention in<lf> accordance with paragraph 3.<lf> <p>  3\. If a Party makes a finding under the preceding paragraph regarding a<lf> preparation, it may decide to exempt the preparation, in its country or in one<lf> of its regions, from any or all of the measures of control provided in this<lf> Convention except the requirements of:<lf>   (a)  article 8 (licences), as it applies to manufacture;<lf>   (b)  article 11 (records), as it applies to exempt preparations;<lf>   (c)  article 13 (prohibition of and restrictions on export and import);<lf>   (d)  article 15 (inspection), as it applies to manufacture;<lf>   (e)  article 16 (reports to be furnished by the Parties), as it applies to<lf> exempt preparations; and<lf>   (f)  article 22 (penal provisions), to the extent necessary for the repression <lf> of acts contrary to laws or regulations adopted pursuant to the foregoing<lf> obligations.<lf> <p><lf> A Party shall notify the Secretary-General of any such decision, of the name and <lf> composition of the exempt preparation, and of the measures of control from which <lf> it is exempted. The Secretary-General shall transmit the notification to the<lf> other Parties, to the World Health Organization and to the Board.<lf> <p>  4\. If a Party or the World Health Organization has information regarding a<lf> preparation exempted pursuant to paragraph 3 which in its opinion may require<lf> the termination, in whole or in part, of the exemption, it shall notify the<lf> Secretary-General and furnish him with the information in support of the<lf> notification. The Secretary-General shall transmit such notification, and any<lf> information which he considers relevant, to the Parties, to the Commission and,<lf> when the notification is made by a Party, to the World Health Organization. The<lf> World Health Organization shall communicate to the Commission an assessment of<lf> the preparation in relation to the matters specified in paragraph 2, together<lf> with a recommendation of the control measures, if any, from which the<lf> preparation should cease to be exempted. The Commission, taking into account the <lf> communication from the World Health Organization, whose assessment shall be<lf> determinative as to medical and scientific matters, and bearing in mind the<lf> economic, social, legal, administrative and other factors it may consider<lf> relevant, may decide to terminate the exemption of the preparation from any or<lf> all control measures. Any decision of the Commission taken pursuant to this<lf> paragraph shall be communicated by the Secretary-General to all States Members<lf> of the United Nations, to non-member States Parties to this Convention, to the<lf> World Health Organization and to the Board.

Exports of consignments of substances in Schedule II to a bonded <lf> warehouse are prohibited unless the Government of the importing country<lf> certifies on the import authorization, produced by the person or establishment<lf> applying for the export authorization, that it has approved the importation for<lf> the purpose of being placed in a bonded warehouse. In such case the export<lf> authorization shall certify that the consignment is exported for such purpose.<lf> Each withdrawal from the bonded warehouse shall require a permit from the<lf> authorities having jurisdiction over the warehouse and, in the case of a foreign <lf> destination, shall be treated as if it were a new export within the meaning of<lf> this Convention.<lf> <p><lf>   (d)  Consignments entering or leaving the territory of a Party not accompanied <lf> by an export authorization shall be detained by the competent authorities.<lf> <p><lf>   (e)  A Party shall not permit any substances consigned to another country to<lf> pass through its territory, whether or not the consignment is removed from the<lf> conveyance in which it is carried, unless a copy of the export authorization for <lf> consignment is produced to the competent authorities of such Party.<lf> <p><lf>   (f)  The competent authorities of any country or region through which a<lf> consignment of substances is permitted to pass shall take all due measures to<lf> prevent the diversion of the consignment to a destination other than that named<lf> in the accompanying copy of the export authorization, unless the Government of<lf> the country or region through which the consignment is passing authorizes the<lf> diversion. The Government of the country or region of transit shall treat any<lf> requested diversion as if the diversion were an export from the country or<lf> region of transit to the country or region of new destination. If the diversion<lf> is authorized, the provisions of paragraph 1 (e) shall also apply between the<lf> country or region of transit and the country or region which originally exported <lf> the consignment.<lf> <p><lf>   (g)  No consignment of substances, while in transit or whilst being stored in<lf> a bonded warehouse, may be subjected to any process which would change the<lf> nature of the substance in question.

Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding paragraphs, a Party which<lf> has given notification pursuant to paragraph 1 may authorize by special import<lf> licence in each case the import of specified quantities of the substances in<lf> question or preparations containing such substances. The issuing authority of<lf> the importing country shall send two copies of the special import licence,<lf> indicating the name and address of the importer and the exporter, to the<lf> competent authority of the exporting country or region, which may then authorize <lf> the exporter to make the shipment.

(a) If, on the basis of its examination of information submitted by<lf> governments to the Board or of information communicated by United Nations<lf> organs, the Board has reason to believe that the aims of this Convention are<lf> being seriously endangered by reason of the failure of a country or region to<lf> carry out the provisions of this Convention, the Board shall have the right to<lf> ask for explanations from the Government of the country or region in question.<lf> Subject to the right of the Board to call the attention of the Parties, the<lf> Council and the Commission to the matter referred to in sub-paragraph (c) below, <lf> it shall treat as confidential a request for information or an explanation by a<lf> government under this sub-paragraph.<lf> <p>  (b) After taking action under sub-paragraph (a), the Board, if satisfied that<lf> it is necessary to do so, may call upon the Government concerned to adopt such<lf> remedial measures as shall seem under the circumstances to be necessary for the<lf> execution of the provisions of this Convention.<lf> <p>  (c) If the Board finds that the Government concerned has failed to give<lf> satisfactory explanations when called upon to do so under sub-paragraph (a), or<lf> has failed to adopt any remedial measures which it has been called upon to take<lf> under sub-paragraph (b), it may call the attention of the Parties, the Council<lf> and the Commission to the matter.<lf> <p>  2\.
