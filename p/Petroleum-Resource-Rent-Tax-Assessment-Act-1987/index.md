Pre‑1 July 2008 petroleum project

             (1)  For the purposes of the application of this Act (including this section) to a pre‑1 July 2008 petroleum project, a reference to exploration for petroleum in, or recovery of petroleum from, a production licence area, an exploration permit area or a retention lease area is a reference to exploration for petroleum in, or recovery of petroleum from, the production licence area, the exploration permit area or the retention lease area while the production licence, exploration permit or retention lease concerned is or was in force.

             (2)  For the purposes of the application of this Act to a pre‑1 July 2008 petroleum project, a reference to exploration for petroleum in, or recovery of petroleum from, the eligible exploration or recovery area in relation to a petroleum project is a reference to exploration for petroleum in, or recovery of petroleum from:

                     (a)  where the production licence or any production licence in relation to the project is a permit derived production licence—the exploration permit area in relation to the exploration permit to which the production licence is related (being exploration or recovery occurring either before or after the production licence came into force but not after marketable petroleum commodities cease, otherwise than temporarily, to be produced in relation to the project);

                     (b)  where the production licence or any production licence in relation to the project is a lease derived production licence—the retention lease area in relation to the retention lease to which the production licence is related (being exploration or recovery occurring either before or after the production licence came into force but not after marketable petroleum commodities cease, otherwise than temporarily, to be produced in relation to the project); and

                     (c)  the production licence area of the production licence, or the production licence areas of the production licences, in respect of the project.

             (3)  For the purposes of subsections (1) and (2), where, at a time when no permit derived production licence in relation to an exploration permit is in force, a retention lease that is related to the exploration permit comes into force, any exploration for, or recovery of, petroleum that occurred while the exploration permit was in force in the block or blocks in respect of which the retention lease was granted and during the period:

                     (a)  where paragraph (b) does not apply—before the retention lease came into force; or

                     (b)  where, before the retention lease came into force, a permit derived production licence, or permit derived production licences, in relation to the exploration permit were in force—after that production licence or all of those production licences, as the case may be, ceased to be in force and before the retention lease came into force;

shall be taken to have occurred in the retention lease area and not in the exploration permit area notwithstanding that the retention lease was not in force at that time.

             (4)  For the purposes of subsection (2), where, but for this subsection, the same exploration for petroleum or recovery of petroleum would be exploration for petroleum in, or recovery of petroleum from, the exploration permit area or the retention lease area in relation to 2 or more production licences, the exploration or recovery shall be taken to relate only to the production licence that first came into force.

             (2)  For the purposes of this Act, if:

                     (a)  on the termination of a petroleum project, a person disposes of all of the person’s property in respect of which the person incurred capital expenditure that is eligible real expenditure in relation to the project; and

                     (b)  there is no consideration receivable by the person in respect of the disposal;

a reference to the closing‑down expenditure incurred by the person in relation to the project includes a reference to any consideration given by the person for the disposal, to the extent that the consideration relates to the future closing‑down expenditure in relation to the project.

             (3)  For the purposes of this Act, if a person’s assessable property receipts under paragraph 27(1)(b) in relation to a petroleum project are taken to be zero because of subsection 27(4), a reference to closing‑down expenditure incurred by a person in relation to the project includes a reference to an amount equal to the difference between:

                     (a)  the future closing‑down expenditure in relation to the project; and

                     (b)  the amount that would, but for subsections 27(3) and (4), have been the person’s assessable property receipts in relation to the project.

Example:    A production licence of Petgas Ltd ceases to be in force on 24 October 2006, but the use of some facilities of the petroleum project in question continues to be permitted by an infrastructure licence that comes into force on that day. The value of the facilities on that day is $240,000, but there are future closing‑down costs that result in Petgas Ltd having a future closing‑down expenditure of $360,000.

                   Under subsection 27(4), Petgas Ltd’s assessable property receipts under paragraph 27(1)(b) are taken to be zero. In addition, Petgas Ltd’s closing‑down expenditure includes an amount of $120,000 (the difference between its future closing‑down expenditure and the actual value of the facilities).

             (4)  Closing‑down expenditure in relation to a petroleum project does not include closing‑down expenditure in relation to operations, facilities or other things comprising the project to the extent that:

                     (a)  the person has previously had assessable property receipts under paragraph 27(1)(a) in relation to the project and the consideration referred to in that paragraph took into account future closing‑down expenditure that relates to those operations, facilities or other things; or

                     (b)  the person has previously had assessable property receipts under paragraph 27(1)(b) in relation to the project and such future closing‑down expenditure was taken into account in working out those assessable property receipts; or

                     (c)  the person has previously had closing‑down expenditure in relation to the project that included such future closing‑down expenditure.

However, this subsection does not apply if there has been a change in the ownership of those operations, facilities or other things after the assessable property receipts or closing‑down expenditure arose.

then, at the time at which the debt is written off and in relation to:

                     (c)  the petroleum project; or

                     (d)  if, at that time, there is a combined project in relation to which the petroleum project is a pre‑combination project—the combined project;

the person shall be taken for the purposes of this Act to have incurred an amount of:

                     (e)  where at or before the time at which the debt is written off the person has not incurred any general project expenditure or closing‑down expenditure in relation to the petroleum project or the combined project (including any pre‑combination project in relation to the project)—exploration expenditure;

                      (f)  where at or before the time at which the debt is written off the person has incurred general project expenditure, but has not incurred any closing‑down expenditure, in relation to the petroleum project or the combined project (including any pre‑combination project in relation to the project)—general project expenditure; or

                     (g)  where at or before the time at which the debt is written off the person has incurred closing‑down expenditure in relation to the petroleum project or the combined project—closing‑down expenditure;

equal to the amount of the debt.

             (5)  In this Act, an **_instalment transfer_** is a transfer of an amount of expenditure in accordance with this Division in its application under this section to an instalment period.

             (6)  Despite subsection 45D(3), if an instalment transfer of an amount of expenditure is made in relation to an instalment period in a financial year, the instalment transfer does not prevent the transfer of all (or a part) of that expenditure being made again:

                     (a)  in relation to a later instalment period; or

                     (b)  in relation to the financial year or a later financial year (as an annual transfer).

Note:          In some circumstances, interest may be charged in relation to an instalment transfer if the expenditure cannot be transferred again under this Division as an annual transfer: see section 98A.

             (7)  In this section:

                    <a name="instal-period"></a>**_instalment period_** includes a period in a financial year that would be an instalment period if the financial year were a year of tax.

                     (a)  so much of the excess as does not exceed the amount of the closing‑down expenditure is the person’s **_excess closing‑down expenditure_** for the year of tax; and

                     (b)  the person is entitled to a credit of the lesser of the following amounts:

                              (i)  an amount equal to 40% of the excess closing‑down expenditure for the year of tax;

Greater Sunrise closing‑down credits

             (2)  However, for the purposes of the operation of paragraph (1)(a) in relation to a Greater Sunrise project, the amount that is so much of the excess as does not exceed the amount of the closing‑down expenditure is taken to be the amount worked out using the following formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00324/Html/9d20d596-b97e-4061-ada0-6f18c0fc44f2_files/image011.gif)

             (2)  The Commissioner may apply the whole or a part of the credit in total or partial discharge of any liability to the Commonwealth of the person entitled to the credit arising under or by virtue of this Act or any other Act of which the Commissioner has the general administration.

             (3)  Where, under subsection (2), the Commissioner has applied an amount of a credit in discharge of a liability of a person to the Commonwealth, the person shall be deemed to have paid the amount so applied for the purpose for which, and at the time at which, it has been so applied.

             (4)  Where the amount, or the sum of the amounts, applied or paid by the Commissioner as a credit to which a person is entitled under this Division exceeds the amount of the credit to which the person is entitled, the Commissioner may recover the amount of the excess as if it were tax due and payable by the person.

             (2)  The limited amendment period is extended for an additional period if:

                     (a)  on an application by the Commissioner before the end of the limited amendment period (or that period as extended under this section), the Federal Court of Australia orders the extension for the additional period; or

                     (b)  before the end of the limited amendment period (or that period as extended under this section):

                              (i)  the Commissioner requests the person to consent to the extension of the limited amendment period; and

                             (ii)  the person, by notice in writing, consents to the extension for the additional period.

             (3)  The Federal Court of Australia may order an extension of the limited amendment period under paragraph (2)(a) only if the Court is satisfied that it was not reasonably practicable, or that it was inappropriate, for the Commissioner to complete the examination within the limited amendment period (or that period as extended under this section), because of:

                     (a)  any action taken by the person; or

                     (b)  any failure of the person to take action that would have been reasonable for the person to take.

##### <a id="72"></a>72  Refund of overpaid amounts

             (1)  If, because of an amendment of an assessment, a person’s liability (the **_earlier liability_**) to tax or a related charge is reduced, the amount by which the tax or charge is so reduced is taken never to have been payable for the purposes of:

                     (a)  section 85 (which applies the general interest charge); and

                     (b)  Division 280 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ (which applies the shortfall interest charge).

Note:          The general interest charge is worked out under Division 1 of Part IIA of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

             (3)  However, if a later amendment of the assessment is made and all or some of the person’s earlier liability in relation to a particular is reinstated, subsection (1) is taken not to have applied, or not to have applied to the extent that the earlier liability is reinstated.

Note:          If the amendment of an assessment results in an increase in a person’s tax liability, the person is liable to pay shortfall interest charge on the amount of the increase: see Division 280 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

##### <a id="96"></a>96  Amount of instalment of tax

                   The amount payable by a person as an instalment of tax is the notional tax amount in relation to the instalment period in relation to the instalment.

##### <a id="97"></a>97  Notional tax amount

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), the notional tax amount of a person, in relation to a petroleum project and an instalment period in a year of tax, is the amount worked out in accordance with the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00324/Html/9d20d596-b97e-4061-ada0-6f18c0fc44f2_files/image012.gif)

where:

                    <a name="current-period-liabil"></a>**_Current period liability_** means the amount worked out under subsection (1A).

                    <a name="previou-period-liabil"></a>**_Previous period liability_** means the amount worked out under subsection (1B).

          (1A)  For the purposes of subsection (1), the current period liability is an amount equal to the tax that would be payable by the person in relation to the petroleum project if:

                     (a)  the instalment period were the year of tax; and

                    (aa)  without limiting paragraph (a)—any instalment transfers in relation to the instalment period were annual transfers in relation to the year of tax; and

                     (b)  the amounts that were taken by subsections 33(3), 34(3), 34A(4), 35(3) and 36(1) (including because of section 48) to be incurred by the person in relation to the project on the first day of the year of tax were instead only the instalment percentages of those amounts; and

                     (c)  the amounts that would, for the purposes of the Schedule, be the incurred exploration expenditure amounts in relation to financial years before the year of tax were instead only the instalment percentages of those amounts.

Note:          Division 3A of Part V may require or permit the transfer (by **_instalment transfer_**) of transferable exploration expenditure in relation to instalment periods: see section 45E.

       (1AA)  If the whole or a part of the assessable petroleum receipts that would be taken into account in working out the current period liability were determined under subparagraph 24(1)(d)(i) or paragraph 24(1)(e) (the **_special calculation provisions_**), then, in calculating the current period liability under subsection (1A):

                     (a)  any assessable petroleum receipts determined under the special calculation provisions are to be excluded; and

                     (b)  the amount worked out in accordance with the regulations in respect of those assessable petroleum receipts is to be included.

          (1B)  For the purposes of subsection (1), the previous period liability is an amount equal to the sum of the notional tax amounts (if any) worked out under subsection (1) in relation to the person, the petroleum project and any earlier instalment periods in the year of tax.

          (1C)  If the petroleum project is a combined project, the references in paragraph (1A)(b) and subsection (1B) to the project are to be read as including references to the pre‑combination projects in relation to the project.

                     (a)  a person has not furnished information under section 98 in relation to an instalment of tax; or

                     (b)  the Commissioner is not satisfied with the information furnished by a person under section 98 in relation to an instalment of tax;

                   the Commissioner may determine that the notional tax amount of the person in respect of the period to which the instalment of tax relates is such amount that, in the opinion of the Commissioner, might reasonably be expected to be the notional tax amount, ascertained in accordance with subsection (1), of the person in respect of the instalment period.

             (3)  As soon as practicable after a determination is made under subsection (2) in relation to a person, the Commissioner shall cause notice of the determination to be served on the person.

##### <a id="98"></a>98  Instalment statement

             (1)  Where a person is liable to pay an instalment of tax in respect of an instalment period, the person shall, not later than the date on which the instalment is due and payable or such later date as the Commissioner allows, furnish, in accordance with the approved form, such information relating to the basis of the calculation of that instalment as is required by the form.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to an instalment of tax that a person is liable to pay in respect of an instalment period where the amount of the instalment in relation to the instalment period and in relation to each preceding instalment period (if any) is nil.

##### <a id="98A"></a>98A  Instalment transfer interest charge—liability

Situation in which charge applies

             (1)  Subject to subsections (2) and (3), this section applies to a person (the **_liable person_**) in relation to an amount of expenditure (the **_instalment transfer excess_**) if:

                     (a)  an instalment transfer of the amount in relation to an instalment period in a year of tax is made:

                              (i)  by the liable person to a petroleum project under section 45A (as the section applies because of section 45E); or

                             (ii)  to the liable person in relation to a petroleum project under section 45B (as the section applies because of section 45E); and

                     (b)  an annual transfer, in relation to the year of tax, of the amount to the same project, or to the liable person in relation to the same project, cannot be made because of the application of clause 22 or 31 of the Schedule (whether or not there is any other reason preventing such an annual transfer).

Note 1:       This section may apply separately to a person in relation to 2 or more instalment transfers in the same year of tax, even if the same instalment transfer amount is transferred between the same projects or companies by each instalment transfer (as allowed under subsection 45E(6)).

Note 2:       If a transfer is made by the Commissioner under section 45C because of a failure of a person to make a transfer as required by section 45A or 45B, the transfer is taken to be a transfer by the person under section 45A or 45B (as the case requires): see subsection 45C(4).

Instalment transfer excess—offsets

             (2)  The amount of the instalment transfer excess (as it would be apart from this subsection), in relation to a petroleum project, is reduced by:

                     (a)  an amount equal to so much of the excess as must be applied or transferred to reduce or eliminate any person’s taxable profit in relation to any petroleum project and the year of tax; and

                     (b)  any amount of expenditure that must be transferred, by annual transfer in relation to the year of tax, to the project, or to the liable person in relation to the project, because the excess cannot be transferred as mentioned in paragraph (1)(b).

             (3)  This section does not apply if the instalment transfer excess is reduced to zero (or a negative amount) by the operation of subsection (2).

Liability to pay charge

             (4)  The liable person is liable to pay a charge (the **_instalment transfer interest charge_**) on the instalment transfer excess for each day in the following period (the **_instalment transfer charge period_**) in the year of tax:

                     (a)  if the instalment period to which the excess relates is the first instalment period in the year—the period:

                              (i)  starting at the start of the day on which instalments of tax are due and payable for the first instalment period in the year; and

                             (ii)  ending immediately before the day on which instalments of tax are due and payable in relation to the second instalment period in the year;

                     (b)  if the instalment period to which the excess relates is the second instalment period in the year—the period:

                              (i)  starting at the start of the day on which instalments of tax are due and payable for the second instalment period in the year; and

                             (ii)  ending immediately before the day on which instalments of tax are due and payable in relation to the third instalment period in the year;

                     (c)  if the instalment period to which the excess relates is the third instalment period in the year—the period:

                              (i)  starting at the start of the day on which instalments of tax are due and payable for the third instalment period in the year; and

                             (ii)  ending immediately before the day on which tax is due and payable in relation to the year of tax.

Charge payable even if person has transferred interest in project

             (5)  Despite sections 48 and 48A, the liable person remains liable for the full amount of the instalment transfer interest charge even if the liable person enters into a transaction that has the effect, after the end of the instalment period, of transferring part or all of the liable person’s entitlement to derive assessable receipts in relation to the project.

Statement about charge

                     (a)  a notice of assessment; or

                     (b)  a document under the hand of the Commissioner, a Second Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner purporting to be a copy of a notice of assessment;

is conclusive evidence of the due making of the assessment and, except in proceedings under Part IVC of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ on a review or appeal relating to the assessment, that the amounts and all of the particulars of the assessment are correct.

             (2)  The mere production of a document under the hand of the Commissioner, a Second Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner purporting to be a copy of a document issued or given by the Commissioner, a Second Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner is conclusive evidence that the second‑mentioned document was so issued or given.

             (3)  The mere production of a document under the hand of the Commissioner, a Second Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner purporting to be a copy of, or an extract from, a return, a notice of assessment or a notice under section 98C is evidence of the matter set out in the document to the same extent as the original return or notice, as the case may be, would be if it were produced.

          (3A)  To avoid doubt, subsection (3) applies to a copy or an extract of a document that was given to the Commissioner on a data processing device or by way of electronic transmission, unless the person by whom the original of the document was purportedly authorised can show that the person did not authorise the document.

             (4)  The mere production of a certificate in writing signed by the Commissioner, a Second Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner certifying that a sum specified in the certificate was, at the date of the certificate, due and payable by a person in respect of an amount payable under a specified provision of this Act, or an amount of shortfall interest charge payable under the _Taxation Administration Act 1953,_ is _prima facie_ evidence of the matters stated in the certificate.

             (5)  The mere production of a _Gazette_ containing a notice purporting to be issued by the Commissioner is _prima facie_ evidence that the notice was so issued.

             (6)  A return under this Act purporting to be made or signed by or on behalf of a person is _prima facie_ evidence that the return was made by the person or with the authority of the person.

##### <a id="106A"></a>106A  Review of certain decisions

                   A person who is dissatisfied with a decision made under this Act or the regulations in relation to the person, being a decision that is prescribed for the purposes of this section, may object against it in the manner set out in Part IVC of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

##### <a id="107"></a>107  Access to premises etc.

## Part 1A—Special rules relating to the transfer of Greater Sunrise expenditure

##### <a id="4A"></a>4A  Certain Greater Sunrise expenditure is not transferable

                   Despite paragraphs 7(b), 8(5)(c), 11(b), 12(4)(c) and 18(3)(e) of this Schedule and subclauses 18(1) and 18(2) of this Schedule, amounts of exploration expenditure incurred in relation to the Western Greater Sunrise area before 6 March 2003 are not transferable under section 45A, 45B or 45C.

##### <a id="4B"></a>4B  Greater Sunrise transferable exploration expenditure must be adjusted

Transfers from a Greater Sunrise project

             (1)  If, in relation to a year of tax, transferable exploration expenditure is transferred from a Greater Sunrise project to a petroleum project other than a Greater Sunrise project, the amount of that expenditure for the purposes of the other petroleum project is taken to be the amount worked out using the following formula:

## Part 2—Class 2 augmented bond rate exploration expenditure and transferable exploration expenditure

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Interpretation

                   In this Part:

                    <a name="notion-taxabl-profit"></a>**_notional taxable profit_**, in relation to a person, a petroleum project and a financial year, means the amount (if any) that would be the taxable profit in relation to the person, the project and the financial year if:

                     (a)  the person had not incurred any class 2 augmented bond rate exploration expenditure, class 2 GDP factor expenditure or closing‑down expenditure in relation to the project and the financial year; and

                     (b)  any expenditure transferred:

                              (i)  to the project in relation to the financial year under section 45A; or

                             (ii)  to the person in relation to the project and the financial year under section 45B;

                            had not been transferred.

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Matters dealt with in this Part

             (1)  This Part deals with:

                     (a)  the calculation of the amount of class 2 augmented bond rate exploration expenditure that a person is taken to have incurred in a financial year in relation to a petroleum project; and

                     (b)  the calculation of the amount of expenditure incurred by the person in relation to the project in ABR expenditure years that is transferable from the project in relation to the financial year.

In this Part, the financial year is called the **_assessable year_**.

             (2)  For the avoidance of doubt, the assessable year may be a financial year starting after the finishing day in relation to the petroleum project.

##### <a id="7"></a>7  What happens if there is no notional taxable profit

                   If there is no notional taxable profit in relation to the person, the petroleum project and the assessable year:

                     (a)  the person is taken not to have incurred any class 2 augmented bond rate exploration expenditure in relation to the project and the assessable year; and

                     (b)  all the expenditure included in the incurred exploration expenditure amounts for the ABR expenditure years is transferable by the person in relation to the assessable year.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  What happens if there is a notional taxable profit

             (1)  This clause applies if there is a notional taxable profit in relation to the person, the petroleum project and the assessable year.

             (2)  For the purposes of this clause, the available exploration expenditure amount for the assessable year equals the incurred exploration expenditure amount in relation to the assessable year.

             (3)  For the purposes of this clause, the available exploration expenditure amount for an ABR expenditure year before the assessable year is worked out as follows:

                     (a)  if the ABR expenditure year is the financial year immediately before the assessable year—multiply the incurred exploration expenditure amount in relation to the ABR expenditure year by the augmented bond rate for the ABR expenditure year;

                     (b)  if the ABR expenditure year is an earlier financial year—work out, in relation to the ABR expenditure year and each later financial year ending before the assessable year, an amount in accordance with the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00324/Html/9d20d596-b97e-4061-ada0-6f18c0fc44f2_files/image016.gif)

                            where:

**_Exploration expenditure amount_** means:

                              (i)  in making the calculation in relation to the ABR expenditure year—the incurred exploration expenditure amount in relation to the ABR expenditure year; or

                             (ii)  in making the calculation in relation to one of the later financial years—the amount calculated under this paragraph in relation to the immediately preceding financial year for the purpose of working out the available exploration expenditure amount for the ABR expenditure year.

**_Augmented bond rate_** means the augmented bond rate in relation to the financial year in relation to which the calculation is being made;

                     (c)  if paragraph (a) applies—the available exploration expenditure amount for the ABR expenditure year is the amount worked out under that paragraph;

                     (d)  if paragraph (b) applies—the available exploration expenditure amount for the ABR expenditure year is the amount worked out under that paragraph in relation to the most recent of the later financial years referred to in paragraph (b).

             (4)  If the total of the available exploration expenditure amounts for the assessable year and the previous ABR expenditure years is less than or equal to the notional taxable profit:

                     (a)  the person is taken to have incurred an amount of class 2 augmented bond rate exploration expenditure in the assessable year in relation to the project equal to the total of those available exploration expenditure amounts; and

                     (b)  that class 2 augmented bond rate exploration expenditure is attributable to all the expenditur
