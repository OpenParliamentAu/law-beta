                            exploration for petroleum in, or recovery of petroleum from, the exploration permit area of the prior exploration permit, where the exploration or recovery occurred:

                            (iii)  before the prior retention lease came into force; and

                            (iv)  if, before the prior retention lease came into force, there came into force one or more other production licences, or one or more other retention leases, derived from the prior exploration permit—after whichever of those other retention leases or other production licences last came into force before the prior retention lease came into force; and

                     (d)  exploration for petroleum in, or recovery of petroleum from, the production licence area of the production licence, or the production licence areas of the production licences, in respect of the project.

             (7)  If:

                     (a)  paragraph (6)(c) applies to a post‑30 June 2008 petroleum project; and

                     (b)  the prior retention lease mentioned in that paragraph is one of a set of 2 or more retention leases that:

                              (i)  came into force at the same time; and

                             (ii)  were derived from the prior exploration permit mentioned in that paragraph; and

                     (c)  the production licence, or the production licences, in relation to one or more other post‑30 June 2008 petroleum projects were derived from one or more of the retention leases included in the set mentioned in paragraph (b) of this subsection; and

                     (d)  exploration expenditure incurred in relation to the petroleum project mentioned in paragraph (a) of this subsection is attributable to exploration for petroleum in, or recovery of petroleum from, the exploration permit area of the prior exploration permit;

then, for the purposes of the application of this Act to the petroleum project mentioned in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the amount of the exploration expenditure mentioned in paragraph (d) of this subsection is taken to be the amount worked out using the following formula:

                             (ii)  the processing of external petroleum in relation to another petroleum project;

and includes any exploration permit, retention lease or other fee (not being an excluded fee) liable to be paid by the person in relation to the carrying on or providing of any operations, facilities or other things referred to in this section.

             (2)  Where, by reason of the application of subsection 5(3), exploration for petroleum during a period is taken to occur in a retention lease area or areas in relation to a retention lease or leases related to an exploration permit, any liability incurred during that period to pay an exploration permit fee shall, for the purposes of subsection (1), be taken to relate proportionally to the carrying on of operations involved in exploration for petroleum in the retention lease area or areas and in the remainder of the exploration permit area in relation to the exploration permit, according to the respective sizes of those areas.

##### <a id="38"></a>38  General project expenditure

             (1)  For the purposes of this Act, a reference to general project expenditure incurred by a person in relation to a petroleum project is a reference to payments (not being excluded expenditure, exploration expenditure or closing‑down expenditure), whether of a capital or revenue nature, liable to be made by the person:

##### <a id="39"></a>39  Closing‑down expenditure

             (1)  For the purposes of this Act, a reference to closing‑down expenditure incurred by a person in relation to a petroleum project is a reference to payments (not being excluded expenditure), whether of a capital or revenue nature, liable to be made by the person in carrying on operations involved in closing down the project, including in any environmental restoration as a consequence of closing down the project.

             (2)  For the purposes of this Act, if:

                     (a)  on the termination of a petroleum project, a person disposes of all of the person’s property in respect of which the person incurred capital expenditure that is eligible real expenditure in relation to the project; and

                     (b)  there is no consideration receivable by the person in respect of the disposal;

a reference to the closing‑down expenditure incurred by the person in relation to the project includes a reference to any consideration given by the person for the disposal, to the extent that the consideration relates to the future closing‑down expenditure in relation to the project.

             (3)  For the purposes of this Act, if a person’s assessable property receipts under paragraph 27(1)(b) in relation to a petroleum project are taken to be zero because of subsection 27(4), a reference to closing‑down expenditure incurred by a person in relation to the project includes a reference to an amount equal to the difference between:

                     (a)  the future closing‑down expenditure in relation to the project; and

                     (b)  the amount that would, but for subsections 27(3) and (4), have been the person’s assessable property receipts in relation to the project.

Example:    A production licence of Petgas Ltd ceases to be in force on 24 October 2006, but the use of some facilities of the petroleum project in question continues to be permitted by an infrastructure licence that comes into force on that day. The value of the facilities on that day is $240,000, but there are future closing‑down costs that result in Petgas Ltd having a future closing‑down expenditure of $360,000.

                   Under subsection 27(4), Petgas Ltd’s assessable property receipts under paragraph 27(1)(b) are taken to be zero. In addition, Petgas Ltd’s closing‑down expenditure includes an amount of $120,000 (the difference between its future closing‑down expenditure and the actual value of the facilities).

             (4)  Closing‑down expenditure in relation to a petroleum project does not include closing‑down expenditure in relation to operations, facilities or other things comprising the project to the extent that:

                     (a)  the person has previously had assessable property receipts under paragraph 27(1)(a) in relation to the project and the consideration referred to in that paragraph took into account future closing‑down expenditure that relates to those operations, facilities or other things; or

                     (b)  the person has previously had assessable property receipts under paragraph 27(1)(b) in relation to the project and such future closing‑down expenditure was taken into account in working out those assessable property receipts; or

                     (c)  the person has previously had closing‑down expenditure in relation to the project that included such future closing‑down expenditure.

However, this subsection does not apply if there has been a change in the ownership of those operations, facilities or other things after the assessable property receipts or closing‑down expenditure arose.

then, at the time at which the debt is written off and in relation to:

                     (c)  the petroleum project; or

                     (d)  if, at that time, there is a combined project in relation to which the petroleum project is a pre‑combination project—the combined project;

the person shall be taken for the purposes of this Act to have incurred an amount of:

                     (e)  where at or before the time at which the debt is written off the person has not incurred any general project expenditure or closing‑down expenditure in relation to the petroleum project or the combined project (including any pre‑combination project in relation to the project)—exploration expenditure;

                      (f)  where at or before the time at which the debt is written off the person has incurred general project expenditure, but has not incurred any closing‑down expenditure, in relation to the petroleum project or the combined project (including any pre‑combination project in relation to the project)—general project expenditure; or

                     (g)  where at or before the time at which the debt is written off the person has incurred closing‑down expenditure in relation to the petroleum project or the combined project—closing‑down expenditure;

equal to the amount of the debt.

             (2)  If a debtor, after incurring a debt that has been brought to account as mentioned in paragraph (1) (b), becomes bankrupt or executes a personal insolvency agreement for the benefit of creditors:

                     (a)  where, in the opinion of the Commissioner, no amount will be paid on account of the debt—the debt; or

                     (b)  where, in the opinion of the Commissioner, an amount less than the amount of the debt will be paid on account of the debt—so much of the debt as exceeds the amount that, in the opinion of the Commissioner, will be so paid;

shall be deemed to be a bad debt.

             (3)  Where a person receives an amount in respect of a debt to which subsection (1) applies, that amount shall for the purposes of this Act be taken to be a receipt of the kind referred to in paragraph (1)(b) derived by the person in relation to:

                     (a)  the petroleum project referred to in that paragraph; or

                     (b)  if, at the time at which the amount is received, there is a combined project in relation to which the petroleum project referred to in that paragraph is a pre‑combination project—the combined project.

                     (b)  the liability shall be taken to have been incurred by the eligible person in carrying on or providing the operations, facilities or other things.

             (2)  This section does not apply if the other person carries on or provides the operations, facilities or other things as part of the processing of external petroleum, or internal petroleum, in relation to a petroleum project other than the project to which the operations, facilities or other things referred to in subsection (1) relate.

##### <a id="42"></a>42  Expenditure on property for partial project use

                   Where:

                     (a)  a person incurs or incurred eligible real expenditure in relation to a petroleum project; and

then, for the purposes of this Act (including this section):

                     (d)  the person shall be taken to have incurred capital expenditure immediately after the termination or at the later time referred to in paragraph (c), as the case may be, in carrying on or providing the operations, facilities or other things, referred to in paragraph (c) in relation to the project or projects referred to in that paragraph; and

                     (e)  the amount of the expenditure shall be taken to be equal to so much of the value of the property at the time at which the person is so taken to have incurred the expenditure as, in the opinion of the Commissioner, is attributable to the expenditure referred to in paragraph (a).

             (2)  Where:

                     (a)  a person incurs or incurred capital expenditure in relation to property that is not or was not for use in carrying on or providing operations, facilities or other things of a kind referred to in section 37, 38 or 39 in relation to any petroleum project; and

                     (b)  the person commences or commenced to use the property at a later time in carrying on or providing such operations, facilities or other things in relation to a petroleum project or projects;

             (3)  The transfer must:

                     (a)  be in writing; and

                     (b)  to a company in relation to a petroleum project and a financial year under section 45B.

             (2)  If the expenditure was incurred in an earlier financial year, then, for the purposes of this Act other than subsection (3), the transfer is taken to be a transfer of the amount worked out in accordance with Part 7 of Schedule 1.

             (3)  The expenditure transferred (disregarding the effect of subsection (2)):

                     (a)  must not be transferred again in relation to the financial year; and

                     (b)  must not be counted again as expenditure incurred, or taken to be incurred, by a person:

                              (i)  when working out the liability of the person to tax in relation to a later financial year; or

##### <a id="45E"></a>45E  Instalment transfers and annual transfers

             (1)  Subject to this section, the following provisions apply in relation to instalment periods in the same way as they apply in relation to financial years:

                     (b)  Schedule 1;

                     (c)  definitions or other provisions of this Act as they apply for the purpose of this Division or Schedule 1.

Note:          A person who contravenes section 45A or 45B as the section applies in relation to an instalment period commits an offence: see subsections 45A(5) and 45B(5).

             (2)  The provisions mentioned in subsection (1) apply under that subsection only to the extent necessary to require or permit the making of transfers of expenditure in relation to instalment periods.

             (3)  For the purpose of subsection (1), the following assumptions apply in relation to any petroleum project and an instalment period in a financial year:

                     (a)  the instalment period is taken to be a financial year;

                     (b)  the amounts taken by subsections 33(3), 34(3), 34A(4), 35(3) and 36(1) (including because of section 48) to be incurred by any person in relation to any project on the first day of the financial year are instead taken to be only the instalment percentages of those amounts;

                     (c)  the amounts that would, for the purposes of Schedule 1, be the incurred exploration expenditure amounts in relation to financial years before that financial year are instead taken to be only the instalment percentages of those amounts.

             (4)  In this Act, an **_annual transfer_** is a transfer of an amount of expenditure in accordance with this Division in its application to a financial year.

             (5)  In this Act, an **_instalment transfer_** is a transfer of an amount of expenditure in accordance with this Division in its application under this section to an instalment period.

             (6)  Despite subsection 45D(3), if an instalment transfer of an amount of expenditure is made in relation to an instalment period in a financial year, the instalment transfer does not prevent the transfer of all (or a part) of that expenditure being made again:

                     (a)  in relation to a later instalment period; or

                     (b)  in relation to the financial year or a later financial year (as an annual transfer).

Note:          In some circumstances, interest may be charged in relation to an instalment transfer if the expenditure cannot be transferred again under this Division as an annual transfer: see section 98A.

             (7)  In this section:

                    <a name="instal-period"></a>**_instalment period_** includes a period in a financial year that would be an instalment period if the financial year were a year of tax.

### Division 4—Tax credits

##### <a id="46"></a>46  Credits in respect of closing‑down expenditure

             (1)  If, in relation to a petroleum project, the sum of any closing‑down expenditure and any other deductible expenditure incurred by a person in a year of tax exceeds the assessable receipts derived by the person in the year of tax:

                     (a)  so much of the excess as does not exceed the amount of the closing‑down expenditure is the person’s **_excess closing‑down expenditure_** for the year of tax; and

                     (b)  the person is entitled to a credit of the lesser of the following amounts:

                              (i)  an amount equal to 40% of the excess closing‑down expenditure for the year of tax;

                             (ii)  the total amount of any tax in respect of the project (including in the case of a combined project any pre‑combination project in relation to the project) paid or payable by the person in relation to previous years of tax, reduced by the total amount of any credits allowed or allowable to the person under this section in relation to the project in relation to any previous years of tax.

Greater Sunrise closing‑down credits

             (2)  However, for the purposes of the operation of paragraph (1)(a) in relation to a Greater Sunrise project, the amount that is so much of the excess as does not exceed the amount of the closing‑down expenditure is taken to be the amount worked out using the following formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00686/Html/2ad21fa4-cb65-45b8-bf15-381f955f5b3a_files/image013.gif)

             (2)  The Commissioner may apply the whole or a part of the credit in total or partial discharge of any liability to the Commonwealth of the person entitled to the credit arising under or by virtue of this Act or any other Act of which the Commissioner has the general administration.

             (3)  Where, under subsection (2), the Commissioner has applied an amount of a credit in discharge of a liability of a person to the Commonwealth, the person shall be deemed to have paid the amount so applied for the purpose for which, and at the time at which, it has been so applied.

             (4)  Where the amount, or the sum of the amounts, applied or paid by the Commissioner as a credit to which a person is entitled under this Division exceeds the amount of the credit to which the person is entitled, the Commissioner may recover the amount of the excess as if it were tax due and payable by the person.

                            (ia)  to have incurred, in relation to the project, any expenditure that, if the financial year in which the transaction is or was entered into had ended immediately before the transfer time, would, within the meaning of Schedule 1, have been included in the incurred exploration expenditure amount in relation to the vendor, the project and the financial year or a previous financial year; and

### Division 8—Consolidated groups

##### <a id="58N"></a>58N  Choice to consolidate

             (1)  A head company of a consolidated group or a MEC group or a provisional head company of a MEC group may, in writing, choose to apply this Division in relation to the group.

             (2)  However, subsection (1) does not apply if a notice has not been given to the Commissioner under section 703‑58 or 719‑76 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ in relation to the group.

             (3)  The choice is not valid unless it is in the approved form, and the head company or the provisional head company gives it to the Commissioner:

                     (a)  within 21 days after making the choice; or

                     (b)  within such further period as the Commissioner allows.

             (4)  The choice is irrevocable, and:

                     (a)  has effect on and after the day the choice is made; and

                     (b)  does not have effect after the consolidated group or MEC group ceases to exist.

Note:          The head company’s interests in petroleum projects just before a consolidated group or MEC group ceases to exist would be transferred at the time the group ceases to exist: see section 58R.

##### <a id="58P"></a>58P  Single entity rule

             (1)  If a person is a subsidiary member of the consolidated group or MEC group for any period in which the choice is in effect, the person and any other subsidiary member of the group are taken for the purposes covered by subsection (2) to be parts of the head company or provisional head company of the group, rather than separate persons, during that period.

Note:          Despite the single entity rule, a subsidiary member of the group is jointly and severally liable for a liability of the head company: see section 721‑10 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

             (2)  The purposes covered by this subsection are:

                     (a)  working out the head company’s and subsidiary member’s interests in onshore petroleum projects for any year of tax in which any of the period occurs or any later year of tax; and

                     (b)  working out any tax that is payable in relation to such an interest for any such year of tax; and

                     (c)  working out assessable receipts and deductible expenditure arising in relation to such an interest for any such year of tax.

Examples:  The following are some examples of consequences of the single entity rule:

(a)    a subsidiary member’s interest in an onshore petroleum project becomes a part of the head company’s aggregated interest in the project;

(b)    a subsidiary member’s assessable receipts and deductible expenditure relating to the interest are inherited by the head company along with the interest;

(c)    liabilities that a subsidiary member has to pay tax before becoming a member of the group (and any interest charges associated with such a liability) remain liabilities of the subsidiary member and not the head company.

##### <a id="58Q"></a>58Q  Interests taken to be transferred to head company etc. on joining

                   If, because of the application of section 58P, a person is taken at a particular time to start being part of the head company or provisional head company, section 48 applies as if each of the person’s interests in onshore petroleum projects just before that time had been transferred to the head company or provisional head company.

##### <a id="58R"></a>58R  Interests taken to be transferred to leaving entity on leaving

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  at a particular time, a person stops being taken, because of section 58P, to be part of the head company or provisional head company; and

                     (b)  the entitlement comprising the person’s interest in an onshore petroleum project just after that time is all of the entitlement comprising the company’s interest in the project just before that time;

section 48 applies as if the person’s interest in the project just after that time had been transferred from the company under a transaction of a kind referred to in subsection 48(1A).

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  at a particular time, a person stops being taken, because of section 58P, to be part of the head company or provisional head company; and

                     (b)  the entitlement comprising the person’s interest in an onshore petroleum project just after that time is part, but not all, of the entitlement comprising the company’s interest in the project just before that time;

section 48A applies as if the person’s interest in the project just after that time had been transferred from the company under a transaction of a kind referred to in subsection 48A(1).

##### <a id="58S"></a>58S  Acquisition of consolidated group by another consolidated group etc.

                   If a member of a consolidated group or MEC group (the **_relinquishing group_**) becomes a member of another consolidated group or MEC group (the **_acquiring group_**) at a particular time (the **_acquisition time_**):

                     (a)  first apply subsection 58R(1) or (2) (as the case requires) in relation to the member ceasing to be a member of the relinquishing group as if section 58P did not apply in relation to the member just after the acquisition time; and

                     (b)  then apply section 58Q in relation to the member becoming a member of the acquiring group as if section 58P did not apply in relation to the member just before the acquisition time.

##### <a id="58T"></a>58T  Effect of choice to continue group after shelf company becomes new head company

             (1)  If a company (the **_interposed company_**) chooses under subsection 124‑380(5) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ that a consolidated group is to continue in existence at and after the time referred to in that subsection as the completion time, for the purposes of this Act:

                     (a)  the group is taken not to have ceased to exist under subsection 703‑5(2) of that Act because the company referred to in subsection 124‑380(5) of that Act as the original company ceases to be the head company of the group; and

                     (b)  the interposed company is taken to have become the head company of the consolidated group at the completion time; and

                     (c)  the original company is taken to have ceased to be the head company at that time.

Note:          A further result is that the original company is taken to have become a subsidiary member of the group at that time.

             (2)  For the purposes referred to in subsection 58P(2) in relation to a year of tax ending after the completion time, everything that happened in relation to the original company before the completion time:

                     (a)  is taken to have happened in relation to the interposed company instead of in relation to the original company; and

                     (b)  is taken to have happened in relation to the interposed company instead of what would (apart from this section) be taken to have happened in relation to the interposed company before that time;

as if, at all times before the completion time, the interposed company had been the original company, and the original company had been the interposed company.

Note:          This section treats the original company and the interposed company as having in effect exchanged identities throughout the period before the completion time, but without affecting any of the original company’s other attributes.

##### <a id="58U"></a>58U  Effect of change of head company or provisional head company of a MEC group

             (1)  For the purposes referred to in subsection 58P(2) in relation to a year of tax:

                     (a)  if:

                              (i)  a company (the **_old head company_**) is the head company of a * MEC group at the end of an income year (within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_); and

                             (ii)  a different company (the **_new head company_**) is the head company of the group at the start of the next income year (the **_transition time_**); or

                     (b)  if:

                              (i)  a company (also the **_old head company_**) is the * provisional head company of a * MEC group just before a cessation event (within the meaning of that Act) happens to the company; and

                             (ii)  a different company (also the **_new head company_**) is the provisional head company of the group just after that cessation event (also the **_transition time_**);

everything that happened in relation to the old head company before the transition time is taken to have happened in relation to the new head company instead, as if the new head company had been the old head company at all times before the transition time.

Note 1:       This section treats the new head company as having in effect assumed the identity of the old head company throughout the period before the transition time, but without affecting any of the other attributes of the old head company.

Note 2:       A further result is that the old head company is taken to have become a subsidiary member of the group at the transition time.

             (2)  However, this section does not apply in relation to a year of tax ending on or before the transition time.

##### <a id="58V"></a>58V  Effect of group conversions involving MEC groups

             (1)  This section applies if, at a particular time (the **_conversion time_**):

                     (a)  a consolidated group (the **_new group_**) is created from a * MEC group (the **_old group_**); or

                     (b)  a MEC group (the **_new group_**) is created from a consolidated group (the **_old group_**).

             (2)  For the purposes referred to in subsection 58P(2) in relation to a year of tax ending after the conversion time:

                     (a)  the new group is taken to be a continuation of the old group; and

                     (b)  the old group is taken not to have ceased to exist for the purposes of subsection 58N(4); and

                     (c)  everything that happened in relation to the head company of the old group before the conversion time is taken instead to have happened in relation to:

                              (i)  if the head company of the old group is the same entity as the head company of the new group—that entity in its role as head company of the new group; or

                             (ii)  otherwise—the head company of the new group (as if the head company of the new group had been the head company of the old group at all times before the conversion time).

## Part VI—Returns and assessments

##### <a id="97"></a>97  Notional tax amount

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), the notional tax amount of a person, in relation to a petroleum project and an instalment period in a year of tax, is the amount worked out in accordance with the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00686/Html/2ad21fa4-cb65-45b8-bf15-381f955f5b3a_files/image014.gif)

                    <a name="previou-period-liabil"></a>**_Previous period liability_** means the amount worked out under subsection (1B).

          (1A)  For the purposes of subsection (1), the current period liability is an amount equal to the tax that would be payable by the person in relation to the petroleum project if:

                     (a)  the instalment period were the year of tax; and

                    (aa)  without limiting paragraph (a)—any instalment transfers in relation to the instalment period were annual transfers in relation to the year of tax; and

                     (b)  the amounts that were taken by subsections 33(3), 34(3), 34A(4), 35(3) and 36(1) (including because of section 48) to be incurred by the person in relation to the project on the first day of the year of tax were instead only the instalment percentages of those amounts; and

                     (c)  the amounts that would, for the purposes of Schedule 1, be the incurred exploration expenditure amounts in relation to financial years before the year of tax were instead only the instalment percentages of those amounts.

Note:          Division 3A of Part V may require or permit the transfer (by **_instalment transfer_**) of transferable exploration expenditure in relation to instalment periods: see section 45E.

       (1AA)  If the whole or a part of the assessable petroleum receipts that would be taken into account in working out the current period liability were determined under subparagraph 24(1)(d)(i) or paragraph 24(1)(e) (the **_special calculation provisions_**), then, in calculating the current period liability under subsection (1A):

                     (a)  any assessable petroleum receipts determined under the special calculation provisions are to be excluded; and

                     (b)  the amount worked out in accordance with the regulations in respect of those assessable petroleum receipts is to be included.

                     (b)  the Commissioner is not satisfied with the information furnished by a person under section 98 in relation to an instalment of tax;

                   the Commissioner may determine that the notional tax amount of the person in respect of the period to which the instalment of tax relates is such amount that, in the opinion of the Commissioner, might reasonably be expected to be the notional tax amount, ascertained in accordance with subsection (1), of the person in respect of the instalment period.

             (3)  As soon as practicable after a determination is made under subsection (2) in relation to a person, the Commissioner shall cause notice of the determination to be served on the person.

##### <a id="98"></a>98  Instalment statement

             (1)  Where a person is liable to pay an instalment of tax in respect of an instalment period, the person shall, not later than the date on which the instalment is due and payable or such later date as the Commissioner allows, furnish, in accordance with the approved form, such information relating to the basis of the calculation of that instalment as is required by the form.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to an instalment of tax that a person is liable to pay in respect of an instalment period where the amount of the instalment in relation to the instalment period and in relation to each preceding instalment period (if any) is nil.

##### <a id="98A"></a>98A  Instalment transfer interest charge—liability

Situation in which charge applies

             (1)  Subject to subsections (2) and (3), this section applies to a person (the **_liable person_**) in relation to an amount of expenditure (the **_instalment transfer excess_**) if:

                     (a)  an instalment transfer of the amount in relation to an instalment period in a year of tax is made:

                              (i)  by the liable person to a petroleum project under section 45A (as the section applies because of section 45E); or

                             (ii)  to the liable person in relation to a petroleum project under section 45B (as the section applies because of section 45E); and

                     (b)  an annual transfer, in relation to the year of tax, of the amount to the same project, or to the liable person in relation to the same project, cannot be made because of the application of clause 22 or 31 of Schedule 1 (whether or not there is any other reason preventing such an annual transfer).

Note 1:       This section may apply separately to a person in relation to 2 or more instalment transfers in the same year of tax, even if the same instalment transfer amount is transferred between the same projects or companies by each instalment transfer (as allowed under subsection 45E(6)).

Note 2:       If a transfer is made by the Commissioner under section 45C because of a failure of a person to make a transfer as required by section 45A or 45B, the transfer is taken to be a transfer by the person under section 45A or 45B (as the case requires): see subsection 45C(4).

Instalment transfer excess—offsets

             (2)  The amount of the instalment transfer excess (as it would be apart from this subsection), in relation to a petroleum project, is reduced by:

                     (a)  an amount equal to so much of the excess as must be applied or transferred to reduce or eliminate any person’s taxable profit in relation to any petroleum project and the year of tax; and

                     (b)  any amount of expenditure that must be transferred, by annual transfer in relation to the year of tax, to the project, or to the liable person in relation to the project, because the excess cannot be transferred as mentioned in paragraph (1)(b).

             (3)  This section does not apply if the instalment transfer excess is reduced to zero (or a negative amount) by the operation of subsection (2).

Liability to pay charge

             (4)  The liable person is liable to pay a charge (the **_instalment transfer interest charge_**) on the instalment transfer excess for each day in the following period (the **_instalment transfer charge period_**) in the year of tax:

                     (a)  if the instalment period to which the excess relates is the first instalment period in the year—the period:

                              (i)  starting at the start of the day on which instalments of tax are due and payable for the first instalment period in the year; and

                             (ii)  ending immediately before the day on which instalments of tax are due and payable in relation to the second instalment period in the year;

                     (b)  if the instalment period to which the excess relates is the second instalment period in the year—the period:

                              (i)  starting at the start of the day on which instalments of tax are due and payable for the second instalment period in the year; and

                             (ii)  ending immediately before the day on which instalments of tax are due and payable in relation to the third instalment period in the year;

                     (c)  if the instalment period to which the excess relates is the third instalment period in the year—the period:

                              (i)  starting at the start of the day on which instalments of tax are due and payable for the third instalment period in the year; and

                             (ii)  ending immediately before the day on which tax is due and payable in relation to the year of tax.

                     (b)  a document under the hand of the Commissioner, a Second Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner purporting to be a copy of a notice of assessment;

is conclusive evidence of the due making of the assessment and, except in proceedings under Part IVC of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ on a review or appeal relating to the assessment, that the amounts and all of the particulars of the assessment are correct.

             (2)  The mere production of a document under the hand of the Commissioner, a Second Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner purporting to be a copy of a document issued or given by the Commissioner, a Second Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner is conclusive evidence that the second‑mentioned document was so issued or given.

             (3)  The mere production of a document under the hand of the Commissioner, a Second Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner purporting to be a copy of, or an extract from, a return, a notice of assessment or a notice under section 98C is evidence of the matter set out in the document to the same extent as the original return or notice, as the case may be, would be if it were produced.

          (3A)  To avoid doubt, subsection (3) applies to a copy or an extract of a document that was given to the Commissioner on a data processing device or by way of electronic transmission, unless the person by whom the original of the document was purportedly authorised can show that the person did not authorise the document.

             (4)  The mere production of a certificate in writing signed by the Commissioner, a Second Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner certifying that a sum specified in the certificate was, at the date of the certificate, due and payable by a person in respect of an amount payable under a specified provision of this Act, or an amount of shortfall interest charge payable under the _Taxation Administration Act 1953,_ is _prima facie_ evidence of the matters stated in the certificate.

             (5)  The mere production of a _Gazette_ containing a notice purporting to be issued by the Commissioner is _prima facie_ evidence that the notice was so issued.

             (6)  A return under this Act purporting to be made or signed by or on behalf of a person is _prima facie_ evidence that the return was made by the person or with the authority of the person.

##### <a id="106A"></a>106A  Review of certain decisions

                   A person who is dissatisfied with a decision made under this Act or the regulations in relation to the person, being a decision that is prescribed for the purposes of this section, may object against it in the manner set out in Part IVC of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

             (2)  For the purposes of this clause, the available exploration expenditure amount for the assessable year equals the incurred exploration expenditure amount in relation to the assessable year.

             (3)  For the purposes of this clause, the available exploration expenditure amount for an ABR expenditure year before the assessable year is worked out as follows:

                     (a)  if the ABR expenditure year is the financial year immediately before the assessable year—multiply the incurred exploration expenditure amount in relation to the ABR expenditure year by the augmented bond rate for the ABR expenditure year;

                     (b)  if the ABR expenditure year is an earlier financial year—work out, in relation to the ABR expenditure year and each later financial year ending before the assessable year, an amount in accordance with the formula:

**_Augmented bond rate_** means the augmented bond rate in relation to the financial year in relation to which the calculation is being made;

                     (c)  if paragraph (a) applies—the available exploration expenditure amount for the ABR expenditure year is the amount worked out under that paragraph;

                     (d)  if paragraph (b) applies—the available exploration expenditure amount for the ABR expenditure year is the amount worked out under that paragraph in relation to the most recent of the later financial years referred to in paragraph (b).

             (4)  If the total of the available exploration expenditure amounts for the assessable year and the previous ABR expenditure years is less than or equal to the notional taxable profit:

                     (a)  the person is taken to have incurred an amount of class 2 augmented bond rate exploration expenditure in the assessable year in relation to the project equal to the total of those available exploration expenditure amounts; and

                     (b)  that class 2 augmented bond rate exploration expenditure is attributable to all the expenditure included in the incurred exploration expenditure amounts for the assessable year and the previous ABR expenditure years; and

                     (c)  none of the expenditure included in the incurred exploration expenditure amounts for the assessable year and the previous ABR expenditure years is transferable by the person in relation to the assessable year.

                     (c)  the expenditure included in the incurred exploration expenditure amounts for the assessable year and the previous ABR expenditure years that is not expenditure to which that class 2 augmented bond rate exploration expenditure is attributable is transferable by the person in relation to the assessable year.

             (6)  If:

                     (a)  class 2 augmented bond rate exploration expenditure is taken to be incurred by subclause (5); and

                     (b)  the available exploration expenditure amount for the earliest of the ABR expenditure years for which there is such an amount equals or exceeds the notional taxable profit;

the class 2 augmented bond rate exploration expenditure is attributable to so much of the expenditure included in the incurred exploration expenditure amount for that ABR expenditure year as, if it had been the only expenditure included in that amount, would have made the available exploration expenditure amount for that ABR expenditure year equal the notional taxable profit.

             (7)  If:

                     (a)  class 2 augmented bond rate exploration expenditure is taken to be incurred by subclause (5); and

                             (ii)  if adding the available exploration expenditure amount for an ABR expenditure year would make the total exceed the notional taxable profit, add only so much of that amount as makes the total equal the notional taxable profit and do not add the available exploration expenditure amount for any later ABR expenditure year;

                     (d)  the class 2 augmented bond rate expenditure is attributable to:

                              (i)  all the expenditure included in the incurred exploration expenditure amounts for each ABR expenditure year in relation to which the whole available exploration expenditure amount was added in accordance with subparagraphs (c)(i) and (ii); and

                             (ii)  if, under those subparagraphs, part only of the available exploration expenditure amount for an ABR expenditure year was added—so much of the expenditure included in the incurred exploration expenditure amount for that ABR expenditure year as, if it had been the only expenditure included in that amount, would have made the available exploration expenditure amount for that ABR expenditure year equal the added part.

## Part 4—Transferable exploration expenditure not incurred in relation to a project

##### <a id="13"></a>13  Matters dealt with in this Part

             (1)  Subject to subclause (2), this Part deals with the calculation of the amount of expenditure incurred by a person in relation to an exploration permit or retention lease that is transferable from the permit or lease in relation to a financial year. In this Part, the financial year is called the **_assessable year_**.

          (1A)  For the avoidance of doubt, the assessable year may, subject to subclause (2), be a financial year starting after the finishing day in relation to the exploration permit or retention lease.

             (2)  This Part does not apply to an exploration permit or retention lease in relation to a financial year if a production licence derived from the permit or lease was actually in force at any time during the financial year.

##### <a id="14"></a>14  Assumptions on which amounts to be worked out

                   Amounts worked out under this Part in relation to the exploration permit or retention lease and a period (including a financial year) are to be worked out on the assumptions that:

                     (a)  a production licence derived from the permit or lease was in force at all times during the period; and

                     (b)  the petroleum project to which that production licence was related consisted only of that production licence.

In this Part, the petroleum project referred to in paragraph (b) is called the **_notional project_**.

##### <a id="15"></a>15  Non‑transferable expenditure

             (1)  For the purposes of this Part, if:

                     (a)  the person incurred exploration expenditure, or is taken to have incurred uplifted frontier expenditure, in relation to the notional project in a financial year; and

                     (b)  the total amount of assessable receipts derived by the person in relation to the notional project in the financial year equals or exceeds the total amount of deductible expenditure actually incurred by the person in relation to the notional project in the financial year;

the total of the amounts of exploration expenditure (other than designated frontier expenditure), and uplifted frontier expenditure, is taken to be non‑transferable expenditure incurred by the person in relation to the notional project.

             (2)  For the purposes of this Part, if:

                     (a)  the total amount of deductible expenditure actually incurred by the person in relation to the notional project in a financial year exceeds the total amount of assessable receipts derived by the person in relation to the notional project and the financial year; and

                     (b)  the total of:

                              (i)  any amounts of exploration expenditure (other than designated frontier expenditure) actually incurred by the person; and

                             (ii)  any amounts of uplifted frontier expenditure taken to be incurred by the person in respect of designated frontier expenditure actually incurred by the person;

                            in relation to the notional project in the financial year exceeds the excess referred to in paragraph (a) by an amount (the **_non‑transferable amount_**);

so much of the expenditure as equals the non‑transferable amount is taken to be non‑transferable expenditure incurred by the person in relation to the notional project.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  subclause (2) applies; and

                     (b)  the oldest amount of any exploration expenditure (other than designated frontier expenditure) incurred, or any uplifted frontier expenditure taken to be incurred, by the person in the financial year equals or exceeds the non‑transferable amount;

the non‑transferable expenditure consists of so much of that oldest amount as equals the non‑transferable amount.

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  subclause (2) applies; but

                     (b)  subclause (3) does not apply;

the following provisions have effect:

                     (c)  add amounts in accordance with the following rules:

                              (i)  start with the oldest amount of any exploration expenditure (other than designated frontier expenditure) incurred, or any uplifted frontier expenditure taken to be incurred, by the person in the financial year;

                             (ii)  add to that, in order starting with the next oldest amount, each of the other amounts incurred, or taken to be incurred, by the person in the financial year;

                            (iii)  if adding an amount of expenditure would make the total exceed the non‑transferable amount, add only so much of the amount as makes the total equal the non‑transferable amount and do not add any later amount of expenditure;

                     (d)  the non‑transferable expenditure consists of the amounts of expenditure added together in accordance with paragraph (c).

##### <a id="16"></a>16  Amounts to be worked out

                   Work out, in relation to the person, the exploration permit or retention lease and the assessable year, the following amounts:

                     (a)  the total of the assessable receipts derived by the person in relation to the notional project during the period starting on 1 July 1990 and ending at the end of the assessable year;

                     (b)  the total of the deductible expenditure actually incurred by the person in relation to the notional project during the period starting on 1 July 1990 and ending at the end of the assessable year;

                     (c)  the total of:

                              (i)  any amounts of exploration expenditure (other than designated frontier expenditure) actually incurred by the person; and

                             (ii)  any amounts of uplifted frontier expenditure taken to be incurred by the person in respect of designated frontier expenditure actually incurred by the person;

                            in relation to the notional project during the period starting on 1 July 1990 and ending at the end of the assessable year;

                     (d)  the amount worked out under paragraph (c), less the total of the amounts of non‑transferable expenditure incurred by the person in relation to the notional project during the period starting on 1 July 1990 and ending at the end of the assessable year.

In this Part, the amount worked out under paragraph (a) is called the **_notional assessable receipts_**, the amount worked out under paragraph (b) is called the **_notional deductible expenditure_**, the amount worked out under paragraph (c) is called the **_notional exploration expenditure_** and the amount worked out under paragraph (d) is called the **_reduced notional exploration expenditure_**.

Note:          the effect of subsection 45D(3) must be taken into account when working out the notional deductible expenditure and the notional exploration expenditure.

##### <a id="17"></a>17  What happens if the notional assessable receipts equal or exceed the notional deductible expenditure

                   If, in relation to the person, the exploration permit or retention lease and the assessable year, the notional assessable receipts equal or exceed the notional deductible expenditure, none of the expenditure included in the notional exploration expenditure is transferable by the person in relation to the assessable year.

##### <a id="18"></a>18  What happens if the notional deductible expenditure exceeds the notional assessable receipts

             (1)  If, in relation to the person, the exploration permit or retention lease and the assessable year:

                     (a)  the notional deductible expenditure exceeds the notional assessable receipts; and

                     (b)  the excess equals or exceeds the notional exploration expenditure;

all the expenditure included in the reduced notional exploration expenditure is transferable by the person in relation to the assessable year.

             (2)  If, in relation to the person, the exploration permit or retention lease and the assessable year:

                     (a)  the notional deductible expenditure exceeds the notional assessable receipts; and

                     (b)  the excess (in this subclause called the **_notional loss_**) is less than the notional exploration expenditure; and

                     (c)  the oldest amount of expenditure included in the reduced notional exploration expenditure equals or exceeds the notional loss;

so much of that oldest amount as equals the notional loss is transferable by the person in relation to the assessable year.

             (3)  If, in relation to the person, the exploration permit or retention lease and the assessable year:

                     (a)  the notional deductible expenditure exceeds the notional assessable receipts; and

                     (b)  the excess (in this subclause called the **_notional loss_**) is less than the notional exploration expenditure; and

                     (c)  the notional loss exceeds the oldest amount of expenditure included in the reduced notional exploration expenditure;

the following provisions have effect:

                     (d)  add amounts in accordance with the following rules:

                              (i)  start with the oldest amount of expenditure included in the reduced notional exploration expenditure and add to that, in order starting with the next oldest amount, each of the other amounts included in the reduced notional exploration expenditure;

                             (ii)  if adding an amount of expenditure would make the total exceed the notional loss, add only so much of the amount as makes the total equal the notional loss and do not add any later incurred amount of expenditure;

                     (e)  the expenditure added in accordance with subparagraphs (d)(i) and (ii) is transferable by the person in relation to the assessable year.

## Part 5—General rules relating to transfer of exploration expenditure

##### <a id="19"></a>19  Interpretation

                   In this Part:

                    <a name="notion-taxabl-profit"></a>**_notional taxable profit_**, in relation to a person, a petroleum project and a financial year, means the amount (if any) that would be the taxable profit in relation to the person, the project and the financial year if:

                     (a)  all deductible expenditure in relation to the person, the project and the financial year were taken into account; and

                     (b)  any expenditure transferred:

                              (i)  to the project in relation to the financial year under section 45A; or

                             (ii)  to the person in relation to the project and the financial year under section 45B;

                            had not been transferred.

##### <a id="20"></a>20  Matters dealt with in this Part

                   This Part sets out the rules relating to the transfer by a person of transferable exploration expenditure from a petroleum project or an exploration right to another petroleum project in relation to a financial year. In this Part, the project or right from which the expenditure is transferred is called the **_transferring entity_**, the project to which the expenditure is transferred is called the **_receiving project_** and the financial year is called the **_transfer year_**.

Note:          Special rules apply in relation to the transfer of Greater Sunrise exploration expenditure: see Part 1A of this Schedule.

##### <a id="21"></a>21  Rule—must be a notional taxable profit in relation to receiving project

                   The person may only transfer the expenditure to the receiving project in relation to the transfer year if there is a notional taxable profit in relation to the person, the receiving project and the transfer year.

##### <a id="22"></a>22  Rule—person must have held interests in relation to transferring entity and receiving project

             (1)  Subject to subclauses (2), (2AA), (2AB), (2A), (3) and (4), the person may only transfer the expenditure to the receiving project in relation to the transfer year if:

                     (a)  the person held an interest in relation to the transferring entity at all times from the beginning of the financial year in which the expenditure was incurred to the end of the transfer year; and

                     (b)  the person held an interest in relation to the receiving project at all times from the beginning of the financial year in which the expenditure was incurred to the end of the transfer year.

             (2)  Subclause (1) does not require the person to have held an interest in relation to the transferring entity at a time before the starting day in relation to the transferring entity.

       (2AA)  If:

                     (a)  the person started (whether or not for the first time) to hold an interest in relation to the transferring entity during the financial year in which the expenditure was incurred; and

                     (b)  the expenditure was incurred after the time (the **_farm‑in time_**) when the person started to hold the interest; and

                     (c)  the expenditure was actually incurred by the person (rather than taken by section 48 or 48A to have been incurred by the person);

subclause (1) does not require the person to have held an interest in relation to the transferring entity before the farm‑in time.

       (2AB)  If:

                     (a)  at a time (the **_cessation time_**) after the expenditure was incurred and on or after 1 July 1993, the person ceased to hold any interest in relation to the transferring entity; and

                     (b)  the cessation did not occur because of a transaction to which section 48 applies;

subclause (1) does not require the person to have held an interest in relation to the transferring entity at a time after the cessation time.

          (2A)  Subclause (1) does not require the person to have held an interest in relation to the transferring entity at a time after the finishing day in relation to the transferring entity.

             (3)  If the starting days in relation to the transferring entity and the receiving project occurred in the same financial year, subclause (1) does not require the person to have held an interest in relation to the receiving project at a time before the starting day in relation to the receiving project.

             (4)  If the starting day in relation to the receiving project occurred in a later financial year than the financial year in which the expenditure was incurred:

                     (a)  paragraph (1)(b) does not apply in relation to the transfer of the expenditure; and

                     (b)  the person may only transfer the expenditure if (in addition to the requirement in paragraph (1)(a)):

                              (i)  the exploration permit by reference to which the starting day in relation to the receiving project is determined was granted to the person; and

                             (ii)  the person held an interest in relation to the receiving project at all times from the starting day in relation to the receiving project to the end of the transfer year.

##### <a id="23"></a>23  Rule—transfer to project with most recent production licence

                   If the expenditure was incurred before the transfer year, the person may not transfer the expenditure to the receiving project in relation to the transfer year if:

                     (a)  there is another petroleum project to which the expenditure could be transferred in relation to the transfer year under section 45A; and

                     (b)  the other project includes a production licence that was granted more recently than the production licence or licences included in the receiving project.

##### <a id="24"></a>24  Rule—restriction on transfer of ABR expenditure

                   The person may not transfer the expenditure to the receiving project in relation to the transfer year if:

                     (a)  the expenditure was incurred in an ABR expenditure year in relation to the receiving project; and

                     (b)  there is other expenditure that the person could transfer to the receiving project in relation to the transfer year under section 45A; and

                     (c)  that other expenditure was incurred in an earlier ABR expenditure year in relation to the receiving project.

##### <a id="25"></a>25  Rule—restriction on transfer of GDP expenditure

                   The person may not transfer the expenditure to the receiving project in relation to the transfer year if:

                     (a)  the expenditure was incurred in a GDP expenditure year in relation to the receiving project; and

                     (b)  there is other expenditure that the person could transfer to the receiving project in relation to the transfer year under section 45A; and

                     (c)  that other expenditure was incurred in:

                              (i)  an ABR expenditure year in relation to the receiving project; or

                             (ii)  an earlier GDP expenditure year in relation to the receiving project.

##### <a id="26"></a>26  Rule—total transferred not to exceed notional taxable profit

                   The total amount of expenditure transferred by the person under section 45A to the receiving project in relation to the transfer year must not exceed the notional taxable profit in relation to the person, the receiving project and the transfer year.

Note:          because of subsection 45D(2), some transfers of expenditure are taken to be transfers of amounts compounded in accordance with Part 7 of this Schedule.

## Part 6—Rules relating to transfer of exploration expenditure between group companies

##### <a id="27"></a>27  Interpretation

                   In this Part:

                    <a name="notion-taxabl-profit"></a>**_notional taxable profit_**, in relation to a company, a petroleum project and a financial year, means the amount (if any) that would be the taxable profit in relation to the company, the project and the financial year if:

                     (a)  all deductible expenditure in relation to the company, the project and the financial year were taken into account; and

                     (b)  all expenditure to be transferred by the company to the project in relation to the financial year under section 45A had been transferred; and

                     (c)  any expenditure transferred to the company in relation to the project and the financial year under section 45B had not been transferred.

##### <a id="28"></a>28  Situations to which this Part applies

                   This Part applies if:

                     (a)  a number of companies are group companies in relation to each other and a financial year; and

                     (b)  there is unused transferable exploration expenditure, within the meaning of section 45B, in relation to some of the companies and the financial year.

In this Part, each of the companies in relation to which there is unused transferable exploration expenditure is called a **_loss company_**, each of the other companies is called a **_profit company_** and the financial year is called the **_transfer year_**.

##### <a id="29"></a>29  Matters dealt with in this Part

                   This Part sets out the rules relating to the transfer by a loss company of transferable exploration expenditure from a petroleum project or an exploration right to a profit company in relation to a petroleum project and the transfer year. In this Part, the project or right from which the expenditure is transferred is called the **_transferring entity_**and the project in relation to which the expenditure is transferred is called the **_receiving project_.**

Note:          Special rules apply in relation to the transfer of Greater Sunrise exploration expenditure: see Part 1A of this Schedule.

##### <a id="30"></a>30  Rule—must be a notional taxable profit in relation to profit company and receiving project

                   The loss company may only transfer the expenditure to the profit company in relation to the receiving project and the transfer year if there is a notional taxable profit in relation to the profit company, the receiving project and the transfer year.

##### <a id="31"></a>31  Rule—continuity of interest within company group

Main rule

             (1)  The loss company may transfer the expenditure to the profit company in relation to the receiving project and the transfer year only if:

                     (a)  from the start of the financial year in which the expenditure was actually incurred, until the end of the transfer year—the company which held the receiving interest at any particular time was, at that time:

                             (ii)  unless the time is at the end of the transfer year—the company which held the loss interest at that time; and

                     (b)  when the expenditure was actually incurred:

                              (i)  unless section 41 applies to the expenditure—the company which actually incurred the expenditure held the loss interest in the transferring entity; or

                             (ii)  if section 41 applies to the expenditure—the company taken under paragraph 41(1)(b) to have incurred the liability for making the expenditure held the loss interest in the transferring entity.

Receiving project or transferring entity not in existence at particular time

             (2)  For the purposes of subclause (1):

                     (a)  if the starting day for the receiving project was after the start of the financial year in which the expenditure was incurred—during the period from the start of that year until the start of the starting day, the company which held the receiving interest at the start of the starting day is taken to have held the receiving interest; and

                     (b)  if the finishing day for the receiving project was before the end of the transfer year—during the period from the start of the finishing day until the end of the transfer year, the profit company is taken to have held the receiving interest; and

                     (c)  if the starting day for the transferring entity was after the start of the financial year in which the expenditure was incurred—during the period from the start of that year until the start of the starting day, the company which held the loss interest at the start of the starting day is taken to have held the loss interest; and

                     (d)  if the finishing day for the transferring entity was before the end of the transfer year—during the period from the start of the finishing day until the end of the transfer year, the loss company is taken to have held the loss interest.

Starting day for receiving project in later financial year than when expenditure actually incurred

             (3)  If the starting day for the receiving project was in a later financial year than the financial year in which the expenditure was incurred, the loss company may transfer the expenditure only if (in addition to the other requirements of this clause) the company which held the receiving interest at the start of the starting day was the company which had been granted the exploration permit by reference to which the starting day is determined.

                     (a)  the expenditure could be transferred in relation to the transfer year under section 45B to:

                              (i)  the profit company in relation to another petroleum project; or

                             (ii)  another profit company in relation to another petroleum project; and

                     (b)  the other project includes a production licence that was granted more recently than the production licence or licences included in the receiving project.

##### <a id="33"></a>33  Rule—restriction on transfer of ABR expenditure

## Part 2—Choosing a valuation approach

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Choosing a valuation approach

             (1)  A person may choose the valuation approach for:

                     (a)  an interest that, on 30 June 2013, the person holds in an onshore petroleum project or the North West Shelf project; or

                     (b)  an interest that the person may in the future hold in such a project, if the project:

                              (i)  does not exist at the time the person makes the choice; and

                             (ii)  would, if it later came into existence, be derived from an exploration permit or retention lease in which the person held an interest at that time.

             (2)  The choice is not valid unless the person gives to the Commissioner a valid starting base return.

             (3)  The choice must specify whether the person has chosen:

                     (a)  the book value approach; or

                     (b)  the market value approach; or

                     (c)  the look‑back approach.

Note 1:       The book value approach and the market value approach affect a person’s starting base amount under Part 3, through the valuation of starting base assets under Division 3 of that Part and the way in which interim expenditure is taken into account under Division 4 of that Part.

Note 2:       There is no starting base amount if the look‑back approach applies, but expenditure incurred before 1 July 2012 may be eligible real expenditure: see subsections 45(2), (4) and (5).

             (4)  The choice is irrevocable after:

                     (a)  30 August 2013; or

                     (b)  if, under paragraph 22(2)(c), the Commissioner allows further time for the person to give a starting base return—after that time elapses.

             (5)  The choice applies to:

                     (a)  the year of tax commencing on 1 July 2012; and

                     (b)  all later years of tax.

Note:          Making a choice obliges the person to give to the Commissioner a starting base return under clause 22.

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Restriction on specifying the book value approach

             (1)  The choice cannot specify the book value approach unless:

                     (a)  during the 18 months preceding 2 May 2010, a person who held in that period:

                              (i)  the interest in the onshore petroleum project or the North West Shelf project; or

                             (ii)  if that interest did not exist in that period—an interest in the exploration permit or retention lease mentioned in subparagraph 3(1)(b)(ii);

                            prepared a financial report relating to the interest in accordance with accounting standards; and

                     (b)  the report relates to a financial period that ended in the 18 months preceding 2 May 2010; and

                     (c)  the report has been audited in accordance with auditing standards.

             (2)  If, during the 18 months preceding 2 May 2010, the person was a part of a consolidated entity (within the meaning of the _Corporations Act 2001_), for the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), treat any financial report for the consolidated entity, relating to the interest, as a report that the person prepared.

##### <a id="5"></a>5  The valuation approach for starting base assets

                   The valuation approach for an interest in an onshore petroleum project or the North West Shelf project is the approach specified in a choice under clause 3 relating to:

                     (a)  the interest; or

                     (b)  an interest in an exploration permit or retention lease from which the interest is derived.

##### <a id="6"></a>6  When a person has a _starting base amount_

                   A person has a **_starting base amount_** in relation to an interest in a petroleum project if:

                     (a)  the project is an onshore petroleum project or is the North West Shelf project; and

                     (b)  the person holds the interest; and

                     (c)  either:

                              (i)  the production licence relating to the project existed at the start of 1 July 2012; or

                             (ii)  there existed at that time an exploration permit, or a retention lease, from which is derived the production licence to which the project relates; and

                     (d)  the look‑back approach is not the valuation approach for the interest under Part 2; and

                     (e)  there are one or more starting base assets relating to the interest.

Note:          In order for a starting base asset to relate to an interest in a petroleum project, the production licence relating to the project, or the retention lease or exploration permit from which it is derived, must have existed just before 2 May 2010: see clause 10.

##### <a id="7"></a>7  The amount of the starting base amount

             (1)  If, under Part 2, the book value approach is the valuation approach for an interest in an onshore petroleum project or the North West Shelf project, the amount of the starting base amount relating to the interest is the sum of:

                     (a)  the book values, worked out under Division 3, of all the starting base assets, relating to the interest, to which subclause (3) applies; and

                     (b)  the adjusted interim expenditure amounts relating to the interest, worked out under clause 16.

             (2)  If, under Part 2, the market value approach is the valuation approach for an interest in an onshore petroleum project or the North West Shelf project, the amount of the starting base amount relating to the interest is the sum of:

                     (a)  unless clause 8 applies—the market values, worked out under Division 3, of all the starting base assets, relating to the interest, to which subclause (3) applies; and

                     (b)  if clause 8 applies—the amount worked out under subclause 8(2); and

                     (c)  the amounts of interim expenditure incurred in relation to the interest.

             (3)  This subclause applies to a starting base asset if, at all times between 2 May 2010 and 30 June 2012, the person holding the asset simultaneously held:

                     (a)  the interest in the project; or

                     (b)  if, for some or all of that period, the project did not exist—an interest in a retention lease, or in an exploration permit, from which the project is derived.

Note:          This subsection allows for a transfer of the starting base asset between 2 May 2010 and 30 June 2012, if it matches a transfer of the interest.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Alternative valuation method for coal seam gas projects

             (1)  This clause applies if:

                     (a)  under Part 2, the market value approach is the valuation approach for an interest in an onshore petroleum project; and

                     (b)  the project includes a known reserve of coal seam gas; and

                     (c)  either:

                              (i)  the interest, or another interest in the project, was acquired, by any person, between 1 July 2007 and 2 May 2010; or

                             (ii)  a company that held the interest, or another interest in the project, was acquired, by any person, between 1 July 2007 and 2 May 2010; and

                     (d)  the person who chose the market value approach in relation to the interest (the **_interest holder_**) chooses under subclause (4) of this clause to apply the alternative valuation method for coal seam gas projects.

             (2)  For the purposes of paragraph 7(2)(b), the amount worked out under this subclause is:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00686/Html/2ad21fa4-cb65-45b8-bf15-381f955f5b3a_files/image022.gif)

where:

                    <a name="estimated-reserv"></a>**_estimated reserves_** is:

                     (a)  if paragraph (b) does not apply—the most recent approved estimate, made before 2 May 2010, of the proved, probable and possible reserves of coal seam gas for the project, expressed in gigajoules; or

                     (b)  if the interest holder does not hold the entire interest in the project—the portion of that estimate, expressed in gigajoules, of those reserves that reflects the interest holder’s interest in the project.

                    <a name="product-estim"></a>**_production since estimate_** is:

                     (a)  if paragraph (b) does not apply—the amount of coal seam gas produced from the project, expressed in gigajoules, between the day on which that approved estimate was made and 2 May 2010; or

                     (b)  if the interest holder does not hold the entire interest in the project—the portion of that production, expressed in gigajoules, that reflects the interest holder’s interest in the project.

             (3)  To be an approved estimate for the purposes of subclause (2), an estimate of the proved, probable and possible reserves of coal seam gas for the project must have been:

                     (a)  determined in accordance with the requirements of the document known as the Petroleum Resources Management System, issued by the Society of Petroleum Engineers, as in force at the time the estimate was made; and

                     (b)  independently certified as being determined in accordance with the requirements of that document as so in force.

             (4)  The interest holder may choose to apply the alternative valuation method for coal seam gas projects.

             (5)  The choice is not valid unless the interest holder gives it to the Commissioner:

                     (a)  in the approved form; and

                     (b)  on or before 30 August 2013, or within a further time that the Commissioner allows.

             (6)  The choice is irrevocable, and applies to:

                     (a)  the year of tax commencing on 1 July 2012; and

                     (b)  all later years of tax.

             (7)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(c):

                     (a)  a person holding an interest in the project is taken to have acquired the interest if, and when, the person is taken to have acquired that interest for the purposes of clause 18; and

                     (b)  a company holding an interest in the project is taken to have been acquired if, and when, the company is taken to have been acquired for the purposes of that clause.

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Reducing the starting base amount

             (1)  Despite clause 7, a starting base amount under that clause is reduced by the sum of all the reductions (if any) required by subclauses (2) and (3) of this clause in relation to any starting base assets to which the starting base amount relates.

Use etc. that is not related to project activities

             (2)  Reduce the starting base amount to the extent (if any) that the amount relates to a starting base asset that, during the starting base period relating to the asset, was used, or being constructed for use, for a purpose other than carrying on project activities relating to the petroleum project.

Use etc. that equates to excluded expenditure

             (3)  Reduce the starting base amount (or, if that amount is reduced under subclause (2), that amount as so reduced) to the extent (if any) that the amount:

                     (a)  relates to a starting base asset that, during the starting base period relating to the asset, was used, or being constructed for use, for carrying on project activities relating to the petroleum project; but

                     (b)  would have been excluded expenditure if it had been an amount of expenditure that the person holding the interest in the project incurred.

             (4)  However, subclause (3) does not apply if:

                     (a)  under Part 2, the market value approach is the valuation approach for the person’s starting base assets relating to the petroleum project; and

                     (b)  the amount would have been excluded expenditure only because of paragraph 44(e), (f) or (g).

Note:          Subclause (4) ensures that a starting base amount in relation to an interest in a petroleum project is not reduced under the market value approach.

Starting base period

             (5)  The **_starting base period_** in relation to a starting base asset is a period, between 2 May 2010 and 1 July 2012:

                     (a)  during which a person held both the asset and the interest in the project; and

                     (b)  during which the asset was, for any purpose, used or being constructed for use.

### Division 2—Starting base assets

##### <a id="10"></a>10  Meaning of _starting base asset_

             (1)  Property, or a legal or equitable right that is not property, is a **_starting base asset_** relating to an interest in an onshore petroleum project or the North West Shelf project if:

                     (a)  either of the following existed just before 2 May 2010:

                              (i)  the production licence relating to the project, or (if the project is a combined project) a pre‑combination project in relation to the project;

                             (ii)  a retention lease, or exploration permit, from which the project (or pre‑combination project) is derived; and

                     (b)  on 2 May 2010, the property or right was used, or being constructed for use, in carrying on project activities relating to the project (or pre‑combination project); and

                     (c)  the look‑back approach is not the valuation approach for the interest under Part 2.

             (2)  Despite subclause (1):

                     (a)  if, under Part 2, the book value approach is the valuation approach for the interest in the petroleum project, the following are not **_starting base assets_**:

                              (i)  rights and interests constituting the petroleum project;

                             (ii)  mining, quarrying or prospecting information, or rights to such information;

                            (iii)  goodwill; and

                     (b)  property, or a legal or equitable right, is not, and is taken never to have been, a **_starting base asset_** if:

                              (i)  a valid choice has not been made under section 3 specifying the valuation approach for the interest; or

                             (ii)  a valid starting base return that covers the property or right has not been given to the Commissioner.

             (3)  If, under Part 2, the market value approach is the valuation approach for the person’s starting base assets relating to the interest in the petroleum project, treat:

                     (a)  any mining, quarrying or prospecting information; or

                     (b)  any rights to such information;

as property, or a legal or equitable right, for the purposes of subsection (1).

             (4)  Despite subsection (1), something that has already become a starting base asset relating to an interest in a petroleum project derived from a particular retention lease or exploration permit cannot become a starting base asset relating to an interest in another petroleum project derived from that lease or permit.

             (5)  This Schedule applies to any improvement to, or any fixture on, land as if it were an asset separate from the land, whether the improvement or fixture is removable or not.

##### <a id="11"></a>11  _Holding_ a starting base asset

             (1)  A person **_holds_** a starting base asset relating to an onshore petroleum project or the North West Shelf project if:

                     (a)  the asset is a depreciating asset that the person holds (within the meaning of section 40‑40 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_); or

                     (b)  the person would hold the asset (within the meaning of that section) if it were a depreciating asset.

             (2)  However, a person who is entitled to the interest in a petroleum project is taken to hold the rights and interests constituting the interest in the project.

### Division 3—Valuation of starting base assets

##### <a id="12"></a>12  The book value of a starting base asset

             (1)  If, under Part 2, the book value approach is the valuation approach for an interest in an onshore petroleum project or the North West Shelf project, the book value of a starting base asset relating to the interest is the book value under subclause (2) or (3).

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  the value of the asset is recorded in the accounts from which the most recent audited financial report before 2 May 2010 was prepared; and

                     (b)  the financial report relates to a financial period that ended in the 18 months preceding that day;

the book value of the asset is as follows:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00686/Html/2ad21fa4-cb65-45b8-bf15-381f955f5b3a_files/image023.gif)

where:

                    <a name="accepted-valu"></a>**_accepted value_** is:

                     (a)  the value recorded in those accounts, unless paragraph (b) applies; or

                     (b)  if that value is inconsistent with an auditor’s report on the financial report—a value that is consistent with the auditor’s report.

                    <a name="long-term-bond-rate-valuat-period"></a>**_long term bond rate for the valuation period_** is the long term bond rate for the valuation period under subclause (4).

                    <a name=""></a>**_n_** is the number of days in that valuation period, divided by 365.

             (3)  However, the initial book value of the asset is zero if the value of the asset is not recorded as mentioned in subclause (2).

             (4)  The valuation period for the asset is the period:

                     (a)  starting:

                              (i)  on the day the financial report mentioned in paragraph (2)(a) was prepared, unless subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph applies; or

                             (ii)  if the value of the asset recorded in the accounts from which the financial report was produced is inconsistent with an auditor’s report on the financial report—on the day of the auditor’s report; and

                     (b)  ending at the end of 30 June 2012.

##### <a id="13"></a>13  The market value of a starting base asset

             (1)  If, under Part 2, the market value approach is the valuation approach for an interest in an onshore petroleum project or the North West Shelf project, the market value of a starting base asset relating to the interest is the market value of the asset on 1 May 2010.

             (2)  However, if the asset is a right or interest constituting the interest in the project, in working out its market value for the purposes of this section, disregard any liability of the person to make any payments, of a kind known as private override royalty payments, relating to:

                     (a)  petroleum recovered from:

                              (i)  the production licence area in relation to the project; or

                             (ii)  an exploration permit area for an exploration permit from which the production licence to which the project relates is derived; or

                            (iii)  a retention lease area for a retention lease from which the production licence to which the project relates is derived; or

                     (b)  marketable petroleum commodities produced from such petroleum.

##### <a id="14"></a>14  Partial disposal of a starting base asset before 1 July 2012

             (1)  The book value under clause 12, or the market value under clause 13, of a starting base asset relating to an interest that a person holds in an onshore petroleum project or the North West Shelf project is reduced to the extent (if any) that any of the person’s interest in the asset is disposed of during the period:

                     (a)  starting on the day provided under subclause (2); and

                     (b)  ending at the end of 30 June 2012.

             (2)  The period starts:

                     (a)  if, under Part 2, the book value approach is the valuation approach for the interest:

                              (i)  on the day of the financial report (if any) mentioned in paragraph 12(2)(a) of this Schedule in relation to the accounts in which the value of the asset is recorded; or

                             (ii)  if subparagraph (i) of this paragraph does not apply—on 2 May 2010; or

                     (b)  if, under Part 2, the market value approach is the valuation approach for the interest—on 2 May 2010.

             (3)  Treat, for the purposes of this clause, as a disposal of part of the person’s interest in the starting base asset an arrangement that has the effect of transferring to another person part of the benefits or entitlements that the person has in relation to the asset.

### Division 4—Interim expenditure

##### <a id="15"></a>15  Meaning of _interim expenditure_

             (1)  An amount of expenditure that a person incurs relating to an interest in an onshore petroleum project or the North West Shelf project is **_interim expenditure_** relating to the interest to the extent that:

                     (a)  the amount:

                              (i)  relates to a depreciating asset that is used, or being constructed for use, on 1 July 2012 in carrying on project activities relating to the project; and

                             (ii)  is included in the cost of the asset under Subdivision 40‑C of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

                            (iii)  was incurred during the period starting on the day provided under subclause (3) or (4) and ending at the end of 30 June 2012; or

                     (b)  the amount:

                              (i)  relates to a CGT asset that is not a depreciating asset and that is used, or being constructed for use, on 1 July 2012 in carrying on project activities relating to the project; and

                             (ii)  is included in the cost base of the asset; and

                            (iii)  was incurred during the period starting on the day provided under subclause (3) or (4) and ending at the end of 30 June 2012; or

                     (c)  the amount:

                              (i)  is mining capital expenditure (within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_) relating to project activities relating to the project; and

                             (ii)  was incurred between 2 May 2010 and 30 June 2012.

             (2)  However, if the asset is a CGT asset (but not a depreciating asset), treat the amount of the interim expenditure as not including any part of the amount that consists of the third element of the cost base under subsection 110‑25(4) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

Start of the expenditure period

             (3)  If, under Part 2, the book value approach is the valuation approach for the interest in the petroleum project, the period starts:

                     (a)  if subclause (5) applies to the asset:

                              (i)  on the day of the financial report (if any) mentioned in paragraph 12(2)(a) of this Schedule in relation to the accounts in which the value of the asset is recorded; or

                             (ii)  if subparagraph (i) of this paragraph does not apply—on 2 May 2010; or

                     (b)  otherwise—on the first day, before the end of 30 June 2012, from which the person held the asset at all times until the end of 30 June 2012.

Example:    The person bought an asset on 1 January 2011 and sold it on 1 May 2011\. The person bought the asset again on 1 June 2011 and still held it at the end of 30 June 2012.

                   The expenditure incurred in buying the asset the first time (on 1 January 2011) is not interim expenditure, because the person did not hold the asset until the end of 30 June 2012, as required by paragraph (3)(b).

                   The expenditure incurred in buying the asset the second time (on 1 June 2011) is interim expenditure (if it is covered by paragraph (1)(a)), because the person held the asset until the end of 30 June 2012.

             (4)  If, under Part 2, the market value approach is the valuation approach for the interest in the petroleum project, the period starts:

                     (a)  if subclause (5) applies to the asset—on 2 May 2010; or

                     (b)  otherwise—on the first day, before the end of 30 June 2012, from which the person held the asset at all times until the end of 30 June 2012.

             (5)  This subclause applies to an asset if, at all times between 2 May 2010 and 30 June 2012, the person holding the asset simultaneously held:

                     (a)  the interest in the project; or

                     (b)  if, for some or all of that period, the project did not exist—an interest in a retention lease, or in an exploration permit, from which the project is derived.

             (6)  For the purposes of subclauses (3) to (5), an amount of expenditure to which paragraph (1)(c) applies is taken to be an asset that the person incurring the expenditure holds from the day the expenditure was incurred until the day on which the person ceases to hold the interest in the project.

Excluded expenditure

             (7)  Despite subclause (1), the amount is not **_interim expenditure_** to the extent (if any) that the amount would have been excluded expenditure if it had been incurred after 1 July 2012.

##### <a id="16"></a>16  Adjusted interim expenditure amounts

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  under Part 2, the book value approach is the valuation approach for an interest in an onshore petroleum project or the North West Shelf project; and

                     (b)  a person holding an interest in the project incurred an amount of interim expenditure relating to the interest;

there is an adjusted interim expenditure amount relating to the interest.

             (2)  The adjusted interim expenditure amount is as follows:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00686/Html/2ad21fa4-cb65-45b8-bf15-381f955f5b3a_files/image024.gif)

where:

                    <a name="long-term-bond-rate-interim-valuat-period"></a>**_long term bond rate for the interim valuation period_** is the long term bond rate for the interim valuation period under subclause (3).

                    <a name=""></a>**_n_** is the number of days in the interim valuation period, divided by 365.

             (3)  The interim valuation period for an amount of interim expenditure is the period:

                     (a)  starting on the day on which the person holding the interest in the petroleum project incurred the amount; and

                     (b)  ending at the end of 30 June 2012.

##### <a id="17"></a>17  Partial disposal of an asset before 1 July 2012

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a person incurs interim expenditure relating to an interest that a person holds in an onshore petroleum project or the North West Shelf project; and

                     (b)  the interim expenditure relates to a depreciating asset or a CGT asset; and

                     (c)  any of the person’s interest in the asset is disposed of between 2 May 2010 and 1 July 2012;

the amount of the interim expenditure is taken to be reduced to the extent the person’s interest in the asset is disposed of.

             (2)  Treat, for the purposes of this clause, as a disposal of part of the person’s interest in the asset an arrangement that has the effect of transferring to another person part of the benefits or entitlements that the person has in relation to the asset.

## Part 4—The look‑back approach

Note:          Section 45 deals generally with when eligible real expenditure may be incurred in relation to onshore petroleum projects and the North West shelf project, including under the look‑back approach. This Part deals with some specific issues under the look‑back approach, in particular issues relating to the costs of acquiring projects.

##### <a id="18"></a>18  Expenditure incurred in acquiring interests in petroleum projects

Interests acquired between 1 July 2007 and 2 May 2010

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  under Part 2, the look‑back approach is the valuation approach for an interest in an onshore petroleum project or the North West Shelf project; and

                     (b)  during the period between 1 July 2007 and 2 May 2010, either or both of the following events occurred:

                              (i)  a person acquired the interest;

                             (ii)  if the person holding the interest is a company—the person was acquired by another company;

the starting base expenditure, incurred by the person referred to in paragraph (b) in relation to the last such event to occur in relation to the interest during that period, includes the expenditure (**_acquisition expenditure_**) referred to in subsection (2).

             (2)  The acquisition expenditure is whichever of the following is applicable:

                     (a)  the expenditure incurred by the person in acquiring the interest;

                     (b)  the expenditure incurred by the other company in making the acquisition.

             (3)  Despite subclause (1), the starting base expenditure incurred by the person in relation to the project does not include acquisition expenditure to the extent (if any) that the acquisition expenditure reflects the value of things that are not project activities relating to the project.

             (4)  Despite subclause (1), the starting base expenditure incurred by the person in relation to the project does not include acquisition expenditure to the extent that the expenditure relates to an acquired exploration expenditure amount.

             (5)  Acquisition expenditure included under subclause (1) in the starting base expenditure incurred by the person is taken, for the purposes of this Act, to have been incurred on 2 May 2010.

Interests acquired before 30 June 2007

             (6)  If, under Part 2, the look‑back approach is the valuation approach for an interest in an onshore petroleum project or the North West Shelf project, the eligible real expenditure incurred by the person holding the interest does not include:

                     (a)  if the person acquired the interest before 30 June 2007—expenditure (**_acquisition expenditure_**) incurred by the person in acquiring the interest; or

                     (b)  if the person is a company that was acquired by another company before 30 June 2007—expenditure (**_acquisition expenditure_**) incurred by the other company in making the acquisition.

Acquisitions

             (7)  For the purposes of this clause and clause 19, the person holding an interest in an onshore petroleum project or the North West Shelf project is taken to have acquired the interest if and only if:

                     (a)  in a case where the project existed on 2 May 2010—the person purchased the interest; or

                     (b)  in a case where the project did not exist on 2 May 2010—the person purchased:

                              (i)  the exploration permit or retention lease from which the production licence to which the project relates is derived; or

                             (ii)  an interest in the exploration permit or retention lease.

The acquisition is taken to have occurred when the transaction was first entered into that, when complete, had the effect of transferring the interest, or the permit or lease.

             (8)  For the purposes of this clause and clause 19:

                     (a)  a company is taken to have been acquired by another company if and only if the company became a subsidiary of the other company; and

                     (b)  the acquisition is taken to have occurred when:

                              (i)  the transaction was first entered into that, when complete, had the effect of the first becoming a subsidiary of the other company; or

                             (ii)  an agreement to enter into that transaction;

                            was first entered into; and

                     (c)  except for the purposes of subclause (6) of this clause, the acquisition expenditure relating to the acquisition includes any expenditure the company incurred in acquiring any interest in the other company:

                              (i)  during the period between 1 July 2007 and 2 May 2010; or

                             (ii)  under an agreement entered into during the period between 1 July 2007 and 2 May 2010.

Note:          Section 2B defines a **_subsidiary_**.

             (9)  However, paragraph (8)(c) does not apply to acquisition expenditure to the extent (if any) that the acquisition expenditure reflects the value of things that are not project activities relating to the petroleum project in which the other company holds an interest.

##### <a id="19"></a>19  Acquired exploration expenditure amounts

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  under Part 2, the look‑back approach is the valuation approach for an interest in an onshore petroleum project or the North West Shelf project; and

                     (b)  either:

                              (i)  the person holding the interest acquired the interest during the period between 1 July 2007 and 2 May 2010; or

                             (ii)  the person holding the interest is a company that was acquired during the period between 1 July 2007 and 2 May 2010; and

                     (c)  expenditure that:

                              (i)  the person holding the interest incurred in acquiring the interest; or

                             (ii)  the person making the acquisition of the company holding the interest incurred in making the acquisition;

                            would, apart from subclause 18(4), be included under clause 18 in the starting base expenditure incurred by the person holding the interest;

the person holding the interest is taken, for the purposes of this Act, to have an acquired exploration expenditure amount in relation to the project equal to the amount of acquisition expenditure allocated to exploration assets and evaluation assets, as recorded in a financial report that satisfies subclause (2).

             (2)  The financial report satisfies this subclause if:

                     (a)  it has been audited; and

                     (b)  it was prepared in accordance with the accounting standards (within the meaning of the _Corporations Act 2001_); and

                     (c)  it relates to a period that includes the day of the acquisition.

             (3)  The acquired exploration expenditure amount is taken, for the purposes of this Act, to be acquired exploration expenditure incurred by the person holding the interest on 2 May 2010.

##### <a id="20"></a>20  Restriction applying the look‑back approach in certain cases

                   Despite section 45 and clauses 18 and 19, if:

                     (a)  under Part 2, the look‑back approach is the valuation approach for an interest in an onshore petroleum project or the North West Shelf project; and

                     (b)  particular expenditure would, apart from this clause, be eligible real expenditure incurred by a person in relation to the project; and

                     (c)  either:

                              (i)  if the expenditure was incurred between 1 July 2010 and 30 June 2012—the person has not kept and retained records, relating to the expenditure, that would meet the requirements of section 112; or

                             (ii)  if the expenditure was incurred between 1 July 2002 and 30 June 2010—the person has not kept and retained records that enable the amount and nature of the expenditure to be reasonably substantiated;

the eligible real expenditure incurred by the person in relation to the project does not include that expenditure.

##### <a id="21"></a>21  Certain receipts taken to be assessable receipts

                   If:

                     (a)  under Part 2, the look‑back approach is the valuation approach for an interest in an onshore petroleum project or the North West Shelf project; and

                     (b)  between the starting base day under subsection 45(5) and 30 June 2012, the person incurred, in relation to particular property, expenditure that would have been eligible real expenditure incurred by the person in relation to the project if the person were to incur it after 30 June 2012; and

                     (c)  between that starting base day and 30 June 2012, circumstances arose relating to the property that would have caused an assessable receipt of one of the following kinds to be derived in relation to the property if those circumstances were to arise after 30 June 2012:

                              (i)  an assessable property receipt;

                             (ii)  an assessable miscellaneous compensation receipt;

                            (iii)  an assessable employee amenities receipt;

an amount equal to what would have been the amount of that assessable receipt is taken, for the purposes of this Act, to be an assessable receipt of that kind derived by the person, in relation to the project, in the financial year in which the circumstances arose.

## Part 5—Starting base returns and assessments

##### <a id="22"></a>22  Starting base returns

             (1)  A person must give to the Commissioner a starting base return if the person wishes to choose a valuation approach under clause 3 in relation to a petroleum project.

             (2)  A starting base return is not valid unless:

                     (a)  it is in the approved form; and

                     (b)  it is signed by or on behalf of the person giving the return; and

                     (c)  it is given to the Commissioner on or before 30 August 2013, or within a further time that the Commissioner allows.

             (3)  Without limiting the information that the approved form may require, the starting base return must provide the following information:

                     (a)  the valuation approach chosen under clause 3 in relation to the petroleum project;

                     (b)  if the book value approach or market value approach was chosen—the amount of the starting base amount relating to the person’s interest in the project;

                     (c)  if the look‑back approach was chosen—the amount of eligible real expenditure incurred before 1 July 2012 relating to the person’s interest in the project.

##### <a id="23"></a>23  Starting base assessments

             (1)  If a person has given to the Commissioner a valid starting base return relating to a petroleum project, the Commissioner is taken to have made, in accordance with what the person specified in the return, an ascertainment (a **_starting base assessment_**) of:

                     (a)  if the book value approach or market value approach is the valuation approach relating to the person’s interest in the project—the amount of the starting base amount relating to the person’s interest in the project; or

                     (b)  if the look‑back approach is the valuation approach relating to the person’s interest in the project—the amount and kind of eligible real expenditure incurred before 1 July 2012 relating to the person’s interest in the project.

             (2)  The starting base assessment is taken to have been made on the day the starting base return is given to the Commissioner.

             (3)  On and after the day the Commissioner is taken to have made the starting base assessment, the return is taken to be a notice of the starting base assessment:

                     (a)  under the hand of the Commissioner; and

                     (b)  given to the person on the day the Commissioner is taken to have made the starting base assessment.

             (4)  The starting base assessment is taken, from the time it is made, to be an assessment for the purposes of:

                     (a)  section 65 (validity of assessments); and

                     (b)  section 66 (objections to assessments); and

                     (c)  Division 3 of Part VI (amendment of assessments); and

                     (d)  section 106 (evidence).

             (5)  Without limiting subclause (4), from the first time an assessment (a **_general assessment_**) is made of the person’s taxable profit (or that the person has no taxable profit), in relation to the project and a year of tax commencing on or after 1 July 2012:

                     (a)  the starting base assessment is taken, for the purposes of this Act, to form part of the general assessment; and

                     (b)  any objection against the general assessment under section 66 must not relate to matters to which the starting base assessment relates; and

                     (c)  any amendment of the general assessment under Division 3 of Part VI must not relate to matters to which the starting base assessment relates, except to the extent necessary to give effect to the starting base assessment (including the starting base assessment as amended).

             (6)  Without limiting subsection 67(2), the Commissioner may amend a general assessment at any time to the extent necessary to give effect to the starting base assessment (including the starting base assessment as amended).

_Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Amendment Act 2006 (No. 78, 2006)_

## Schedule 1

## 12  Application

The amendments made by Part 1 of this Schedule apply only in relation to instalment transfers under the _Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act 1987_ for financial years that start on or after 1 July 2006.

## Schedule 2

## 3  Application—years of tax that start on or after 1 July 2006

The amendments made by Part 1 of this Schedule apply only in relation to instalments and assessments of tax under the _Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act 1987_ for financial years that start on or after 1 July 2006.

## 4  Application—pre‑1 July 2006 expenditure

(1)       Transferable exploration expenditure that was actually incurred before 1 July 2006 may, unless subitem (2), (3) or (4) applies, be transferred in relation to a transfer year that starts on or after 1 July 2006 from one company (the **_loss company_**) to another company (the **_profit company_**) in relation to a petroleum project (the **_receiving project_**) in which the profit company holds (or has held) an interest (the **_receiving interest_**).

(2)       The expenditure cannot be transferred if new clause 31, or any other provision of the _Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act 1987_ (as amended by this Act), prevents the transfer.

(3)       If the starting day for the receiving project was before 1 July 2006, the expenditure cannot be transferred if old clause 31 would have prevented the transfer of the expenditure, in relation to the transfer year starting on 1 July 2005, from the company which actually incurred the expenditure to the company which held the receiving interest at the end of that year.

(4)       If the starting day for the receiving project was on or after 1 July 2006, the expenditure cannot be transferred if paragraph 31(1)(a) of the old clause 31, subject to subclauses (2), (2AA), (2AB) and (2A) of that clause, did not, in relation to the transfer year starting on 1 July 2005, apply to the company which actually incurred the expenditure.

(5)       If section 41 of the _Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act 1987_ applies to the expenditure, a reference in subitem (3) or (4) to the company which actually incurred the expenditure is taken to be a reference to the company taken under paragraph 41(1)(b) of the Act to have incurred the liability for making the expenditure.

(6)       An expression used in this item has the same meaning as in Part 6 of the Schedule to the _Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act 1987_.

(7)       In this item:

**_new clause 31_** means clause 31 of the Schedule to the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act 1987, as amended by Part 1 of this Schedule.

**_old clause 31_** means clause 31 of the Schedule to the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act 1987, as in force immediately before 1 July 2006.

## Schedule 3

## 9  Application

The amendments made by Part 1 of this Schedule apply only in relation to assessments of tax under the _Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act 1987_ for financial years that start on or after 1 July 2006.

## Schedule 4

## 38  Application

The amendments made by Part 1 of this Schedule apply only in relation to returns and assessments of tax, and instalments of tax, under the _Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act 1987_ for financial years that start on or after 1 July 2006.

(2)       The other amendments made by this Schedule apply only in relation to returns, assessments, notices and certificates under the _Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act 1987_ in relation to financial years that start on or after 1 July 2006.

* * *

_Tax Laws Amendment (Repeal of Inoperative Provisions) Act 2006 
 (No. 101, 2006)_

## Schedule 6

## 1  Application of Schedule 1 and 2 amendments

Except as mentioned in items 2 and 3, the repeals and amendments made by Schedules 1 and 2 apply:

                     (a)  so far as they affect assessments—to assessments for the 2006‑07 income year and all later income years; and

                     (b)  otherwise—to acts done or omitted to be done, or states of affairs existing, after the commencement of the repeals and amendments.

## 6  Object

The object of this Part is to ensure that, despite the repeals and amendments made by this Act, the full legal and administrative consequences of:

                     (a)  any act done or omitted to be done; or

                     (b)  any state of affairs existing; or

                     (c)  any period ending;

before such a repeal or amendment applies, can continue to arise and be carried out, directly or indirectly through an indefinite number of steps, even if some or all of those steps are taken after the repeal or amendment applies.

## 7  Making and amending assessments, and doing other things, in relation to past matters

Even though an Act is repealed or amended by this Act, the repeal or amendment is disregarded for the purpose of doing any of the following under any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_):

                     (a)  making or amending an assessment (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

                     (b)  exercising any right or power, performing any obligation or duty or doing any other thing (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

Example 1: On 31 July 1999, Greg Ltd lodged its annual return under former section 160ARE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The return stated that the company had a credit on its franking account and that no franking deficit tax was payable for the 1998‑99 franking year. Under former section 160ARH of that Act, the Commissioner was taken to have made an assessment consistent with the return.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of Part IIIAA of that Act, the Commissioner concludes that Greg Ltd fraudulently overfranked dividends it paid during the 1998‑99 franking year, and had a franking account deficit for that franking year. As a result, the Commissioner considers that franking deficit tax and a penalty by way of additional tax are payable.

                   The Commissioner can amend the assessment under former section 160ARN of that Act, because item 7 of this Schedule disregards the repeal of that section for the purposes of making an assessment in relation to the 1998‑99 franking year. Item 7 will also disregard the repeal of Division 11 of former Part IIIAA to the extent necessary for the Commissioner to assess Greg Ltd’s liability to a penalty by way of additional tax.

                   Despite the repeal of sections 160ARU and 160ARV, item 9 will ensure that the general interest charge will accrue on the unpaid franking deficit tax and penalty until they are paid.

                   Item 7 will also preserve Greg Ltd’s right, under former section 160ART of that Act, to object against the Commissioner’s amended assessment (including the penalty), since the objection is the exercise of a right in relation to a franking year that ended before the repeal of Part IIIAA.

Example 2: During the 1997‑98 income year, Duffy Property Ltd withheld amounts from its employees’ wages as required by former Divisions 1AAA and 2 of Part VI of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The company failed to notify the Commissioner of those amounts, and failed to remit them to the Commissioner.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of those Divisions, the Commissioner discovers that the withheld amounts have not been remitted. The company’s records are incomplete and the Commissioner is unable to completely ascertain the extent of its liability for the withheld amounts. Under section 222AGA of that Act, the Commissioner makes an estimate of the liability.

                   Item 7 will disregard the repeal of section 220AAZA of that Act (which empowered the Commissioner to recover the amount of the estimate). Even though the estimate is made after the repeal, it relates to amounts withheld before the repeal.

## 8  Saving of provisions about effect of assessments

If a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act deals with the effect of an assessment, the repeal or amendment is disregarded in relation to assessments made, before or after the repeal or amendment applies, in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

## 9  Saving of provisions about general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty

If:

                     (a)  a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act provides for the payment of:

                              (i)  general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty (all within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_); or
