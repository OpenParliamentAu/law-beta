           (13)  If this subsection applies, the amount spent by the eligible body in the financial year that started on 1 July 2001 on activities that qualify, under the funding contract, as research and development activities is taken, for the purposes of this section (including for the purposes of subsections (10) and (11)), to be increased by the amount worked out using the following formula:

Note:          Subsection 33(3) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ provides for the repeal, variation etc. of instruments.

             (2)  A declaration under this section must specify the day on and after which the relevant body is to be the industry services body. That day must not be earlier than the day after the day, or the later of the days (as the case may be), that paragraph (3)(a) is complied with.

                     (a)  laid before each House of the Parliament or, if a House is not sitting, presented to the Presiding Officer of that House for circulation to the members of that House and tabling on the next sitting day, within 5 days after the declaration is made; and

             (4)  For the purposes of subsection (3), if a House has been dissolved and the newly-elected House has not met when a declaration is provided to the Presiding Officer, circulation to the persons who were members of that House immediately before the dissolution is taken to be circulation to the members of the House.

                     (b)  the annual reports of the body applicable to periods in which the direction has effect must include:

                              (i)  particulars of the direction; and

                             (ii)  an assessment of the impact that the direction has had on the operations of the body during the period.

          (3A)  Subsection (3) does not apply in relation to a particular direction if:

             (4)  The Minister is not to be taken to be a director of the industry services body for the purposes of the _Corporations Act 2001_ merely because of the power conferred on the Minister by this section.

             (5)  The Commonwealth is not to be taken to be in a position to exercise control over the industry services body merely because of the power conferred on the Minister by this section.

### Division 4—Transfer of assets etc. of statutory authorities

                   The Minister must, in writing, declare the beginning of a specified day to be the **_transfer time_** for the purposes of this Act.

_(a)_ Subsection 2(2) provides as follows:

                 (2)   Schedule 1 (other than item 3) commences immediately after the transfer time.

         The transfer time was declared as the beginning of 1 July 2001 (_see Gazette_ 2001, No. S269).

         Subsection 2(3)(b) provides as follows:

                              (b)   the commencement of Parts 4 to 10 of the Act that establishes the Administrative Review Tribunal.
