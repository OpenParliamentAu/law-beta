                    <a name="standard"></a>**_standard_** means a standard in force under section 18.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Meaning of _public interest_

                   In determining, for the purposes of this Act, if particular action is or would be in, or contrary to, the public interest, the Reserve Bank is to have regard to the desirability of payment systems:

                     (a)  being (in its opinion):

                              (i)  financially safe for use by participants; and

                             (ii)  efficient; and

                            (iii)  competitive; and

                     (b)  not (in its opinion) materially causing or contributing to increased risk to the financial system.

The Reserve Bank may have regard to other matters that it considers are relevant, but is not required to do so.

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Meaning of _purchased payment facility_ and _holder of the stored value_

             (1)  A **_purchased payment facility_** is a facility (other than cash) in relation to which the following conditions are satisfied:

                     (c)  those payments are to be made by the provider of the facility or by a person acting under an arrangement with the provider (rather than by the user of the facility).

However, a facility covered by a declaration under subsection (3) is not a purchased payment facility for the purposes of this Act.

             (2)  The **_holder of the stored value_**, in relation to a purchased payment facility, is the person who is to make payments as mentioned in paragraph (1)(c).

             (3)  The Reserve Bank may, by notice in writing published in the _Gazette_, declare that this Act does not apply to a specified facility, or to facilities included in a specified class of facilities, if the Reserve Bank considers that it is not appropriate for this Act to apply to the facility, or to each facility of that class, having regard to:

                     (a)  any restrictions that limit the number or types of people who may purchase the facility; or

                     (b)  any restrictions that limit the number or types of people to whom payments may be made using the facility.

The Reserve Bank may have regard to other matters that it considers are relevant, but is not required to do so.

             (4)  In this section:

                     (a)  a reference to a facility includes a reference to a right to use a facility; and

                     (b)  a reference to the purchase of a facility includes a reference to the payment of an amount for a right to use a facility.

## Part 3—Regulation of payment systems

### Division 1—Overview

             (1)  Under this Part, the Reserve Bank is given the power to designate payment systems (see Division 2).

             (2)  The Reserve Bank has the following powers in relation to a designated payment system:

                     (a)  it may impose an access regime on the participants in the payment system (see Division 3); and

                     (b)  it may make standards to be complied with by participants in the payment system (see Division 4); and

                     (c)  it may arbitrate disputes relating to the payment system (see Division 5); and

                     (d)  it may give directions to participants in the payment system (see Division 6).

### Division 2—Designation of payment systems

##### <a id="11"></a>11  Reserve Bank may designate payment systems

             (1)  The Reserve Bank may designate a payment system if it considers that designating the system is in the public interest. The designation is to be by notice in writing published in the _Gazette_.

             (2)  The designation has effect until it is revoked.

             (3)  The Reserve Bank may revoke the designation if it no longer considers that it is in the public interest that the system be designated. The revocation is to be by notice in writing published in the _Gazette_.

### Division 3—Access to designated systems

#### Subdivision A—Access regimes

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Imposition of access regime

             (1)  The Reserve Bank may impose an access regime on the participants in a designated payment system.

             (2)  The access regime imposed must be one that the Reserve Bank considers appropriate, having regard to:

                     (a)  whether imposing the access regime would be in the public interest; and

                     (b)  the interests of the current participants in the system; and

                     (c)  the interests of people who, in the future, may want access to the system; and

                     (d)  any other matters the Reserve Bank considers relevant.

             (3)  The Reserve Bank must not impose the access regime unless it has first consulted in accordance with section 28.

             (4)  The decision to impose the access regime is to be in writing and is to set out the access regime.

             (5)  As soon as practicable after imposing the access regime, the Reserve Bank must provide notification under section 29.

             (6)  A failure to comply with subsection (5) does not affect the validity of the access regime.

##### <a id="13"></a>13  When access regimes are in force

                   An access regime:

                     (a)  comes into force:

                              (i)  unless subparagraph (ii) applies—on the day on which the decision to impose the access regime is made; or

                             (ii)  if that decision specifies a later day as the day on which the access regime comes into force—on the day so specified; and

                     (b)  may be varied as provided in section 14; and

                     (c)  remains in force until it ceases to be in force as provided in section 15.

##### <a id="14"></a>14  Variation of access regime

             (1)  The Reserve Bank may vary an access regime if the Reserve Bank considers it is appropriate to do so, having regard to:

                     (a)  whether the variation would be in the public interest; and

                     (b)  the interests of the current participants in the system; and

                     (c)  the interests of people who, in the future, may want access to the system; and

                     (d)  any other matters the Reserve Bank considers relevant.

             (2)  The Reserve Bank must not vary the access regime unless it has first consulted in accordance with section 28.

             (3)  The Reserve Bank may vary the access regime without complying with subsection (2) if it considers that the variation is of a minor technical nature.

             (4)  A decision to vary the access regime is to be in writing and is to set out the variation.

             (5)  If the Reserve Bank varies the access regime it must, as soon as practicable, provide notification under section 29.

             (6)  A failure to comply with subsection (5) does not affect the validity of a variation of the access regime.

             (7)  A variation of the access regime takes effect:

                     (a)  unless paragraph (b) applies—on the day on which the decision to vary the access regime is made; or

                     (b)  if that decision specifies a later day as the day on which the variation comes into force—on the day so specified.

##### <a id="15"></a>15  When access regimes cease to be in force

             (1)  An access regime ceases to be in force if:

                     (a)  the access regime contains an expiry date and that date is reached; or

                     (b)  the Reserve Bank, on the application of the participants in the designated payment system concerned, revokes the access regime; or

                     (c)  the Reserve Bank revokes the access regime on its own initiative; or

                     (d)  the payment system concerned ceases to exist or ceases to be a designated payment system.

             (2)  An application for the revocation of the regime must comply with the applicable requirements determined under section 27.

             (3)  The Reserve Bank may revoke the access regime (pursuant to an application or on its own initiative) if the Reserve Bank considers it appropriate to do so, having regard to:

                     (a)  whether revoking the access regime would be in the public interest; and

                     (b)  the interests of the current participants in the system; and

                     (c)  the interests of people who, in the future, may want access to the system; and

                     (d)  any other matters the Reserve Bank considers relevant.

             (4)  A decision to revoke the access regime is to be in writing.

             (5)  If the Reserve Bank revokes the access regime it must, as soon as practicable, provide notification under section 29.

             (6)  A failure to comply with subsection (5) does not invalidate the revocation of the access regime.

             (7)  A revocation of the access regime takes effect:

                     (a)  unless paragraph (b) applies—on the day on which the decision to revoke the access regime is made; or

                     (b)  if that decision specifies a later day as the day on which the revocation takes effect—on the day so specified.

#### Subdivision B—Enforcement of access regimes

##### <a id="16"></a>16  Right to ask Reserve Bank to give a direction

                   If a person who has been denied access to a designated payment system considers that the denial of access constitutes, or is attributable (wholly or partly) to, a breach of a provision of an access regime by a participant, the person may ask the Reserve Bank to use its power under section 21 to give a direction to remedy the situation.

##### <a id="17"></a>17  Right to apply to the Federal Court

             (1)  If a person who has been denied access to a designated payment system considers that the denial of access constitutes, or is attributable (wholly or partly) to, a breach of a provision of an access regime by a participant, the person may apply to the Federal Court for an order under subsection (3).

             (2)  The person must notify the Reserve Bank of the application to the Federal Court. The Reserve Bank may apply to the Federal Court to be joined as a party to the proceedings for the order.

             (3)  If the Federal Court is satisfied that the participant has breached a provision of the access regime, the Court may make all or any of the following orders:

                     (a)  an order directing the participant to comply with that provision of the access regime;

                     (b)  an order directing the participant to compensate any other person who has suffered loss or damage as a result of the breach;

                     (c)  any other order that the Court considers appropriate.

             (4)  The Federal Court may discharge or vary an order made under this section.

### Division 4—Standards for designated systems

##### <a id="18"></a>18  Reserve Bank may make standards for designated systems

             (1)  The Reserve Bank may, in writing, determine standards to be complied with by participants in a designated payment system if it considers that determining the standards is in the public interest.

Note:          A failure to comply with a standard is not an offence, but it may lead to a direction being given under section 21.

             (2)  A standard:

                     (a)  comes into force:

                              (i)  unless subparagraph (ii) applies—on the day on which the determination of the standard is made; or

                             (ii)  if that determination specifies a later day as the day on which the standard comes into force—on the day so specified; and

                     (b)  continues in force until it is revoked.

             (3)  The Reserve Bank may, in writing, vary or revoke a standard.

             (4)  The Reserve Bank must not determine or vary a standard unless it has first consulted in accordance with section 28.

             (5)  The Reserve Bank may determine or vary a standard without complying with subsection (4) if:

                     (a)  the Reserve Bank considers that there is an urgent need for the determination or variation of the standard; or

                     (b)  in the case of a variation—the Reserve Bank considers that the variation is of a minor technical nature.

             (6)  If the Reserve Bank determines a standard, or varies or revokes a standard, it must, as soon as practicable, provide notification under section 29.

             (7)  A failure to comply with subsection (6) does not affect the validity of a standard or of the variation or revocation of a standard.

##### <a id="18A"></a>18A  Authorisation of conduct under certain standards for the purposes of the _Competition and Consumer Act 2010_

             (1)  For the purposes of subparagraph 51(1)(a)(i) of the _Competition and Consumer Act 2010_, anything that is done:

                     (a)  by a participant in relation to the setting, or charging, of wholesale fees (also known as interchange fees) payable under a payment system to which an interchange fees standard applies; and

                     (b)  in accordance with that standard;

is taken to be specified in, and specifically authorised by, this Act.

             (2)  In this section:

                    <a name="interchang-fee-standard"></a>**_interchange fees standard_** means any of the following standards as amended and in force from time to time:

                     (a)  a standard that is known as Standard No. 1, The Setting of Wholesale (“Interchange”) Fees and that was determined by the Reserve Bank on 26 August 2002;

                     (b)  a standard specified by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph.

### Division 5—Arbitration of disputes relating to designated systems

##### <a id="19"></a>19  Disputes to which Division applies

                   This Division applies to the following kinds of disputes:

                     (a)  a dispute between 2 or more participants in a designated payment system that arises out of, or that is otherwise connected with, that system;

                     (b)  a dispute between a person and 2 or more participants in a designated payment system for which there is an access regime, being a dispute relating to whether the access regime is being complied with.

##### <a id="20"></a>20  Arbitration of disputes

             (1)  The Reserve Bank may arrange for a dispute to which this Division applies to be settled by arbitration in accordance with this section. The Reserve Bank must only do so if:

                     (a)  it considers that the dispute raises issues related to:

                              (i)  the financial safety of payment systems for participants; or

                             (ii)  the efficiency of payment systems; or

                            (iii)  the competitiveness of payment systems; or

                            (iv)  risk to the financial system; and

                     (b)  the parties to the dispute agree to the Reserve Bank arranging the arbitration.

Note:          The Reserve Bank may be acting on its own initiative or in response to a request from one or more of the parties to the dispute in arranging for the arbitration.

             (2)  The arbitration is to be conducted by the Governor of the Reserve Bank, or by a person appointed in writing by the Governor for the purpose.

             (3)  The person conducting an arbitration is not subject to any action, claim or demand by, or liable to, any person in respect of anything done, or omitted to be done, in good faith in connection with the arbitration.

             (4)  The arbitration must be conducted in accordance with the regulations.

             (5)  The fact the dispute is being, or has been, settled by arbitration under this section does not prevent a party to the dispute from bringing an action in a court in connection with the dispute, unless the court otherwise orders.

### Division 6—Directions to participants in designated systems

##### <a id="21"></a>21  Directions

             (1)  The Reserve Bank may give a direction to a participant in a designated payment system if the Reserve Bank considers that:

                     (a)  the participant has failed to comply with a standard; or

                     (b)  the participant has failed to comply with an access regime.

             (2)  The direction is to require the participant to take specified action, or to refrain from specified action, as the Reserve Bank considers appropriate having regard to the failure.

             (3)  The direction must be consistent with any applicable standards and with any applicable access regime.

             (4)  The direction may deal with the time by which, or the period during which, it is to be complied with.

             (5)  The direction is to be given by notice in writing given to the participant.

             (6)  The participant is guilty of an offence if:

                     (a)  the participant does, or fails to do, an act; and

                     (b)  doing, or failing to do, the act results in a contravention of the direction; and

                     (c)  the doing of the act, or the failure to do the act, occurs at a time when:

                              (i)  the participant is still a participant in the payment system referred to in subsection (1); and

                             (ii)  that payment system is still a designated payment system.

                    Penalty:  50 penalty units

Note 1:       Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.

Note 2:       If a body corporate is convicted of an offence against this subsection, subsection 4B(3) of the _Crimes Act 1914_ allows a court to impose a fine of up to 5 times the penalty stated above.

             (7)  If a contravention of the direction occurs in circumstances that give rise to the participant committing an offence against subsection (6), the participant is guilty of an offence against that subsection in respect of:

                     (a)  the day on which the contravention occurs; and

                     (b)  each subsequent day (if any) on which the contravention continues (including the day of conviction for any such offence or any later day).

Note:          This subsection is not intended to imply that section 4K of the _Crimes Act 1914_ does not apply to offences against this Act or the regulations.

             (8)  The direction:

                     (a)  comes into force:

                              (i)  unless subparagraph (ii) applies—on the day on which it is given; or

                             (ii)  if the instrument giving the direction specifies a later day as the day on which it comes into force—on the day so specified; and

                     (b)  continues in force until it is revoked.

             (9)  The Reserve Bank may revoke the direction by notice in writing given to the participant if, at the time of revocation, it considers that the direction is no longer necessary or appropriate.

## Part 4—Regulation of purchased payment facilities

##### <a id="22"></a>22  Holder of stored value must be an ADI or be authorised or exempted under this Part

             (1)  A constitutional corporation is guilty of an offence if:

                     (a)  it is the holder of the stored value of a purchased payment facility; and

##### <a id="23"></a>23  Authority to be the holder of the stored value

             (1)  A constitutional corporation may apply to the Reserve Bank for an authority to be the holder of the stored value of a class of purchased payment facilities. The application must comply with the applicable requirements determined under section 27.

             (2)  The Reserve Bank may grant the authority if it is satisfied that the corporation will be able to satisfy its obligations as the holder of the stored value of purchased payment facilities of the relevant class.

             (3)  The grant of the authority is to be by notice in writing given to the corporation.

             (4)  The Reserve Bank may, at any time, by notice in writing given to the corporation:

                     (a)  impose conditions, or additional conditions, on the authority; and

                     (b)  vary or revoke conditions imposed on the authority.

The conditions must be aimed at ensuring the corporation meets its obligations as holder of the stored value of purchased payment facilities of the relevant class.

             (5)  The authority:

                     (a)  comes into force:

                              (i)  unless subparagraph (ii) applies—on the day on which it is granted; or

                             (ii)  if the instrument granting the authority specifies a later day as the day on which it comes into force—on the day so specified; and

                     (b)  continues in force until it is revoked.

             (6)  The Reserve Bank may revoke the authority by notice in writing to the corporation if:

                     (a)  it is no longer satisfied as mentioned in subsection (2); or

                     (b)  it considers that the corporation has contravened a condition of the authority; or

                     (c)  the corporation applies to the Reserve Bank for revocation of the authority; or

                     (d)  the corporation ceases to be the holder of the stored value of any purchased payment facilities of the relevant class.

An application for revocation of the authority must comply with any applicable requirements determined under section 27.

             (7)  If the Reserve Bank:

                     (a)  grants an authority under subsection (2); or

                     (b)  imposes, varies or revokes conditions under subsection (4); or

                     (c)  revokes an authority under subsection (6);

the Reserve Bank must cause notice of that action to be published in the _Gazette_. 

             (8)  Failure to comply with subsection (7) does not affect the validity of the action concerned.

##### <a id="24"></a>24  Directions on failure to comply with conditions

             (1)  The Reserve Bank may give a direction to a corporation that has been granted an authority under section 23 if the Reserve Bank considers that the corporation has failed to comply with a condition of the authority.

             (2)  The direction is to require the corporation to take specified action, or to refrain from specified action, as the Reserve Bank considers appropriate having regard to the failure.

             (3)  The direction may deal with the time by which, or the period during which, it is to be complied with.

             (4)  The direction is to be given by notice in writing given to the corporation.

             (5)  The corporation is guilty of an offence if:

                     (a)  the corporation does, or fails to do, an act; and

                     (b)  doing, or failing to do, the act results in a contravention of the direction; and

                     (c)  the doing of the act, or the failure to do the act, occurs at a time when;

                              (i)  the authority referred to in subsection (1) is still in force; and

                             (ii)  the corporation is the holder of the stored value of one or more purchased payment facilities of the class to which that authority applies.

                    Penalty:  50 penalty units.

Note 1:       Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.

Note 2:       If a body corporate is convicted of an offence against this subsection, subsection 4B(3) of the _Crimes Act 1914_ allows a court to impose a fine of up to 5 times the penalty stated above.

             (6)  If a contravention of the direction occurs in circumstances that give rise to the corporation committing an offence against subsection (5), the corporation is guilty of an offence against that subsection in respect of:

                     (a)  the day on which the contravention occurs; and

                     (b)  each subsequent day (if any) on which the contravention continues (including the day of conviction for any such offence or any later day).

                     (a)  comes into force:

                              (i)  unless subparagraph (ii) applies—on the day on which it is given; or

                             (ii)  if the instrument giving the direction specifies a later day as the day on which it comes into force—on the day so specified; and

                     (b)  continues in force until it is revoked.

             (8)  The Reserve Bank may revoke the direction by notice in writing to the corporation if, at the time of revocation, it considers that the direction is no longer necessary or appropriate.

##### <a id="25"></a>25  Exemptions

             (1)  The Reserve Bank may grant a corporation, or corporations included in a class of corporations, an exemption allowing the corporation, or each corporation in the class, to be the holder of the stored value in respect of purchased payment facilities in a particular class even though the corporation is not an authorised deposit-taking institution, within the meaning of the _Banking Act 1959_, and does not have an authority under section 23 of this Act that covers those facilities.

                     (b)  continues in force until it is revoked.

             (6)  The Reserve Bank may revoke the exemption if it is no longer satisfied as mentioned in subsection (3). The revocation is to be:

                     (b)  if it applies to a class of corporations—by notice in writing published in the _Gazette_.

             (7)  If the Reserve Bank:

                     (a)  grants an exemption to a particular corporation under subsection (3); or
