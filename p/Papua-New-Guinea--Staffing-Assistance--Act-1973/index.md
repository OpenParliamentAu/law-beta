##### <a id="58"></a>58  Arrangements for reimbursement of Commonwealth by certain authorities

                   Where benefits have been, are or may become payable under Part V to or in relation to a person who was or is required or permitted to contribute to the Superannuation Fund or the Provident Account or to the Commonwealth and, while being so required or permitted, was or is receiving a salary from an authority of Papua New Guinea, the Minister may enter into an arrangement with that authority providing for the reimbursement of the Commonwealth in respect of payments made by the Commonwealth in respect of those benefits.

##### <a id="60"></a>60  No assignment of benefits

                   Subject to section 61, a benefit under Part V is not capable of being assigned or charged or of passing by operation of law, and any moneys paid or payable out of the Superannuation Fund, the Provident Account or the Reserve Units of Pension Account or by the Commonwealth on the death of a person are not liable to be applied or made available in payment of his debts or liabilities.

##### <a id="61"></a>61  Attachment of benefits

             (1)  Where a judgment given by a court for the payment of a sum of money has not been fully satisfied by the judgment debtor and the judgment debtor is entitled to benefit under Part V, the judgment creditor may serve on CSC, in the manner prescribed, a copy of the judgment, certified under the hand of the registrar or other proper officer of the court by which the judgment was given, and a statutory declaration by the judgment creditor stating that the judgment has not been fully satisfied by the judgment debtor and specifying the amount due by the judgment debtor under the judgment.

             (2)  Where a copy of a judgment and a statutory declaration are served on CSC in accordance with subsection (1), CSC shall, as soon as practicable, by notice in writing given to the judgment debtor, inform him of the service of those documents and require him to notify CSC within the period, and in the manner, specified in the notice, whether the amount specified in the declaration is still due under the judgment and, if no amount or a lesser amount is due under the judgment, to furnish to CSC, in the manner specified in the notice, evidence in support of that fact.

             (3)  A person to whom a notice is given under subsection (2) shall comply with the requirements contained in the notice.

                    Penalty:  Forty dollars.

             (4)  If, at the expiration of the period specified in the notice, CSC is satisfied that an amount is due under the judgment, CSC may, in his discretion, deduct from the benefit, and pay to the judgment creditor, such sums as do not exceed that amount.

             (5)  A deduction shall not be made from:

                     (a)  an instalment of pension payable in respect of a child; or

                     (b)  an instalment of any other pension if the deduction will reduce the amount of the instalment payable to less than one‑half of the amount that would, but for this section, be payable.

             (6)  If, after a copy of a judgment given against a beneficiary, being a judgment in respect of which CSC is satisfied that an amount is due, has been served in accordance with subsection (1), a copy of another judgment given (whether before or after the first‑mentioned judgment) against the same beneficiary in favour of the person in whose favour the first‑mentioned judgment was given or in favour of another person is served under that subsection, CSC shall not make a payment in accordance with this section to the judgment creditor under the other judgment in respect of the amount due under that judgment until the amount due under the first‑mentioned judgment has been paid.

             (7)  A payment made to a judgment creditor in accordance with this section shall, as between CSC and the beneficiary, be deemed to be a payment under Part V to the beneficiary.

             (8)  A judgment creditor who serves a copy of a judgment on CSC under subsection (1) shall notify CSC, in the manner prescribed, immediately the judgment debt is satisfied.

                    Penalty:  One hundred dollars or imprisonment for three months.

             (9)  If the amounts paid in accordance with this section to a judgment creditor in respect of a judgment exceed, in the aggregate, the amount due under the judgment, the excess is repayable by the judgment creditor to the judgment debtor and, in default of payment, may be recovered by the judgment debtor from the judgment creditor in a court of competent jurisdiction.

##### <a id="62A"></a>62A  Payments may be made by Papua New Guinea

                   Where the whole or part of any benefit payable to a person under this Act is paid to that person by the Government of Papua New Guinea out of the moneys of that Government, the amount of that benefit that would, but for this section, be payable under this Act by Australia to that person shall be reduced by the amount so paid.

##### <a id="64"></a>64  Delegations

             (1)  The Minister may, by instrument in writing, delegate to a person, either generally or otherwise as provided by the instrument of delegation, all or any of his powers and functions under this Act (except this power of delegation).

             (2)  A power or function so delegated may be exercised or performed by the delegate in accordance with the instrument of delegation and, when so exercised or performed, shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to have been exercised or performed by the Minister.

             (3)  A delegation under this section is revocable at will and does not prevent the exercise of a power or the performance of a function by the Minister.

##### <a id="65"></a>65  Regulations

             (1)  The Governor‑General may make regulations, not inconsistent with this Act, prescribing all matters that by this Act are required or permitted to be prescribed or to be provided for by regulation, or that are necessary or convenient to be prescribed for giving effect to this Act, and, in particular:

                     (a)  for enabling a specified officer of the Public Service of the Commonwealth to delegate his powers and functions under regulations made for the purposes of Part II; and

                     (b)  for prescribing penalties not exceeding a fine of One hundred dollars for offences against the regulations.

             (2)  The power to make regulations conferred by this Act shall not be taken, by implication, not to include the power to make provision for or in relation to a matter by reason only of the fact that:

                     (a)  provision is made by this Act in relation to that matter or another matter; or

                     (b)  power is expressly conferred by this Act to make provision by regulation for or in relation to another matter.

             (3)  The power to make regulations conferred by this Act may be exercised:

                     (a)  in relation to all cases to which the power extends, or in relation to all those cases subject to specified exceptions, or in relation to any specified cases or classes of case; and

                     (b)  so as to make, as respects the cases in relation to which it is exercised, the same provision for all those cases or a different provision for different cases or classes of case.

             (4)  The power conferred by this Act to make modifications by regulation includes the power to omit any matter or add any new matter.

             (5)  The limitation imposed by subsection (1) on the penalties that may be prescribed by regulation does not prevent the regulations from requiring a person to make a statutory declaration.
