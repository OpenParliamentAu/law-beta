_Section 3_

REGULATIONS FOR THE PREVENTION OF POLLUTION BY HARMFUL SUBSTANCES CARRIED BY SEA IN PACKAGED FORMS, OR IN FREIGHT CONTAINERS, PORTABLE TANKS OR ROAD AND RAILTANK WAGONS

**Regulation 1**

_Application_

(1)     Unless expressly provided otherwise, the Regulations of this Annex apply to all ships carrying harmful substances in packaged forms, or in freight containers, portable tanks or road and rail tank wagons.

(2)     Such carriage of harmful substances is prohibited except in accordance with the provisions of this Annex.

(3)     To supplement the provisions of this Annex the Government of each Party to the Convention shall issue, or cause to be issued, detailed requirements on packaging, marking and labelling, documentation, stowage, quantity limitations, exceptions and notification, for preventing or minimizing pollution of the marine environment by harmful substances.

(4)     For the purpose of this Annex, empty receptacles, freight containers, portable tanks and road and rail tank wagons which have been used previously for the carriage of harmful substances shall themselves be treated as harmful substances unless adequate precautions have been taken to ensure that they contain no residue that is hazardous to the marine environment.

**Regulation 2**

_Packaging_

          Packagings, freight containers, portable tanks and road and rail tank wagons shall be adequate to minimize the hazard to the marine environment having regard to their specific contents.

**Regulation 3**

_Marking and Labelling_

          Packages, whether shipped individually or in units or in freight containers, freight containers, portable tanks or road and rail tank wagons containing a harmful substance, shall be durably marked with the correct technical name (trade names shall not be used as the correct technical name), and further marked with a distinctive label or stencil of label, indicating that the contents are harmful. Such identification shall be supplemented where possible by any other means, for example by the use of the United Nations number.

**Regulation 4**

_Documentation_

(1)     In all documents relating to the carriage of harmful substances by sea where such substances are named, the correct technical name of the substances shall be used (trade names shall not be used).

(2)     The shipping documents supplied by the shipper shall include a certificate or declaration that the shipment offered for carriage is properly packed, marked and labelled and in proper condition for carriage to minimize the hazard to the marine environment.

(3)     Each ship carrying harmful substances shall have a special list or manifest setting forth the harmful substances on board and the location thereof. A detailed stowage plan which sets out the location of all harmful substances on board may be used in place of such special list or manifest. Copies of such documents shall also be retained on shore by the owner of the ship or his representative until the harmful substances are unloaded.

(4)     In a case where the ship carries a special list or manifest or a detailed stowage plan, required for the carriage of dangerous goods by the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea in force, the documents required for the purpose of this Annex may be combined with those for dangerous goods. Where documents are combined, a clear distinction shall be made between dangerous goods and other harmful substances.

**Regulation 5**

_Stowage_

          Harmful substances shall be both properly stowed and secured so as to minimize the hazards to the marine environment without impairing the safety of ship and persons on board.

**Regulation 6**

_Quantity Limitations_

          Certain harmful substances which are very hazardous to the marine environment may, for sound scientific and technical reasons, need to be prohibited for carriage or be limited as to the quantity which may be carried aboard any one ship. In limiting the quantity due consideration shall be given to size, construction and equipment of the ship as well as the packaging and the inherent nature of the substance.

**Regulation 7**

_Exceptions_

(1)     Discharge by jettisoning of harmful substances carried in packaged forms, freight containers, portable tanks or road and rail tank wagons shall be prohibited except where necessary for the purpose of securing the safety of the ship or saving life at sea.

(2)     Subject to the provisions of the present Convention, appropriate measures based on the physical, chemical and biological properties of harmful substances shall be taken to regulate the washing of leakages overboard provided that compliance with such measures would not impair the safety of the ship and persons on board.

**Regulation 8**

_Notification_

          With respect to certain harmful substances, as may be designated by the Government of a Party to the Convention, the master or owner of the ship or his representative shall notify the appropriate port authority of the intent to load or unload such substances at least 24 hours prior to such action.

THE PARTIES TO THE PRESENT PROTOCOL,

HAVING CONSIDERED the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, and the 1984 Protocol thereto,

HAVING NOTED that the 1984 Protocol to that Convention, which provides for improved scope and enhanced compensation, has not entered into force, 

AFFIRMING the importance of maintaining the viability of the international oil pollution liability and compensation system,

AWARE OF the need to ensure the entry into force of the content of the 1984 Protocol as soon as possible,

RECOGNIZING that special provisions are necessary in connection with the introduction of corresponding amendments to the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage, 1971,

HAVE AGREED as follows:

<u>Article 1</u>

The Convention which the provisions of this Protocol amend is the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, hereinafter referred to as the “1969 Liability Convention”. For States Parties to the Protocol of 1976 to the 1969 Liability Convention, such reference shall be deemed to include the 1969 Liability Convention as amended by that Protocol.

<u>Article 2</u>

Article I of the 1969 Liability Convention is amended as follows: 

1.    Paragraph 1 is replaced by the following text:

1.  “Ship” means any sea-going vessel and seaborne craft of any type whatsoever constructed or adapted for the carriage of oil in bulk as cargo, provided that a ship capable of carrying oil and other cargoes shall be regarded as a ship only when it is actually carrying oil in bulk as cargo and during any voyage following such carriage unless it is proved that it has no residues of such carriage of oil in bulk aboard.

2.    Paragraph 5 is replaced by the following text:

5.  “Oil” means any persistent hydrocarbon mineral oil such as crude oil, fuel oil, heavy diesel oil and lubricating oil, whether carried on board a ship as cargo or in the bunkers of such a ship.

3.    Paragraph 6 is replaced by the following text:

6.  “Pollution damage” means:

(a)   loss or damage caused outside the ship by contamination resulting from the escape or discharge of oil from the ship, wherever such escape or discharge may occur, provided that compensation for impairment of the environment other than loss of profit from such impairment shall be limited to costs of reasonable measures of reinstatement actually undertaken or to be undertaken;

(b)   the costs of preventive measures and further loss or damage caused by preventive measures.

4.    Paragraph 8 is replaced by the following text:

8.  “Incident” means any occurrence, or series of occurrences having the same origin, which causes pollution damage or creates a grave and imminent threat of causing such damage.

5.    Paragraph 9 is replaced by the following text: 

9.  “Organization” means the International Maritime Organization. 

6.    After paragraph 9 a new paragraph is inserted reading as follows: 

10.   “1969 Liability Convention” means the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969\. For States Parties to the Protocol of 1976 to that Convention, the term shall be deemed to include the 1969 Liability Convention as amended by that Protocol.

<u>Article 3</u>

Article II of the 1969 Liability Convention is replaced by the following text: 

This Convention shall apply exclusively:

(a)   to pollution damage caused:

(i)    in the territory, including the territorial sea, of a Contracting  State, and 

(ii)   in the exclusive economic zone of a Contracting State, established in accordance with international law, or, if a Contracting State has not established such a zone, in an area beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea of that State determined by that State in accordance with international law and extending not more than 200 nautical miles from the baseline from which the breadth of its territorial sea is measured;

(b)   to preventive measures, wherever taken, to prevent or minimize such damage.

<u>Article 4</u>

Article III of the 1969 Liability Convention is amended as follows: 

1.    Paragraph 1 is replaced by the following text:

1.  Except as provided in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article, the owner of a ship at the time of an incident, or, where the incident consists of a series of occurrences, at the time of the first such occurrence, shall be liable for any pollution damage caused by the ship as a result of the incident. 

2.    Paragraph 4 is replaced by the following text:

4.  No claim for compensation for pollution damage may be made against the owner otherwise than in accordance with this Convention. Subject to paragraph 5 of this Article, no claim for compensation for pollution damage under this Convention or otherwise may be made against:

(a)   the servants or agents of the owner or the members of the crew; 

(b)   the pilot or any other person who, without being a member of the crew, performs services for the ship;

(e)   any person taking preventive measures;

(f)    all servants or agents of persons mentioned in subparagraphs (c), (d) and (e);

unless the damage resulted from their personal act or omission, committed with the intent to cause such damage, or recklessly and with knowledge that such damage would probably result.

<u>Article 5</u>

Article IV of the 1969 Liability Convention is replaced by the following text:

When an incident involving two or more ships occurs and pollution damage results therefrom, the owners of all the ships concerned, unless exonerated under Article III, shall be jointly and severally liable for all such damage which is not reasonably separable.

<u>Article 6</u>

Article V of the 1969 Liability Convention is amended as follows: 

1.    Paragraph 1 is replaced by the following text:

1.  The owner of a ship shall be entitled to limit his liability under this Convention in respect of any one incident to an aggregate amount calculated as follows:

(a)   3 million units of account for a ship not exceeding 5,000 units of tonnage;

(b)   for a ship with a tonnage in excess thereof, for each additional unit of tonnage, 420 units of account in addition to the amount mentioned in subparagraph (a);

provided, however, that this aggregate amount shall not in any event exceed 59.7 million units of account.

2.    Paragraph 2 is replaced by the following text:

2.  The owner shall not be entitled to limit his liability under this Convention if it is proved that the pollution damage resulted from his personal act or omission, committed with the intent to cause such damage, or recklessly and with knowledge that such damage would probably result. 

3.    Paragraph 3 is replaced by the following text:

3.  For the purpose of availing himself of the benefit of limitation provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article the owner shall constitute a fund for the total sum representing the limit of his liability with the Court or other competent authority of any one of the Contracting States in which action is brought under Article IX or, if no action is brought, with any Court or other competent authority in any one of the Contracting States in which an action can be brought under Article IX. The fund can be constituted either by depositing the sum or by producing a bank guarantee or other guarantee, acceptable under the legislation of the Contracting State where the fund is constituted, and considered to be adequate by the Court or other competent authority.

4.    Paragraph 9 is replaced by the following text:

9(a).   The “unit of account” referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article is the Special Drawing Right as defined by the International Monetary Fund. The amounts mentioned in paragraph 1 shall be converted into national currency on the basis of the value of that currency by reference to the Special Drawing Right on the date of the constitution of the fund referred to in paragraph 3\. The value of the national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a Contracting State which is a member of the International Monetary Fund shall be calculated in accordance with the method of valuation applied by the International Monetary Fund in effect on the date in question for its operations and transactions. The value of the national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a Contracting  State which is not a member of the International Monetary Fund shall be calculated in a manner determined by that State.

9(b).   Nevertheless, a Contracting State which is not a member of the International Monetary Fund and whose law does not permit the application of the provisions of paragraph 9(a) may, at the time of ratification, acceptance, approval of or accession to this Convention or at any time thereafter, declare that the unit of account referred to in paragraph 9(a) shall be equal to 15 gold francs. The gold franc referred to in this paragraph corresponds to sixty-five and a half milligrammes of gold of millesimal fineness nine hundred. The conversion of the gold franc into the national currency shall be made according to the law of the State concerned.

9(c).   The calculation mentioned in the last sentence of paragraph 9(a) and the conversion mentioned in paragraph 9(b) shall be made in such manner as to express in the national currency of the Contracting State as far as possible the same real value for the amounts in paragraph 1 as would result from the application of the first three sentences of paragraph 9(a). Contracting States shall communicate to the depositary the manner of calculation pursuant to paragraph 9(a), or the result of the conversion in paragraph 9(b) as the case may be, when depositing an instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval of or accession to this Convention and whenever there is a change in either.

5.    Paragraph 10 is replaced by the following text:

10.     For the purpose of this Article the ship’s tonnage shall be the gross tonnage calculated in accordance with the tonnage measurement regulations contained in Annex I of the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969.

6.    The second sentence of paragraph 11 is replaced by the following text: 

Such a fund may be constituted even if, under the provisions of paragraph 2, the owner is not entitled to limit his liability, but its constitution shall in that case not prejudice the rights of any claimant against the owner. 

<u>Article 7</u>

Article VII of the 1969 Liability Convention is amended as follows: 

1.    The first two sentences of paragraph 2 are replaced by the following text:

A certificate attesting that insurance or other financial security is in force in accordance with the provisions of this Convention shall be issued to each ship after the appropriate authority of a Contracting State has determined that the requirements of paragraph 1 have been complied with. With respect to a ship registered in a Contracting State such certificate shall be issued or certified by the appropriate authority of the State of the ship’s registry; with respect to a ship not registered in a Contracting State it may be issued or certified by the appropriate authority of any Contracting State. 

2.    Paragraph 4 is replaced by the following text:

4.  The certificate shall be carried on board the ship and a copy shall be deposited with the authorities who keep the record of the ship’s registry or, if the ship is not registered in a Contracting State, with the authorities of the State issuing or certifying the certificate.

3.    The first sentence of paragraph 7 is replaced by the following text: 

Certificates issued or certified under the authority of a Contracting State in accordance with paragraph 2 shall be accepted by other Contracting States for the purposes of this Convention and shall be regarded by other Contracting States as having the same force as certificates issued or certified by them even if issued or certified in respect of a ship not registered in a Contracting State.

4.    In the second sentence of paragraph 7 the words “with the State of a ship’s registry” are replaced by the words “with the issuing or certifying State”.

5.    The second sentence of paragraph 8 is replaced by the following text: 

In such case the defendant may, even if the owner is not entitled to limit his liability according to Article V, paragraph 2, avail himself of the limits of liability prescribed in Article V, paragraph 1.

<u>Article 8</u>

Article IX of the 1969 Liability Convention is amended as follows: 

Paragraph 1 is replaced by the following text:

1.  Where an incident has caused pollution damage in the territory, including the territorial sea or an area referred to in Article II, of one or more Contracting States or preventive measures have been taken to prevent or minimize pollution damage in such territory including the territorial sea or area, actions for compensation may only be brought in the Courts of any such Contracting State or States. Reasonable notice of any such action shall be given to the defendant.

<u>Article 9</u>

After Article XII of the 1969 Liability Convention two new Articles are inserted as follows:

<u>Article XII bis</u>

<u>Transitional provisions</u>

The following transitional provisions shall apply in the case of a State which at the time of an incident is a Party both to this Convention and to the 1969 Liability Convention:

(a)   where an incident has caused pollution damage within the scope of this Convention, liability under this Convention shall be deemed to be discharged if, and to the extent that, it also arises under the 1969 Liability Convention; 

(b)   where an incident has caused pollution damage within the scope of this Convention, and the State is a Party both to this Convention and to the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage, 1971, liability remaining to be discharged after the application of subparagraph (a) of this Article shall arise under this Convention only to the extent that pollution damage remains uncompensated after application of the said 1971 Convention;

(c)   in the application of Article III, paragraph 4, of this Convention the expression “this Compensation” shall be interpreted as referring to this Convention or the 1969 Liability Convention, as appropriate;

(d)   in the application of Article V, paragraph 3, of this Convention the total sum of the fund to be constituted shall be reduced by the amount by which liability has been deemed to be discharged in accordance with subparagraph (a) of this Article.

<u>Article XII ter </u>

<u>Final clauses</u>

The final clauses of this Convention shall be Articles 12 to 18 of the Protocol of 1992 to amend the 1969 Liability Convention. References in this Convention to Contracting States shall be taken to mean references to the Contracting States of that Protocol.

<u>Article 10</u>

The model of a certificate annexed to the 1969 Liability Convention is replaced by the model annexed to this Protocol.

<u>Article 11</u>

1.    The 1969 Liability Convention and this Protocol shall, as between the Parties to this Protocol, be read and interpreted together as one single instrument.

2.    Articles I to XII ter, including the model certificate, of the 1969 Liability Convention as amended by this Protocol shall be known as the International Convention of Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1992 (1992 Liability Convention).

FINAL CLAUSES
