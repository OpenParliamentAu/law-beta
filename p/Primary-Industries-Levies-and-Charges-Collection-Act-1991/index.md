          (3B)  An agreement between a producer and an intermediary that purports, expressly or implicitly, to require the producer to pay levy or charge as a condition for the provision of services by the intermediary is void to that extent, if the intermediary would otherwise have to pay an amount under this section in relation to that levy or charge.

                     (a)  the producer is, to the extent of that amount, discharged from so much of his or her liability to the Commonwealth in relation to the products as has not previously been discharged under subsection 8(2); and

                     (b)  the intermediary may recover from the producer, by set-off or otherwise, an amount equal to the amount by which the first-mentioned amount exceeds the amount (if any) deducted by the intermediary under subsection 8(1).

             (1)  Despite any law of a State or any agreement (whether entered into before or after the commencement of this Act) to the contrary, an intermediary referred to in subsection 7(1), (2), (3) or (3A) may, for the purpose of ensuring that the intermediary is provided with the funds necessary for the due payment by the intermediary, on behalf of the producer, of levy or charge on the products, deduct from any money received by the intermediary on behalf of the producer, or payable by the intermediary, in relation to the products an amount equal to, or that may reasonably be expected to be equal to, the amount in relation to levy or charge for which the intermediary is liable under that subsection.

             (2)  When an intermediary deducts an amount under subsection (1) in respect of levy or charge:

                     (a)  the producer is discharged from liability to pay that levy or charge to the extent of the amount deducted; and

             (4)  The proprietor of an abattoir may, despite any law of a State or Territory or any contract entered into before the commencement of this Act, refuse to slaughter or to permit the slaughter of cattle (being cattle within the meaning of Schedule 1 or 3 to the _Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Act 1999_) owned by another person at the abattoir unless that other person first provides the proprietor with the funds necessary for the due payment, on behalf of that other person, of levy on or in relation to the cattle.

                     (b)  permit the slaughter at the abattoir of deer owned by another person;

unless that other person first provides the proprietor with the funds necessary for the due payment, on behalf of that other person, of levy on the slaughter of the deer.

             (5)  Where a contract is made, whether at auction or otherwise, by which a person sells or agrees to sell pigs to another person, the amount that would, but for this section, be the price payable under the contract is taken to be reduced for all purposes (including, in the case of a contract made through an agent of the seller, the settlement of accounts between an agent and the seller) by an amount ascertained by multiplying an amount equal to the amount per pig that is the rate of the levy in force at the date of the contract by the number of the pigs comprised in the contract.

             (6)  Where a contract mentioned in subsection (5) makes specific provision for a deduction by, or allowance to, the purchaser in respect of levy, so much of the reduction provided for in that subsection as does not exceed the amount of that deduction or allowance is not to be made.
