_Overview_

This Act provides for the payment of parental leave pay to a person in the first year after the birth of a child or, for adoption, the placement of a child.

Parental leave pay is paid to a person for a particular period. That period is called the person’s PPL period. The maximum period for which any person may be paid parental leave pay is 18 weeks. A person’s PPL period may be the full 18 weeks or a lesser period (e.g. where the person is not eligible for parental leave pay for that full period).

Parental leave pay is paid in instalments at the national minimum wage for each week day during the person’s PPL period. It is paid by either the person’s employer or the Secretary.

_Chapter 2—When parental leave pay is payable to a person_

Chapter 2 sets out when parental leave pay is payable to a person. The key provisions for the Chapter are found in Part 2‑1.

A person can only be paid parental leave pay if the Secretary makes a determination that parental leave pay is payable to the person. Part 2‑2 has the rules about when the Secretary can make that determination.

The Secretary cannot make that determination if the person is not eligible for parental leave pay. Part 2‑3 has the rules about eligibility. For the main case, to be eligible a person must (broadly):

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(a)   satisfy the work test, the

income test and the Australian residency test; and</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(b)   be the child’s primary

carer; and</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(c)   not have returned to work;

and</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(d)   not be entitled to baby

bonus.</li>

The Secretary also cannot make that determination if the person has not made a claim for parental leave pay. Part 2‑4 has the rules about claims.

There are 3 types of claims: a primary claim, a secondary claim and (in rare cases) a tertiary claim. These claims relate to each other, although the primary claim is the main one—a secondary or tertiary claim cannot be made without it. The primary claim will often be the only claim that is made. If a secondary or tertiary claim is made, that claim will be for the part of the maximum 18 week period (or lesser period) in which parental leave pay was not payable to the primary claimant.

_Chapter 3—Payment of parental leave pay_

Chapter 3 sets out how parental leave pay is paid to a person.

Part 3‑1 is about instalments of parental leave pay. It deals with when instalments must be paid, whether the person’s employer or the Secretary must pay them and the amount of the instalments.

Part 3‑2 sets out when a person’s employer must pay instalments to the person. The employer is only required to do that if an employer determination has come into force for the employer and the person, and the employer has been paid enough by the Secretary to fund the instalment.

Part 3‑3 sets out when the Secretary must pay instalments directly to the person. The Secretary is required to do that if an employer determination is never made for the person (e.g. the person is a contractor and so does not have an employer). There are some other circumstances in which the Secretary is also required to pay instalments directly to the person (such as when an employer determination is being reviewed or has been revoked).

Part 3‑4 has general rules about the payment of instalments (such as what happens when an instalment cannot be paid on the day specified in this Act).

Part 3‑5 is about employer determinations. If an employer determination is in force for an employer and a person, the employer must pay instalments to the person. The Secretary must be satisfied that certain conditions have been met before the Secretary can make an employer determination.

_Chapter 4—Compliance and enforcement_

Chapter 4 deals with compliance and enforcement.

Part 4‑1 allows the Secretary to gather information for the purposes of checking compliance with this Act. It also deals with the confidentiality of personal and protected information.

Part 4‑2 deals with other compliance matters. It allows the Secretary to refer matters to the Fair Work Ombudsman for investigation if the Secretary has reason to believe that an employer has not complied with certain obligations under this Act. It also deals with civil penalty provisions, compliance notices and infringement notices.

Part 4‑3 provides for debts in relation to the parental leave pay scheme, and for the recovery of debts owing to the Commonwealth.

_Chapter 5—Review of decisions_

Chapter 5 is about administrative and judicial review of decisions made under this Act.

Part 5‑1 allows the Secretary, on his or her own initiative, to conduct an internal review of decisions made under this Act. It also allows a person whose interests are affected by certain types of decisions to seek internal review of those decisions, and an employer to seek internal review of certain types of decisions that affect employers.

Part 5‑2 allows a person to apply to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal for review of a decision made under this Act.

Part 5‑3 is about the procedures to be followed when the Social Security Appeals Tribunal reviews a decision.

Part 5‑4 allows the Secretary or a person whose interests are affected by a decision made by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal to apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of the decision.

Part 5‑5 has miscellaneous provisions relating to reviews of decisions under this Act.

_Chapter 6—Miscellaneous_

Chapter 6 has miscellaneous provisions.

Part 6‑1 has rules that modify this Act so that it applies correctly in 3 limited kinds of cases—adoption, claims made in exceptional circumstances etc. and Commonwealth employment.

Part 6‑2 is about payment nominees (who are people who can receive payments of instalments of parental leave pay on behalf of other people for the purposes of this Act) and correspondence nominees (who are people who can receive notices on behalf of other people for the purposes of this Act).

Part 6‑3 deals with other miscellaneous matters, such as the PPL rules, delegations and regulations.

# Chapter 2—When parental leave pay is payable to a person

## Part 2‑1—Key provisions

### Division 1—Guide to this Part

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Guide to this Part

* * *

This Part has the key provisions for this Chapter (which deals with when parental leave pay is payable to a person).

A person can only be paid parental leave pay if the Secretary makes a determination that parental leave pay is payable to the person. Part 2‑2 has the rules about when the Secretary can make that determination.

The Secretary cannot make that determination if the person has not made a claim for parental leave pay. Part 2‑4 has the rules about claims. There are 3 types of claims: a primary claim, a secondary claim and (in rare cases) a tertiary claim. These claims relate to each other, although the primary claim is the main one—a secondary or tertiary claim cannot be made without it. The primary claim will often be the only claim that is made.

If the Secretary makes a determination that parental leave pay is payable to a person for a child, the parental leave pay is payable for the particular period that is specified in the determination. This period is the person’s PPL period. The maximum period for which any person may be paid parental leave pay is 18 weeks. A person’s PPL period may be the full 18 weeks or a lesser period (e.g. where the person is not eligible for parental leave pay for that full period).

If a secondary or tertiary claim is made, that claim will be for the part of the maximum 18 week period (or lesser period) in which parental leave pay was not payable to the primary claimant. The person’s employer or the Secretary will pay instalments of parental leave pay for that period (see Chapter 3 for the rules about how the person is paid parental leave pay).

* * *

### Division 2—When parental leave pay is payable to a person

##### <a id="8"></a>8  A determination must be made for parental leave pay to be payable to a person

                   Parental leave pay is payable to a person for a child for a period if a determination of the Secretary that parental leave pay is payable to the person for that period is in force under section 13, 14, 15, 16 or 17.

Note:          See Part 2‑2 for the rules about when the Secretary can make a determination that parental leave pay is, or is not, payable to a person.

##### <a id="9"></a>9  For the determination to be made, the person must be eligible

                   The Secretary cannot make a determination that parental leave pay is payable to a person for a child for a period unless the person was or will be eligible for parental leave pay during the period.

Note:          See Part 2‑3 for the rules about when a person is eligible for parental leave pay.

##### <a id="10"></a>10  For the determination to be made, the person must claim

                   The Secretary cannot make a determination that parental leave pay is payable to a person for a child for a period unless the person has made:

                     (a)  an effective primary claim for the child (in which case the person is the primary claimant); or

                     (b)  an effective secondary claim for the child (in which case the person is the secondary claimant); or

                     (c)  an effective tertiary claim for the child (in which case the person is the tertiary claimant).

Note:          See Part 2‑4 for the rules about how to make an effective claim.

##### <a id="11"></a>11  The determination must specify the person’s _PPL period_

             (1)  If the Secretary makes a determination that parental leave pay is payable to a person for a child, the Secretary must specify, in the determination, the period for which parental leave pay is payable to the person. That period is the person’s **_PPL period_**.

Note:          For a primary claimant’s PPL period, see subsections 13(3) and 14(3). For a secondary claimant’s PPL period, see subsections 14(6), 15(5) and 16(4). For a tertiary claimant’s PPL period, see subsection 17(3).

             (2)  A person’s PPL period must be the same as, or within, the maximum PPL period for the child.

             (3)  The **_maximum PPL period_** for a child is the period that:

                     (a)  starts on the child’s maximum PPL period start day; and

                     (b)  ends on the child’s maximum PPL period end day.

             (4)  The **_maximum PPL period start day_** for a child is:

                     (a)  if, on or before the day (the **_relevant day_**) that is 28 days after the day the child was born, the primary claimant both made an effective claim for parental leave pay for the child and verified the child’s birth—the later of the following days:

                              (i)  the day the child was born;

                             (ii)  the primary claimant’s nominated start date; and

                     (b)  if, on or before the relevant day, the primary claimant made an effective claim for parental leave pay for the child but did not verify the child’s birth—the later of the following days:

                              (i)  the day the primary claimant verifies the child’s birth;

                             (ii)  the primary claimant’s nominated start date; and

                     (c)  if the primary claimant makes an effective claim for parental leave pay for the child after the relevant day—the later of the following days:

                              (i)  the day the claim is made;

                             (ii)  the primary claimant’s nominated start date.

             (5)  The **_maximum PPL period end day_** for a child is the earlier of the following days:

                     (a)  the day that is 125 days after the maximum PPL period start day (which is 18 weeks from (and including) that start day);

                     (b)  the day before the child’s first birthday.

## Part 2‑2—Determinations about whether parental leave pay is payable to a person

### Division 1—Guide to this Part

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Guide to this Part

* * *

This Part is about the Secretary making determinations about whether parental leave pay is payable to a person. These determinations are payability determinations. A person cannot be paid parental leave pay unless there is a payability determination that parental leave pay is payable to the person.

Division 2 has the rules that apply to the Secretary when making a payability determination. Different rules apply depending on the type of claim and, for a primary or secondary claim, whether it was made by itself or at the same time as another claim.

Division 3 has restrictions that apply in particular circumstances to prevent the Secretary from making a payability determination that parental leave pay is payable to a person (for example, where the child’s birth has not been verified or the person has already been paid parental leave pay for the child).

Division 4 has general rules that apply to payability determinations (for example, if the Secretary makes a determination, the Secretary must give a notice of it to the claimant).

Division 5 deals with initial eligibility determinations. These determinations can be made by the Secretary before the Secretary makes a payability determination. The Secretary can make an initial eligibility determination if the Secretary is satisfied that the person satisfies, or will satisfy, particular eligibility criteria (the work test, the income test and the Australian residency test). If the Secretary makes a determination, the Secretary must give a notice of it to the claimant.

                     (b)  a secondary claimant makes an effective secondary claim for parental leave pay for the child at a later time;

the Secretary must make a determination on the secondary claim under this section.

             (2)  However, the Secretary cannot make a determination on the secondary claim under this section until the Secretary has first made a determination on the primary claim.

When parental leave pay is payable to secondary claimant

             (3)  The Secretary must determine that parental leave pay is payable to the secondary claimant for the secondary claimant’s PPL period if, when making the determination, the Secretary is satisfied that:

                     (a)  a determination under section 13 or 14 that parental leave pay is payable to the primary claimant was or will be in force on the day before the start of the secondary claimant’s PPL period; and

                     (b)  the secondary claimant was or will be eligible for parental leave pay for the child on each day in the secondary claimant’s PPL period.

Note:          The Secretary is prevented from making a determination under this subsection in certain circumstances: see Division 3.

Secondary claimant’s PPL period

             (4)  The Secretary must specify in the determination under subsection (3) that the secondary claimant’s PPL period:

                     (a)  starts on the first day after the primary claimant’s PPL period ends; and

                     (b)  ends on:

                              (i)  if the Secretary is satisfied that the secondary claimant was or will be eligible on each day that remains in the child’s maximum PPL period—the child’s maximum PPL period end day; or

                             (ii)  otherwise—the last day in the child’s maximum PPL period that the Secretary is satisfied the secondary claimant was or will be eligible.

When parental leave pay is not payable to secondary claimant

             (5)  The Secretary must determine that parental leave pay is not payable to the secondary claimant if the Secretary is not satisfied of the matters in subsection (3).

##### <a id="17"></a>17  Determination on a tertiary claim

When a tertiary claim is to be determined under this section

             (1)  If a tertiary claimant makes an effective tertiary claim for parental leave pay for a child, the Secretary must make a determination on the tertiary claim under this section.

When parental leave pay is payable to tertiary claimant

             (2)  The Secretary must determine that parental leave pay is payable to the tertiary claimant for the tertiary claimant’s PPL period if, when making the determination, the Secretary is satisfied that:

                     (a)  a determination under section 14, 15 or 16 that parental leave pay is payable to the secondary claimant was or will be in force on the day before the start of the tertiary claimant’s PPL period; and

                     (b)  the tertiary claimant was or will be eligible for parental leave pay on each day in the tertiary claimant’s PPL period.

Note:          The Secretary is prevented from making a determination under this subsection in certain circumstances: see Division 3.

Tertiary claimant’s PPL period

             (3)  The Secretary must specify in the determination under subsection (2) that the tertiary claimant’s PPL period:

                     (a)  starts on the first day after the secondary claimant’s PPL period ends; and

                     (b)  ends on:

                              (i)  if the Secretary is satisfied that the tertiary claimant was or will be eligible on each day that remains in the child’s maximum PPL period—the child’s maximum PPL period end day; or

                             (ii)  otherwise—the last day in the child’s maximum PPL period that the Secretary is satisfied the tertiary claimant was or will be eligible.

When parental leave pay is not payable to tertiary claimant

             (4)  The Secretary must determine that parental leave pay is not payable to the tertiary claimant if the Secretary is not satisfied of the matters in subsection (2).

### Division 3—When the Secretary cannot make a determination that parental leave pay is payable

##### <a id="18"></a>18  The child’s birth has not been verified

                     (e)  the person has applied to have the birth of the child registered under the law.

             (4)  The Secretary may approve a form (a **_birth verification form_**) for the purposes of verifying the birth of a child.

##### <a id="19"></a>19  The child was born before 1 January 2011

                   The Secretary must not make a payability determination that parental leave pay is payable to a person for a child if the child was born before 1 January 2011.

##### <a id="20"></a>20  Multiple births

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply to a claim that is made in exceptional circumstances.

### Division 4—General provisions applying to determinations about whether parental leave pay is payable

##### <a id="22"></a>22  Assumptions when making the determination

                   In deciding whether to make a payability determination, the Secretary may act on the assumption that the state of affairs known to the Secretary when making the determination will remain unchanged.

##### <a id="23"></a>23  When the determination is in force

                   A payability determination comes into force on the day it is made and continues in force unless it is:

                     (a)  revoked under section 25 (which deals with revoking a payability determination on the claimant’s request); or

                     (b)  set aside under Chapter 5 (which deals with review of decisions).

##### <a id="24"></a>24  Notice of the determination

                   If the Secretary makes a payability determination, the Secretary must give a notice of the determination to the claimant, stating:

                     (a)  whether parental leave pay is payable; and

                     (b)  if parental leave pay is payable—the claimant’s PPL period; and

                     (c)  that the claimant may apply for review of the determination in the manner set out in Chapter 5.

##### <a id="25"></a>25  Revoking the determination on request

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a payability determination is made that parental leave pay is payable to a person; and

                     (c)  the request is made:

                              (i)  before the start of the person’s PPL period; and

                             (ii)  in a manner approved by the Secretary;

then the Secretary must revoke the determination.

             (2)  The revocation is taken to have come into force on the day the person requested the Secretary to revoke the determination.

### Division 5—Initial eligibility determinations

##### <a id="26"></a>26  Initial eligibility determinations

Primary claimants

             (1)  If a person makes an effective primary claim, the Secretary may make a determination (the **_initial eligibility determination_**) that the person is initially eligible for parental leave pay for the child if, when making the determination, the Secretary is satisfied that the person satisfies:

                     (a)  the work test; and

                     (b)  the income test; and

                     (c)  the Australian residency test.

Secondary claimants

             (2)  If a person makes an effective secondary claim, the Secretary may make a determination (the **_initial eligibility determination_**) that the person is initially eligible for parental leave pay for the child if, when making the determination, the Secretary is satisfied that the person:

                     (a)  satisfies:

                              (i)  the work test; and

                             (ii)  the income test; and

                            (iii)  the Australian residency test; or

                     (b)  will satisfy those tests on the day the person becomes the child’s primary carer.

##### <a id="27"></a>27  Assumptions when making the initial eligibility determination

                   In deciding whether to make an initial eligibility determination, the Secretary may act on the assumption that the state of affairs known to the Secretary when making the determination will remain unchanged.

##### <a id="28"></a>28  When the initial eligibility determination comes into force

                   An initial eligibility determination comes into force on the day it is made.

##### <a id="29"></a>29  Notice of the initial eligibility determination

                   If the Secretary makes an initial eligibility determination, the Secretary must give a notice of the determination to the claimant.

## Part 2‑3—Eligibility for parental leave pay

### Division 1—Guide to this Part

##### <a id="30"></a>30  Guide to this Part

* * *

This Part sets out when a person is eligible for parental leave pay. The Secretary cannot make a payability determination that parental leave pay is payable if the person is not eligible for it.

Division 2 sets out when a person is eligible for parental leave pay. Subsection 31(2) deals with the main case and requires that for a person to be eligible for parental leave pay for a child, the person must (broadly):

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(a)   satisfy the work test, the

income test and the Australian residency test; and</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(b)   be the child’s primary

carer; and</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(c)   not have returned to work;

and</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(d)   not be entitled to baby

bonus.</li>

There are other eligibility criteria that apply for more unusual cases—see subsection 31(3) (which deals with when a child is stillborn or dies) and subsection 31(4) (which allows the PPL rules to prescribe eligibility criteria).

Division 3 has the work test. To satisfy the work test, a person must have performed enough paid work or taken enough paid leave in a particular period before the day the child was born (for a primary claimant) or the day the person became the child’s primary carer (for a secondary claimant). Special rules apply in the case of premature birth or complications or illness related to the pregnancy.

Division 4 has the income test. To satisfy the income test, the person’s income for a particular income year must not be more than the PPL income limit (which is $150,000 until 30 June 2014 and then indexed).

Division 5 has the Australian residency test. To satisfy this test, the person must be an Australian resident or be in a special class of visa holder.

Division 6 sets out when a person is the primary carer of a child. For the main case, a person will not be eligible for parental leave pay if the person is not the child’s primary carer.

Division 7 sets out when a person returns to work after the birth of a child. For the main case, a person will not be eligible for parental leave pay if the person performs more than one hour of work other than for a permissible purpose. There are 2 permissible purposes. One is where the person performs the work for another entity on a keeping in touch day with that entity. The other is where the person performs the work for a business that the person carries on and the work consists of overseeing the business or is an occasional administrative task.

* * *

### Division 2—When a person is eligible for parental leave pay

##### <a id="31"></a>31  When a person is _eligible_ for parental leave pay

             (1)  This section sets out when a person is eligible for parental leave pay for a child on a day.

             (2)  First, a person is **_eligible_** for parental leave pay for a child on a day if, on that day:

                     (a)  the person satisfies the work test (see Division 3); and

                     (b)  the person satisfies the income test (see Division 4); and

                     (c)  the person satisfies the Australian residency test (see Division 5); and

                     (d)  the person is the primary carer of the child (see Division 6); and

                     (e)  the person has not returned to work (see Division 7); and

                      (f)  both of the following are satisfied:

                              (i)  the person and the person’s partner are not entitled to baby bonus for the child;

                             (ii)  a former partner of the person was not entitled to baby bonus for the child when he or she was the person’s partner.

             (3)  Second, a person is **_eligible_** for parental leave pay for a child on a day if:

                     (a)  the child is stillborn or has died before that day; and

                     (b)  on that day, the person would be eligible under subsection (2) for parental leave pay for the child, if paragraphs (2)(d) and (e) were disregarded; and

                     (c)  the person would have been the child’s primary carer on that day had the child not been stillborn or died.

             (4)  Third, a person is **_eligible_** for parental leave pay  for a child on a day if, on that day:

                     (a)  if the person is the primary claimant:

                              (i)  the person satisfies the work test (see Division 3); and

                             (ii)  the person satisfies the income test (see Division 4); and

                            (iii)  the person satisfies the Australian residency test (see Division 5); and

                            (iv)  the person satisfies the conditions prescribed by the PPL rules; and

                     (b)  if the person is a secondary claimant or tertiary claimant—the person satisfies the conditions prescribed by the PPL rules.

             (5)  Despite subsections (2), (3) and (4), a person is not **_eligible_** for parental leave pay for a child on a day if, on that day, the person is deceased.

### Division 3—The work test

##### <a id="32"></a>32  When a person satisfies the _work test_

                   To work out whether a person satisfies the **_work test_** on a day, use the following method statement:

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.   Work out the person’s work test period under section 33.

Step 2.   Work out the days in the work test period on which the person has and has not performed qualifying work.

                   Note:             **_Qualifying work_** is defined in section 34.

Step 3.   Work out whether any days on which the person has not performed qualifying work during the work test period fall within a permissible break.

                   Note:             **_Permissible break_** is defined in section 36.

Step 4.   Work out whether there is a period (a **_qualifying period_**) of 295 consecutive days in the work test period that are days:

               (a)     on which the person has performed qualifying work; or

              (b)     that fall within a permissible break.

Step 5.   If the person has performed at least 330 hours of qualifying work in a qualifying period, the person satisfies the **_work test_**.

* * *

Note:          A person may also satisfy the work test despite not satisfying the test in step 5, if:

(a)    the child was born prematurely; or

(b)    while the person was pregnant with the child, the person had complications or illness related to the pregnancy which prevented the person from performing paid work.

                   See section 36A.

##### <a id="33"></a>33  The _work test period_

Primary claimant’s work test period

             (1)  The **_work test period_** for a primary claimant is the 392 days immediately before:

                     (a)  if the child is born on or before the expected date of birth of the child—the day the child is born; or

                     (b)  if the child is born after the expected date of birth of the child—either:

                              (i)  the day the child is born; or

                             (ii)  if the person does not satisfy the work test in the work test period that applies under subparagraph (i), the expected date of birth of the child.

             (2)  However, for the purposes of making an initial eligibility determination on a primary claim that is made before the child is born, the **_work test period_** for the primary claimant is the 392 days immediately before the expected date of birth of the child.

Secondary claimant’s work test period

             (3)  The **_work test period_** for a secondary claimant is the 392 days immediately before the day the person becomes the child’s primary carer.

##### <a id="34"></a>34  When a person performs _qualifying work_

             (1)  A person performs **_qualifying work_** if:

                     (a)  the person performs at least one hour of paid work on a day; or

                     (b)  the person takes a period of paid leave of at least one hour on a day.

             (2)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), the PPL rules may prescribe what is, or is not, taken to be paid leave.

##### <a id="35"></a>35  When a person performs _paid work_

People other than self‑employed

             (1)  A person performs **_paid work_** on a day if, on that day, the person performs work (whether as an employee, a contractor or otherwise and whether or not in Australia) for another entity for remuneration or other financial benefit.

             (2)  However, a person is taken not to perform **_paid work_** for the purposes of subsection (1) if the other entity is controlled by the person (whether alone or with others).

Self‑employed

             (3)  A person performs **_paid work_** on a day if, on that day, the person performs work for the purposes of a business that is carried on for profit (whether in or outside of Australia) by:

                     (a)  the person (whether alone or with others); or

                     (b)  an entity that is controlled by the person (whether alone or with others).

When a person **controls** an entity

             (4)  A person **_controls_** an entity if the person has the capacity to determine the outcome of decisions about the entity’s financial and operating policies.

PPL rules about what paid work is

             (5)  The PPL rules may prescribe what is, or is not, taken to be paid work.

##### <a id="36"></a>36  When there is a _permissible break_

             (1)  A **_permissible break_** is any of the periods in subsections (2) and (3).

Permissible break between 2 qualifying work days

             (2)  If, between a day on which the person performed qualifying work (a **_qualifying_** **_work day_**) in the work test period and the next qualifying work day, there was at least 1 day but not more than 56 consecutive days on which the person did not perform qualifying work—the day or period of consecutive days between those 2 qualifying work days is a **_permissible break_**.

Permissible break at the start of the work test period

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  a person performed qualifying work on a day (the **_earlier qualifying work day_**) before the first day in the work test period; and

                     (b)  the person next performed qualifying work on a day (the **_later qualifying work day_**) after the first day in the work test period; and

                     (c)  the later qualifying work day was no more than 56 consecutive days after the earlier qualifying work day;

then the day or period of consecutive days on which the person did not perform qualifying work between the first day in the work test period and the later qualifying work day (including the first day of the work test period) is a **_permissible break_**.

##### <a id="36A"></a>36A  Premature birth or pregnancy‑related complications or illness

                   A person also satisfies the **_work test_** on a day if:

                     (a)  the person is the birth mother of the child; and

                     (b)  the Secretary is satisfied that either or both of the following circumstances existed:

                              (i)  the child was born prematurely;

                             (ii)  while the person was pregnant with the child, the person had complications or illness related to the pregnancy which prevented the person from performing paid work; and

                     (c)  the Secretary is satisfied that the person would have satisfied the work test on the day in accordance with section 32 if that circumstance, or those circumstances, had not existed.

### Division 4—The income test

#### Subdivision A—The income test

##### <a id="37"></a>37  When a person satisfies the _income test_

                   A person satisfies the **_income test_** on a day if the person’s adjusted taxable income for the reference income year is not more than the relevant PPL income limit.

##### <a id="38"></a>38  A person’s _adjusted taxable income_

                   A person’s **_adjusted taxable income_** for an income year is worked out in accordance with Schedule 3 to the Family Assistance Act (disregarding subclause 2(2) and clauses 3 and 3A of that Schedule).

Note:          Schedule 3 to the Family Assistance Act sets out how to work out a person’s adjusted taxable income for the purposes of that Act.

##### <a id="39"></a>39  The _reference income year_

                   The **_reference income year_** for a person is:

                     (a)  if the person is a primary claimant—the income year that ended before the earlier of:

                              (i)  the day the person made the claim; and

                             (ii)  the day the child was born; and

                     (b)  if the person is a secondary claimant—the income year that ended before the earlier of:

                              (i)  the day the person made the claim; and

                             (ii)  the day the person became the child’s primary carer.

##### <a id="40"></a>40  The _relevant PPL income limit_

                   The **_relevant PPL income limit_** for a person is:

                     (a)  if the person is a primary claimant—the PPL income limit that applies on the earlier of the following days:

                              (i)  the day the person made the claim;

                             (ii)  the day the child was born; or

                     (b)  if the person is a secondary claimant—the PPL income limit that applies on the earlier of the following days:

                              (i)  the day the person made the claim;

                             (ii)  the day the person became the child’s primary carer.

##### <a id="41"></a>41  The _PPL income limit_

                   The **_PPL income limit_** that applies on a day is:

                     (a)  if the day is on or after 1 October 2010 but before 1 July 2014—$150,000; and

                     (b)  if the day is on or after an indexation day (the **_relevant indexation day_**) but before the next indexation day—the indexed amount on the relevant indexation day worked out under Subdivision B.

#### Subdivision B—Indexation of the PPL income limit

##### <a id="42"></a>42  Indexation of the PPL income limit

             (1)  The amount of the PPL income limit in section 41 is to be indexed under this Subdivision on 1 July each year (the **_indexation day_**) starting on 1 July 2014.

Working out the indexed amount for the PPL income limit

             (2)  This is how to work out the **_indexed amount_** for the PPL income limit on the indexation day:

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.   Work out the amount (the **_previous amount_**) for the PPL income limit that applied on the day immediately before the indexation day.

Step 2.   Use section 43 to work out the indexation factor on the indexation day.

Step 3.   Multiply the previous amount by the indexation factor: the result is the **_provisional indexed amount_**.

Step 4.   Use section 44 to round off the provisional indexed amount: the result is the **_indexed amount_**.

* * *

##### <a id="43"></a>43  The _indexation factor_

             (1)  The **_indexation factor_** is worked out using the following formula and applying subsections (2) and (3):

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00619/Html/0bc1cb5a-3a4a-46a2-8e4e-820969b7c9b1_files/image002.gif)

where:

## Part 2‑4—Claims for parental leave pay

### Division 1—Guide to this Part

##### <a id="51"></a>51  Guide to this Part

* * *

This Part is about claims for parental leave pay. A person cannot be paid parental leave pay unless the person has first made a claim for it.

Division 2 sets out the rules about claims. There are 3 types of claims: a primary claim, a secondary claim and (in rare cases) a tertiary claim. These claims relate to each other, although the primary claim is the main one—a secondary or tertiary claim cannot be made without it. However, it will often be the only claim that is made. Section 54 sets out who can make a primary claim, a secondary claim or a tertiary claim.

The Secretary cannot make a payability determination on a claim unless it is an effective claim. To be effective, the claim must be made by the right person and satisfy the requirements in the provisions listed in section 55\. One of those requirements is that the claim must be in the form, and contain the information, required by the Secretary (see section 56). Another requirement is that the claim must be made in the period set out in section 60.

##### <a id="55"></a>55  When a claim is effective

             (1)  A claim is not effective unless the requirements of the following provisions that apply to the claim are satisfied:

                     (a)  section 56 (which deals with the form etc. of the claim);

                     (b)  section 57 (which deals with the nominated start date);

             (4)  An instalment becomes payable on the payday for the instalment.

             (5)  More than one instalment may be paid to a person on a particular day.

##### <a id="64"></a>64  A person’s _instalment period_ and the _payday_ for an instalment

             (1)  A person’s **_instalment period_**, and the **_payday_** for an instalment that relates to an instalment period, are worked out according to the following rules.

### Division 1—Guide to this Part

##### <a id="90"></a>90  Guide to this Part

* * *

This Part contains general rules that are relevant to the payment of instalments to a person, whether by the person’s employer or the Secretary.

Some of those rules deem instalments to have become payable in certain circumstances (such as when an employer or the Secretary becomes required to pay instalments to a person after the person’s PPL period has already started).

Other rules deal with the effect on a person’s instalment periods of changing who is required to pay instalments to the person.

There are also rules that relate to what happens when an instalment cannot be paid on the day specified in this Act.

Finally, this Part deals with the interaction of this Chapter with certain Commonwealth, State and Territory laws.

* * *

### Division 2—General rules relevant to paying instalments

                     (b)  that later instalment is not payable by the payer;

the payer must pay the instalment referred to in paragraph (a) on the day that would have been the payday for the later instalment if it had been payable by the payer.

##### <a id="96"></a>96  Paying instalment on particular day—complying with obligation

                   The Secretary or a person’s employer (the **_payer_**) is taken to have complied with a requirement to pay an instalment on a particular day if the payer pays the instalment:

                     (a)  before that day; or

                     (b)  if the payer cannot pay the instalment on that day—as soon as practicable after that day.

the court order does not apply to the saved amount (if any) in the account.

             (2)  The **_saved amount_** is worked out as follows:

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.   Work out the total amount of the instalments that have been paid to the credit of the account during the 4 week period immediately before the court order came into force.

Step 2.   Subtract from the step 1 amount the total amount withdrawn from the account during the same 4 week period: the result is the **_saved amount_**.

* * *

##### <a id="99"></a>99  PPL period is not a period of paid leave

                   Despite any law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, or any industrial instrument (however described), a period of unpaid leave is not to be taken to be a period of paid leave just because a person receives instalments of parental leave pay for all or part of that period.

##### <a id="99A"></a>99A  Payment of paid parental leave does not affect other employer obligations

                   An obligation of an employer to pay a person parental leave pay under this Act is in addition to any other obligation the employer may have in relation to the person, however that other obligation might arise (including, for example, under another law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, or an industrial instrument (however described)).

This Part is about employer determinations. If an employer determination is in force for an employer and a person, the employer must pay instalments to the person.

Under Division 2, the Secretary must make an employer determination if the Secretary is satisfied that certain conditions have been met. Not all of those conditions need to be satisfied for a person if the employer has made an election under Division 4 that applies to the person and the person consents to the employer paying the instalments.

If the Secretary makes an employer determination for a person and the person’s employer, the employer must either:

               (a)     give the Secretary certain information to enable the Secretary to pay the employer PPL funding amounts for the person; or

              (b)     apply for review of the employer determination under Part 5‑1 or 5‑2.

Division 3 is about when an employer determination is in force. It includes rules about revoking employer determinations.

Under Division 4, an employer may elect to pay instalments to one or more employees.

Division 5 provides for the Secretary to give an employer for whom an employer determination has been made notice of certain other decisions under this Act.

### Division 2—Making employer determinations

##### <a id="101"></a>101  Making employer determinations

When Secretary must make employer determination

             (1)  The Secretary must make a determination under this section (the **_employer determination_**) that a person’s employer is to pay the person instalments if the Secretary is satisfied, when making the determination, that:

                     (a)  a payability determination that parental leave pay is payable to the person, or an initial eligibility determination for the person, is in force; and

                     (b)  instalments are likely, if the determination is made, to be payable by the employer to the person for at least 40 consecutive PPL days that are week days; and

                     (c)  the person has, or will have, been employed by the employer for at least 12 months immediately before:

                              (i)  if the person’s claim was made before the birth of the person’s child—the expected date of birth of the child; or

                             (ii)  if the person’s claim was made after the birth of the person’s child—the later of the expected date of birth of the child and the day the child was born; and

                     (d)  the person is likely to be an Australian‑based employee of the employer during whichever of the following periods applies:

                              (i)  if the Secretary has made a payability determination that parental leave pay is payable to the person—the person’s PPL period;

                             (ii)  otherwise—the period of days for which instalments are likely, if the determination is made, to be payable to the person by the employer; and

                     (e)  the employer has an ABN; and

                      (f)  if paragraphs (c) to (e) are satisfied in relation to more than one employer of the person (other than because of subsection (2))—the person nominated the employer in the claim as the employer who would be required to pay instalments to the person.

Effect of election by employer to pay instalments

             (2)  Paragraphs (1)(b) and (c) do not apply in relation to a person if:

                     (a)  the person’s employer has made an election under section 109 that applies to the person; and

                     (b)  the person has consented in the claim to the employer paying instalments to the person.

When must employer determination be made

             (3)  The Secretary must not make an employer determination for a person and the person’s employer unless:

                     (a)  the Secretary is satisfied as referred to in subsection (1); and

                     (b)  the employer determination is made on or before the day on which the payability determination referred to in paragraph (1)(a) is made.

Note:          See section 106 for when the Secretary may, despite this subsection, make an employer determination for a person and the person’s employer after the day referred to in paragraph (b).

When Secretary may decide not to make employer determination

             (4)  Despite subsection (1), the Secretary may decide not to make an employer determination for a person and the person’s employer if the Secretary is satisfied of all or any of the following:

                     (a)  the person’s PPL period has ended;

                     (b)  the person is a tertiary claimant;

                     (c)  the child in relation to whom parental leave pay is payable to the person is stillborn or has died;

                     (d)  both of the following apply:

                              (i)  a primary claimant owes a debt to the Commonwealth in relation to amounts paid to, or in relation to, the primary claimant by way of instalments for a child;

                             (ii)  the person is a secondary claimant for parental leave pay for the same child;

                     (e)  the employer is not a fit and proper person.

Matters relevant to whether employer is a fit and proper person

             (5)  The Secretary may take into account the following matters in determining whether an employer is a fit and proper person:

                     (a)  whether the employer is insolvent;

                     (b)  whether the employer has, or is alleged to have, contravened a civil penalty provision of this Act;

                     (c)  whether a matter relating to a contravention of section 70 or Part 3‑2 (which deal with unauthorised deductions and payment of instalments by an employer) by the employer has been referred to the Fair Work Ombudsman under section 143;

                     (d)  subject to Part VIIC of the _Crimes Act 1914_, whether the employer has, or is alleged to have, contravened a provision of an industrial law (within the meaning of the Fair Work Act);

                     (e)  subject to Part VIIC of the _Crimes Act 1914_, whether the employer has been convicted of an offence against this Act, or a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory that involves:

                              (i)  fraud or dishonesty; or

                             (ii)  the misapplication of money; or

                            (iii)  the management of the affairs of a body (whether or not incorporated);

                      (f)  any other matter the Secretary considers relevant.

Note:          Part VIIC of the _Crimes Act 1914_ includes provisions that, in certain circumstances, relieve persons from the requirement to disclose spent convictions and require persons aware of such convictions to disregard them.

##### <a id="147"></a>147  Civil penalty orders

             (1)  If the Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Court is satisfied that a person has contravened one or more civil penalty provisions, the court may, on the application of the Secretary or the Fair Work Ombudsman, order the person to pay to the Commonwealth such pecuniary penalty, in relation to each contravention, as the court determines to be appropriate.

Note:          Subsection (3) sets out the maximum penalty that the court may order the person to pay.

             (2)  An order under subsection (1) is a **_civil penalty order_**.

Determining pecuniary penalty

             (3)  The pecuniary penalty must not be more than:

                     (a)  if the person is a body corporate—5 times the maximum number of penalty units referred to in the relevant item in column 2 of the table in section 146; and

                     (b)  otherwise—the maximum number of penalty units referred to in the relevant item in column 2 of the table in section 146.

             (4)  In determining the pecuniary penalty, the court must take into account all relevant matters, including:

                     (a)  the nature and extent of the contravention; and

                     (b)  the nature and extent of any loss or damage suffered because of the contravention; and

                     (c)  the circumstances in which the contravention took place; and

                     (d)  whether the person has previously been found by a court in proceedings under this Act to have engaged in any similar conduct; and

                     (e)  the likely impact of the penalty on the person.

Civil enforcement of penalty

             (5)  The pecuniary penalty is a civil debt payable to the Commonwealth.

             (6)  The Commonwealth may enforce a civil penalty order as if it were an order made in civil proceedings against the person to recover a debt due by the person. The debt arising from the order is taken to be a judgment debt.

##### <a id="148"></a>148  Proceedings may be heard together

                   The Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Court may direct that 2 or more proceedings for civil penalty orders are to be heard together.

##### <a id="151"></a>151  Conduct contravening more than one civil penalty provision

             (1)  If conduct constitutes a contravention of 2 or more civil penalty provisions, proceedings may be instituted under this Act against a person in relation to the contravention of any one or more of those provisions.

             (2)  However, the person is not liable to more than one pecuniary penalty under this Act in relation to the same conduct.

##### <a id="152"></a>152  Civil proceedings after criminal proceedings

                   Neither the Federal Court nor the Federal Magistrates Court may make a civil penalty order against a person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision if the person has been convicted of an offence constituted by conduct that is substantially the same as the conduct constituting the contravention.

##### <a id="153"></a>153  Criminal proceedings during civil proceedings

             (1)  Proceedings for a civil penalty order against a person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision are stayed if:

                     (a)  criminal proceedings are commenced or have already been commenced against the person for an offence; and

                     (b)  the offence is constituted by conduct that is the same, or substantially the same, as the conduct alleged to constitute the contravention.

             (2)  The proceedings for the order (the **_civil proceedings_**) may be resumed if the person is not convicted of the offence. Otherwise:

                     (a)  the civil proceedings are dismissed; and

                     (b)  costs must not be awarded in relation to the civil proceedings.

##### <a id="154"></a>154  Criminal proceedings after civil proceedings

                   Criminal proceedings may be commenced against a person for conduct that is substantially the same as conduct constituting a contravention of a civil penalty provision regardless of whether a civil penalty order has been made against the person.

##### <a id="155"></a>155  Evidence given in proceedings for penalty not admissible in criminal proceedings

             (1)  Evidence of information given or evidence of production of documents by a natural person is not admissible in criminal proceedings against the person if:

                     (a)  the person previously gave the evidence or produced the documents in proceedings for a civil penalty order against the person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision (whether or not the order was made); and

                     (b)  the conduct alleged to constitute the offence is the same, or substantially the same, as the conduct alleged to constitute the contravention.

             (2)  However, subsection (1) does not apply to criminal proceedings in relation to the falsity of the evidence given by the person in the proceedings for the civil penalty order.

##### <a id="156"></a>156  Requirement for person to assist in applications for civil penalty orders

             (1)  A person commits an offence if:

                     (a)  the Secretary requests, in writing, the person to give all reasonable assistance in connection with an application for a civil penalty order; and

                     (b)  the person fails to comply with the request.

                    Penalty:  10 penalty units.

Note:          This section does not abrogate or affect the law relating to legal professional privilege, or any other immunity, privilege or restriction that applies to the disclosure of information, documents or other things.

             (2)  A request under subsection (1) is not a legislative instrument.

             (3)  The Secretary can request a person to assist under subsection (1) only if:

                     (a)  it appears to the Secretary that the person is unlikely to have:

                              (i)  contravened the civil penalty provision to which the application relates; or

                             (ii)  committed an offence constituted by the same, or substantially the same, conduct as the conduct to which the application relates; and

                     (b)  the Secretary suspects or believes that the person can give information relevant to the application.

             (4)  The Secretary cannot request a person to assist under subsection (1) if the person is or has been a lawyer for the person suspected of contravening the civil penalty provision to which the application relates.

             (5)  The Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Court may order a person to comply with a request under subsection (1) in a specified way. Only the Secretary may apply to the court for an order under this subsection _._

             (6)  For the purposes of this section, it does not matter whether the application for the civil penalty order has actually been made.

### Division 2—Main debts recoverable under this Act

##### <a id="165"></a>165  Debts due to the Commonwealth

                   If an amount has been paid by way of parental leave pay or a PPL funding amount, the amount (or an amount equivalent to the amount) is a debt due to the Commonwealth only to the extent expressly provided for under:

                     (a)  this Act; or

                     (b)  the _Data‑matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990_.

Note:          The main debts due to the Commonwealth under this Act are provided for in this Division. Other debts due to the Commonwealth are provided for in the following provisions:

(a)    section 177 (which deals with interest);

(b)    section 179 (which imposes an administrative charge);

(c)    section 186 (which deals with non‑compliance with garnishee notices).

##### <a id="166"></a>166  Parental leave pay instalment debts—instalments paid by employer

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  the total of amounts paid to a person (the **_first person_**) by way of PPL funding amounts in relation to instalments for another person for a child exceeds (by the **_PPL funding excess_**) the total of amounts payable to the first person as PPL funding amounts in relation to those instalments; and

                     (b)  the first person pays an amount (the **_employer payment_**) to, or in relation to, the other person for the child by way of an instalment; and

                     (c)  the total of employer payments paid for the child exceeds (by the **_instalment excess_**) the total of amounts that are payable by the first person to, or in relation to, the other person for the child as instalments under Division 2 of Part 3‑2 (which deals with the payment of instalments by employers).

Note:          Instalments may stop being payable with retrospective effect if a payability determination that parental leave is payable to the other person for the child is set aside or varied after the instalments are paid.

             (2)  An amount equal to the lesser of the PPL funding excess and the instalment excess is a debt due to the Commonwealth by the other person.

Example:    If no amounts are payable by the first person to, or in relation to, the other person for a child as instalments, the amount of the instalment excess is the total amount of the employer payments.

             (3)  The debt under subsection (2) arises:

                     (a)  if the other person has a PPL period for the child—immediately after the end of the person’s PPL period; or

                     (b)  otherwise—when subsection (1) starts to apply in relation to an employer payment.

Note 1:       The other person does not have a PPL period for the child if a payability determination that parental leave pay is payable to the other person for the child has not been made, or has been set aside. In such a case, a debt will arise as soon as there is an instalment excess.

Note 2:       This section may apply to overpayments by way of instalments or amounts that are mistakenly paid. For example, an overpayment or mistaken payment may arise due to administrative error, the setting aside or variation of a payability determination or payments following a stay order under subsection 41(2) of the AAT Act.

##### <a id="167"></a>167  Parental leave pay instalment debts—instalments paid by Secretary

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  the Secretary pays an amount (the **_Secretary payment_**) to, or in relation to, a person for a child by way of an instalment; and

                     (b)  the total of Secretary payments paid for the child exceeds the total of amounts that are payable to, or in relation to, the person for the child as instalments under Part 3‑3 (which deals with the payment of instalments by the Secretary).

Note:          Instalments may stop being payable with retrospective effect if the payability determination is set aside or varied after the instalments are paid.

             (2)  An amount equal to the amount of the excess is a debt due to the Commonwealth by the person.

Example:    If no amounts are payable to, or in relation to, a person for a child as instalments, the amount of the excess is the total amount of the Secretary payments.

             (3)  The debt under subsection (2) arises:

                     (a)  if the person has a PPL period for the child—immediately after the end of the person’s PPL period; or

                     (b)  otherwise—when subsection (1) starts to apply in relation to a Secretary payment.

Note 1:       The person does not have a PPL period for the child if a payability determination that parental leave pay is payable to the person for the child has not been made, or has been set aside. In such a case, a debt will arise as soon as there is an excess as referred to in subsection (1).

Note 2:       This section may apply to overpayments by way of instalments or amounts that are mistakenly paid. For example, an overpayment or mistaken payment may arise due to administrative error, the setting aside or variation of a payability determination or payments following a stay order under subsection 41(2) of the AAT Act.

##### <a id="168"></a>168  PPL funding amount debts—amounts not paid as parental leave pay instalments

             (1)  This section applies if the total of amounts paid to a person (the **_first person_**) by way of PPL funding amounts in relation to instalments for another person for a child exceeds the total of amounts paid by the first person to, or in relation to, the other person by way of such instalments for the child.

             (2)  The amount of the excess is a debt due to the Commonwealth by the first person.

Example:    If the first person has not paid any amounts by way of instalments to the other person, the amount of the excess is the total of amounts paid to the first person by way of PPL funding amounts in relation to instalments for the other person for the child.

             (3)  The debt under subsection (2) arises:

                     (a)  if the other person has a PPL period for the child—at the earlier of the following times:

                              (i)  when the Secretary pays one or more of the instalments to, or in relation to, the other person under section 85, 86 or 87 (which deal with the payment of arrears);

                             (ii)  immediately after the end of the other person’s PPL period; or

                     (b)  otherwise—when subsection (1) starts to apply in relation to an amount paid to the first person.

Note 1:       The other person does not have a PPL period for the child if a payability determination that parental leave pay is payable to the person for the child has not been made, or has been set aside. In such a case, a debt will arise as soon as there is an excess referred to in subsection (1).

Note 2:       This section may apply to overpayments by way of PPL funding amounts or amounts that are mistakenly paid. For example, an overpayment or mistaken payment may arise due to administrative error or the revocation or setting aside of an employer determination.

##### <a id="169"></a>169  Wrong person receives parental leave pay instalment or PPL funding amount

                 (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  an instalment or a PPL funding amount (the **_PPL payment_**) is paid by the Secretary or an employer; and

                     (b)  a person (the **_wrong recipient_**) other than the person (the **_right recipient_**) to whom the PPL payment is payable receives the PPL payment (or a part of it); and

                     (c)  the wrong recipient is not authorised by the right recipient, or authorised under law, to receive the PPL payment (or that part).

             (2)  An amount equal to the PPL payment (or that part of the PPL payment), is a debt due by the wrong recipient to:

                     (a)  if the PPL payment is made by the Secretary—the Commonwealth; or

                     (b)  if the PPL payment is made by an employer—the employer.

Note 1:       Because the PPL payment (or part) has not been properly paid to the right recipient, the Secretary or the employer must repay to the right recipient the amount of the PPL payment that ought to have been paid to the right recipient in the first place.

Note 2:       The Secretary may recover a debt due to the Commonwealth under this section from an ADI (see section 192).

##### <a id="170"></a>170  Joint and several liability for debts arising because of false and misleading statements

                   A person (the **_recipient_**) and another person are jointly and severally liable to pay a debt if:

                     (a)  the recipient is liable under this Division to repay an amount (the **_unauthorised amount_**) paid to, or in relation to, the recipient (or an amount equal to such an amount); and

                     (b)  the unauthorised amount was paid because the recipient contravened Part 7.4 of the _Criminal Code_ (which deals with false and misleading statements); and

                     (c)  the other person is convicted of an offence:

                              (i)  that is taken to have been committed in relation to that contravention because of section 11.2 or 11.2A of the _Criminal Code_ (which deal with complicity, common purpose and joint commission); or

                             (ii)  in relation to that contravention against section 11.4 or 11.5 of the _Criminal Code_ (which deal with incitement and conspiracy).

             (4)  If the Secretary and a debtor agree that the debtor’s debt will be fully satisfied if the debtor pays the Commonwealth an agreed amount less than the amount (the **_unpaid_**_amount_) of the debt outstanding when the agreement is made, the Secretary must, if the agreed amount is paid, waive the right to recover the difference between the unpaid amount and the agreed amount.

Limits on agreement to accept part payment in satisfaction of outstanding debt

             (5)  The Secretary must not make an agreement described in subsection (4) unless the Secretary is satisfied that the agreed amount is at least the present value of the unpaid amount if it is repaid in instalments of amounts, and at times, determined by the Secretary.

# Chapter 5—Review of decisions

## Part 5‑1—Internal review of decisions

### Division 1—Guide to this Part

##### <a id="202"></a>202  Guide to this Part

* * *

This Part is about the internal review of decisions of officers under this Act.

Division 2 sets out 3 kinds of internal review of those decisions.

The first kind of review is where the Secretary, on his or her own initiative, reviews those decisions.

The second kind of review is where a person whose interests are affected by certain decisions (which are “claimant decisions”) applies for internal review of the decision.

The third kind of review is where an employer applies for internal review of certain decisions that affect the employer (those decisions are “employer determination decisions” and “employer funding amount decisions”). Employer determination decisions can only be reviewed on application, and not on the Secretary’s own initiative.

Note 2:       Paragraph 44(2B)(b) of the AAT Act provides that the Federal Court may allow further time to appeal if the text of a decision or a statement of reasons for a decision has been altered under section 43AA of the AAT Act (which allows errors to be corrected).

Note 3:       Paragraph 45(1)(a) of the AAT Act requires the President of the AAT to concur before the AAT can refer a question of law arising in proceedings before the AAT to the Federal Court.

             (5)  However, the following provisions of Part IVA of the AAT Act do not apply in relation to SSAT employer proceedings:

                     (a)  subsection 44(2) (which allows certain appeals about standing before the AAT to be made);

                     (b)  paragraphs 44(3)(b) and (c) (which require appeals to be heard by the Full Court of the Federal Court in some circumstances);

# Chapter 6—Miscellaneous

## Part 6‑1—How this Act applies in particular circumstances

### Division 1—Guide to this Part

##### <a id="274"></a>274  Guide to this Part

* * *

This Part has rules that modify this Act so that it applies correctly in 3 limited kinds of cases—adoption, claims made in exceptional circumstances etc. and Commonwealth employment.

Division 2 modifies this Act so that it applies correctly for adopted children under 16\. For example, where a provision of this Act refers to the day a child was born, Division 2 modifies that provision so that, when applying that provision to the adopted child, the provision has the effect of referring to the day of placement of the adopted child (instead of the day the adopted child was born).

Division 3 modifies this Act so that it applies correctly for claims that are made in exceptional circumstances and other special cases. For example, where a provision of this Act refers to the day a child was born, Division 3 modifies that provision so that, when applying that provision in relation to a claim that is made in exceptional circumstance, the provision has the effect of referring to the day the claimant became the child’s primary carer (instead of the day the child was born).

Division 4 modifies this Act so that it applies correctly to Commonwealth employment.

* * *

### Division 2—How this Act applies to an adopted child

##### <a id="275"></a>275  How this Act applies to an adopted child

             (1)  This Act applies in relation to an adopted child that satisfies the requirements of subsection (2) as if:

                     (a)  a reference to the birth of a child were a reference to the placement of the child; and

                     (b)  a reference to the day the child was born were a reference to the day of placement of the child; and

                     (c)  a reference to the expected date of birth of the child were a reference to the expected day of placement of the child; and

                     (d)  a reference to a child’s first birthday were a reference to the first anniversary of the day of placement of the child; and

                     (e)  a reference to a completed birth verification form for a child were a reference to information required by the Secretary about the adoption of the child; and

                      (f)  a reference to a child being born during the same multiple birth were a reference to the child being adopted during the same multiple adoption.

When a child satisfies this subsection

             (2)  A child satisfies the requirements of this subsection if:

                     (a)  as part of the process for the adoption of the child by a person, the child is, or is to be, entrusted to the care of the person by an authorised party; and

                     (b)  the child is, or will be, under 16 on the day of placement of the child.

Meaning of **day of placement**

             (3)  The **_day of placement_** of a child with a person is the day on which, as part of the process for the adoption of a child by a person, the child is entrusted to the care of the person by an authorised party.

### Division 3—How this Act applies to claims made in exceptional circumstances and other cases

##### <a id="276"></a>276  How this Act applies to claims made in exceptional circumstances

                   This Act (other than subsection 18(3), which deals with birth registration) applies in relation to a claim that is made in exceptional circumstances as if:

                     (a)  a reference to the birth of a child were a reference to the claimant becoming the child’s primary carer; and

                     (b)  a reference to the day the child was born were a reference to the day the claimant became the child’s primary carer; and

                     (c)  a reference to the expected date of birth of the child were a reference to the day the claimant expects to become the child’s primary carer; and

                     (d)  a reference to a child’s first birthday were a reference to the first anniversary of the day the claimant became the child’s primary carer; and

                     (e)  a reference to a completed birth verification form for a child were a reference to information required by the Secretary about the claimant becoming the child’s primary carer; and

                      (f)  a reference to a child being born during the same multiple birth were a reference to the claimant becoming the primary carer of the child at the same time as becoming the primary carer of another child.

##### <a id="277"></a>277  Primary carers when a child is stillborn or dies

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a claim is made for parental leave pay for a child; and

                     (b)  before or after the claim is made, the child is stillborn or dies;

then this Act (other than sections 31 and 47) applies as if a reference to the claimant becoming or being the child’s primary carer were a reference to the claimant having become or been the child’s primary carer had the child not been stillborn or died.

Note:          Section 31 deals with eligibility for parental leave pay and section 47 defines who is a primary carer.

             (2)  The PPL rules may modify the operation of subsection (1).

### Division 4—How this Act applies to Commonwealth employment

##### <a id="278"></a>278  How this Act applies to Commonwealth employment

                     (a)  the employee were employed by the agency (rather than the Commonwealth) for whom the person is to perform functions; and

                     (b)  the agency were a body corporate; and

                     (c)  the head of the agency (however described) has all the rights, duties and powers of an employer in relation to the employee.

             (2)  However, for the purposes of working out for the purposes of paragraph 101(1)(c) (which deals with when the Secretary must make an employer determination) whether the person has, or will have, been employed by the Commonwealth agency for at least 12 months:

                     (a)  treat the reference in that paragraph to the employer as being a reference to the Commonwealth; and

                     (b)  disregard subsection (1) of this section.

The Secretary also cannot make that determination if the person has not made a claim for dad and partner pay. Part 3A‑4 has the rules about claims.

If the Secretary makes a determination that dad and partner pay is payable to a person for a child, the amount of dad and partner pay is worked out by reference to the period for which the person is eligible for dad and partner pay. This period is the person’s DAPP period. The maximum period for which any person may be eligible for dad and partner pay is 2 weeks. A person’s DAPP period may be the full 2 weeks or a lesser period (if the person is not eligible for dad and partner pay for that full period).

Generally, dad and partner pay is paid by the Secretary as a single payment.

                   Dad and partner pay is payable to a person for a child for a period if a determination of the Secretary that dad and partner pay is payable to the person for that period is in force under section 115BB.

Note:          See Part 3A‑2 for the rules about when the Secretary can make a determination that dad and partner pay is, or is not, payable to a person.

##### <a id="115AC"></a>115AC  For the determination to be made, the person must be eligible

                   The Secretary cannot make a determination that dad and partner pay is payable to a person for a child for a period unless the person was or will be eligible for dad and partner pay during the period.

Note:          See Part 3A‑3 for the rules about when a person is eligible for dad and partner pay.

## Part 3A‑2—Determinations about whether dad and partner pay is payable to a person

### Division 1—Guide to this Part

##### <a id="115BA"></a>115BA  Guide to this Part

* * *

This Part is about the Secretary making determinations about whether dad and partner pay is payable to a person. These determinations are payability determinations. A person cannot be paid dad and partner pay unless there is a payability determination that dad and partner pay is payable to the person.

Division 2 has the rules that apply to the Secretary when making a payability determination.

Division 3 has restrictions that apply in particular circumstances to prevent the Secretary from making a payability determination that dad and partner pay is payable to a person (for example, where the child’s birth has not been verified or the person has already been paid dad and partner pay for the child).

Division 4 has general rules that apply to payability determinations (for example, if the Secretary makes a determination, the Secretary must give a notice of it to the claimant).

Division 5 deals with initial eligibility determinations. These determinations can be made by the Secretary before the Secretary makes a payability determination. The Secretary can make an initial eligibility determination if the Secretary is satisfied that the person satisfies, or will satisfy, particular eligibility criteria (the work test, the income test and the Australian residency test). If the Secretary makes a determination, the Secretary must give a notice of it to the claimant.

When dad and partner pay is payable to DAPP claimant

             (2)  The Secretary must determine that dad and partner pay is payable to the DAPP claimant for the claimant’s DAPP period if, when making the determination, the Secretary is satisfied that the DAPP claimant was or will be eligible for dad and partner pay on each day in that period.

Note:          The Secretary is prevented from making a determination under this subsection in certain circumstances: see Division 3.

DAPP claimant’s DAPP period

             (3)  The Secretary must specify in the determination under subsection (2) that the claimant’s DAPP period:

                     (a)  starts on the child’s maximum DAPP period start day; and

                     (b)  ends on:

                              (i)  if the Secretary is satisfied that the DAPP claimant was or will be eligible for dad and partner pay on each day in the child’s maximum DAPP period—the child’s maximum DAPP period end day; or

                             (ii)  if the Secretary is satisfied that the DAPP claimant was or will be eligible for a period that is shorter than the child’s maximum DAPP period—the last day in the child’s maximum DAPP period that the DAPP claimant was or will be eligible for dad and partner pay.

When dad and partner pay is not payable to DAPP claimant

             (4)  The Secretary must determine that dad and partner pay is not payable to the DAPP claimant if the Secretary is not satisfied of the matters in subsection (2).

##### <a id="115BH"></a>115BH  When the determination is in force

                   A payability determination about dad and partner pay comes into force on the day it is made and continues in force unless it is:

                     (a)  revoked under section 115BK (which deals with revoking a payability determination on the DAPP claimant’s request); or

                     (b)  set aside under Chapter 5 (which deals with review of decisions).

##### <a id="115BJ"></a>115BJ  Notice of the determination

                   If the Secretary makes a payability determination about dad and partner pay, the Secretary must give a notice of the determination to the DAPP claimant, stating:

                     (a)  whether dad and partner pay is payable; and

                     (b)  if dad and partner pay is payable—the DAPP claimant’s DAPP period; and

                     (c)  the request is made:

                              (i)  before the start of the person’s DAPP period; and

                             (ii)  in a manner approved by the Secretary;

then the Secretary must revoke the determination.

             (2)  The revocation is taken to have come into force on the day the person requested the Secretary to revoke the determination.

### Division 5—Initial eligibility determinations about dad and partner pay

##### <a id="115BL"></a>115BL  Initial eligibility determinations

                   If a person makes an effective claim for dad and partner pay, the Secretary may make a determination (the **_initial eligibility determination_**) that the person is initially eligible for dad and partner pay for the child if, when making the determination, the Secretary is satisfied that the person:

                     (a)  satisfies:

                              (i)  the work test; and

                             (ii)  the income test; and

                   If the Secretary makes an initial eligibility determination about dad and partner pay, the Secretary must give a notice of the determination to the DAPP claimant.

## Part 3A‑3—Eligibility for dad and partner pay

### Division 1—Guide to this Part

##### <a id="115CA"></a>115CA  Guide to this Part

* * *

This Part sets out when a person is eligible for dad and partner pay. The Secretary cannot make a payability determination that dad and partner pay is payable if the person is not eligible for it.

Division 2 sets out when a person is eligible for dad and partner pay. Subsection 115CB(2) deals with the main case and requires that for a person to be eligible for dad and partner pay for a child, the person must (broadly):

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(a)   satisfy the work test, the

income test and the Australian residency test; and</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(b)   be caring for the child; and</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(c)   not be working.</li>

There are other eligibility criteria that apply for more unusual cases—see subsection 115CB(3) (which deals with when a child is stillborn or dies) and subsection 115CB(4) (which allows the PPL rules to prescribe eligibility criteria).

The work test is mostly in Division 3 of Part 2‑3, but Division 3 of this Part has provisions relevant to DAPP claimants. To satisfy the work test, a person must have performed enough paid work or taken enough paid leave in a particular period before the person’s nominated start date for dad and partner pay. Special rules apply in the case of premature birth or complications or illness related to the pregnancy (see section 115CE) or if the person is already eligible for parental leave pay (see section 115CF).

The income test is mostly in Division 4 of Part 2‑3, but Division 4 of this Part has provisions relevant to DAPP claimants. To satisfy the income test, the person’s income for a particular income year must not be more than the PPL income limit (which is $150,000 until 30 June 2014 and then indexed). A special rule applies if the person is already eligible for parental leave pay (see subsection 115CG(2)).

The Australian residency test is in Division 5 of Part 2‑3\. To satisfy this test, the person must be an Australian resident or be in a special class of visa holder.

Division 6 of this Part sets out when a person is caring for a child. For the main case, a person will not be eligible for dad and partner pay if the person is not caring for the child.

Division 7 of this Part sets out when a person is not working. For the main case, a person will not be eligible for dad and partner pay if the person performs one hour or more of work other than for a purpose of performing the work for a business that the person carries on and that consists of overseeing the business or is an occasional administrative task.

### Division 2—When a DAPP claimant is eligible for dad and partner pay

##### <a id="115CB"></a>115CB  When a DAPP claimant is _eligible_ for dad and partner pay

             (1)  This section sets out when a DAPP claimant is eligible for dad and partner pay for a child on a day.

Eligible

             (2)  First, a DAPP claimant is **_eligible_** for dad and partner pay for a child on a day if, on that day:

                     (a)  the claimant satisfies the work test (see Division 3 of Part 2‑3 and sections 115CD, 115CE and 115CF); and

                     (b)  the claimant satisfies the income test (see Division 4 of Part 2‑3 and sections 115CG, 115CH and 115CJ); and

                     (c)  the claimant satisfies the Australian residency test (see Division 5 of Part 2‑3); and

                     (d)  the claimant is caring for the child (see Division 6 of this Part); and

                     (e)  the claimant is not working (see Division 7 of this Part).

             (3)  Second, a DAPP claimant is **_eligible_** for dad and partner pay for a child on a day if:

                     (a)  the child is stillborn or has died before that day; and

                     (b)  on that day, the claimant would be eligible under subsection (2) for dad and partner pay for the child, if paragraphs (2)(d) and (e) were disregarded; and

                     (c)  the claimant would have been caring for the child on that day had the child not been stillborn or died.

             (4)  Third, a DAPP claimant is **_eligible_** for dad and partner pay  for a child on a day if, on that day, the claimant satisfies:

                     (a)  the work test (see Division 3 of Part 2‑3 and sections 115CD, 115CE and 115CF); and

                     (b)  the income test (see Division 4 of Part 2‑3 and sections 115CG, 115CH and 115CJ); and

                     (c)  the Australian residency test (see Division 5 of Part 2‑3); and

                     (d)  the conditions prescribed by the PPL rules.

Not eligible—overlap with PPL period

             (5)  If there is in force a payability determination that parental leave pay is payable to a person for a child for the person’s PPL period, then, despite subsections (2), (3) and (4), the person is not **_eligible_** for dad and partner pay for the child on a day that is in the PPL period.

Not eligible—overlap with DAPP period for another child

             (6)  If there is in force a payability determination that dad and partner pay is payable to a person for a child for the person’s DAPP period, then, despite subsections (2), (3) and (4), the person is not **_eligible_** for dad and partner pay for another child on a day that is in that DAPP period.

Not eligible—excess days

             (7)  Despite subsections (2), (3) and (4), if:

                     (a)  there is in force a payability determination that parental leave pay is payable to a person for a child for the person’s PPL period; and

                     (b)  combined, the total days in the PPL period and the reference period for the person’s claim for dad and partner pay for the child exceed 126;

then:

                     (c)  the Secretary must exclude from the reference period the excess number of days; and

                     (d)  the person is not **_eligible_** for dad and partner pay for the child on a day excluded by the Secretary.

Not eligible—claimant deceased

             (8)  Despite subsections (2), (3) and (4), a DAPP claimant is not **_eligible_** for dad and partner pay for a child on a day if, on that day, the claimant is deceased.

### Division 3—Applying the work test to claimants for dad and partner pay

##### <a id="115CC"></a>115CC  When a DAPP claimant satisfies the work test

                   To work out whether a DAPP claimant satisfies the work test on a day in accordance with section 32, use the method statement in section 32 with the work test period  in section 115CD.

Note:          Sections 115CE and 115CF in this Division are alternative ways of satisfying the work test for DAPP claimants.

##### <a id="115CD"></a>115CD  The _work test period_

                   For the purposes of satisfying the work test in accordance with section 32, the **_work test period_** for a DAPP claimant is the 392 days immediately before the claimant’s nominated start date.

Note:          Sections 115CE and 115CF in this Division are alternative ways of satisfying the work test for DAPP claimants.

##### <a id="115CE"></a>115CE  Premature birth

                   A DAPP claimant also satisfies the **_work test_** on a day if:

                     (a)  the Secretary is satisfied that the child was born prematurely; and

                     (b)  the Secretary is satisfied that the DAPP claimant would have satisfied the work test on the day in accordance with section 32 if the child had not been born prematurely.

##### <a id="115CF"></a>115CF  DAPP claimant who is already eligible for parental leave pay

                   A DAPP claimant also satisfies the **_work test_** on a day if the Secretary is satisfied that the DAPP claimant is eligible for parental leave pay for the child.

### Division 4—Applying the income test to claimants for dad and partner pay

##### <a id="115CG"></a>115CG  When a DAPP claimant satisfies the _income test_

             (1)  To work out whether a DAPP claimant satisfies the income test in subsection 37(1) on a day, use the income test in subsection 37(1) with the reference income year  in section 115CH and the relevant PPL income limit in section 115CJ.

             (2)  A DAPP claimant also satisfies the **_income test_** on a day if the Secretary is satisfied that the DAPP claimant is eligible for parental leave pay for the child.

##### <a id="115CH"></a>115CH  The _reference income year_

                   The **_reference income year_** for a DAPP claimant is the income year that ended before the earlier of the following days:

                     (a)  the day the DAPP claimant made the claim for dad and partner pay;

                     (b)  the DAPP claimant’s nominated start date.

##### <a id="115CJ"></a>115CJ  The _relevant PPL income limit_

                   The **_relevant PPL income limit_** for a DAPP claimant is the PPL income limit that applies on the earlier of the following days:

                     (a)  the day the DAPP claimant made the claim for dad and partner pay;

                     (b)  the DAPP claimant’s nominated start date.

Note:          For **_PPL income limit_**, see section 41\. The PPL income limit may be indexed under Subdivision B of Division 4 of Part 2‑3.

### Division 5—Applying the Australian residency test to claimants for dad and partner pay

##### <a id="115CK"></a>115CK  When a DAPP claimant satisfies the _Australian residency test_

                   To work out whether a DAPP claimant satisfies the Australian residency test on a day, use the Australian residency test in sections 45 and 46.

### Division 6—Caring for a child

##### <a id="115CL"></a>115CL  When a DAPP claimant is _caring_ for  a child

             (1)  A DAPP claimant is **_caring_** for  a child on a day in the DAPP claimant’s reference period if the child is in the DAPP claimant’s care in that period.

             (2)  A DAPP claimant’s **_reference period_** is the period that is determined by the Secretary for the purposes of making a payability determination on the DAPP claimant’s claim.

             (3)  More than one person may be caring for the same child on any particular day. This does not prevent one of the persons being the primary carer of the child under section 47.

             (4)  Despite subsection (1), a person is not **_caring_** for  a child on a day if, before that day, the child has died.

### Division 7—Not working

##### <a id="115CM"></a>115CM  When a DAPP claimant is _not working_

             (1)  A DAPP claimant is **_not working_** on a day if neither of the following apply on that day:

                     (a)  the DAPP claimant performs one hour or more of paid work, other than for a purpose that is a permissible purpose under subsection 49(2);

                     (b)  the DAPP claimant is on paid leave.

             (2)  However, the PPL rules may prescribe circumstances in which a DAPP claimant is taken to be **_not working_** even though paragraph (1)(a) or (b) applies to the claimant.

## Part 3A‑4—Claims for dad and partner pay

### Division 1—Guide to this Part

##### <a id="115DA"></a>115DA  Guide to this Part

* * *

This Part is about claims for dad and partner pay. A person cannot be paid dad and partner pay unless the person has first made a claim for it.

Division 2 sets out the rules about claims. Section 115DD sets out who can make a claim for dad and partner pay.

The Secretary cannot make a payability determination on a claim unless it is an effective claim. To be effective, the claim must be made by the right person and satisfy the requirements in the provisions listed in section 115DE. One of those requirements is that the claim must be in the form, and contain the information, required by the Secretary (see section 115DF). Another requirement is that the claim must be made in the period set out in section 115DK.

### Division 2—Payment of dad and partner pay

##### <a id="115EB"></a>115EB  Payment of dad and partner pay

                   If the Secretary makes a payability determination that dad and partner pay is payable to a person for a child, the Secretary must pay the dad and partner pay to the person as soon as practicable after making the determination (but not before the start of the person’s DAPP period).

##### <a id="115EC"></a>115EC  Amount of dad and partner pay

                   The amount of dad and partner pay to be paid to the person is the total of the daily national minimum wage amounts for each week day during the person’s DAPP period.

Note:          See subsection 65(2) for the **_daily national minimum wage amount_** for a day.

                     (b)  after the Secretary has paid the dad and partner pay, a decision is made in relation to the payability determination that has the effect that a higher amount of dad and partner pay is payable to the person;

the Secretary must pay the person the difference between the higher amount and the amount already paid to the person as soon as practicable after the decision is made.

             (2)  To avoid doubt, any difference worked out under subsection (1) is also dad and partner pay.

##### <a id="115EG"></a>115EG  Protection of payment

             (1)  A payment of dad and partner pay is absolutely inalienable, whether by way of, or in consequence of, sale, assignment, charge, execution, bankruptcy or otherwise.

Note:          Section 115EK (which deals with the effect of a garnishee etc. order) also provides a protection for an account into which dad and partner pay has been paid.

             (2)  Subsection (1) has effect subject to section 115EH.

##### <a id="115EH"></a>115EH  Deductions for PAYG withholding

                     (b)  a court order in the nature of a garnishee order comes into force in relation to the account;

the court order does not apply to the saved amount (if any) in the account.

             (2)  The **_saved amount_** is worked out as follows:

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.   Work out the total amount of dad and partner pay that has been paid to the credit of the account during the 4 week period immediately before the court order came into force.

Step 2.   Subtract from the step 1 amount the total amount withdrawn from the account during the same 4 week period: the result is the **_saved amount_**.

##### <a id="115EM"></a>115EM  DAPP period is not a period of paid leave

                   Despite any law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, or any industrial instrument (however described), a period of unpaid leave is not to be taken to be a period of paid leave just because a person receives dad and partner pay for all or part of that period.

##### <a id="168A"></a>168A  Dad and partner pay debts

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  the Secretary pays an amount (the **_Secretary payment_**) to, or in relation to, a person for a child by way of dad and partner pay; and

                     (b)  the total of Secretary payments paid for the child exceeds the total of amounts that are payable to, or in relation to, the person for the child under Part 3A‑5 (which deals with the payment of dad and partner pay by the Secretary).

Note:          Dad and partner pay may cease to be payable after it has already been paid, if the payability determination is later set aside or varied.

             (2)  An amount equal to the amount of the excess is a debt due to the Commonwealth by the person.

Example:    If no dad and partner pay is payable to, or in relation to, a person for the child, the amount of the excess is the total amount of the Secretary payments.

             (3)  The debt under subsection (2) arises:

                     (a)  if the person has a DAPP period for the child—immediately after the end of the person’s DAPP period; or

                     (b)  otherwise—when subsection (1) starts to apply in relation to a Secretary payment.

Note 1:       The person does not have a DAPP period for the child if a payability determination that dad and partner pay is payable to the person for the child has not been made, or has been set aside. In such a case, a debt will arise as soon as there is an excess as referred to in subsection (1).

Note 2:       This section may apply to overpayments by way of payments that are mistakenly paid. For example, an overpayment or mistaken payment may arise due to administrative error, the setting aside or variation of a payability determination or payments following a stay order under subsection 41(2) of the AAT Act.

then this Act (other than sections 115CB and 115CL) applies as if a reference to the DAPP claimant caring for the child were a reference to the DAPP claimant caring for the child had the child not been stillborn or died.

Note:          Section 115CB deals with eligibility for dad and partner pay and section 115CL defines when a person is caring for a child for the purposes of dad and partner pay.

## 93  At the end of subsection 277(2)
