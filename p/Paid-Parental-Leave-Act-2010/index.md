### Division 1A—Objects of this Act

##### <a id="3A"></a>3A  Objects of this Act

          (1A)  This Act establishes a paid parental leave scheme with 2 payments—parental leave pay, and dad and partner pay.

          (1B)  The objects of the paid parental leave scheme are to:

                     (a)  signal that taking time out of the paid workforce to care for a child is part of the usual course of life and work for both parents; and

                     (b)  promote equality between men and women and balance between work and family life.

             (1)  The object of parental leave pay is to provide financial support to primary carers (mainly birth mothers) of newborn and newly adopted children, in order to:

                     (a)  allow those carers to take time off work to care for the child after the child’s birth or adoption; and

                     (b)  enhance the health and development of birth mothers and children; and

                     (c)  encourage women to continue to participate in the workforce.

             (2)  The object of dad and partner pay is to provide financial support to fathers and partners caring for newborn or newly adopted children, in order to:

                     (a)  increase the time that fathers and partners take off work around the time of birth or adoption; and

                     (b)  create further opportunities for fathers and partners to bond with the child; and

                     (c)  allow fathers and partners to take a greater share of caring responsibilities and to support mothers and partners from the beginning.

             (3)  The financial support provided by this Act is intended to complement and supplement existing entitlements to paid or unpaid leave in connection with the birth or adoption of a child.

_Overview_

This Act provides for the payment of parental leave pay and dad and partner pay in the first year after the birth of a child or, for adoption, the placement of a child.

Parental leave pay is paid to a person for a particular period. That period is called the person’s PPL period. The maximum period for which any person may be paid parental leave pay is 18 weeks. A person’s PPL period may be the full 18 weeks or a lesser period (e.g. where the person is not eligible for parental leave pay for that full period).

Parental leave pay is paid in instalments at the national minimum wage for each week day during the person’s PPL period. It is paid by either the person’s employer or the Secretary.

Dad and partner pay is a one‑off payment that relates to a period of up to 2 weeks. The period is called the person’s DAPP period. The person’s DAPP period may be the full 2 weeks or a lesser period (if the person is not eligible for dad and partner pay for that full period).

Dad and partner pay is paid at the national minimum wage for each week day during the person’s DAPP period. Dad and partner pay is paid by the Secretary.

_Chapter 2—When parental leave pay is payable to a person_

Chapter 2 sets out when parental leave pay is payable to a person. The key provisions for the Chapter are found in Part 2‑1.

A person can only be paid parental leave pay if the Secretary makes a determination that parental leave pay is payable to the person. Part 2‑2 has the rules about when the Secretary can make that determination.

The Secretary cannot make that determination if the person is not eligible for parental leave pay. Part 2‑3 has the rules about eligibility. For the main case, to be eligible a person must (broadly):

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(a)   satisfy the work test, the

income test and the Australian residency test; and</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(b)   be the child’s primary

carer; and</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(c)   not have returned to work;

and</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(d)   not be entitled to baby

bonus.</li>

The Secretary also cannot make that determination if the person has not made a claim for parental leave pay. Part 2‑4 has the rules about claims.

There are 3 types of claims: a primary claim, a secondary claim and (in rare cases) a tertiary claim. These claims relate to each other, although the primary claim is the main one—a secondary or tertiary claim cannot be made without it. The primary claim will often be the only claim that is made. If a secondary or tertiary claim is made, that claim will be for the part of the maximum 18 week period (or lesser period) in which parental leave pay was not payable to the primary claimant.

_Chapter 3—Payment of parental leave pay_

Chapter 3 sets out how parental leave pay is paid to a person.

Part 3‑1 is about instalments of parental leave pay. It deals with when instalments must be paid, whether the person’s employer or the Secretary must pay them and the amount of the instalments.

Part 3‑2 sets out when a person’s employer must pay instalments to the person. The employer is only required to do that if an employer determination has come into force for the employer and the person, and the employer has been paid enough by the Secretary to fund the instalment.

Part 3‑3 sets out when the Secretary must pay instalments directly to the person. The Secretary is required to do that if an employer determination is never made for the person (e.g. the person is a contractor and so does not have an employer). There are some other circumstances in which the Secretary is also required to pay instalments directly to the person (such as when an employer determination is being reviewed or has been revoked).

Part 3‑4 has general rules about the payment of instalments (such as what happens when an instalment cannot be paid on the day specified in this Act).

Part 3‑5 is about employer determinations. If an employer determination is in force for an employer and a person, the employer must pay instalments to the person. The Secretary must be satisfied that certain conditions have been met before the Secretary can make an employer determination.

_Chapter 3A—Dad and partner pay_

Chapter 3A sets out when dad and partner pay is payable to a person. The key provisions for the Chapter are found in Part 3A‑1.

A person can only be paid dad and partner pay if the Secretary makes a determination that dad and partner pay is payable to the person. Part 3A‑2 has rules about when the Secretary can make that determination.

The Secretary cannot make that determination if the person is not eligible for dad and partner pay. Part 3A‑3 has the rules about eligibility. For the main case, to be eligible a person must (broadly):

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(a)   satisfy the work test, the

income test and the Australian residency test; and</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(b)   be caring for the child; and</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(c)   not be working.</li>

The Secretary also cannot make that determination if the person has not made a claim for dad and partner pay. Part 3A‑4 has the rules about claims.

Part 3A‑5 sets out how dad and partner pay is paid to a person. Generally, dad and partner pay is paid by the Secretary as a single payment.

_Chapter 4—Compliance and enforcement_

Chapter 4 deals with compliance and enforcement.

Part 4‑1 allows the Secretary to gather information for the purposes of checking compliance with this Act. It also deals with the confidentiality of personal and protected information.

Part 4‑2 deals with other compliance matters. It allows the Secretary to refer matters to the Fair Work Ombudsman for investigation if the Secretary has reason to believe that an employer has not complied with certain obligations under this Act. It also deals with civil penalty provisions, compliance notices and infringement notices.

Part 4‑3 provides for debts in relation to the paid parental leave scheme, and for the recovery of debts owing to the Commonwealth.

_Chapter 5—Review of decisions_

Chapter 5 is about administrative and judicial review of decisions made under this Act.

Part 5‑1 allows the Secretary, on his or her own initiative, to conduct an internal review of decisions made under this Act. It also allows a person whose interests are affected by certain types of decisions to seek internal review of those decisions, and an employer to seek internal review of certain types of decisions that affect employers.

Part 5‑2 allows a person to apply to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal for review of a decision made under this Act.

Part 5‑3 is about the procedures to be followed when the Social Security Appeals Tribunal reviews a decision.

Part 5‑4 allows the Secretary or a person whose interests are affected by a decision made by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal to apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of the decision.

Part 5‑5 has miscellaneous provisions relating to reviews of decisions under this Act.

_Chapter 6—Miscellaneous_

Chapter 6 has miscellaneous provisions.

Part 6‑1 has rules that modify this Act so that it applies correctly in 3 limited kinds of cases—adoption, claims made in exceptional circumstances etc. and Commonwealth employment.

Part 6‑2 is about payment nominees (who are people who can receive payments of instalments of parental leave pay, or a payment of dad and partner pay, on behalf of other people for the purposes of this Act) and correspondence nominees (who are people who can receive notices on behalf of other people for the purposes of this Act).

Part 6‑3 deals with other miscellaneous matters, such as the PPL rules, delegations and regulations.

# Chapter 2—When parental leave pay is payable to a person

## Part 2‑1—Key provisions

### Division 1—Guide to this Part

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Guide to this Part

* * *

This Part has the key provisions for this Chapter (which deals with when parental leave pay is payable to a person).

A person can only be paid parental leave pay if the Secretary makes a determination that parental leave pay is payable to the person. Part 2‑2 has the rules about when the Secretary can make that determination.

The Secretary cannot make that determination if the person has not made a claim for parental leave pay. Part 2‑4 has the rules about claims. There are 3 types of claims: a primary claim, a secondary claim and (in rare cases) a tertiary claim. These claims relate to each other, although the primary claim is the main one—a secondary or tertiary claim cannot be made without it. The primary claim will often be the only claim that is made.

If the Secretary makes a determination that parental leave pay is payable to a person for a child, the parental leave pay is payable for the particular period that is specified in the determination. This period is the person’s PPL period. The maximum period for which any person may be paid parental leave pay is 18 weeks. A person’s PPL period may be the full 18 weeks or a lesser period (e.g. where the person is not eligible for parental leave pay for that full period).

If a secondary or tertiary claim is made, that claim will be for the part of the maximum 18 week period (or lesser period) in which parental leave pay was not payable to the primary claimant. The person’s employer or the Secretary will pay instalments of parental leave pay for that period (see Chapter 3 for the rules about how the person is paid parental leave pay).

* * *

### Division 2—When parental leave pay is payable to a person

##### <a id="8"></a>8  A determination must be made for parental leave pay to be payable to a person

                   Parental leave pay is payable to a person for a child for a period if a determination of the Secretary that parental leave pay is payable to the person for that period is in force under section 13, 14, 15, 16 or 17.

Note:          See Part 2‑2 for the rules about when the Secretary can make a determination that parental leave pay is, or is not, payable to a person.

##### <a id="9"></a>9  For the determination to be made, the person must be eligible

                   The Secretary cannot make a determination that parental leave pay is payable to a person for a child for a period unless the person was or will be eligible for parental leave pay during the period.

Note:          See Part 2‑3 for the rules about when a person is eligible for parental leave pay.

##### <a id="10"></a>10  For the determination to be made, the person must claim

                   The Secretary cannot make a determination that parental leave pay is payable to a person for a child for a period unless the person has made:

                     (a)  an effective primary claim for the child (in which case the person is the primary claimant); or

                     (b)  an effective secondary claim for the child (in which case the person is the secondary claimant); or

                     (c)  an effective tertiary claim for the child (in which case the person is the tertiary claimant).

Note:          See Part 2‑4 for the rules about how to make an effective claim.

##### <a id="11"></a>11  The determination must specify the person’s _PPL period_

             (1)  If the Secretary makes a determination that parental leave pay is payable to a person for a child, the Secretary must specify, in the determination, the period for which parental leave pay is payable to the person. That period is the person’s **_PPL period_**.

## Part 2‑2—Determinations about whether parental leave pay is payable to a person

### Division 1—Guide to this Part

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Guide to this Part

* * *

This Part is about the Secretary making determinations about whether parental leave pay is payable to a person. These determinations are payability determinations. A person cannot be paid parental leave pay unless there is a payability determination that parental leave pay is payable to the person.

Division 2 has the rules that apply to the Secretary when making a payability determination. Different rules apply depending on the type of claim and, for a primary or secondary claim, whether it was made by itself or at the same time as another claim.

Division 3 has restrictions that apply in particular circumstances to prevent the Secretary from making a payability determination that parental leave pay is payable to a person (for example, where the child’s birth has not been verified or the person has already been paid parental leave pay for the child).

Division 4 has general rules that apply to payability determinations (for example, if the Secretary makes a determination, the Secretary must give a notice of it to the claimant).

Division 5 deals with initial eligibility determinations. These determinations can be made by the Secretary before the Secretary makes a payability determination. The Secretary can make an initial eligibility determination if the Secretary is satisfied that the person satisfies, or will satisfy, particular eligibility criteria (the work test, the income test and the Australian residency test). If the Secretary makes a determination, the Secretary must give a notice of it to the claimant.

Secondary claimants

             (2)  If a person makes an effective secondary claim, the Secretary may make a determination (the **_initial eligibility determination_**) that the person is initially eligible for parental leave pay for the child if, when making the determination, the Secretary is satisfied that the person:

                     (a)  satisfies:

                              (i)  the work test; and

                             (ii)  the income test; and

## Part 2‑3—Eligibility for parental leave pay

### Division 1—Guide to this Part

##### <a id="30"></a>30  Guide to this Part

* * *

This Part sets out when a person is eligible for parental leave pay. The Secretary cannot make a payability determination that parental leave pay is payable if the person is not eligible for it.

Division 2 sets out when a person is eligible for parental leave pay. Subsection 31(2) deals with the main case and requires that for a person to be eligible for parental leave pay for a child, the person must (broadly):

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(a)   satisfy the work test, the

income test and the Australian residency test; and</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(b)   be the child’s primary

carer; and</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(c)   not have returned to work;

and</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(d)   not be entitled to baby

bonus.</li>

There are other eligibility criteria that apply for more unusual cases—see subsection 31(3) (which deals with when a child is stillborn or dies) and subsection 31(4) (which allows the PPL rules to prescribe eligibility criteria).

Division 3 has the work test. To satisfy the work test, a person must have performed enough paid work or taken enough paid leave in a particular period before the day the child was born (for a primary claimant) or the day the person became the child’s primary carer (for a secondary claimant). Special rules apply in the case of premature birth or complications or illness related to the pregnancy (see section 36A) or if the person is already eligible for dad and partner pay (see section 36B).

Division 4 has the income test. To satisfy the income test, the person’s income for a particular income year must not be more than the PPL income limit (which is $150,000 until 30 June 2014 and then indexed. A special rule applies if the person is already eligible for dad and partner pay (see subsection 37(2)).

Division 5 has the Australian residency test. To satisfy this test, the person must be an Australian resident or be in a special class of visa holder.

Division 6 sets out when a person is the primary carer of a child. For the main case, a person will not be eligible for parental leave pay if the person is not the child’s primary carer.

Division 7 sets out when a person returns to work after the birth of a child. For the main case, a person will not be eligible for parental leave pay if the person performs more than one hour of work other than for a permissible purpose. There are 2 permissible purposes. One is where the person performs the work for another entity on a keeping in touch day with that entity. The other is where the person performs the work for a business that the person carries on and the work consists of overseeing the business or is an occasional administrative task.

                              (i)  the person and the person’s partner are not entitled to baby bonus for the child;

                             (ii)  a former partner of the person was not entitled to baby bonus for the child when he or she was the person’s partner.

             (3)  Second, a person is **_eligible_** for parental leave pay for a child on a day if:

                     (a)  the child is stillborn or has died before that day; and

                     (b)  on that day, the person would be eligible under subsection (2) for parental leave pay for the child, if paragraphs (2)(d) and (e) were disregarded; and

                     (c)  the person would have been the child’s primary carer on that day had the child not been stillborn or died.

             (4)  Third, a person is **_eligible_** for parental leave pay  for a child on a day if, on that day:

                     (a)  if the person is the primary claimant:

                              (i)  the person satisfies the work test (see Division 3); and

                             (ii)  the person satisfies the income test (see Division 4); and

                            (iii)  the person satisfies the Australian residency test (see Division 5); and

                            (iv)  the person satisfies the conditions prescribed by the PPL rules; and

                     (b)  if the person is a secondary claimant or tertiary claimant—the person satisfies the conditions prescribed by the PPL rules.

Not eligible—overlap with DAPP period

          (4A)  If there is in force a payability determination that dad and partner pay is payable to a person for a child for the person’s DAPP period, then, despite subsections (2), (3) and (4), the person is not **_eligible_** for parental leave pay for the child on a day that is in the DAPP period.

Not eligible—excess days

          (4B)  Despite subsections (2), (3) and (4), if:

                     (a)  there is in force a payability determination that dad and partner pay is payable to a person for a child for the person’s DAPP period; and

                     (b)  combined, the total days in the DAPP period and the reference period for the person’s claim for parental leave pay for the child exceed 126;

then:

                     (c)  the Secretary must exclude from the reference period the excess number of days; and

                     (d)  the person is not **_eligible_** for parental leave pay for the child on a day excluded by the Secretary.

Not eligible—claimant deceased

             (5)  Despite subsections (2), (3) and (4), a person is not **_eligible_** for parental leave pay for a child on a day if, on that day, the person is deceased.

### Division 3—The work test

##### <a id="32"></a>32  When a person satisfies the _work test_

                   To work out whether a person satisfies the **_work test_** on a day, use the following method statement:

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.   Work out the person’s work test period.

                   Note:             **_Work test period_** is defined in section 33 for primary claimants and secondary claimants and in section 115CD for DAPP claimants.

Step 2.   Work out the days in the work test period on which the person has and has not performed qualifying work.

                   Note:             **_Qualifying work_** is defined in section 34.

Step 3.   Work out whether any days on which the person has not performed qualifying work during the work test period fall within a permissible break.

                   Note:             **_Permissible break_** is defined in section 36.

Step 4.   Work out whether there is a period (a **_qualifying period_**) of 295 consecutive days in the work test period that are days:

               (a)     on which the person has performed qualifying work; or

              (b)     that fall within a permissible break.

Step 5.   If the person has performed at least 330 hours of qualifying work in a qualifying period, the person satisfies the **_work test_**.

* * *

Note 1:       A person may also satisfy the work test despite not satisfying the test in step 5, if:

(a)    the child was born prematurely; or

(b)    while the person was pregnant with the child, the person had complications or illness related to the pregnancy which prevented the person from performing paid work.

                   See sections 36A (for claimants for parental leave pay) and 115CE (for DAPP claimants).

Note 2:       Section 36B is an alternative way of satisfying the work test for a person claiming parental leave pay who is already eligible for dad and partner pay. An equivalent provision is in section 115CF for a DAPP claimant who is already eligible for parental leave pay.

##### <a id="33"></a>33  The _work test period_

Primary claimant’s work test period

             (1)  The **_work test period_** for a primary claimant is the 392 days immediately before:

                     (a)  if the child is born on or before the expected date of birth of the child—the day the child is born; or

                     (b)  if the child is born after the expected date of birth of the child—either:

                              (i)  the day the child is born; or

                             (ii)  if the person does not satisfy the work test in the work test period that applies under subparagraph (i), the expected date of birth of the child.

             (2)  However, for the purposes of making an initial eligibility determination on a primary claim that is made before the child is born, the **_work test period_** for the primary claimant is the 392 days immediately before the expected date of birth of the child.

Secondary claimant’s work test period

             (3)  The **_work test period_** for a secondary claimant is the 392 days immediately before the day the person becomes the child’s primary carer.

Note:          For the **_work test period_** for a DAPP claimant, see section 115CD.

##### <a id="34"></a>34  When a person performs _qualifying work_

             (1)  A person performs **_qualifying work_** if:

                     (a)  the person performs at least one hour of paid work on a day; or

                     (b)  the person takes a period of paid leave of at least one hour on a day.

             (2)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), the PPL rules may prescribe what is, or is not, taken to be paid leave.

##### <a id="35"></a>35  When a person performs _paid work_

People other than self‑employed

             (1)  A person performs **_paid work_** on a day if, on that day, the person performs work (whether as an employee, a contractor or otherwise and whether or not in Australia) for another entity for remuneration or other financial benefit.

             (2)  However, a person is taken not to perform **_paid work_** for the purposes of subsection (1) if the other entity is controlled by the person (whether alone or with others).

Self‑employed

             (3)  A person performs **_paid work_** on a day if, on that day, the person performs work for the purposes of a business that is carried on for profit (whether in or outside of Australia) by:

                     (a)  the person (whether alone or with others); or

                     (b)  an entity that is controlled by the person (whether alone or with others).

When a person **controls** an entity

             (4)  A person **_controls_** an entity if the person has the capacity to determine the outcome of decisions about the entity’s financial and operating policies.

PPL rules about what paid work is

             (5)  The PPL rules may prescribe what is, or is not, taken to be paid work.

##### <a id="36"></a>36  When there is a _permissible break_

             (1)  A **_permissible break_** is any of the periods in subsections (2) and (3).

Permissible break between 2 qualifying work days

             (2)  If, between a day on which the person performed qualifying work (a **_qualifying_** **_work day_**) in the work test period and the next qualifying work day, there was at least 1 day but not more than 56 consecutive days on which the person did not perform qualifying work—the day or period of consecutive days between those 2 qualifying work days is a **_permissible break_**.

Permissible break at the start of the work test period

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  a person performed qualifying work on a day (the **_earlier qualifying work day_**) before the first day in the work test period; and

                     (b)  the person next performed qualifying work on a day (the **_later qualifying work day_**) after the first day in the work test period; and

                     (c)  the later qualifying work day was no more than 56 consecutive days after the earlier qualifying work day;

then the day or period of consecutive days on which the person did not perform qualifying work between the first day in the work test period and the later qualifying work day (including the first day of the work test period) is a **_permissible break_**.

##### <a id="36A"></a>36A  Premature birth or pregnancy‑related complications or illness

                   A person also satisfies the **_work test_** on a day if:

                     (a)  the person is the birth mother of the child; and

                     (b)  the Secretary is satisfied that either or both of the following circumstances existed:

                              (i)  the child was born prematurely;

                             (ii)  while the person was pregnant with the child, the person had complications or illness related to the pregnancy which prevented the person from performing paid work; and

                     (c)  the Secretary is satisfied that the person would have satisfied the work test on the day in accordance with section 32 if that circumstance, or those circumstances, had not existed.

##### <a id="36B"></a>36B  Claimant for parental leave pay who is already eligible for dad and partner pay

                   A claimant for parental leave pay also satisfies the **_work test_** on a day if the Secretary is satisfied that the claimant is eligible for dad and partner pay for the child.

Note:          See section 115CF for an equivalent provision for a DAPP claimant.

### Division 4—The income test

#### Subdivision A—The income test

##### <a id="37"></a>37  When a person satisfies the _income test_

             (1)  A person satisfies the **_income test_** on a day if the person’s adjusted taxable income for the reference income year is not more than the relevant PPL income limit.

             (2)  A claimant for parental leave pay also satisfies the **_income test_** on a day if the Secretary is satisfied that the claimant is eligible for dad and partner pay for the child.

Note:          See subsection 115CG(2) for an equivalent provision for a DAPP claimant.

##### <a id="38"></a>38  A person’s _adjusted taxable income_

                   A person’s **_adjusted taxable income_** for an income year is worked out in accordance with Schedule 3 to the Family Assistance Act (disregarding subclause 2(2) and clauses 3 and 3A of that Schedule).

Note:          Schedule 3 to the Family Assistance Act sets out how to work out a person’s adjusted taxable income for the purposes of that Act.

##### <a id="39"></a>39  The _reference income year_

                   The **_reference income year_** for a person is:

                     (a)  if the person is a primary claimant—the income year that ended before the earlier of:

                              (i)  the day the person made the claim; and

                             (ii)  the day the child was born; and

                     (b)  if the person is a secondary claimant—the income year that ended before the earlier of:

                              (i)  the day the person made the claim; and

                             (ii)  the day the person became the child’s primary carer.

Note:          For the **_reference income year_** for a DAPP claimant, see section 115CH.

##### <a id="40"></a>40  The _relevant PPL income limit_

                   The **_relevant PPL income limit_** for a person is:

                     (a)  if the person is a primary claimant—the PPL income limit that applies on the earlier of the following days:

                              (i)  the day the person made the claim;

                             (ii)  the day the child was born; or

                     (b)  if the person is a secondary claimant—the PPL income limit that applies on the earlier of the following days:

                              (i)  the day the person made the claim;

                             (ii)  the day the person became the child’s primary carer.

Note:          For the **_relevant PPL income limit_** for a DAPP claimant, see section 115CJ.

##### <a id="41"></a>41  The _PPL income limit_

                   The **_PPL income limit_** that applies on a day is:

                     (a)  if the day is on or after 1 October 2010 but before 1 July 2014—$150,000; and

                     (b)  if the day is on or after an indexation day (the **_relevant indexation day_**) but before the next indexation day—the indexed amount on the relevant indexation day worked out under Subdivision B.

#### Subdivision B—Indexation of the PPL income limit

##### <a id="42"></a>42  Indexation of the PPL income limit

             (1)  The amount of the PPL income limit in section 41 is to be indexed under this Subdivision on 1 July each year (the **_indexation day_**) starting on 1 July 2014.

Working out the indexed amount for the PPL income limit

             (2)  This is how to work out the **_indexed amount_** for the PPL income limit on the indexation day:

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.   Work out the amount (the **_previous amount_**) for the PPL income limit that applied on the day immediately before the indexation day.

Step 2.   Use section 43 to work out the indexation factor on the indexation day.

Step 3.   Multiply the previous amount by the indexation factor: the result is the **_provisional indexed amount_**.

Step 4.   Use section 44 to round off the provisional indexed amount: the result is the **_indexed amount_**.

* * *

##### <a id="43"></a>43  The _indexation factor_

             (1)  The **_indexation factor_** is worked out using the following formula and applying subsections (2) and (3):

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00909/Html/b53895d4-8ea0-4068-a487-5effc468d285_files/image002.gif)

where:

                    <a name="base-decemb-quarter"></a>**_base December quarter_** means the December quarter that has the highest index number of the December quarters before the reference December quarter (but not earlier than the December quarter 2007).

                    <a name="index-number"></a>**_index number_**, for a quarter, means the All Groups Consumer Price Index number that is the weighted average of the 8 capital cities and is published by the Australian Statistician in relation to that quarter.

                    <a name="refer-decemb-quarter"></a>**_reference December quarter_** means the last December quarter before the indexation day.

             (2)  The indexation factor is to be worked out to 3 decimal places, but increased by 0.001 if the fourth decimal place is more than 4.

             (3)  If an indexation factor worked out under subsections (1) and (2) would be less than 1, that indexation factor is to be increased to 1.

Changes to CPI reference base and publication of substituted index numbers

             (4)  Amounts are to be worked out under this section:

                     (a)  using only the index numbers published in terms of the most recently published reference base for the Consumer Price Index; and

                     (b)  disregarding index numbers published in substitution for previously published index numbers (except where the substituted numbers are published to take account of changes in the reference base).

##### <a id="44"></a>44  Rounding off indexed amounts

             (1)  If a provisional indexed amount is a multiple of $1.00, the provisional indexed amount becomes the indexed amount.

             (2)  If a provisional indexed amount is not a multiple of $1.00, the indexed amount is the provisional indexed amount rounded up or down to the nearest multiple of $1.00.

             (3)  If a provisional indexed amount is not a multiple of $1.00 but is a multiple of $0.50, the indexed amount is the provisional indexed amount rounded up to the nearest multiple of $1.00.

### Division 5—The Australian residency test

##### <a id="45"></a>45  When a person satisfies the _Australian residency test_

             (1)  A person satisfies the **_Australian residency test_** on a day if, on that day, the person:

                     (a)  is an Australian resident; or

                     (b)  is a special category visa holder residing in Australia; or

                     (c)  satisfies subsection (2).

When a person satisfies this subsection

             (2)  A person satisfies this subsection if the person is the holder of a visa determined by the Minister for the purposes of subparagraph 729(2)(f)(v) of the Social Security Act, and either of the following applies:

                     (a)  the person is in Australia;

                     (b)  the person:

                              (i)  is temporarily absent from Australia for not more than 13 weeks; and

                             (ii)  the absence is an allowable absence in relation to special benefit within the meaning of Part 4.2 of that Act.

##### <a id="46"></a>46  Effect of absence from Australia on Australian residency test

             (1)  Despite section 45, a person does not satisfy the **_Australian residency test_** on a day (the **_relevant day_**) if:

                     (a)  before the relevant day, the person left Australia; and

                     (b)  on the relevant day, the person has been absent from Australia for more than 3 years since the day the person left Australia.

Effect of a person’s return to Australia within 3 years

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  a person who has been absent from Australia for more than 13 weeks, but not more than 3 years, returns to Australia; and

                     (b)  the person leaves Australia again less than 13 weeks later;

then the person is taken not to have returned to Australia for the purposes of subsection (1).

Effect of a person’s return to Australia after 3 years

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  a person satisfies the Australian residency test while the person is absent from Australia; and

                     (b)  the person then ceases to satisfy the Australian residency test because of the application of subsection (1) or a previous application of this subsection; and

                     (c)  the person returns to Australia; and

                     (d)  the person leaves Australia again less than 13 weeks later;

then, despite section 45, the person does not satisfy the **_Australian residency test_** at any time during:

                     (e)  the person’s return to Australia referred to in paragraph (c); or

                      (f)  the person’s absence from Australia referred to in paragraph (d).

### Division 6—Primary carer

##### <a id="47"></a>47  When a person is the _primary carer_ of a child

             (1)  A person is the **_primary carer_** of a child on a day in the person’s reference period if:

                     (a)  the child is in the person’s care in that period; and

                     (b)  the person meets the child’s physical needs more than anyone else in that period.

             (2)  A person’s **_reference period_** is the period that is determined by the Secretary for the purposes of making a payability determination on the person’s claim.

             (3)  Only one person can be a child’s primary carer on a particular day.

             (4)  Despite subsection (1), a person is not the **_primary carer_** of a child on a day if, before that day, the child has died.

### Division 7—Return to work

##### <a id="48"></a>48  When a person _returns to work_

                   A person **_returns to work_** on a day that is on or after the birth of a child if, on that day, the person performs one hour or more of paid work other than for a permissible purpose.

##### <a id="49"></a>49  When paid work is for a _permissible purpose_

**Permissible purpose**for people other than self‑employed

             (1)  If a person performs paid work on a day for another entity (see subsection 35(1)), the person does so for a **_permissible purpose_** if:

                     (a)  the person performs the work for the entity as an employee, defence force member or law enforcement officer; and

                     (b)  the day is a keeping in touch day with the entity and would otherwise be a day of leave in a period of leave granted by that entity; and

                     (c)  the person has not already performed paid work on 10 keeping in touch days (whether with the entity or another entity).

**Permissible purpose** for self‑employed

             (2)  If a person performs paid work on a day for a business in the situation referred to in subsection 35(3), the person does so for a **_permissible purpose_** if the work performed by the person consists of overseeing the business or is an occasional administrative task for the purposes of the business.

##### <a id="50"></a>50  Performing paid work on a _keeping in touch day_

                   A day on which a person performs paid work for an entity on a day that would otherwise be a day of leave in a period of leave granted by that entity is a **_keeping in touch day_** if:

                     (a)  the purpose of performing the work is to enable the person to keep in touch with his or her employment or engagement in order to facilitate a return to that employment or engagement after the end of the period of leave; and

                     (b)  both the person and the entity consent to the person performing work for the entity on that day; and

                     (c)  the day is not within:

                              (i)  if the person suggested or requested that he or she perform work for the entity on that day—14 days after the day the child was born; or

                             (ii)  otherwise—42 days after the day the child was born.

Note 1:       Performance of work on keeping in touch days is also dealt with, for the purposes of unpaid parental leave, in section 79A of the _Fair Work Act 2009_.

Note 2:       The employer will be obliged, under the relevant contract of employment or industrial instrument, to pay the employee for performing work on a keeping in touch day.

Note 3:       Section 344 of the _Fair Work Act 2009_ prohibits the exertion of undue influence or undue pressure on the person in relation to a decision by the person whether to consent to performing work on keeping in touch days: see subsection 79A(3) of that Act.

Note 4:       That section, and section 343 of that Act, contain other prohibitions on coercion and undue influence or pressure.

## Part 2‑4—Claims for parental leave pay

### Division 1—Guide to this Part

##### <a id="51"></a>51  Guide to this Part

* * *

This Part is about claims for parental leave pay. A person cannot be paid parental leave pay unless the person has first made a claim for it.

Division 2 sets out the rules about claims. There are 3 types of claims: a primary claim, a secondary claim and (in rare cases) a tertiary claim. These claims relate to each other, although the primary claim is the main one—a secondary or tertiary claim cannot be made without it. However, it will often be the only claim that is made. Section 54 sets out who can make a primary claim, a secondary claim or a tertiary claim.

The Secretary cannot make a payability determination on a claim unless it is an effective claim. To be effective, the claim must be made by the right person and satisfy the requirements in the provisions listed in section 55\. One of those requirements is that the claim must be in the form, and contain the information, required by the Secretary (see section 56). Another requirement is that the claim must be made in the period set out in section 60.

* * *

### Division 2—Claims for parental leave pay

##### <a id="55"></a>55  When a claim is effective

             (1)  A claim for parental leave pay is not effective unless the requirements of the following provisions that apply to the claim are satisfied:

                   A claim for parental leave pay must be made in the period that:

                     (a)  starts on the day that is 97 days before the expected date of birth of the child; and

The Secretary is also required to pay instalments directly to a person in certain circumstances where an employer determination is being reviewed or has been revoked, or where a matter has been referred to the Fair Work Ombudsman relating to a failure by an employer to pay an instalment to a person.

In certain circumstances where the Secretary becomes required to pay instalments to a person, the Secretary is also required to pay the person arrears for instalments that had previously become payable, but not been paid, to the person.

## Part 3‑4—General rules relevant to paying instalments

### Division 1—Guide to this Part

##### <a id="90"></a>90  Guide to this Part

* * *

This Part contains general rules that are relevant to the payment of instalments to a person, whether by the person’s employer or the Secretary.

Some of those rules deem instalments to have become payable in certain circumstances (such as when an employer or the Secretary becomes required to pay instalments to a person after the person’s PPL period has already started).

Other rules deal with the effect on a person’s instalment periods of changing who is required to pay instalments to the person.

There are also rules that relate to what happens when an instalment cannot be paid on the day specified in this Act.

Finally, this Part deals with the interaction of this Chapter with certain Commonwealth, State and Territory laws.

* * *

### Division 2—General rules relevant to paying instalments

##### <a id="91"></a>91  Effect of the Secretary or employer becoming required to pay instalments after start of PPL period

                   If:

                     (a)  the Secretary or a person’s employer (the **_payer_**) becomes required to pay an instalment to the person after the start of the person’s PPL period; and

                     (b)  neither the Secretary nor the employer is otherwise required to pay an earlier instalment to the person; and

                     (c)  one or more instalments would have been payable to the person on the paydays for the instalments if the payer had been required to pay instalments from the start of the person’s PPL period;

then the instalments referred to in paragraph (c) are taken to have become payable on the respective paydays for the instalments.

##### <a id="92"></a>92  Effect of extending PPL period after review

                   If:

                     (a)  a person’s PPL period ends; and

                     (b)  later, a decision in relation to a payability determination for the person is made that has the effect that the person’s PPL period is extended by an additional period; and

                     (c)  one or more instalments that relate to instalment periods that overlap with the additional period would have been payable to the person on the paydays for the instalments if:

                              (i)  the payability determination had always specified the extended PPL period; and

                             (ii)  the Secretary had been required to pay the instalments; and

                     (d)  the Secretary is not otherwise required to pay the instalments;

then the instalments referred to in paragraph (c) are taken to have become payable on the respective paydays for the instalments.

##### <a id="93"></a>93  Effect on instalment periods of employer determination coming into force after review

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  the Secretary is required to pay an instalment to a person under subsection 84(3) (which deals with payment of instalments where an employer determination is reviewed); and

                     (b)  the employer determination comes into force for the person and the person’s employer on the transfer day referred to in that subsection.

             (2)  The instalment period for the person for the last instalment payable by the Secretary is taken to end on the day before the transfer day.

             (3)  The instalment period for the person for the first instalment payable by the employer is taken to start on the transfer day.

Note:          Subsection (3) does not affect when the instalment period ends.

##### <a id="94"></a>94  Effect on instalment periods of revocation etc.

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  an employer determination has come into force for a person and the person’s employer; and

                     (b)  the Secretary becomes required to pay an instalment to the person under either of the following subsections for an instalment period that starts on or after the transfer day referred to in that subsection:

                              (i)  subsection 84(4) (which deals with payment of instalments where an employer determination is revoked);

                             (ii)  subsection 84(5) (which deals with payment of instalments where a matter is referred to the Fair Work Ombudsman relating to a failure to pay an instalment).

             (2)  The instalment period for the person for the last instalment payable by the employer is taken to end on the day before the transfer day.

             (3)  The instalment period for the person for the first instalment payable by the Secretary is taken to start on the transfer day.

Note:          Subsection (3) does not affect when the instalment period ends.

##### <a id="95"></a>95  Paying instalment on payday for later instalment—no later instalment

                   If:

                     (a)  the Secretary or a person’s employer (the **_payer_**) is required to pay an instalment to the person on the payday for an instalment for a later instalment period; and

                     (b)  that later instalment is not payable by the payer;

the payer must pay the instalment referred to in paragraph (a) on the day that would have been the payday for the later instalment if it had been payable by the payer.

##### <a id="96"></a>96  Paying instalment on particular day—complying with obligation

                   The Secretary or a person’s employer (the **_payer_**) is taken to have complied with a requirement to pay an instalment on a particular day if the payer pays the instalment:

                     (a)  before that day; or

                     (b)  if the payer cannot pay the instalment on that day—as soon as practicable after that day.

##### <a id="97"></a>97  Effect of garnishee etc. order

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  an instalment is being paid, or has been paid, to the credit of an account; and

                     (b)  a court order in the nature of a garnishee order comes into force in relation to the account;

the court order does not apply to the saved amount (if any) in the account.

             (2)  The **_saved amount_** is worked out as follows:

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.   Work out the total amount of the instalments that have been paid to the credit of the account during the 4 week period immediately before the court order came into force.

Step 2.   Subtract from the step 1 amount the total amount withdrawn from the account during the same 4 week period: the result is the **_saved amount_**.

* * *

##### <a id="98"></a>98  Exemption from operation of workers’ compensation and accident compensation laws

             (1)  The payment of an instalment of parental leave pay is not to be taken into account for the purposes of the following provisions or laws:

                     (a)  a provision of a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, if the provision deals with:

                              (i)  workers’ compensation; or

                             (ii)  accident compensation;

                     (b)  a law, or a provision of a law, prescribed by the PPL rules, to the extent that the law or provision deals with a matter referred to in paragraph (a).

             (2)  The PPL rules may provide that subsection (1) does not apply in relation to a prescribed provision of a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory.

##### <a id="99"></a>99  PPL period is not a period of paid leave

                   Despite any law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, or any industrial instrument (however described), a period of unpaid leave is not to be taken to be a period of paid leave just because a person receives instalments of parental leave pay for all or part of that period.

##### <a id="99A"></a>99A  Payment of paid parental leave does not affect other employer obligations

                   An obligation of an employer to pay a person parental leave pay under this Act is in addition to any other obligation the employer may have in relation to the person, however that other obligation might arise (including, for example, under another law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, or an industrial instrument (however described)).

## Part 3‑5—Employer determinations

### Division 1—Guide to this Part

##### <a id="100"></a>100  Guide to this Part

* * *

This Part is about employer determinations. If an employer determination is in force for an employer and a person, the employer must pay instalments to the person.

Under Division 2, the Secretary must make an employer determination if the Secretary is satisfied that certain conditions have been met. Not all of those conditions need to be satisfied for a person if the employer has made an election under Division 4 that applies to the person and the person consents to the employer paying the instalments.

If the Secretary makes an employer determination for a person and the person’s employer, the employer must either:

               (a)     give the Secretary certain information to enable the Secretary to pay the employer PPL funding amounts for the person; or

              (b)     apply for review of the employer determination under Part 5‑1 or 5‑2.

Division 3 is about when an employer determination is in force. It includes rules about revoking employer determinations.

Under Division 4, an employer may elect to pay instalments to one or more employees.

Division 5 provides for the Secretary to give an employer for whom an employer determination has been made notice of certain other decisions under this Act.

##### <a id="101"></a>101  Making employer determinations

When Secretary must make employer determination

             (1)  The Secretary must make a determination under this section (the **_employer determination_**) that a person’s employer is to pay the person instalments if the Secretary is satisfied, when making the determination, that:

                     (a)  a payability determination that parental leave pay is payable to the person, or an initial eligibility determination for the person, is in force; and

                     (b)  instalments are likely, if the determination is made, to be payable by the employer to the person for at least 40 consecutive PPL days that are week days; and

                     (c)  the person has, or will have, been employed by the employer for at least 12 months immediately before:

                              (i)  if the person’s claim was made before the birth of the person’s child—the expected date of birth of the child; or

                             (ii)  if the person’s claim was made after the birth of the person’s child—the later of the expected date of birth of the child and the day the child was born; and

                             (ii)  otherwise—the period of days for which instalments are likely, if the determination is made, to be payable to the person by the employer; and

                     (e)  the employer has an ABN; and

                      (f)  if paragraphs (c) to (e) are satisfied in relation to more than one employer of the person (other than because of subsection (2))—the person nominated the employer in the claim as the employer who would be required to pay instalments to the person.

Effect of election by employer to pay instalments

             (2)  Paragraphs (1)(b) and (c) do not apply in relation to a person if:

                     (a)  the person’s employer has made an election under section 109 that applies to the person; and

                     (b)  the person has consented in the claim to the employer paying instalments to the person.

When must employer determination be made

             (3)  The Secretary must not make an employer determination for a person and the person’s employer unless:

                     (a)  the Secretary is satisfied as referred to in subsection (1); and

                     (b)  the employer determination is made on or before the day on which the payability determination referred to in paragraph (1)(a) is made.

When Secretary may decide not to make employer determination

             (4)  Despite subsection (1), the Secretary may decide not to make an employer determination for a person and the person’s employer if the Secretary is satisfied of all or any of the following:

                     (a)  the person’s PPL period has ended;

                     (b)  the person is a tertiary claimant;

                     (c)  the child in relation to whom parental leave pay is payable to the person is stillborn or has died;

                     (d)  both of the following apply:

                              (i)  a primary claimant owes a debt to the Commonwealth in relation to amounts paid to, or in relation to, the primary claimant by way of instalments for a child;

                             (ii)  the person is a secondary claimant for parental leave pay for the same child;

                     (e)  the employer is not a fit and proper person.

Matters relevant to whether employer is a fit and proper person

             (5)  The Secretary may take into account the following matters in determining whether an employer is a fit and proper person:

                     (a)  whether the employer is insolvent;

                     (b)  whether the employer has, or is alleged to have, contravened a civil penalty provision of this Act;

                     (c)  whether a matter relating to a contravention of section 70 or Part 3‑2 (which deal with unauthorised deductions and payment of instalments by an employer) by the employer has been referred to the Fair Work Ombudsman under section 143;

                     (d)  subject to Part VIIC of the _Crimes Act 1914_, whether the employer has, or is alleged to have, contravened a provision of an industrial law (within the meaning of the Fair Work Act);

                     (e)  subject to Part VIIC of the _Crimes Act 1914_, whether the employer has been convicted of an offence against this Act, or a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory that involves:

                              (i)  fraud or dishonesty; or

                             (ii)  the misapplication of money; or

                            (iii)  the management of the affairs of a body (whether or not incorporated);

                      (f)  any other matter the Secretary considers relevant.

Note:          Part VIIC of the _Crimes Act 1914_ includes provisions that, in certain circumstances, relieve persons from the requirement to disclose spent convictions and require persons aware of such convictions to disregard them.

Secretary may assume state of affairs will not change

             (6)  In deciding whether to make a determination under this section, the Secretary may act on the assumption that the state of affairs known to the Secretary when making the determination will remain unchanged.

##### <a id="102"></a>102  Secretary must give notice of employer determination

             (1)  If the Secretary makes an employer determination for a person and the person’s employer, the Secretary must give the employer and the person a written notice advising them that the determination has been made.

# Chapter 3A—Dad and partner pay

## Part 3A‑1—Key provisions

### Division 1—Guide to this Part

##### <a id="115AA"></a>115AA  Guide to this Part

* * *

This Part has the key provisions for this Chapter (which deals with dad and partner pay).

A person can only be paid dad and partner pay if the Secretary makes a determination that dad and partner pay is payable to the person. Part 3A‑2 has the rules about when the Secretary can make that determination.

The Secretary cannot make that determination if the person has not made a claim for dad and partner pay.

If the Secretary makes a determination that dad and partner pay is payable to a person for a child, the amount of dad and partner pay is worked out by reference to the period for which the person is eligible for dad and partner pay. This period is the person’s DAPP period. The maximum period for which any person may be eligible for dad and partner pay is 2 weeks. A person’s DAPP period may be the full 2 weeks or a lesser period (if the person is not eligible for dad and partner pay for that full period).

Generally, dad and partner pay is paid by the Secretary as a single payment.

* * *

### Division 2—When dad and partner pay is payable to a person

##### <a id="115AB"></a>115AB  A determination must be made for dad and partner pay to be payable to a person

                   Dad and partner pay is payable to a person for a child for a period if a determination of the Secretary that dad and partner pay is payable to the person for that period is in force under section 115BB.

Note:          See Part 3A‑2 for the rules about when the Secretary can make a determination that dad and partner pay is, or is not, payable to a person.

##### <a id="115AC"></a>115AC  For the determination to be made, the person must be eligible

                   The Secretary cannot make a determination that dad and partner pay is payable to a person for a child for a period unless the person was or will be eligible for dad and partner pay during the period.

Note:          See Part 3A‑3 for the rules about when a person is eligible for dad and partner pay.

##### <a id="115AD"></a>115AD  For the determination to be made, the person must claim

                   The Secretary cannot make a determination that dad and partner pay is payable to a person for a child for a period unless the person has made an effective claim for the child.

Note:          See Part 3A‑4 for the rules about how to make an effective claim.

##### <a id="115AE"></a>115AE  The determination must specify the person’s _DAPP period_

             (1)  If the Secretary makes a determination that dad and partner pay is payable to a person for a child, the Secretary must specify, in the determination, the period for which dad and partner pay is payable to the person. That period is the person’s **_DAPP period_**.

Note:          For a DAPP claimant’s DAPP period, see subsection 115BB(3).

             (2)  A person’s DAPP period must be the same as, or within, the maximum DAPP period for the child.

             (3)  The **_maximum DAPP period_** for a child is the period that:

                     (a)  starts on the child’s maximum DAPP period start day; and

                     (b)  ends on the child’s maximum DAPP period end day.

             (4)  The **_maximum DAPP period start day_** for a child is the later of the following days:

                     (a)  the day the child was born;

                     (b)  the claimant’s nominated start date.

             (5)  The **_maximum DAPP period end day_** for a child is the earlier of the following days:

                     (a)  the day that is 13 days after the maximum DAPP period start day;

                     (b)  the day before the child’s first birthday.

## Part 3A‑2—Determinations about whether dad and partner pay is payable to a person

### Division 1—Guide to this Part

##### <a id="115BA"></a>115BA  Guide to this Part

* * *

This Part is about the Secretary making determinations about whether dad and partner pay is payable to a person. These determinations are payability determinations. A person cannot be paid dad and partner pay unless there is a payability determination that dad and partner pay is payable to the person.

Division 2 has the rules that apply to the Secretary when making a payability determination.

Division 3 has restrictions that apply in particular circumstances to prevent the Secretary from making a payability determination that dad and partner pay is payable to a person (for example, where the child’s birth has not been verified or the person has already been paid dad and partner pay for the child).

Division 4 has general rules that apply to payability determinations (for example, if the Secretary makes a determination, the Secretary must give a notice of it to the claimant).

Division 5 deals with initial eligibility determinations. These determinations can be made by the Secretary before the Secretary makes a payability determination. The Secretary can make an initial eligibility determination if the Secretary is satisfied that the person satisfies, or will satisfy, particular eligibility criteria (the work test, the income test and the Australian residency test). If the Secretary makes a determination, the Secretary must give a notice of it to the claimant.

                              (i)  if the Secretary is satisfied that the DAPP claimant was or will be eligible for dad and partner pay on each day in the child’s maximum DAPP period—the child’s maximum DAPP period end day; or

                             (ii)  if the Secretary is satisfied that the DAPP claimant was or will be eligible for a period that is shorter than the child’s maximum DAPP period—the last day in the child’s maximum DAPP period that the DAPP claimant was or will be eligible for dad and partner pay.

When dad and partner pay is not payable to DAPP claimant

             (4)  The Secretary must determine that dad and partner pay is not payable to the DAPP claimant if the Secretary is not satisfied of the matters in subsection (2).

### Division 5—Initial eligibility determinations about dad and partner pay

##### <a id="115BL"></a>115BL  Initial eligibility determinations

                   If a person makes an effective claim for dad and partner pay, the Secretary may make a determination (the **_initial eligibility determination_**) that the person is initially eligible for dad and partner pay for the child if, when making the determination, the Secretary is satisfied that the person:

                     (a)  satisfies:

                              (i)  the work test; and

                   If the Secretary makes an initial eligibility determination about dad and partner pay, the Secretary must give a notice of the determination to the DAPP claimant.

## Part 3A‑3—Eligibility for dad and partner pay

### Division 1—Guide to this Part

##### <a id="115CA"></a>115CA  Guide to this Part

* * *

This Part sets out when a person is eligible for dad and partner pay. The Secretary cannot make a payability determination that dad and partner pay is payable if the person is not eligible for it.

Division 2 sets out when a person is eligible for dad and partner pay. Subsection 115CB(2) deals with the main case and requires that for a person to be eligible for dad and partner pay for a child, the person must (broadly):

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(a)   satisfy the work test, the

income test and the Australian residency test; and</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(b)   be caring for the child; and</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(c)   not be working.</li>

There are other eligibility criteria that apply for more unusual cases—see subsection 115CB(3) (which deals with when a child is stillborn or dies) and subsection 115CB(4) (which allows the PPL rules to prescribe eligibility criteria).

The work test is mostly in Division 3 of Part 2‑3, but Division 3 of this Part has provisions relevant to DAPP claimants. To satisfy the work test, a person must have performed enough paid work or taken enough paid leave in a particular period before the person’s nominated start date for dad and partner pay. Special rules apply in the case of premature birth or complications or illness related to the pregnancy (see section 115CE) or if the person is already eligible for parental leave pay (see section 115CF).

The income test is mostly in Division 4 of Part 2‑3, but Division 4 of this Part has provisions relevant to DAPP claimants. To satisfy the income test, the person’s income for a particular income year must not be more than the PPL income limit (which is $150,000 until 30 June 2014 and then indexed). A special rule applies if the person is already eligible for parental leave pay (see subsection 115CG(2)).

The Australian residency test is in Division 5 of Part 2‑3\. To satisfy this test, the person must be an Australian resident or be in a special class of visa holder.

Division 6 of this Part sets out when a person is caring for a child. For the main case, a person will not be eligible for dad and partner pay if the person is not caring for the child.

Division 7 of this Part sets out when a person is not working. For the main case, a person will not be eligible for dad and partner pay if the person performs one hour or more of work other than for a purpose of performing the work for a business that the person carries on and that consists of overseeing the business or is an occasional administrative task.

### Division 2—When a DAPP claimant is eligible for dad and partner pay

##### <a id="115CB"></a>115CB  When a DAPP claimant is _eligible_ for dad and partner pay

             (1)  This section sets out when a DAPP claimant is eligible for dad and partner pay for a child on a day.

             (1)  To work out whether a DAPP claimant satisfies the income test in subsection 37(1) on a day, use the income test in subsection 37(1) with the reference income year  in section 115CH and the relevant PPL income limit in section 115CJ.

             (2)  A DAPP claimant also satisfies the **_income test_** on a day if the Secretary is satisfied that the DAPP claimant is eligible for parental leave pay for the child.

##### <a id="115CH"></a>115CH  The _reference income year_

                     (b)  after the Secretary has paid the dad and partner pay, a decision is made in relation to the payability determination that has the effect that a higher amount of dad and partner pay is payable to the person;

the Secretary must pay the person the difference between the higher amount and the amount already paid to the person as soon as practicable after the decision is made.

                     (b)  a court order in the nature of a garnishee order comes into force in relation to the account;

the court order does not apply to the saved amount (if any) in the account.

             (2)  The **_saved amount_** is worked out as follows:

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.   Work out the total amount of dad and partner pay that has been paid to the credit of the account during the 4 week period immediately before the court order came into force.

Step 2.   Subtract from the step 1 amount the total amount withdrawn from the account during the same 4 week period: the result is the **_saved amount_**.

* * *

##### <a id="115EL"></a>115EL  Exemption from operation of workers’ compensation and accident compensation laws
