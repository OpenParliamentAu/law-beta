there is payable on that day, on account of levy that may become so payable, an amount equal to the amount of levy that may become so payable.

             (3)  Where:

##### <a id="10"></a>10  Recovery of levy and amounts on account of levy

             (1)  Levy that has become payable, or an amount that, under section 8, is payable on account of levy, is a debt due to the Commonwealth by the person or persons by whom the levy or the amount is payable.

             (2)  In proceedings to recover levy in respect of a ship for a quarter, it shall be presumed, unless the contrary is established by the defendant:

                     (a)  that, at some time when the ship was in an Australian port during the quarter, there was on board the ship a quantity of oil in bulk weighing not less than 10 tonnes; and

             (2)  If payment of the levy is not made before the expiration of the period of 3 days after the distress, the Collector may, at any time while the levy remains unpaid, sell by public auction the goods or equipment distrained and, out of the proceeds of the sale, may, to the extent that the amount of those proceeds allows, recover the levy and all reasonable expenses incurred by him under this section.

             (3)  For the purposes of a sale under subsection (2), the Commonwealth shall be deemed to be the absolute owner of the goods or equipment the subject of the sale.

             (4)  Where, after deducting from the proceeds of the sale the amount of the levy and the expenses of the Collector, a surplus remains, the Collector shall, on demand, pay that surplus to the owner or master of the ship.

             (5)  A reference in this section to levy payable in respect of a ship shall be read as including a reference to an amount that, under section 8, is payable on account of levy that may become payable in respect of the ship.

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Detention of ship for unpaid levy

             (1)  A ship in respect of which levy is payable may be detained by a Collector until the levy is paid.

             (2)  If a ship that has been detained by a Collector under subsection (1) goes to sea without having been released by the Collector, the master of the ship is guilty of an offence punishable, upon conviction, by a fine not exceeding $500.
