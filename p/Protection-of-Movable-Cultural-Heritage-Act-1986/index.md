	(a)	after having considered the terms of the information prepared in accordance with subsection (1); and
	(b)	after having received such further information (if any) as the Magistrate requires concerning the grounds on which the issue of the warrant is being sought;
that there are reasonable grounds for issuing the warrant, the Magistrate shall complete and sign such a search warrant as the Magistrate would issue under section 30 if the application had been made to the Magistrate in accordance with that section.
	(4)	Where a Magistrate signs a warrant under subsection (3):
	(a)	the Magistrate shall inform the inspector of the terms of the warrant and the date on which and the time at which it was signed, and record on the warrant the reasons for granting the warrant; and
	(b)	the inspector shall complete a form of warrant in the terms furnished by the Magistrate and write on it the name of the Magistrate and the date on which and the time at which the warrant was signed.
	(5)	Where an inspector completes a form of warrant in accordance with subsection (4), the inspector shall, not later than the day next following the date of expiry of the warrant, forward to the Magistrate who signed the warrant the form of warrant completed by the inspector and the information duly sworn in connection with the warrant.
	(6)	Upon receipt of the documents referred to in subsection (5), the Magistrate shall attach to them the warrant signed by the Magistrate and deal with the documents in the manner in which the Magistrate would have dealt with the information if the application for the warrant had been made in accordance with section 30.

32  Searches in emergencies
	(1)	An inspector may:
	(a)	search a person, or the clothing that is being worn by, and property in the immediate control of, a person, suspected by the inspector to be carrying any thing that is forfeited or connected with an offence against this Act; or
	(b)	enter upon any land, or upon or into any premises, structure, vessel, aircraft or vehicle, on or in which the inspector believes on reasonable grounds that any thing forfeited or connected with an offence against this Act is situated;
and may seize any such thing found in the course of that search, or upon the land or in the premises, structure, vessel, aircraft or vehicle, as the case may be, if:
	(c)	the inspector believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary to do so in order to prevent the exportation or importation of that thing or the concealment, loss or destruction of any thing forfeited or connected with an offence against this Act; and

	(b)	the person:
	(i)	refuses or fails to comply with the request; or
	(ii)	whether or not in compliance, or purported compliance, with the request, states as his or her full name or usual place of residence a name or a place, as the case may be, that the inspector believes on reasonable grounds to be false or misleading in a material particular;
the inspector shall be taken, for the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), to have reasonable grounds for believing that proceedings against the person by summons in respect of the offence will not be effective.
