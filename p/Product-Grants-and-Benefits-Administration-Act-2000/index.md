                            (iii)  compliance with any such prescribed Code of Practice; and

                     (c)  satisfy any prescribed conditions.

Specific requirement for energy grants

             (4)  The specific requirement in relation to registration for the energy grant is that you notify the Commissioner that you are purchasing or importing, or propose to purchase or import, energy grants scheme fuel into Australia for a particular use or uses that, when you become registered, will entitle you to the grant in respect of the fuel.

Specific requirement for cleaner fuel grants

                      (f)  are a person covered by paragraph (b) of the definition of **_licensed person_** in the _Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme Act 2004_ for a cleaner fuel.

the Commissioner may cancel that registration.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  the Commissioner registers you for entitlement to a grant or benefit; and

                     (b)  after doing so, the Commissioner becomes satisfied that:

                              (i)  you did not, at the time you were registered, satisfy one or more of the requirements in section 9 for registration for entitlement to that grant or benefit; or

                             (ii)  you have ceased to satisfy one or more of those requirements;

the Commissioner may cancel that registration with effect from the time it took place or the time you ceased to satisfy the one or more requirements, as the case requires.

             (3)  The Commissioner must cancel your registration if you ask the Commissioner to do so.

             (4)  This section does not prevent you applying for fresh registration.

## Part 4—Payment of grants and benefits

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Claim periods

             (1)  You may, subject to any determination by the Commissioner under subsection (2), make a claim under section 15 for any period (the **_claim period_**) that is specified in the claim.

             (2)  The Commissioner may, in writing, determine any one or more of the matters set out in subsection (3) in relation to:

                     (b)  claims for particular grants or benefits; or

                     (c)  claims by particular kinds of entities; or

                     (d)  any combination of the above.

             (3)  The matters are:

                     (a)  the minimum period that may be covered by a claim;

                     (b)  the maximum period that may be covered by a claim;

                     (c)  the minimum amount of money in respect of which a claim may be made;

                     (d)  the minimum volume or quantity of goods in respect of which a claim may be made;

                     (e)  any other requirement to be complied with in making a claim.

##### <a id="13"></a>13  Advances on account of grants or benefits

             (1)  The Commissioner may, on behalf of the Commonwealth, make an advance on account of a grant or benefit that may become payable.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  you receive an advance on account of a grant or benefit that may become payable; and

                     (b)  the amount of the advance is greater than the amount of the grant or benefit;

you are liable to repay the amount of the excess to the Commonwealth.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  you receive an advance on account of a grant or benefit that may become payable; and

                     (b)  you do not make a claim for payment of the grant or benefit within 28 days after the end of the claim period concerned;

you are liable to repay the amount of the advance to the Commonwealth.

             (4)  An amount that you are liable to repay under this section is due and payable:

                     (a)  if subsection (2) applies—at the time that you make the claim for the grant or benefit in respect of which the advance was made; or

                     (b)  if subsection (3) applies—at the end of the period of 28 days referred to in that subsection.

             (5)  The Commissioner must not make an advance to an entity unless the entity has requested the Commissioner to make the advance. The amount of the advance must not exceed the amount requested by the entity.

##### <a id="14"></a>14  Guidelines for making advances

             (1)  The Commissioner may, by writing, formulate guidelines to be complied with by him or her in deciding whether to make advances under section 13.

          (1A)  Without limiting subsection (1), guidelines under that subsection may provide that the Commissioner is not to make any advances at all in respect of payments of grants or benefits described in one or more specified items, or all of the items, in the table in section 8.

             (2)  In deciding whether to make advances under section 13, the Commissioner must comply with any relevant guidelines under subsection (1).

##### <a id="15"></a>15  Claims for grants or benefits

             (1)  Despite the provisions of Part 3 and the entitlement Acts, you are not entitled to a grant or benefit unless you make a claim for payment of the grant or benefit in respect of a claim period during which the entitlement (ignoring this subsection) arose.

             (2)  The claim:

                     (a)  may relate to all the goods in respect of which you are entitled to a grant or benefit for the claim period in question; and

                     (b)  must be in the approved form; and

                     (c)  must include such information as is specified in the regulations; and

                     (d)  must be signed by you, unless it is transmitted to the Commissioner in an electronic format approved by the Commissioner and contains your electronic signature; and

                   (da)  if the claim is for payment of an energy grant in respect of an on‑road credit for on‑road alternative fuel—must be given to the Commissioner before the earlier of:

                              (i)  1 July 2011; and

                             (ii)  the end of 3 years after the start of the claim period; and

                     (e)  otherwise—must be given to the Commissioner before the end of 3 years after the start of the claim period.

          (2A)  Despite the provisions of Part 3 and the _Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme Act 2003_, you are not entitled to an energy grant for an on‑road credit for on‑road alternative fuel if you have already given the Commissioner a return under the _Fuel Tax Act 2006_ that includes a net fuel amount that takes into account a decreasing fuel tax adjustment that relates to the fuel.

             (3)  Section 9 does not, by implication, limit subsection (2) of this section.

             (4)  In this section:

                    <a name="decreas-fuel-tax-adjust"></a>**_decreasing fuel tax adjustment_** has the meaning given by section 110‑5 of the _Fuel Tax Act 2006._

                    <a name="net-fuel-amount"></a>**_net fuel amount_** has the meaning given by section 110‑5 of the _Fuel Tax Act 2006._

                    <a name="road-altern-fuel"></a>**_on‑road alternative fuel_** has the meaning given by section 4 of the _Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme Act 2003_.

##### <a id="15A"></a>15A  Authority for third party to make claim under section 15

             (1)  You may apply in writing to the Commissioner for permission to authorise third parties to make claims under section 15 on your behalf.

             (2)  An application under subsection (1) must be in the approved form.

             (3)  If the Commissioner accepts your application:

                     (a)  that acceptance may be subject to such terms and conditions (including any limitations on the kinds of third parties in respect of whom an authorisation may be given) as the Commissioner determines to be appropriate; and

                     (b)  when informing you of that acceptance, the Commissioner must notify those terms and conditions to you.

             (4)  If the Commissioner rejects your application, the Commissioner must notify you of the rejection and specify the reasons why the application was rejected.

             (5)  If the Commissioner accepts your application, you may, subject to any terms or conditions to which the acceptance is subject, authorise in writing a third party or third parties:

             (6)  If a third party makes, or purports to make, a claim on your behalf under such an authority, the claim is to be treated, for all purposes of this Act, as a claim made by you under section 15.

             (7)  You may, at any time, revoke in writing an authorisation of a third party given under subsection (5).

             (8)  If you revoke an authorisation:

Note:          Under section 5, **_assessment_** includes a nil assessment.

##### <a id="18"></a>18  Reliance by Commissioner on claim

             (1)  If you make a claim for a grant or benefit in respect of a claim period, the Commissioner may, for the purposes of making an assessment, accept (either in whole or in part):

                     (a)  a statement in the claim; and

                     (b)  any other statement otherwise made by you or on your behalf.

             (2)  In determining whether an assessment is correct, any determination, opinion or judgment of the Commissioner made, held or formed in connection with the consideration of an objection against the assessment is taken to have been made, held or formed when the assessment was made.

##### <a id="19"></a>19  Commissioner must give you notice of an assessment

             (1)  Except where the assessment is that you are entitled to the full amount of the grant or benefit claimed, the Commissioner must give you notice of an assessment as soon as practicable after the assessment is made. However, failing to do so does not affect the validity of the assessment.

             (2)  The Commissioner may give you the notice electronically if you transmitted the relevant claim to the Commissioner in an electronic format.

             (3)  In all cases, the Commissioner may give you the notice in any other manner or form.

##### <a id="20"></a>20  Amendment of assessment

             (1)  The Commissioner may at any time amend an assessment under this Part.

             (2)  An amended assessment is an assessment for all purposes of this Act.

             (3)  If, as a result of an amended assessment, you are liable to pay an amount to the Commissioner, the amount is taken to have become due and payable at the time that the original assessment was made.

                     (b)  such further period as the Commissioner allows.

##### <a id="22"></a>22  Production of assessment is conclusive evidence

                   If the Commissioner gives you a notice of assessment under this Part, the production of the notice is conclusive evidence:

                     (a)  that the assessment was properly made; and

                     (b)  except in proceedings under Part IVC of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ on a review or appeal relating to the assessment—that the amounts and particulars in the assessment are correct.

##### <a id="23"></a>23  Payment of grants or benefits

             (1)  If you are entitled to a grant or benefit in respect of a claim period:

                     (a)  the grant or benefit is a debt due to you by the Commissioner on behalf of the Commonwealth; and

                     (b)  you may recover the grant or benefit by action in a court of competent jurisdiction.

             (2)  Grant or benefits are payable by the Commonwealth in the manner determined by the Commissioner.

##### <a id="24"></a>24  Recovery by set‑off

                   If an entity is liable to pay a scheme debt, the scheme debt may be deducted from one or more grants or benefits that are payable to the entity, and if the scheme debt is so deducted, the grant or benefit is taken to have been paid in full to the entity.

##### <a id="24A"></a>24A  Interest on underpaid grants or benefits

             (1)  Interest is payable by the Commissioner to a person in respect of an amount of grant or benefit that becomes payable to the person if:

                     (a)  the amount relates to a grant or benefit for a claim period; and

                     (b)  the amount is payable as a result of a decision to which this section applies (the **_review decision_**).

             (2)  The interest is to be calculated for the period (the **_interest period_**):

                     (a)  starting on the day on which the original assessment in relation to the grant or benefit was made; and

                     (b)  ending on the day on which the amount is paid or applied by the Commissioner.

             (3)  The following method statement shows how to work out the interest (which is calculated on a daily basis):

* * *

_Calculating the interest payable_

Step 1\. Work out the amount that is determined by the review decision to be the amount of the grant or benefit payable in relation to the claim period.

Step 2\. For each day in the interest period, work out the amount of the grant or benefit that had been paid or applied by the Commissioner on or before that day (reduced by any amounts repaid before that day by the person).

Step 3\. For each day in the interest period, subtract the amount worked out in step 2 from the amount worked out in step 1\. If the result is negative, it is taken to be nil.

Step 4\. For each day in the interest period, multiply the amount worked out in step 3 by the base interest rate for the day (expressed as a daily rate).

Step 5\. Add all of the amounts worked out under step 4.

* * *

             (4)  In this section:

                    <a name=""></a><a name="base-interest-rate"></a>**_base interest rate_** for a day  has the same meaning as in section 8AAD of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

                    <a name="decision-section-appli"></a>**_decision to which this section applies_** means:

                     (a)  a decision under Part IVC of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ upon an objection relating to a grant or benefit; or

                     (b)  a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in relation to an objection mentioned in paragraph (a); or

                     (c)  a decision of a court in relation to:

                              (i)  an objection mentioned in paragraph (a); or

                             (ii)  a decision of the kind mentioned in paragraph (b).

                     (b)  if you have made a claim for a grant or benefit in respect of a particular claim period—you are not entitled, and are taken never to have been entitled, to the grant or benefit in respect of that claim period unless you have complied with the post‑claim record‑keeping requirements set out in section 27.

                     (a)  you make a claim for a grant or benefit in respect of a claim period; and

                     (b)  you make a statement in the claim to the effect that you undertake to comply with the post‑claim record‑keeping requirements set out in section 27;

             (4)  A notice under subsection (3) must give you 28 days or more to comply, starting on the day after the notice is given. The Commissioner may allow you more time to comply with the notice.

             (5)  Despite subsection (2), it is not necessary to continue to retain records:

                     (a)  if the Commissioner tells you that you do not need to retain them; or

                     (b)  for a company that has been finally dissolved.

             (6)  Despite section 8C of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_, you do not commit an offence merely by not complying with a notice under subsection (3).

 (No. 101, 2006)_

## Schedule 6

## 1  Application of Schedule 1 and 2 amendments

Except as mentioned in items 2 and 3, the repeals and amendments made by Schedules 1 and 2 apply:

                     (a)  so far as they affect assessments—to assessments for the 2006‑07 income year and all later income years; and

                     (b)  otherwise—to acts done or omitted to be done, or states of affairs existing, after the commencement of the repeals and amendments.

## 6  Object

The object of this Part is to ensure that, despite the repeals and amendments made by this Act, the full legal and administrative consequences of:

                     (a)  any act done or omitted to be done; or

                     (b)  any state of affairs existing; or

                     (c)  any period ending;

before such a repeal or amendment applies, can continue to arise and be carried out, directly or indirectly through an indefinite number of steps, even if some or all of those steps are taken after the repeal or amendment applies.

## 7  Making and amending assessments, and doing other things, in relation to past matters

Even though an Act is repealed or amended by this Act, the repeal or amendment is disregarded for the purpose of doing any of the following under any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_):

                     (a)  making or amending an assessment (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

                     (b)  exercising any right or power, performing any obligation or duty or doing any other thing (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

Example 1: On 31 July 1999, Greg Ltd lodged its annual return under former section 160ARE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The return stated that the company had a credit on its franking account and that no franking deficit tax was payable for the 1998‑99 franking year. Under former section 160ARH of that Act, the Commissioner was taken to have made an assessment consistent with the return.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of Part IIIAA of that Act, the Commissioner concludes that Greg Ltd fraudulently overfranked dividends it paid during the 1998‑99 franking year, and had a franking account deficit for that franking year. As a result, the Commissioner considers that franking deficit tax and a penalty by way of additional tax are payable.

                   The Commissioner can amend the assessment under former section 160ARN of that Act, because item 7 of this Schedule disregards the repeal of that section for the purposes of making an assessment in relation to the 1998‑99 franking year. Item 7 will also disregard the repeal of Division 11 of former Part IIIAA to the extent necessary for the Commissioner to assess Greg Ltd’s liability to a penalty by way of additional tax.

                   Despite the repeal of sections 160ARU and 160ARV, item 9 will ensure that the general interest charge will accrue on the unpaid franking deficit tax and penalty until they are paid.

                   Item 7 will also preserve Greg Ltd’s right, under former section 160ART of that Act, to object against the Commissioner’s amended assessment (including the penalty), since the objection is the exercise of a right in relation to a franking year that ended before the repeal of Part IIIAA.

Example 2: During the 1997‑98 income year, Duffy Property Ltd withheld amounts from its employees’ wages as required by former Divisions 1AAA and 2 of Part VI of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The company failed to notify the Commissioner of those amounts, and failed to remit them to the Commissioner.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of those Divisions, the Commissioner discovers that the withheld amounts have not been remitted. The company’s records are incomplete and the Commissioner is unable to completely ascertain the extent of its liability for the withheld amounts. Under section 222AGA of that Act, the Commissioner makes an estimate of the liability.

                   Item 7 will disregard the repeal of section 220AAZA of that Act (which empowered the Commissioner to recover the amount of the estimate). Even though the estimate is made after the repeal, it relates to amounts withheld before the repeal.

## 8  Saving of provisions about effect of assessments

If a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act deals with the effect of an assessment, the repeal or amendment is disregarded in relation to assessments made, before or after the repeal or amendment applies, in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

## 9  Saving of provisions about general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty

If:

                     (a)  a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act provides for the payment of:

                              (i)  general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty (all within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_); or

                             (ii)  interest under the _Taxation (Interest on Overpayments and Early Payments) Act 1983_; and

                     (b)  in a particular case, the period in respect of which the charge, penalty or interest is payable (whether under the provision or under the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_) has not begun, or has begun but not ended, when the provision is repealed or amended;

then, despite the repeal or amendment, the provision or part continues to apply in the particular case until the end of the period.

## 10  Repeals disregarded for the purposes of dependent provisions

If the operation of a provision (the **_subject provision_**) of any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_) made under any Act depends to any extent on an Act, or a provision of an Act, that is repealed by this Act, the repeal is disregarded so far as it affects the operation of the subject provision.

## 11  Schedule does not limit operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_

This Schedule does not limit the operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.
