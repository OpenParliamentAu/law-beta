                     (c)  a ship shall be deemed to be proceeding on a voyage from the time when it has got under way for the purpose of proceeding on the voyage until the time when it has got under way for the purpose of proceeding on another voyage.

##### <a id="16"></a>16  Issue of insurance certificates

             (2)  An application under subsection (1):

                     (a)  shall be in accordance with the prescribed form; and

                     (b)  shall be lodged with a person who is a prescribed person for the purposes of this subsection.

             (3)  Where application is made to the Minister under subsection (1) in respect of a ship, the Minister shall:

                     (a)  if he or she is satisfied that the owner of the ship is maintaining insurance or other financial security in respect of the ship in an amount that will cover the limits of liability prescribed by paragraph 1 of Article V of the Convention in relation to the ship—issue to the applicant an insurance certificate in respect of the ship; or

                     (b)  if he or she is not so satisfied—refuse to issue such a certificate in respect of the ship.

             (4)  An insurance certificate issued under subsection (3) in respect of a ship:

                     (a)  shall be in accordance with the prescribed form, being a form which contains, but is not limited to containing, the particulars specified in paragraph 2 of Article VII of the Convention;

                     (b)  comes into force on such day as is specified in the certificate; and

                     (c)  remains in force, subject to this Part, until the expiration of such day as is specified in the certificate, being:

                              (i)  the day that is the last day in the period of 12 months commencing on the day on which the certificate comes into force; or

                             (ii)  the day that the Minister is satisfied is the last day in the balance of the period during which the insurance or other financial security in respect of the ship is to remain in force;

                            whichever is the earlier day.

             (5)  Such fees (if any) as are prescribed are payable in respect of the issue of an insurance certificate in respect of a ship under this section.

             (6)  Where an insurance certificate is issued under this section in respect of a ship registered in Australia, the Minister shall cause a copy of the certificate to be forwarded to a person who is a prescribed person for the purposes of this subsection.

##### <a id="17"></a>17  Extension, cancellation and lapsing of insurance certificates

             (1)  Where:

                     (a)  a ship in respect of which an insurance certificate has been issued under section 16 is not at a port in   Australia at the time when the certificate expires or is about to expire; and

                     (b)  the Minister is satisfied that, after the day specified in the certificate as the day until which it is to remain in force, there will be in force a contract of insurance or other financial security in respect of the ship in an amount that will cover the limits of liability prescribed by paragraph 1 of Article V of the Convention in relation to the ship;

the Minister may, if it appears proper and reasonable to do so, extend the certificate for a period that expires on or before the day that the Minister is satisfied is the last day in the balance of the period during which that contract of insurance or other financial security is to remain in force, being a period that does not exceed one month from the day referred to in paragraph (b).

             (2)  An extension of an insurance certificate under subsection (1) is of no further force or effect after the arrival of the ship at a port in Australia.

             (3)  The Minister may cancel an insurance certificate issued under section 16 that is in force in respect of a ship if he or she is satisfied that, by reason of any modification or variation of, or to, the contract of insurance or other financial security in respect of the ship, the owner of the ship will not be covered for an amount that is not less than the limits of liability prescribed by paragraph 1 of Article V of the Convention in relation to the ship.

             (4)  If, while an insurance certificate issued under section 16 in respect of a ship registered in Australia or in a country that is not a country to which the Civil Liability Convention applies is in force, the ship ceases to be registered in Australia or in that country, as the case may be, the certificate so issued thereupon ceases to be in force.

             (5)  Where an insurance certificate issued under section 16 in respect of the ship is cancelled under subsection (3) or ceases to be in force by virtue of subsection (4), the master shall forthwith cause the certificate to be lodged with a person referred to in paragraph 16(2)(b).

                    Penalty:  20 penalty units.

                     (b)  in the case of a ship owned by a State—a certificate certifying:

                              (i)  that the ship is owned by the State; and

                             (ii)  if the Minister is satisfied that any liability for pollution damage up to the limits of liability applicable in relation to the ship under Article V of the Convention will be met by the State—that any such liability will be so met by the State.

             (2)  Subject to subsection (3), a certificate issued under subsection (1) remains in force for such period as is specified in the certificate.

             (3)  If, while a certificate issued under subsection (1) in respect of a ship owned by the Commonwealth or by a State is in force, the ship ceases to be owned by the Commonwealth or by the State, as the case may be, the certificate so issued thereupon ceases to be in force.

             (4)  Every country to which the Civil Liability Convention applies shall, in any proceedings brought in a court in Australia to enforce a claim in respect of a liability incurred under the applied provisions of the Convention, be deemed to have submitted to the jurisdiction of that court and to have waived any defence based on its status as a sovereign country, but nothing in this subsection shall permit the levy of execution against the property of such a country.

# Schedule 1—International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage

Section 3

The States Parties to the present Convention,

CONSCIOUS of the dangers of pollution posed by the worldwide maritime carriage of oil in bulk,

CONVINCED of the need to ensure that adequate compensation is available to persons who suffer damage caused by pollution resulting from the escape or discharge of oil from ships,

DESIRING to adopt uniform international rules and procedures for determining questions of liability and providing adequate compensation in such cases,

HAVE AGREED as follows: 

ARTICLE I

For the purposes of this Convention: 

1.    “Ship” means any sea-going vessel and any seaborne craft of any type whatsoever, actually carrying oil in bulk as cargo.

2.    “Person” means any individual or partnership or any public or private body, whether corporate or not, including a State or any of its constituent subdivisions.

3.    “Owner” means the person or persons registered as the owner of the ship or, in the absence of registration, the person or persons owning the ship. However in the case of a ship owned by a State and operated by a company which in that State is registered as the ship’s operator, “owner” shall mean such company.

4.    “State of the ship’s registry” means in relation to registered ships the State of registration of the ship, and in relation to unregistered ships the State whose flag the ship is flying. 

5.    “Oil” means any persistent oil such as crude oil, fuel oil, heavy diesel oil, lubricating oil and whale oil, whether carried on board a ship as cargo or in the bunkers of such a ship.

6.    “Pollution damage” means loss or damage caused outside the ship carrying oil by contamination resulting from the escape or discharge of oil from the ship, wherever such escape or discharge may occur, and includes the cost of preventive measures and further loss or damage caused by preventive measures.

7.    “Preventive measures” means any reasonable measures taken by any person after an incident has occurred to prevent or minimize pollution damage.

8.    “Incident” means any occurrence, or series of occurrences having the same origin, which causes pollution damage.

9.    “Organization” means the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization.

ARTICLE II

This Convention shall apply exclusively to pollution damage caused on the territory including the territorial sea of a Contracting State and to preventive measures taken to prevent or minimize such damage.

ARTICLE III

1.    Except as provided in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article, the owner of a ship at the time of an incident, or where the incident consists of a series of occurrences at the time of the first such occurrence, shall be liable for any pollution damage caused by oil which has escaped or been discharged from the ship as a result of the incident.

2.    No liability for pollution damage shall attach to the owner if he proves that the damage:

(a)   resulted from an act of war, hostilities, civil war, insurrection or a natural phenomenon of an exceptional, inevitable and irresistible character, or

(b)   was wholly caused by an act or omission done with intent to cause damage by a third party or

(c)   was wholly caused by the negligence or other wrongful act of any Government or other authority responsible for the maintenance of lights or other navigational aids in the exercise of that function.

3.    If the owner proves that the pollution damage resulted wholly or partially either from an act or omission done with intent to cause damage by the person who suffered the damage or from the negligence of that person, the owner may be exonerated wholly or partially from his liability to such person.

4.    No claim for compensation for pollution damage shall be made against the owner otherwise than in accordance with this Convention. No claim for pollution damage under this Convention or otherwise may be made against the servants or agents of the owner.

5.    Nothing in this Convention shall prejudice any right of recourse of the owner against third parties.

ARTICLE IV

When oil has escaped or has been discharged from two or more ships, and pollution damage results therefrom, the owners of all the ships concerned, unless exonerated under Article III, shall be jointly and severally liable for all such damage which is not reasonably separable.

ARTICLE V

1.    The owner of a ship shall be entitled to limit his liability under this Convention in respect of any one incident to an aggregate amount of 2,000 francs for each ton of the ship’s tonnage. However, this aggregate amount shall not in any event exceed 210 million francs.

2.    If the incident occurred as a result of the actual fault or privity of the owner, he shall not be entitled to avail himself of the limitation provided in paragraph 1 of this Article.

3.    For the purpose of availing himself of the benefit of limitation provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article the owner shall constitute a fund for the total sum representing the limit of his liability with the Court or other competent authority of any one of the Contracting States in which action is brought under Article IX. The fund can be constituted either by depositing the sum or by producing a bank guarantee or other guarantee, acceptable under the legislation of the Contracting  State where the fund is constituted, and considered to be adequate by the Court or another competent authority. 

4.    The fund shall be distributed among the claimants in proportion to the amounts of their established claims.

5.    If before the fund is distributed the owner or any of his servants or agents or any person providing him insurance or other financial security has as a result of the incident in question, paid compensation for pollution damage, such person shall, up to the amount he has paid, acquire by subrogation the rights which the person so compensated would have enjoyed under this Convention.

6.    The right of subrogation provided for in paragraph 5 of this Article may also be exercised by a person other than those mentioned therein in respect of any amount of compensation for pollution damage which he may have paid but only to the extent that such subrogation is permitted under the applicable national law. 

7.    Where the owner or any other person establishes that he may be compelled to pay at a later date in whole or in part any such amount of compensation, with regard to which such person would have enjoyed a right of subrogation under paragraphs 5 or 6 of this Article, had the compensation been paid before the fund was distributed, the Court or other competent authority of the State where the fund has been constituted may order that a sufficient sum shall be provisionally set aside to enable such person at such later date to enforce his claim against the fund.

8.    Claims in respect of expenses reasonably incurred or sacrifices reasonably made by the owner voluntarily to prevent or minimize pollution damage shall rank equally with other claims against the fund.

9.    The franc mentioned in this Article shall be a unit consisting of sixty-five and a half milligrams of gold of millesimal fineness nine hundred. The amount mentioned in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be converted into the national currency of the State in which the fund is being constituted on the basis of the official value of that currency by reference to the unit defined above on the date of the constitution of the fund.

10.   For the purpose of this Article the ship’s tonnage shall be the net tonnage of the ship with the addition of the amount deducted from the gross tonnage on account of engine room space for the purpose of ascertaining the net tonnage. In the case of a ship which cannot be measured in accordance with the normal rules of tonnage measurement, the ship’s tonnage shall be deemed to be 40 per cent of the weight in tons (of 2240 lbs) of oil which the ship is capable of carrying.

11.   The insurer or other person providing financial security shall be entitled to constitute a fund in accordance with this Article on the same conditions and having the same effect as if it were constituted by the owner. Such a fund may be constituted even in the event of the actual fault or privity of the owner but its constitution shall in that case not prejudice the rights of any claimant against the owner.

ARTICLE VI

1.    Where the owner, after an incident, has constituted a fund in accordance with Article V, and is entitled to limit his liability,

(a)   no person having a claim for pollution damage arising out of that incident shall be entitled to exercise any right against any other other assets of the owner in respect of such claim;

(b)   the Court or other competent authority of any Contracting State shall order the release of any ship or other property belonging to the owner which has been arrested in respect of a claim for pollution damage arising out of that incident, and shall similarly release any bail or other security furnished to avoid such arrest.

2.    The foregoing shall, however, only apply if the claimant has access to the Court administering the fund and the fund is actually available in respect of his claim.

ARTICLE VII

1.    The owner of a ship registered in a Contracting State and carrying more than 2,000 tons of oil in bulk as cargo shall be required to maintain insurance or other financial security, such as the guarantee of a bank or a certificate delivered by an international compensation fund, in the sums fixed by applying the limits of liability prescribed in Article V, paragraph 1 to cover his liability for pollution damage under this Convention.

2.    A certificate attesting that insurance or other financial security is in force in accordance with the provisions of this Convention shall be issued to each ship. It shall be issued or certified by the appropriate authority of the State of the ship’s registry after determining that the requirements of paragraph 1 of this Article have been complied with. This certificate shall be in the form of the annexed model and shall contain the following particulars: 

(a)   name of ship and port of registration;

(b)   name and principal place of business of owner;

(c)   type of security;

(d)   name and principal place of business of insurer or other person giving security and, where appropriate, place of business where the insurance or security is established;

(e)   period of validity of certificate which shall not be longer than the period of validity of the insurance or other security.

3.    The certificate shall be in the official language or languages of the issuing State. If the language used is neither English nor French, the text shall include a translation into one of those languages.

4.    The certificate shall be carried on board the ship and a copy shall be deposited with the authorities who keep the record of the ship’s registry. 

5.    An insurance or other financial security shall not satisfy the requirements of this Article if it can cease, for reasons other than the expiry of the period of validity of the insurance or security specified in the certificate under paragraph 2 of this Article, before three months have elapsed from the date on which notice of its termination is given to the authorities referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article, unless the certificate has been surrendered to these authorities or a new certificate has been issued within the said period. The foregoing provisions shall similarly apply to any modification which results in the insurance or security no longer satisfying the requirements of this Article.

6.    The State of registry shall, subject to the provisions of this Article, determine the conditions of issue and validity of the certificate.

7.    Certificates issued or certified under the authority of a Contracting State shall be accepted by other Contracting States for the purposes of this Convention and shall be regarded by other Contracting States as having the same force as certificates issued or certified by them. A Contracting State may at any time request consultation with the State of a ship’s registry should it believe that the insurer or guarantor named in the certificate is not financially capable of meeting the obligations imposed by this Convention. 

8.    Any claim for compensation for pollution damage may be brought directly against the insurer or other person providing financial security for the owner’s liability for pollution damage. In such case the defendant may, irrespective of the actual fault or privity of the owner, avail himself of the limits of liability prescribed in Article V, paragraph 1\. He may further avail himself of the defences (other than the bankruptcy or winding up of the owner) which the owner himself would have been entitled to invoke. Furthermore, the defendant may avail himself of the defence that the pollution damage resulted from the wilful misconduct of the owner himself, but the defendant shall not avail himself of any other defence which he might have been entitled to invoke in proceedings brought by the owner against him. The defendant shall in any event have the right to require the owner to be joined in the proceedings.

9.    Any sums provided by insurance or by other financial security maintained in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article shall be available exclusively for the satisfaction of claims under this Convention.

10.   A Contracting State shall not permit a ship under its flag to which this Article applies to trade unless a certificate has been issued under paragraph 2 or 12 of this Article.

11.   Subject to the provisions of this Article, each Contracting State shall ensure, under its national legislation, that insurance or other security to the extent specified in paragraph 1 of this Article is in force in respect of any ship, wherever registered, entering or leaving a port in its territory, or arriving at or leaving an off-shore terminal in its territorial sea, if the ship actually carries more than 2,000 tons of oil in bulk as cargo.

12.   If insurance or other financial security is not maintained in respect of a ship owned by a Contracting State, the provisions of this Article relating thereto shall not be applicable to such ship, but the ship shall carry a certificate issued by the appropriate authorities of the State of the ship’s registry stating that the ship is owned by that State and that the ship’s liability is covered within the limits prescribed by Article V, paragraph 1\. Such a certificate shall follow as closely as practicable the model prescribed by paragraph 2 of this Article.

ARTICLE VIII

Rights of compensation under this Convention shall be extinguished unless an action is brought thereunder within three years from the date when the damage occurred. However, in no case shall an action be brought after six years from the date of the incident which caused the damage. Where this incident consists of a series of occurrences, the six years’ period shall run from the date of the first such occurrence.

ARTICLE IX

1.    Where an incident has caused pollution damage in the territory including the territorial sea of one or more Contracting States, or preventive measures have been taken to prevent or minimize pollution damage in such territory including the territorial sea, actions for compensation may only be brought in the Courts of any such Contracting State or States. Reasonable notice of any such action shall be given to the defendant.

2.    Each Contracting State shall ensure that its Courts possess the necessary jurisdiction to entertain such actions for compensation.

3.    After the fund has been constituted in accordance with Article V the Courts of the State in which the fund is constituted shall be exclusively competent to determine all matters relating to the apportionment and distribution of the fund.

ARTICLE X

1.    Any judgment given by a Court with jurisdiction in accordance with Article IX which is enforceable in the State of origin where it is no longer subject to ordinary forms of review, shall be recognized in any Contracting State, except:

(a)   where the judgement was obtained by fraud; or

(b)   where the defendant was not given reasonable notice and a fair opportunity to present his case.

2.    A judgment recognized under paragraph 1 of this Article shall be enforceable in each Contracting State as soon as the formalities required in that State have been complied with. The formalities shall not permit the merits of the case to be re-opened.

# Schedule 2—Protocol of 1992 to amend the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969

Section 3

THE PARTIES TO THE PRESENT PROTOCOL,

HAVING CONSIDERED the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, and the 1984 Protocol thereto,

HAVING NOTED that the 1984 Protocol to that Convention, which provides for improved scope and enhanced compensation, has not entered into force, 

AFFIRMING the importance of maintaining the viability of the international oil pollution liability and compensation system,

AWARE OF the need to ensure the entry into force of the content of the 1984 Protocol as soon as possible,

RECOGNIZING that special provisions are necessary in connection with the introduction of corresponding amendments to the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage, 1971,

HAVE AGREED as follows:

<u>Article 1</u>

The Convention which the provisions of this Protocol amend is the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, hereinafter referred to as the “1969 Liability Convention”. For States Parties to the Protocol of 1976 to the 1969 Liability Convention, such reference shall be deemed to include the 1969 Liability Convention as amended by that Protocol.

<u>Article 2</u>

Article I of the 1969 Liability Convention is amended as follows: 

1.    Paragraph 1 is replaced by the following text:

1.  “Ship” means any sea-going vessel and seaborne craft of any type whatsoever constructed or adapted for the carriage of oil in bulk as cargo, provided that a ship capable of carrying oil and other cargoes shall be regarded as a ship only when it is actually carrying oil in bulk as cargo and during any voyage following such carriage unless it is proved that it has no residues of such carriage of oil in bulk aboard.

2.    Paragraph 5 is replaced by the following text:

5.  “Oil” means any persistent hydrocarbon mineral oil such as crude oil, fuel oil, heavy diesel oil and lubricating oil, whether carried on board a ship as cargo or in the bunkers of such a ship.

3.    Paragraph 6 is replaced by the following text:

6.  “Pollution damage” means:

(a)   loss or damage caused outside the ship by contamination resulting from the escape or discharge of oil from the ship, wherever such escape or discharge may occur, provided that compensation for impairment of the environment other than loss of profit from such impairment shall be limited to costs of reasonable measures of reinstatement actually undertaken or to be undertaken;

(b)   the costs of preventive measures and further loss or damage caused by preventive measures.

4.    Paragraph 8 is replaced by the following text:

8.  “Incident” means any occurrence, or series of occurrences having the same origin, which causes pollution damage or creates a grave and imminent threat of causing such damage.

5.    Paragraph 9 is replaced by the following text: 

9.  “Organization” means the International Maritime Organization. 

6.    After paragraph 9 a new paragraph is inserted reading as follows: 

10.   “1969 Liability Convention” means the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969\. For States Parties to the Protocol of 1976 to that Convention, the term shall be deemed to include the 1969 Liability Convention as amended by that Protocol.

<u>Article 3</u>

Article II of the 1969 Liability Convention is replaced by the following text: 

This Convention shall apply exclusively:

(a)   to pollution damage caused:

(i)    in the territory, including the territorial sea, of a Contracting  State, and 

(ii)   in the exclusive economic zone of a Contracting State, established in accordance with international law, or, if a Contracting State has not established such a zone, in an area beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea of that State determined by that State in accordance with international law and extending not more than 200 nautical miles from the baseline from which the breadth of its territorial sea is measured;

(b)   to preventive measures, wherever taken, to prevent or minimize such damage.

<u>Article 4</u>

Article III of the 1969 Liability Convention is amended as follows: 

1.    Paragraph 1 is replaced by the following text:

1.  Except as provided in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article, the owner of a ship at the time of an incident, or, where the incident consists of a series of occurrences, at the time of the first such occurrence, shall be liable for any pollution damage caused by the ship as a result of the incident. 

2.    Paragraph 4 is replaced by the following text:

4.  No claim for compensation for pollution damage may be made against the owner otherwise than in accordance with this Convention. Subject to paragraph 5 of this Article, no claim for compensation for pollution damage under this Convention or otherwise may be made against:

(a)   the servants or agents of the owner or the members of the crew; 

(b)   the pilot or any other person who, without being a member of the crew, performs services for the ship;

(c)   any charterer (howsoever described, including a bareboat charterer), manager or operator of the ship;

(d)   any person performing salvage operations with the consent of the owner or on the instructions of a competent public authority;

(e)   any person taking preventive measures;

(f)    all servants or agents of persons mentioned in subparagraphs (c), (d) and (e);

unless the damage resulted from their personal act or omission, committed with the intent to cause such damage, or recklessly and with knowledge that such damage would probably result.

<u>Article 5</u>

Article IV of the 1969 Liability Convention is replaced by the following text:

When an incident involving two or more ships occurs and pollution damage results therefrom, the owners of all the ships concerned, unless exonerated under Article III, shall be jointly and severally liable for all such damage which is not reasonably separable.

<u>Article 6</u>

Article V of the 1969 Liability Convention is amended as follows: 

1.    Paragraph 1 is replaced by the following text:

1.  The owner of a ship shall be entitled to limit his liability under this Convention in respect of any one incident to an aggregate amount calculated as follows:

(a)   3 million units of account for a ship not exceeding 5,000 units of tonnage;

(b)   for a ship with a tonnage in excess thereof, for each additional unit of tonnage, 420 units of account in addition to the amount mentioned in subparagraph (a);

provided, however, that this aggregate amount shall not in any event exceed 59.7 million units of account.

2.    Paragraph 2 is replaced by the following text:

2.  The owner shall not be entitled to limit his liability under this Convention if it is proved that the pollution damage resulted from his personal act or omission, committed with the intent to cause such damage, or recklessly and with knowledge that such damage would probably result. 

3.    Paragraph 3 is replaced by the following text:

3.  For the purpose of availing himself of the benefit of limitation provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article the owner shall constitute a fund for the total sum representing the limit of his liability with the Court or other competent authority of any one of the Contracting States in which action is brought under Article IX or, if no action is brought, with any Court or other competent authority in any one of the Contracting States in which an action can be brought under Article IX. The fund can be constituted either by depositing the sum or by producing a bank guarantee or other guarantee, acceptable under the legislation of the Contracting State where the fund is constituted, and considered to be adequate by the Court or other competent authority.

4.    Paragraph 9 is replaced by the following text:

9 (a).  The “unit of account” referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article is the Special Drawing Right as defined by the International Monetary Fund. The amounts mentioned in paragraph 1 shall be converted into national currency on the basis of the value of that currency by reference to the Special Drawing Right on the date of the constitution of the fund referred to in paragraph 3\. The value of the national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a Contracting State which is a member of the International Monetary Fund shall be calculated in accordance with the method of valuation applied by the International Monetary Fund in effect on the date in question for its operations and transactions. The value of the national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a Contracting  State which is not a member of the International Monetary Fund shall be calculated in a manner determined by that State.

9 (b).  Nevertheless, a Contracting State which is not a member of the International Monetary Fund and whose law does not permit the application of the provisions of paragraph 9(a) may, at the time of ratification, acceptance, approval of or accession to this Convention or at any time thereafter, declare that the unit of account referred to in paragraph 9 (a) shall be equal to 15 gold francs. The gold franc referred to in this paragraph corresponds to sixty-five and a half milligrammes of gold of millesimal fineness nine hundred. The conversion of the gold franc into the national currency shall be made according to the law of the State concerned.

9 (c).  The calculation mentioned in the last sentence of paragraph 9(a) and the conversion mentioned in paragraph 9(b) shall be made in such manner as to express in the national currency of the Contracting State as far as possible the same real value for the amounts in paragraph 1 as would result from the application of the first three sentences of paragraph 9(a). Contracting States shall communicate to the depositary the manner of calculation pursuant to paragraph 9(a), or the result of the conversion in paragraph 9(b) as the case may be, when depositing an instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval of or accession to this Convention and whenever there is a change in either.

5.    Paragraph 10 is replaced by the following text:

10.     For the purpose of this Article the ship’s tonnage shall be the gross tonnage calculated in accordance with the tonnage measurement regulations contained in Annex I of the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969.

6.    The second sentence of paragraph 11 is replaced by the following text: 

Such a fund may be constituted even if, under the provisions of paragraph 2, the owner is not entitled to limit his liability, but its constitution shall in that case not prejudice the rights of any claimant against the owner. 

<u>Article 7</u>

Article VII of the 1969 Liability Convention is amended as follows: 

1.    The first two sentences of paragraph 2 are replaced by the following text:

A certificate attesting that insurance or other financial security is in force in accordance with the provisions of this Convention shall be issued to each ship after the appropriate authority of a Contracting State has determined that the requirements of paragraph 1 have been complied with. With respect to a ship registered in a Contracting State such certificate shall be issued or certified by the appropriate authority of the State of the ship’s registry; with respect to a ship not registered in a Contracting State it may be issued or certified by the appropriate authority of any Contracting State. 

2.    Paragraph 4 is replaced by the following text:

4.  The certificate shall be carried on board the ship and a copy shall be deposited with the authorities who keep the record of the ship’s registry or, if the ship is not registered in a Contracting State, with the authorities of the State issuing or certifying the certificate.

3.    The first sentence of paragraph 7 is replaced by the following text: 

Certificates issued or certified under the authority of a Contracting State in accordance with paragraph 2 shall be accepted by other Contracting States for the purposes of this Convention and shall be regarded by other Contracting States as having the same force as certificates issued or certified by them even if issued or certified in respect of a ship not registered in a Contracting State.

4.    In the second sentence of paragraph 7 the words “with the State of a ship’s registry” are replaced by the words “with the issuing or certifying State”.

5.    The second sentence of paragraph 8 is replaced by the following text: 

In such case the defendant may, even if the owner is not entitled to limit his liability according to Article V, paragraph 2, avail himself of the limits of liability prescribed in Article V, paragraph 1.

<u>Article 8</u>

Article IX of the 1969 Liability Convention is amended as follows: 

Paragraph 1 is replaced by the following text:

1.  Where an incident has caused pollution damage in the territory, including the territorial sea or an area referred to in Article II, of one or more Contracting States or preventive measures have been taken to prevent or minimize pollution damage in such territory including the territorial sea or area, actions for compensation may only be brought in the Courts of any such Contracting State or States. Reasonable notice of any such action shall be given to the defendant.

<u>Article 9</u>

After Article XII of the 1969 Liability Convention two new Articles are inserted as follows:

<u>Article XII bis</u>

<u>Transitional provisions</u>

The following transitional provisions shall apply in the case of a State which at the time of an incident is a Party both to this Convention and to the 1969 Liability Convention:

(a)   where an incident has caused pollution damage within the scope of this Convention, liability under this Convention shall be deemed to be discharged if, and to the extent that, it also arises under the 1969 Liability Convention; 

(b)   where an incident has caused pollution damage within the scope of this Convention, and the State is a Party both to this Convention and to the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage, 1971, liability remaining to be discharged after the application of subparagraph (a) of this Article shall arise under this Convention only to the extent that pollution damage remains uncompensated after application of the said 1971 Convention;

(c)   in the application of Article III, paragraph 4, of this Convention the expression “this Compensation” shall be interpreted as referring to this Convention or the 1969 Liability Convention, as appropriate;

(d)   in the application of Article V, paragraph 3, of this Convention the total sum of the fund to be constituted shall be reduced by the amount by which liability has been deemed to be discharged in accordance with subparagraph (a) of this Article.
