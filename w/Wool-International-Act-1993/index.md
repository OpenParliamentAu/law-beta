             (1)  Subject to this section, a registered equity holder other than TrusteeCo may transfer to another person any or all of the units of equity in WoolStock Australia Limited that he or she holds.

          (2A)  If the register is amended so that:

                     (b)  it no longer shows those units as being “unclaimed entitlements”;

then TrusteeCo must transfer those units to that person.

             (3)  A unit of equity that is the subject of a charge may not be transferred.

          (3A)  Units of equity cannot be transferred unless, at the same time, the transferor transfers to the transferee a number of shares in WoolStock Australia Limited that is equal to the number of units transferred.

             (4)  A transfer of units of equity does not have effect unless particulars of the transfer are recorded in the register of equity holders.

             (5)  The transferor or the transferee may give notice of the transfer to WoolStock Australia Limited. The notice must:

                     (a)  be in a form approved by WoolStock Australia Limited; and

                     (b)  be given, together with any prescribed document, to WoolStock Australia Limited in accordance with the regulations.

             (6)  On receiving a notice of transfer that complies with subsection (5), WoolStock Australia Limited must, in accordance with the regulations:

                     (a)  enter in the register of equity holders:

                              (i)  the name and address of the transferee; and

                             (ii)  the number of units of equity in WoolStock Australia Limited acquired by the transferee as a result of the transfer; and

                            (iii)  the date on which the transfer takes effect; and

                     (b)  make the necessary adjustments to the particulars entered in the register in respect of the transferor.

             (7)  WoolStock Australia Limited:

                     (a)  does not have any duty of care to ascertain that a transfer of units notified to it under this section is valid; and

                     (b)  is not liable to compensate any person for any loss or damage arising from anything done by it in accordance with this section.

##### <a id="22I"></a>22I  Death etc. of unit holder

                     (b)  the beneficiary of any of those units;

may apply to WoolStock Australia Limited to be registered as the holder of the units concerned.

             (2)  If the registered holder of units of equity in WoolStock Australia Limited becomes bankrupt, the trustee of the bankrupt’s estate may apply to WoolStock Australia Limited to be registered as the holder of those units.

             (3)  If a company that is the registered holder of units of equity in WoolStock Australia Limited is wound up, the liquidator of the company may apply to WoolStock Australia Limited to be registered as the holder of those units.

             (4)  In each case, the application must:

                     (a)  be in a form approved by WoolStock Australia Limited; and

                     (b)  be given, together with any prescribed document, to WoolStock Australia Limited in accordance with the regulations.

                              (i)  the name and address of the applicant; and

                             (ii)  the number of units of equity in WoolStock Australia Limited held by the previous registered holder that are now held by the applicant; and

##### <a id="22J"></a>22J  Charge on unit of equity

             (1)  Subject to this section, a unit of equity in WoolStock Australia Limited held by a registered equity holder other than TrusteeCo may be the subject of a charge in favour of another person (**_beneficiary_**).

             (5)  If the beneficiary subsequently notifies WoolStock Australia Limited that the unit of equity is no longer the subject of the charge, WoolStock Australia Limited must remove all particulars of the charge from the register.

             (6)  Failure to register a charge on a unit of equity in WoolStock Australia Limited under the law of a State or Territory does not affect the validity of the charge for the purposes of this Act.

             (7)  For the purposes of this section, a floating charge:

                     (a)  on all the assets of a registered equity holder; or

                     (b)  on a part of the assets of a registered equity holder that includes units of equity in WoolStock Australia Limited;

is not taken to be a charge on any of the units of equity in WoolStock Australia Limited held by the equity holder.

that charge (**_first charge_**) has priority over any other charge on that unit of equity that is registered under that section after the registration of the first charge.

##### <a id="22KA"></a>22KA  Registered equity holders—status as members of WoolStock Australia Limited

                   For the purposes of the _Corporations Act 2001_, a person is not to be treated as being a member of WoolStock Australia Limited merely because the person is a registered equity holder.

                   For the purposes of the _Corporations Act 2001_:

                     (a)  for each distribution under Part 4B of this Act, WoolStock Australia Limited incurs a debt at the end of the operative day for the distribution; and

                     (b)  in a winding up of WoolStock Australia Limited:

                              (i)  the claims of registered equity holders are admissible to proof against WoolStock Australia Limited; and

                             (ii)  those claims rank behind the debts and claims of all other unsecured creditors.

##### <a id="22L"></a>22L  Access to register

requests WoolStock Australia Limited to do so, WoolStock Australia Limited must:

## Table A

### Application, saving or transitional provisions

_Wool International Amendment Act 1997 (No. 108, 1997)_

## Schedule 1

## 19  Transitional

             (1)  A person who, immediately before the commencement of this Part, was a member of Wool International referred to in paragraph 23(1)(d) of the _Wool International Act 1993_ as then in force:

                     (a)  ceases, on the commencement of this Part, to be a member of Wool International; but

                     (b)  is eligible for re-appointment.

             (2)  Despite subsection 23(4) of the _Wool International Act 1993_, the 2 members referred to in paragraph 23(1)(d) of that Act who are first appointed after the commencement of this Part are not to be persons nominated by a selection committee constituted under that Act. In appointing them, the Minister must, however, consult with the members of Wool International referred to in paragraphs 23(1)(a), (b) and (c) of that Act.

_Tax Laws Amendment (Repeal of Inoperative Provisions) Act 2006 
 (No. 101, 2006)_

## Schedule 6

## 5  Application of Schedule 5 amendments

The repeals and amendments made by Schedule 5 apply to acts done or omitted to be done, or states of affairs existing, after the commencement of the amendments.

## 6  Object

The object of this Part is to ensure that, despite the repeals and amendments made by this Act, the full legal and administrative consequences of:

                     (a)  any act done or omitted to be done; or

                     (b)  any state of affairs existing; or

                     (c)  any period ending;

before such a repeal or amendment applies, can continue to arise and be carried out, directly or indirectly through an indefinite number of steps, even if some or all of those steps are taken after the repeal or amendment applies.

## 7  Making and amending assessments, and doing other things, in relation to past matters

Even though an Act is repealed or amended by this Act, the repeal or amendment is disregarded for the purpose of doing any of the following under any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_):

                     (a)  making or amending an assessment (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

                     (b)  exercising any right or power, performing any obligation or duty or doing any other thing (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

Example 1: On 31 July 1999, Greg Ltd lodged its annual return under former section 160ARE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The return stated that the company had a credit on its franking account and that no franking deficit tax was payable for the 1998-99 franking year. Under former section 160ARH of that Act, the Commissioner was taken to have made an assessment consistent with the return.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of Part IIIAA of that Act, the Commissioner concludes that Greg Ltd fraudulently overfranked dividends it paid during the 1998-99 franking year, and had a franking account deficit for that franking year. As a result, the Commissioner considers that franking deficit tax and a penalty by way of additional tax are payable.

                   The Commissioner can amend the assessment under former section 160ARN of that Act, because item 7 of this Schedule disregards the repeal of that section for the purposes of making an assessment in relation to the 1998-99 franking year. Item 7 will also disregard the repeal of Division 11 of former Part IIIAA to the extent necessary for the Commissioner to assess Greg Ltd’s liability to a penalty by way of additional tax.

                   Despite the repeal of sections 160ARU and 160ARV, item 9 will ensure that the general interest charge will accrue on the unpaid franking deficit tax and penalty until they are paid.

                   Item 7 will also preserve Greg Ltd’s right, under former section 160ART of that Act, to object against the Commissioner’s amended assessment (including the penalty), since the objection is the exercise of a right in relation to a franking year that ended before the repeal of Part IIIAA.

Example 2: During the 1997-98 income year, Duffy Property Ltd withheld amounts from its employees’ wages as required by former Divisions 1AAA and 2 of Part VI of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The company failed to notify the Commissioner of those amounts, and failed to remit them to the Commissioner.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of those Divisions, the Commissioner discovers that the withheld amounts have not been remitted. The company’s records are incomplete and the Commissioner is unable to completely ascertain the extent of its liability for the withheld amounts. Under section 222AGA of that Act, the Commissioner makes an estimate of the liability.

                   Item 7 will disregard the repeal of section 220AAZA of that Act (which empowered the Commissioner to recover the amount of the estimate). Even though the estimate is made after the repeal, it relates to amounts withheld before the repeal.

## 8  Saving of provisions about effect of assessments

If a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act deals with the effect of an assessment, the repeal or amendment is disregarded in relation to assessments made, before or after the repeal or amendment applies, in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

## 9  Saving of provisions about general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty

If:

                     (a)  a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act provides for the payment of:

                              (i)  general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty (all within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_); or

                             (ii)  interest under the _Taxation (Interest on Overpayments and Early Payments) Act 1983_; and

                     (b)  in a particular case, the period in respect of which the charge, penalty or interest is payable (whether under the provision or under the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_) has not begun, or has begun but not ended, when the provision is repealed or amended;

then, despite the repeal or amendment, the provision or part continues to apply in the particular case until the end of the period.

## 10  Repeals disregarded for the purposes of dependent provisions

If the operation of a provision (the **_subject provision_**) of any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_) made under any Act depends to any extent on an Act, or a provision of an Act, that is repealed by this Act, the repeal is disregarded so far as it affects the operation of the subject provision.

## 11  Schedule does not limit operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_

This Schedule does not limit the operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.
