          (1D)  A decision or determination covered by subsection (1) does not discriminate against an employee for the purposes of paragraph (1C)(f) merely because:

then the award is not binding on any person in respect of the employee, while the wages and conditions of employment of the employee continue to be regulated by the agreement.

             (3)  If, at a particular time, a State employment agreement that is made after the commencement of this subsection would regulate wages and conditions of employment of an employee but for the fact that an award is binding on an employer in respect of the employee, then:

                     (a)  the award does not prevent the agreement from coming into force and regulating the wages and conditions of employment of the employee; and

                     (b)  while the agreement continues to regulate those wages and conditions, the award is not binding on any person in respect of the employee.

## 47  Exercise of Commission’s powers under this Part

In exercising its powers under this Part, the Commission is to have regard to the desirability of assisting parties to awards to agree on appropriate variations to their awards, rather than have parts of awards cease to have effect under item 50 at the end of the interim period.

## 48  Special consent provisions

For the purposes of this Part, **_special consent provisions_** are provisions of an award that give effect to a decision of the Commission that is expressed to be made in accordance with one or more of the following principles:

                     (a)  the Enterprise Bargaining Principle adopted by the Commission in the National Wage Case decision of October 1991 (Dec 1150/91, Print K0300);

                     (b)  the Enterprise Awards Principle adopted by the Commission in its Review of the Wage Fixing Principles decision of October 1993 (Dec 1300/93, Print K9700);

                     (c)  Principle 2.2 (Consent Award or Award Variation to Give Effect to an Enterprise Agreement), adopted by the Commission in its Review of the Wage Fixing Principles decision of August 1994 (Dec 1408/94, Print L4700) and incorporated without amendment in wages principles established by the Commission in its Safety Net Adjustment &amp; Section 150A Review decision of October 1995 (Dec 2120/95, Print M5600).

## 49  Variation of awards during the interim period

(1)        If one or more of the parties to an award apply to the Commission for a variation of the award under this item, the Commission may, during the interim period, vary the award so that it only deals with allowable award matters.

(2)        For the purposes of this item, an exceptional matters order is taken to relate wholly to allowable award matters.

(3)        Special consent provisions cannot be varied under this item before the termination time for those provisions.

(4)        The Commission may only deal with the application by arbitration if it is satisfied that the applicant or applicants have made reasonable attempts to reach agreement with the other parties to the award about how the award should be varied and the treatment of matters that are not allowable award matters.

(5)        If:

                     (a)  the award provides for rates of pay that, in the opinion of the Commission:

                              (i)  are not operating as minimum rates; or

                             (ii)  were made on the basis that they were not intended to operate as minimum rates; and

                     (b)  the application under this item seeks to have such rates of pay varied so that they are expressed as minimum rates of pay;

the Commission may vary the award so that it provides for minimum rates of pay consistent with sections 88A and 88B of the Principal Act and the limitation on the Commission’s power in subsection 89A(3) of that Act.

(6)        If the Commission varies the award under subitem (5), it must include in the award provisions that ensure that overall entitlements to pay provided by the award are not reduced by that variation, unless the Commission considers that it would be in the public interest not to include such provisions.

(7)        The Commission must, if it considers it appropriate, review the award to determine whether or not it meets the following criteria:

                     (a)  it does not include matters of detail or process that are more appropriately dealt with by agreement at the workplace or enterprise level;

                     (b)  it does not prescribe work practices or procedures that restrict or hinder the efficient performance of work;

                     (c)  it does not contain provisions that have the effect of restricting or hindering productivity, having regard to fairness to employees.

(8)        The Commission must also review the award to determine whether or not it meets the following criteria:

                     (a)  where appropriate, it contains facilitative provisions that allow agreement at the workplace or enterprise level, between employers and employees (including individual employees), on how the award provisions are to apply;

                     (b)  where appropriate, it contains provisions enabling the employment of regular part-time employees;

                     (c)  it is expressed in plain English and is easy to understand in both structure and content;

                     (d)  it does not contain provisions that are obsolete or that need updating;

                     (e)  where appropriate, it provides support to training arrangements through appropriate trainee wages and a supported wage system for people with disabilities;

                      (f)  it does not contain provisions that discriminate against an employee because of, or for reasons including, race, colour, sex, sexual preference, age, physical or mental disability, marital status, family responsibilities, pregnancy, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin.

(9)        If the Commission determines that the award does not meet the criteria set out in subitem (7) or (8), the Commission may take whatever steps it considers appropriate to facilitate the variation of the award so that it does meet those criteria.

## 50  Parts of awards cease to have effect at the end of the interim period

(1)        At the end of the interim period, each award ceases to have effect to the extent that it provides for matters other than allowable award matters.

(2)        For the purposes of this item, an exceptional matters order is taken to relate wholly to allowable award matters.

(3)        For the purposes of this item, an award that is made under subsection 170MX(3) of the Principal Act, or varied under item 49 of this Schedule, is taken to provide wholly for allowable award matters.

(4)        If the termination time for special consent provisions is after the end of the interim period, then this item and item 51 apply to the special consent provisions as if a reference to the end of the interim period were instead a reference to the termination time.

## 51  Variation of awards after the end of the interim period

(1)        As soon as practicable after the end of the interim period, the Commission must review each award:

                     (a)  that is in force; and

                     (b)  that the Commission is satisfied has been affected by item 50.

(2)        The Commission must vary the award to remove provisions that ceased to have effect under item 50.

(3)        When varying the award under subitem (2), the Commission may also vary the award so that, in relation to an allowable award matter, the award is expressed in a way that reasonably represents the entitlements of employees in respect of that matter as provided in the award as in force immediately before the end of the interim period.

(4)        If, immediately before the end of the interim period, the award provided for rates of pay that, in the opinion of the Commission:

                     (a)  were not operating as minimum rates of pay; or

                     (b)  were made on the basis that they were not intended to operate as minimum rates;

the Commission may vary the award so that it provides for minimum rates of pay consistent with sections 88A and 88B of the Principal Act and the limitation on the Commission’s power in subsection 89A(3) of that Act.

(5)        If the Commission varies the award under subitem (4), it must include in the award provisions that ensure that overall entitlements to pay provided by the award are not reduced by that variation, unless the Commission considers that it would be in the public interest not to include such provisions.

(6)        The Commission must, if it considers it appropriate, review the award to determine whether or not it meets the following criteria:

                     (a)  it does not include matters of detail or process that are more appropriately dealt with by agreement at the workplace or enterprise level;

                     (b)  it does not prescribe work practices or procedures that restrict or hinder the efficient performance of work;

                     (c)  it does not contain provisions that have the effect of restricting or hindering productivity, having regard to fairness to employees.

(7)        The Commission must also review the award to determine whether or not it meets the following criteria:

                     (a)  where appropriate, it contains facilitative provisions that allow agreement at the workplace or enterprise level, between employers and employees (including individual employees), on how the award provisions are to apply;

                     (b)  where appropriate, it contains provisions enabling the employment of regular part-time employees;

                     (c)  it is expressed in plain English and is easy to understand in both structure and content;

                     (d)  it does not contain provisions that are obsolete or that need updating;

                     (e)  where appropriate, it provides support to training arrangements through appropriate trainee wages and a supported wage system for people with disabilities;

                    (ea)  if it applies to work that is or may be performed by young people—protects the competitive position of young people in the labour market, promotes youth employment, youth skills and community standards and assists in reducing youth unemployment by including, if, on a case-by-case basis, the Commission determines it appropriate, junior rates of pay; and

                      (f)  it does not contain provisions that discriminate against an employee because of, or for reasons including, race, colour, sex, sexual preference, age, physical or mental disability, marital status, family responsibilities, pregnancy, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin.

(8)        If the Commission determines that the award does not meet the criteria set out in subitem (6) or (7), the Commission may take whatever steps it considers appropriate to facilitate the variation of the award so that it does meet those criteria.

## 52  Corporations not bound by State awards

(1)        If:

                     (a)  a constitutional corporation is bound by an award in respect of an employee; and

                     (b)  the award is varied under subitem 49(1) or wholly or partly ceases to have effect because of item 50; and

                     (c)  as a result of the award being varied, or ceasing to have effect, as mentioned in paragraph (b), the corporation would (apart from this item) become bound by a State award in respect of the employee;

then the corporation is not bound by the State award in relation to the employee unless it becomes bound as a result of an application by the corporation to the relevant State industrial authority.

(2)        Subitem (1) does not operate so that a State award, or part of a State award, prevails over an award of the Commission.

## 53  Matters to be dealt with by Full Bench

(1)        After the commencement of this Part, a Full Bench may establish principles about varying awards under this Part.

(2)        After such principles (if any) have been established, the power of the Commission to vary an award under this Part is exercisable only by a Full Bench unless the contents of the award:

                     (a)  give effect to determinations of a Full Bench under this Part; or

                     (b)  are consistent with principles established by a Full Bench under this item.

## 54  Certain provisions not discriminatory

(1)        A provision of an award does not discriminate against an employee for the purposes of paragraph 49(8)(f) or 51(7)(f) merely because:

                     (a)  it provides for a junior rate of pay; or

                     (b)  it discriminates, in respect of particular employment, on the basis of the inherent requirements of that employment; or

                     (c)  it discriminates, in respect of employment as a member of the staff of an institution that is conducted in accordance with the teachings or beliefs of a particular religion or creed:

                              (i)  on the basis of those teachings or beliefs; and

                             (ii)  in good faith.

                     (c)  to provide for remedies appropriate to a case where, on arbitration, a termination is found to be harsh, unjust or unreasonable; and

                     (d)  to provide for sanctions where, on recourse to a court, a termination or proposed termination is found to be unlawful; and

                     (e)  by those procedures, remedies and sanctions, and by orders made in the circumstances set out in Subdivisions D and E, to assist in giving effect to the Termination of Employment Convention.

             (1)  If the certificate given by the Commission under subsection 170CF(2) identifies only the ground referred to in paragraph 170CE(1)(a) as a ground where conciliation is, or is likely to be, unsuccessful, the applicant must elect either to proceed to arbitration to determine whether the termination was harsh, unjust or unreasonable or not to proceed.

             (2)  If the certificate given by the Commission under subsection 170CF(2) identifies only:

                     (a)  the ground referred to in paragraph 170CE(1)(a); and

                     (d)  to begin proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction for an order under section 170CR in respect of the alleged contravention of section 170CM.

             (3)  If the certificate given by the Commission under subsection 170CF(2) identifies:

                     (a)  the ground referred to in paragraph 170CE(1)(a); and

                     (b)  a ground or grounds of an alleged contravention of one or more of sections 170CK, 170CL and 170CN;

as grounds where conciliation is, or is likely to be, unsuccessful, the applicant must elect to do either or neither of the following:

                     (c)  to proceed to arbitration to determine whether the termination was harsh, unjust or unreasonable;

                     (d)  to begin proceedings in the Court for an order under section 170CR in respect of the alleged contravention, or of any one or more of the alleged contraventions.

             (4)  If the certificate given by the Commission under subsection 170CF(2) identifies only a ground or grounds of an alleged contravention of one or more of sections 170CK, 170CL, 170CM and 170CN as the ground or grounds where conciliation is, or is likely to be, unsuccessful, the applicant must elect to do either, both or neither of the following:

                     (a)  so far as concerns an alleged contravention of a section or sections other than section 170CM—to begin proceedings in the Court for an order under section 170CR in respect of the alleged contravention, or of any one or more of the alleged contraventions;

                     (b)  so far as concerns an alleged contravention of section 170CM—to begin proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction for an order under section 170CR in respect of the alleged contravention.

             (5)  If the certificate given by the Commission under subsection 170CF(2) identifies:

                     (c)  a ground or grounds of an alleged contravention of one or more of sections 170CK, 170CL and 170CN;

as grounds where conciliation is, or is likely to be, unsuccessful, the applicant must elect:

                     (d)  to do either or both of the things permitted in subsection (2); or

                     (e)  to do either or both of the things permitted in subsection (4); or

                     (a)  be made in writing; and

                     (b)  be lodged with the Commission not later than 7 days after the day of issue of the certificate by the Commission under subsection 170CF(2) in relation to the application.

             (7)  If an applicant fails to lodge with the Commission an election under subsection (1), (2), (3), (4) or (5) within the period required under subsection (6), the application concerned is taken to have been discontinued by the applicant at the end of that period for all purposes other than the making of an election out of time in accordance with subsection (8).

             (8)  The Commission may accept an election that is lodged out of time if the Commission considers that it would be unfair not to do so, and, if the Commission accepts such an election, the original application is taken not to have been discontinued in spite of subsection (7).

##### 170CG  Arbitration

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  the Commission has issued a certificate under subsection 170CF(2) regarding conciliation of an application relating to a termination of employment; and

                     (b)  the applicant has made an election under subsection 170CFA(1), (2), (3) or (5) to proceed to arbitration to determine whether the termination was harsh, unjust or unreasonable;

the Commission may so proceed to arbitrate the matter.

             (2)  Neither the making of an election under subsection 170CFA(1), (2), (3) or (5) to proceed to arbitration nor the commencement of that arbitration prevents further conciliation of the matter being attempted, or the parties from settling the matter, at any time before an order is made under section 170CH.

             (3)  In determining, for the purposes of the arbitration, whether a termination was harsh, unjust or unreasonable, the Commission must have regard to:

                     (a)  whether there was a valid reason for the termination related to the capacity or conduct of the employee or to the operational requirements of the employer’s undertaking, establishment or service; and

                     (b)  whether the employee was notified of that reason; and

                     (c)  whether the employee was given an opportunity to respond to any reason related to the capacity or conduct of the employee; and

                     (d)  if the termination related to unsatisfactory performance by the employee—whether the employee had been warned about that unsatisfactory performance before the termination; and

                     (e)  any other matters that the Commission considers relevant.

##### 170CH  Remedies on arbitration

             (1)  Subject to this section, the Commission may, on completion of the arbitration, make an order that provides for a remedy of a kind referred to in subsection (3), (4) or (6) if it has determined that the termination was harsh, unjust or unreasonable.

             (2)  The Commission must not make an order under subsection (1) unless the Commission is satisfied, having regard to all the circumstances of the case including:

                     (a)  the effect of the order on the viability of the employer’s undertaking, establishment or service; and

                     (b)  the length of the employee’s service with the employer; and

                     (c)  the remuneration that the employee would have received, or would have been likely to receive, if the employee’s employment had not been terminated; and

                     (d)  the efforts of the employee (if any) to mitigate the loss suffered by the employee as a result of the termination; and

                     (e)  any other matter that the Commission considers relevant;

that the remedy ordered is appropriate.

             (3)  If the Commission considers it appropriate, the Commission may make an order requiring the employer to reinstate the employee by:

                     (a)  reappointing the employee to the position in which the employee was employed immediately before the termination.

                     (b)  appointing the employee to another position on terms and conditions no less favourable than those on which the employee was employed immediately before the termination.

             (4)  If the Commission makes an order under subsection (3) and considers it appropriate to do so, the Commission may also make:

                     (a)  any order that the Commission thinks appropriate to maintain the continuity of the employee’s employment; and

                     (b)  subject to subsection (5)—any order that the Commission thinks appropriate to cause the employer to pay to the employee an amount in respect of the remuneration lost, or likely to have been lost, by the employee because of the termination.

             (5)  If, as a result of an application under section 170CP, a court has awarded an amount of damages for a failure to give notice of a termination as required by section 170CM, any amount ordered to be paid by the Commission under paragraph (4)(b) in respect of the termination is to be reduced accordingly.

             (6)  If the Commission thinks that the reinstatement of the employee is inappropriate, the Commission may, if the Commission considers it appropriate in all the circumstances of the case, make an order requiring the employer to pay the employee an amount ordered by the Commission in lieu of reinstatement.

             (7)  Subject to subsection (8), in determining an amount for the purposes of an order under subsection (6), the Commission must have regard to all the circumstances of the case including:

                     (a)  the effect of the order on the viability of the employer’s undertaking, establishment or service; and

                     (b)  the length of the employee’s service with the employer; and

                     (c)  the remuneration that the employee would have received, or would have been likely to receive, if the employee’s employment had not been terminated; and

                     (d)  the efforts of the employee (if any) to mitigate the loss suffered by the employee as a result of the termination; and

                     (e)  any other matter that the Commission considers relevant.

             (8)  In fixing an amount under subsection (6) for an employee who was employed under award conditions immediately before the termination, the Commission must not fix an amount that exceeds the total of the following amounts:

                     (a)  the total amount of remuneration received (other than remuneration received for any period of leave without full pay) by the employee for any period of employment with the employer during the period of 6 months immediately before the termination; and

                     (b)  if the employee was on leave without pay or without full pay while so employed during any part of that period—the amount of remuneration taken to have been received by the employee for the period of leave in accordance with the regulations.

             (9)  In fixing an amount under subsection (6) for an employee who was not employed under award conditions immediately before the termination, the Commission must not fix an amount that exceeds:

                     (a)  the total of the amounts determined under subsection (8) if the employee were an employee covered by the subsection; or

                     (b)  the amount of $32,000, as indexed from time to time in accordance with a formula prescribed by the regulations;

whichever is the lower amount.

           (10)  For the avoidance of doubt, an order by the Commission under paragraph (4)(b) or under subsection (6) may permit the employer concerned to pay the amount required in instalments specified in the order.

##### 170CI  Orders made on arbitration are binding

                   Subject to any right of appeal to a Full Bench of the Commission, an order made by the Commission under section 170CH is final and binding between the parties.

##### 170CJ  Commission may order payment of costs

             (1)  If the Commission is satisfied that a person or organisation made an application under section 170CE vexatiously or without reasonable cause, the Commission may, on an application by the employer under this section, make an order for costs against the person or organisation.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  the Commission has begun arbitrating a matter the subject of an application under section 170CE; and

                     (b)  the Commission is satisfied that a party to the proceeding has acted unreasonably in failing to discontinue the matter before the Commission or to agree to terms of settlement that could lead to the discontinuance of the matter before the conclusion of the arbitration;

the Commission may, on an application under this section by the other party to the proceeding, make an order for costs against the first-mentioned party.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  a person or organisation has made an application under section 170CE; and

                     (b)  the person or organisation elects, under subsection 170CFA(1), (2), (3) or (5) to proceed to arbitration; and

                     (c)  after the making of that election the person or organisation discontinues the matter before the Commission;

the Commission may, on an application made under this section by the employer, make an order for costs against the person or organisation if the Commission is satisfied that the person or organisation has acted unreasonably in failing to discontinue the application at an earlier time.

             (4)  An application for an order for costs under this section must be made within 14 days after the determination or discontinuance of the proceedings before the Commission arising under an application under section 170CE.

             (5)  A schedule of costs may be prescribed in relation to items of expenditure likely to be incurred in respect of an application to the Commission under section 170CE.

             (6)  Without limiting, by implication, the generality of the items of expenditure for which the schedule may provide, those items may include:

                     (a)  legal and professional costs and disbursements; and

                     (b)  expenses arising from the representation of a party by a person or organisation other than on a legal professional basis; and

                     (c)  expenses of witnesses.

             (7)  If a schedule of costs is prescribed for the purposes of subsection (5), then, in awarding costs under this section, the Commission:

                     (a)  is not limited to the items of expenditure appearing in the schedule; but

                     (b)  if an item does appear in the schedule—must not award costs in respect of that item at a rate or of an amount in excess of the rate or amount appearing in the schedule.

#### Subdivision C—Unlawful termination of employment by employer

##### 170CK  Employment not to be terminated on certain grounds

             (1)  In addition to the principal object of this Division set out in section 170CA, the additional object of this section is to make provisions that are intended to assist in giving effect to:

                     (a)  the Convention concerning Discrimination in respect of Employment and Occupation, a copy of the English text of which is set out in Schedule 1 to the _Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986_; and

                     (b)  the Family Responsibilities Convention.

             (2)  Except as provided by subsection (3) or (4), an employer must not terminate an employee’s employment for any one or more of the following reasons, or for reasons including any one or more of the following reasons:

                     (a)  temporary absence from work because of illness or injury within the meaning of the regulations;

                     (b)  trade union membership or participation in trade union activities outside working hours or, with the employer’s consent, during working hours;

                     (c)  non-membership of a trade union;

                     (d)  seeking office as, or acting or having acted in the capacity of, a representative of employees;

                     (e)  the filing of a complaint, or the participation in proceedings, against an employer involving alleged violation of laws or regulations or recourse to competent administrative authorities;

                      (f)  race, colour, sex, sexual preference, age, physical or mental disability, marital status, family responsibilities, pregnancy, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin;

                     (g)  refusing to negotiate in connection with, make, sign, extend, vary or terminate an AWA;

                     (h)  absence from work during maternity leave or other parental leave.

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not prevent a matter referred to in paragraph (2)(f) from being a reason for terminating employment if the reason is based on the inherent requirements of the particular position concerned.

             (4)  Subsection (2) does not prevent a matter referred to in paragraph (2)(f) from being a reason for terminating a person’s employment as a member of the staff of an institution that is conducted in accordance with the doctrines, tenets, beliefs or teachings of a particular religion or creed, if the employer terminates the employment in good faith to avoid injury to the religious susceptibilities of adherents of that religion or creed.

##### 170CL  Employer to notify CES of proposed terminations in certain cases

             (1)  This section applies if an employer decides to terminate the employment of 15 or more employees for reasons of an economic, technological, structural or similar nature, or for reasons including such reasons.

             (2)  As soon as practicable after so deciding and before terminating an employee’s employment because of the decision, the employer must give to the Commonwealth Employment Service a written notice of the intended terminations that sets out:

                     (a)  the reasons for the terminations; and

                     (b)  the number and categories of employees likely to be affected; and

                     (c)  the time when, or the period over which, the employer intends to carry out the terminations.

             (3)  The employer must not terminate an employee’s employment pursuant to the decision unless the employer has complied with subsection (2).

##### 170CM  Employer to give notice of termination

             (1)  Subject to subsection (8), an employer must not terminate an employee’s employment unless:

                     (a)  the employee has been given the required period of notice (see subsections (2) and (3)); or

                     (b)  the employee has been paid the required amount of compensation instead of notice (see subsections (4) and (5)); or

                     (c)  the employee is guilty of serious misconduct, that is, misconduct of such a nature that it would be unreasonable to require the employer to continue the employment of the employee concerned during the required period of notice (see subsection (7)).

             (2)  The required period of notice is to be worked out as follows:

                     (a)  first work out the period of notice using the table at the end of this subsection; and

                     (b)  then increase the period of notice by 1 week if the employee:

##### 170HB  Applications alleging harsh, unjust or unreasonable termination

             (1)  An application must not be made under section 170CE in relation to the termination of employment of an employee on the ground that the termination was harsh, unjust or unreasonable, or on grounds that include that ground, if proceedings (the **_prior proceedings_**) for a remedy in respect of that termination have been commenced by or on behalf of that employee:

for a reason other than a failure by the employer to provide a benefit to which the employee was entitled on the termination.

                     (a)  have been discontinued by the party who began the proceedings; or

                     (b)  to provide a severance payment as a result of the termination; or

                     (c)  to provide any other entitlement payable as a result of the termination;

is taken to be a proceeding alleging that the termination was unlawful because of a failure to provide a benefit to which the employee was entitled on the termination.

             (4)  If an application of the kind referred to in subsection (1) has been made in respect of a termination, a person is not entitled to take proceedings for any other remedy that, if it had been applied for before the application would, because of the operation of subsection (1), have prevented the application unless the application:

                     (a)  under another provision of this Act; or

                     (b)  under another law of the Commonwealth; or

             (3)  If an application of the kind referred to in subsection (1) has been made in respect of a termination, a person is not entitled to take proceedings for any other remedy that, if it had been applied for before that application would, because of the operation of subsection (1), have prevented that application unless the application:

                     (a)  is discontinued by the applicant; or

                     (b)  fails for want of jurisdiction.

                     (a)  a decision or determination covered by subsection (1) or (2), except:

                              (i)  a decision to certify an ordinary Part VIB agreement; or

                             (ii)  a decision or determination that is, in the Commission’s opinion, an order affecting such an agreement;

                     (b)  any written reasons for a decision or determination covered by paragraph (a) that are received by the Registrar;

                     (c)  a multiple-business agreement a copy of which is given to a Registrar under subparagraph (2)(d)(ia).

          (4A)  In subsection (4):

Repeal the Part, substitute:

## Part VIB—Certified agreements

### Division 1—Preliminary

##### 170L  Object

                   The object of this Part is to facilitate the making, and certifying by the Commission, of certain agreements, particularly at the level of a single business or part of a single business.

##### 170LA  Functions of Commission

             (1)  The Commission must, as far as practicable, perform its functions under this Part in a way that furthers the objects of this Act and, in particular, the object of this Part. 

             (2)  Section 90 (Commission to take into account the public interest) does not apply to the performance of functions of the Commission under this Part. 

             (3)  In performing its functions under this Part, the Commission may not act under paragraph 111(1)(g) on the grounds specified in subparagraph (i), (ii) or (iii) of that paragraph.

##### 170LB  Single business and single employer

             (1)  For the purposes of this Part, a **_single business_** is:

                     (a)  a business, project or undertaking that is carried on by an employer; or

                     (b)  the activities carried on by:

                              (i)  the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; or

                             (ii)  a body, association, office or other entity established for a public purpose by or under a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; or

                            (iii)  any other body in which the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory has a controlling interest.

             (2)  For the purposes of this Part:

                     (a)  if 2 or more employers carry on a business, project or undertaking as a joint venture or common enterprise, the employers are taken to be one employer; and

                     (b)  if 2 or more corporations that are related to each other for the purposes of the Corporations Law each carry on a single business:

                              (i)  the corporations may be treated as one employer; and

                             (ii)  the single businesses may be treated as one single business.

             (3)  For the purposes of this Part, a **_part_** of a single business includes, for example:

                     (a)  a geographically distinct part of the single business; or

                     (b)  a distinct operational or organisational unit within the single business.

##### 170LC  Additional operation of Part

             (1)  In addition to its operation apart from this section to a single business, or part of a single business, of an employer, this Part applies, subject to this section, in the same way to any of the following, or any combination or combinations of the following:

                     (a)  one or more single businesses;

                     (b)  one or more parts of single businesses;

carried on by one or more employers.

             (2)  If an application for certification of an agreement by the Commission can only be made under this Part because of subsection (1), the agreement is a **_multiple-business agreement_**.

             (3)  Only a Full Bench may certify a multiple-business agreement under Division 4.

             (4)  A Full Bench, under that Division, must not certify a multiple-business agreement unless it is satisfied that it is in the public interest to certify the agreement, having regard to:

                     (a)  whether the matters dealt with by the agreement could be more appropriately dealt with by an agreement, other than a multiple-business agreement, under this Part; and

                     (b)  any other matter that the Full Bench considers relevant.

             (5)  In spite of section 170LY (which deals with the effect of a certified agreement in relation to awards and other certified agreements), a multiple-business agreement has no effect in so far as it is inconsistent with any other agreement that is certified under Division 4 that is not a multiple-business agreement.

Note 1:       Section 170LY would nevertheless apply to inconsistencies with awards or orders of the Commission or with other multiple-business agreements.

Note 2:       Part VID deals with the relationship between AWAs and all certified agreements.

             (6)  Division 8 (other than sections 170NA and 170NB) does not apply in relation to a proposed multiple-business agreement.

##### 170LD  Nominal expiry date

                   For the purposes of this Part, the **_nominal expiry date_** of a certified agreement is the date specified in the agreement as its nominal expiry date, or that date as extended or further extended under section 170MC.

##### 170LE  Valid majority

                   For the purposes of this Part, a **_valid majority_** of persons employed at a particular time whose employment is or will be subject to an agreement:

                     (a)  make or genuinely make the agreement; or

                     (b)  approve or genuinely approve:

                              (i)  the agreement; or

                             (ii)  the extension of the nominal expiry date of the agreement; or

                            (iii)  the variation or termination of the agreement;

if:

                     (c)  the employer gives all of the persons so employed a reasonable opportunity to decide whether they want to make the agreement or give the approval; and

                     (d)  either:

                              (i)  if subparagraph (ii) does not apply—a majority of the persons; or

                             (ii)  if the decision is made by a vote—a majority of the persons who cast a valid vote;

                            decide, or genuinely decide, that they want to make the agreement or give the approval.

##### 170LF  Working day

                   For the purposes of this Part, a **_working day_**, in relation to a single business or a part of a single business, is a day on which employees normally perform work in that business or part.

##### 170LG  Paid rates award

                   A **_paid rates award_** is an award or a State award that:

                     (a)  includes a statement to the effect that it is a paid rates award; or

                     (b)  has been regarded by the Commission, or a State industrial authority, as the case may be, as a paid rates award when applying principles for the purposes of determining wages and conditions of employment.

### Division 2—Making agreements with constitutional corporations or the Commonwealth

##### 170LH  What this Division covers

                   This Division sets out requirements that must be satisfied for applications to be made to the Commission to certify certain agreements between employers who are constitutional corporations or the Commonwealth and:

                     (a)  organisations of employees; or

                     (b)  employees.

##### 170LI  Nature of agreement

             (1)  For an application to be made to the Commission under this Division, there must be an agreement, in writing, about matters pertaining to the relationship between:

                     (a)  an employer who is a constitutional corporation or the Commonwealth; and

                     (b)  all persons who, at any time when the agreement is in operation, are employed in a single business, or a part of a single business, of the employer and whose employment is subject to the agreement.

Note:          Section 5AA also allows agreements to be made on a different constitutional basis about matters pertaining to the relationship between an employer and employees.

             (2)  The agreement must be made in accordance with section 170LJ, 170LK or 170LL.

##### 170LJ  Agreement with organisations of employees

             (1)  The employer may make the agreement with one or more organisations of employees where, when the agreement is made, each organisation:

                     (a)  has at least one member employed in the single business or part whose employment will be subject to the agreement; and

                     (b)  is entitled to represent the industrial interests of the member in relation to work that will be subject to the agreement.

             (2)  The agreement must be approved by a valid majority of the persons employed at the time whose employment will be subject to the agreement.

             (3)  The employer must take reasonable steps to ensure that:

                     (a)  at least 14 days before any approval is given, all the persons either have, or have ready access to, the agreement, in writing; and

                     (b)  before any approval is given, the terms of the agreement are explained to all the persons.

             (4)  An agreement must not be made under this section if it is able to be made under section 170LL (which deals with greenfields agreements).

##### 170LK  Agreement with employees

             (1)  The employer may make the agreement with a valid majority of the persons employed at the time whose employment will be subject to the agreement.

             (2)  The employer must take reasonable steps to ensure that every person employed at the time whose employment will be subject to the agreement has at least 14 days’ notice, in writing, of intention to make the agreement, and the agreement must not be made before those 14 days have passed.

             (3)  At or before the time when the notice is given, the employer must take reasonable steps to ensure that every such person either has, or has ready access to, the proposed agreement, in writing.

             (4)  The notice must also state that if:

                     (a)  any person whose employment will be subject to the agreement is a member of an organisation of employees; and

                     (b)  the organisation is entitled to represent the person’s industrial interests in relation to work that will be subject to the agreement;

the person may request the organisation to represent the person in meeting and conferring with the employer about the agreement.

             (5)  If an organisation is so requested to represent such a person, the employer must give the organisation a reasonable opportunity to meet and confer with the employer about the agreement before it is made.

             (6)  If at any time after the request is made:

                     (a)  the person withdraws the request; or

                     (b)  the conditions in paragraphs (4)(a) and (b) cease to be met;

the requirement in subsection (5) ceases to apply to the employer.

             (7)  Before the agreement is made, the employer must take reasonable steps to ensure that the terms of the agreement are explained to all the persons employed at the time whose employment will be subject to the agreement.

             (8)  If a proposed agreement is varied for any reason after the notice is given, the steps in subsections (2), (3), (5) and (7) must again be taken in relation to the proposed agreement as varied.

##### 170LL  Greenfields agreement

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  the single business is a new business that the employer proposes to establish, or is establishing, when the agreement is to be made; and

                     (b)  the agreement is to be made before the employment of any of the persons who will be necessary for the normal operation of the business or part and whose employment will be subject to the agreement;

then the employer may make the agreement with one or more organisations of employees meeting the requirements of subsection (2).

             (2)  When the agreement is made, each organisation must be entitled to represent the industrial interests of one or more of the persons, whose employment is likely to be subject to the agreement, in relation to work that will be subject to the agreement.

##### 170LM  Making the application for certification

             (1)  The application for the Commission to certify the agreement must state that it is made under this Division.

             (2)  The application must be made no later than 21 days after:

                     (a)  if it is made in accordance with section 170LJ—the day on which it is approved as mentioned in subsection 170LJ(2); or

                     (b)  if it is made in accordance with section 170LK or 170LL—the day on which it is made.

### Division 3—Making agreements about industrial disputes and industrial situations

##### 170LN  What this Division covers

                   This Division sets out requirements that must be satisfied for an application to be made to the Commission to certify certain agreements:

                     (a)  to settle, further settle or maintain the settlement of, or to prevent, industrial disputes; or

                     (b)  to prevent industrial situations from giving rise to industrial disputes.

##### 170LO  Agreement about industrial dispute

                   If an employer who is carrying on a single business is or was a party to an industrial dispute, the employer may agree with one or more organisations of employees with whom the employer is or was in dispute on terms for:

                     (a)  settling or further settling all or any of the matters that are in dispute; or

                     (b)  maintaining a settlement of all or any of the matters that were in dispute, whether the settlement was made by an award, a certified agreement or otherwise; or

                     (c)  preventing further industrial disputes between them.

##### 170LP  Agreement about industrial situation

                   If the parties to an industrial situation are, or include, an employer carrying on a single business and one or more organisations of employees, the employer and any of the organisations may agree on terms for preventing the situation from giving rise to an industrial dispute involving them. 

##### 170LQ  Multiple disputes and situations

                   A single agreement may deal with 2 or more disputes or situations.

##### 170LR  Approval by valid majority of employees

             (1)  The agreement must be approved by a valid majority of the persons employed at the time whose employment will be subject to the agreement.

             (2)  The employer must take reasonable steps to ensure that:

                     (a)  at least 14 days before any approval is given, all the persons either have, or have ready access to, the agreement, in writing; and

                     (b)  before any approval is given, the terms of the agreement are explained to all the persons.

##### 170LS  Making the application for certification

             (1)  The application to the Commission to certify the agreement must state that it is made under this Division.

             (2)  The application must be made no later than 21 days after the day on which it is approved as mentioned in subsection 170LR(1).

### Division 4—Certifying agreements

##### 170LT  Certifying an agreement

             (1)  If an application is made to the Commission in accordance with Division 2 or 3 to certify an agreement, the Commission must certify the agreement if, and must not certify the agreement unless, it is satisfied that the requirements of this section are met.

             (2)  The agreement must pass the no-disadvantage test (see Part VIE).

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  the only reason why the Commission must not certify an agreement is that the agreement does not pass the no-disadvantage test; and

                     (b)  the Commission is satisfied that certifying the agreement is not contrary to the public interest;

the agreement is taken to pass the no-disadvantage test.

             (4)  An example of a case where the Commission may be satisfied that certifying the agreement is not contrary to the public interest is where making the agreement is part of a reasonable strategy to deal with a short-term crisis in, and to assist in the revival of, the single business or part.

             (5)  If the agreement was made in accordance with section 170LJ or Division 3, a valid majority of persons employed at the time whose employment would be subject to the agreement must have genuinely approved the agreement.

             (6)  If the agreement was made in accordance with section 170LK, a valid majority of persons employed at the time whose employment would be subject to the agreement must have genuinely made the agreement.

             (7)  The explanation of the terms of the agreement to persons as mentioned in paragraph 170LJ(3)(b), subsection 170LK(7) or paragraph 170LR(2)(b) must have taken place in ways that were appropriate, having regard to the persons’ particular circumstances and needs. An example of such a case would be where the persons included:

                     (a)  women; or

                     (b)  persons from a non-English speaking background; or

                     (c)  young persons.

             (8)  The agreement must include procedures for preventing and settling disputes between:

                     (a)  the employer; and

                     (b)  the employees whose employment will be subject to the agreement;

about matters arising under the agreement.

             (9)  If the agreement was made in accordance with section 170LK, the employer must not have coerced, or attempted to coerce, any employee:

                     (a)  not to make a request as mentioned in subsection 170LK(4); or

                     (b)  to withdraw such a request.

           (10)  The agreement must specify a date as the nominal expiry date of the agreement, and that date cannot be more than 3 years after the date on which the agreement will come into operation.

##### 170LU  When Commission to refuse to certify an agreement

             (1)  Despite section 170LT, if the application for certification states that it is made under Division 3, the Commission must refuse to certify the agreement unless it is satisfied that the agreement will:

                     (a)  settle or further settle all or any of the matters that are the subject of the industrial dispute; or

                     (b)  maintain a settlement of all or any of the matters that were the subject of the industrial dispute, whether the settlement was made by an award, a certified agreement or otherwise; or

                     (c)  prevent further industrial disputes between the persons concerned; or

                     (d)  prevent the industrial situation from giving rise to an industrial dispute involving the persons concerned; or

                     (e)  assist in doing any of the things mentioned in paragraphs (a) to (d).

             (2)  Despite section 170LT, the Commission must refuse to certify an agreement if the Commission thinks that a provision of the agreement is inconsistent with:

                     (a)  a provision of Division 3 of Part VIA; or

                     (b)  an order by the Commission under that Division; or

                     (c)  an injunction granted, or any other order made, by the Court under that Division.

             (3)  Despite section 170LT, the Commission must refuse to certify an agreement if it is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the employer has, in connection with negotiating the agreement, contravened section 170NB or Part XA (which deals with freedom of association); or

                     (b)  the employer has caused a person or body to engage, in connection with negotiations for an agreement, in conduct that, had the employer engaged in the conduct, would be a contravention by the employer of section 170NB or Part XA; or

                     (c)  a person or body has, on behalf of the employer:

                              (i)  so engaged in such conduct; or

                             (ii)  caused another person or body so to engage in such conduct.

             (4)  Subsection (3) does not apply if the Commission is satisfied that the contravention or conduct, and its effects, have been fully remedied.

             (5)  Despite section 170LT, the Commission must refuse to certify an agreement if it thinks that a provision of the agreement discriminates against an employee, whose employment will be subject to the agreement, because of, or for reasons including, race, colour, sex, sexual preference, age, physical or mental disability, marital status, family responsibilities, pregnancy, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin.

             (6)  For the purposes of subsection (5), a provision of an agreement does not discriminate against an employee merely because:

                     (a)  it provides for a junior rate of pay; or

                     (b)  it discriminates, in respect of particular employment, on the basis of the inherent requirements of that employment; or

                     (c)  it discriminates, in respect of employment as a member of the staff of an institution that is conducted in accordance with the teachings or beliefs of a particular religion or creed:

                              (i)  on the basis of those teachings or beliefs; and

                             (ii)  in good faith.

             (7)  Paragraph (6)(a) does not apply for the purposes of any application of subsection (5) by the Commission more than 3 years after 22 June 1997, except where the Commission decides, on a case-by-case basis, that the paragraph should apply. Decisions by the Commission as to whether the paragraph should apply must be made by the Commission in accordance with principles established by a Full Bench.

             (8)  Despite section 170LT, the Commission must refuse to certify an agreement if:

                     (a)  the agreement applies only to a part of a single business that is neither of the following:

                              (i)  a geographically distinct part of the single business; or

                             (ii)  a distinct operational or organisational unit within the single business; and

                     (b)  the Commission considers that the agreement defines that part in a way that results in the employment of employees not being subject to the agreement where it would be reasonable for the employment to be, having regard to:

                              (i)  the nature of the work performed by the employees whose employment is not subject to the agreement; and

                             (ii)  the organisational and operational relationships between that part and the rest of the single business; and

                     (c)  the Commission considers it unfair that the employment of those employees is not subject to the agreement.

##### 170LV  Other options open to Commission instead of refusing to certify an agreement

             (1)  If, under section 170LT or 170LU, the Commission has grounds to refuse to certify an agreement:

                     (a)  the Commission may accept an undertaking from one or more of the persons who made the agreement in relation to the operation of the agreement and, if satisfied that the undertaking meets the Commission’s concerns, certify the agreement; and

                     (b)  in any case, before refusing to certify the agreement, the Commission must give the persons who made the agreement an opportunity to take any action that may be necessary to make the agreement certifiable.

             (2)  If an undertaking is not complied with, the Commission, after giving the persons who made the agreement an opportunity to be heard, may:

                     (a)  order the one or more persons who gave the undertaking to comply with it; or

                     (b)  by order, terminate the agreement.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  after doing the things required or permitted by subsection (1), the Commission is still required to refuse to certify the agreement; and

                     (b)  it is so required only because it is not satisfied as mentioned in subsection 170LU(1);

the Commission may conciliate the industrial dispute or industrial situation concerned with a view to assisting the persons concerned to make the agreement certifiable.

##### 170LW  Procedures for preventing and settling disputes

                   Procedures in a certified agreement for preventing and settling disputes between the employer and employees whose employment will be subject to the agreement may, if the Commission so approves, empower the Commission to do either or both of the following:

                     (a)  to settle disputes over the application of the agreement;

                     (b)  to appoint a board of reference as described in section 131 for the purpose of settling such disputes.

### Division 5—Effect of certified agreements

##### 170LX  When a certified agreement is in operation

             (1)  A certified agreement comes into operation when it is certified and, subject to this section, remains in operation at all times afterwards.

             (2)  The agreement ceases to be in operation if:

                     (a)  its nominal expiry date has passed; and

                     (b)  it is replaced by another certified agreement.

             (3)  The agreement:

                     (a)  ceases to be in operation if it is terminated under section 170LV, 170ME, 170MG, 170MH or 170MHA; and

                     (b)  does not operate if subsection 170LY(2) applies.

The agreement may also be set aside under subsection 113(2A).

Note:          Sections 170LV and 170ME deal with breaches of undertakings. Sections 170MG, 170MH and 170MHA deal with voluntary termination. Subsection 113(2A) deals with discriminatory agreements.

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  the application for certification of an agreement states that the application is made under Division 2; and

                     (b)  at any time when the agreement is in operation, the employer who made the agreement, or any employer who is bound by the agreement under section 170MB (which deals with successor employers), is a constitutional corporation; and

                     (c)  at any later time while bound by the agreement, any such employer ceases to be a constitutional corporation;

the agreement ceases to apply to the single business or part carried on by that employer.

##### 170LY  Effect of a certified agreement in relation to awards and other certified agreements

             (1)  While a certified agreement is in operation:

                     (a)  subject to this section, it prevails over an award or order of the Commission, to the extent of any inconsistency with the award or order; and

                     (b)  it has no effect to the extent of any inconsistency with another agreement certified before it, whose nominal expiry date has not passed.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  an award is made under subsection 170MX(3) (which deals with the exercise of arbitration powers on termination of a bargaining period); and

                     (b)  before the award is made, or after it is made but before its nominal expiry date passes, a certified agreement is certified; and

                     (c)  the employment of at least one employee is subject to both the award and the certified agreement;

the certified agreement does not operate at any time while the award operates.

             (3)  An exceptional matters order prevails, to the extent of any inconsistency, over a certified agreement that was certified before the order was made.

Note:          Part VID deals with the relationship between AWAs and certified agreements.

##### 170LZ  Effect of a certified agreement on Commonwealth laws or State laws, awards or agreements

             (1)  Subject to this section, a certified agreement prevails over terms and conditions of employment specified in a State law, State award or State employment agreement, to the extent of any inconsistency.

             (2)  Provisions in a certified agreement that deal with the following matters operate subject to the provisions of a State law that deals with the matter:

                     (a)  occupational health and safety; 

                     (b)  workers’ compensation; 

                     (c)  apprenticeship; 

                     (d)  any other matter prescribed by the regulations.

             (3)  If a State law, State award or State employment agreement provides a remedy for the termination of an employee’s employment, subsection (1) is not intended to affect the provisions of the State law, State award or State employment agreement that relate to termination of employment, so far as those provisions are able to operate concurrently with the certified agreement.

             (4)  To the extent of any inconsistency, a certified agreement displaces prescribed conditions of employment specified in a Commonwealth law that is prescribed by the regulations.

             (5)  In this section:

                   **_Commonwealth law_** means an Act or any regulations or other instrument made under an Act.

                 **_prescribed conditions_** means conditions that are identified by the regulations.

                    <a name="state-law"></a>**_State law_** means a law of a State or Territory (including any regulations or other instrument made under a law of a State or Territory), but does not include a State award or a State employment agreement.

### Division 6—Persons bound by certified agreements

##### 170M  Persons bound in Division 2 cases

             (1)  If the application for certification states that the application is made under Division 2, the certified agreement binds:

                     (a)  the employer; and

                     (b)  all persons whose employment is, at any time when the agreement is in operation, subject to the agreement.

             (2)  If, in accordance with section 170LJ or 170LL, one or more organisations of employees made the agreement with the employer, the agreement also binds the one or more organisations.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  the application for certification states that the application is made under Division 2; and

                     (b)  in accordance with section 170LK, a valid majority of persons made the agreement with the employer; and

                     (c)  before the agreement is certified, an organisation of employees notifies the Commission and the employer in writing that it wants to be bound by the agreement; and

                     (d)  the organisation satisfies the Commission that it has at least one member:

                              (i)  whose employment will be subject to the agreement; and

                             (ii)  whose industrial interests the organisation is entitled to represent in relation to work that will be subject to the agreement; and

                            (iii)  who requested the organisation to give the notification;

the Commission must, by order, determine that the agreement binds the organisation.

##### 170MA  Persons bound in Division 3 cases

                   If the application for certification states that the application is made under Division 3, the certified agreement binds:

                     (a)  the employer and the one or more organisations of employees concerned; and

                     (b)  all members of the one or more organisations of employees concerned.

                     (b)  at a later time:

                              (i)  if the application for certification of the agreement stated that it was made under Division 2—a new employer that is a constitutional corporation or the Commonwealth; or

                             (ii)  if the application stated that it was made under Division 3—a new employer;

becomes the successor, transmittee or assignee (whether immediate or not) of the whole or a part of the business concerned, then, from the later time:

                     (c)  the new employer is bound by the certified agreement, to the extent that it relates to the whole or the part of the business; and

                     (d)  the previous employer ceases to be bound by the certified agreement, to the extent that it relates to the whole or the part of the business; and

                     (e)  a reference in this Part to the employer includes a reference to the new employer, and ceases to refer to the previous employer, to the extent that the context relates to the whole or the part of the business.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not affect the rights and obligations of the previous employer that arose before the later time.

### Division 7—Extending, varying or terminating certified agreements

##### 170MC  Extending the nominal expiry date

             (1)  On or before the nominal expiry date of a certified agreement:

                     (a)  if paragraph (b) does not apply—the employer; or

                     (b)  if one or more organisations are bound by the agreement—the employer and the one or more organisations;

may, in writing, extend the nominal expiry date of the agreement. The extended date cannot be more than 3 years after the date on which the agreement came into operation.

             (2)  The extension has no effect unless the Commission approves it.

             (3)  The Commission must, by order, approve the extension if, and must not approve the extension unless, it is satisfied that a valid majority of the employees whose employment is subject to the agreement at the time genuinely approve the extension.

             (4)  The extension takes effect when the Commission’s order takes effect.

             (5)  This section does not apply to an agreement:

                     (a)  to which section 170LL (greenfields agreements) applied; or

                     (b)  to which subsection 170LT(3) applied, in circumstances covered by the example in subsection 170LT(4) (short-term business crises).

##### 170MD  Varying a certified agreement

             (1)  Either:

                     (a)  if paragraph (b) does not apply—the employer; or

                     (b)  if one or more organisations are bound by the agreement—the employer and the one or more organisations;

may, in writing, vary the agreement.

             (2)  The variation has no effect unless the Commission approves it.

             (3)  The Commission must, by order, approve the variation if, and must not approve the variation unless, it is satisfied that:

                     (a)  a valid majority of the employees whose employment is subject to the agreement at the time genuinely approve the variation; and

                     (b)  the Commission would be required to certify the agreement as varied if it were a new agreement whose certification was applied for under this Part.

             (4)  In applying paragraph (3)(b):

                     (a)  any requirement about a majority of persons making or approving the agreement is taken to be satisfied; and

                     (b)  section 170LV (which deals with undertakings in the context of certifying an agreement) is to be disregarded.

Note:          Section 170ME instead deals with undertakings in relation to the variation.

             (5)  The variation takes effect when the Commission’s order takes effect.

             (6)  The Commission may, on application by any person bound by a certified agreement, by order vary a certified agreement:

                     (a)  for the purpose of removing ambiguity or uncertainty; or

                     (b)  for the purpose of including, omitting or varying a term (however expressed) that authorises an employer to stand-down an employee.

             (7)  A certified agreement is not able to be varied except in accordance with:

                     (a)  this section (including as it applies in accordance with section 170MDA); or

                     (b)  subsection 113(2A) (which deals with discriminatory agreements); or

                     (c)  section 170MC (extending the nominal expiry date); or

                     (d)  section 170ME (which deals with undertakings).

Note:          Subsection (7) would not apply to an agreement in so far as the obligations under the agreement can change because of the terms of the agreement itself.

##### 170MDA  Variation where discrimination between unionists and non-unionists

                   If:

                     (a)  one or more employees whose employment is not subject to the agreement request the employer to:

                              (i)  vary the agreement so that the employment of the employees is subject to the agreement; and

                             (ii)  seek the approval of the Commission for the variation under section 170MD; and

                     (b)  the employment of the employees would be subject to the agreement if:

                              (i)  they were members of an organisation of employees or of a particular organisation of employees; or

                             (ii)  they were not members of an organisation of employees or of a particular organisation of employees; and

                     (c)  the variation would not cause the agreement to become a multiple-business agreement;

the employer must comply with the request.

             (2)  If, in accordance with the request, the employer seeks the approval of the Commission to the variation under subsection 170MD(3), the Commission must disregard paragraph 170MD(3)(a) in deciding whether to approve the variation.

##### 170ME  Other options open to Commission instead of refusing to approve variation of an agreement

             (1)  If, under section 170MD, the Commission has grounds to refuse to approve a variation of an agreement:

                     (a)  the Commission may accept an undertaking from one or more of the persons who varied the agreement in relation to the operation of the agreement as varied and, if satisfied that the undertaking meets the Commission’s concerns, approve the variation; and

                     (b)  in any case, before refusing to approve the variation, the Commission must give the persons who varied the agreement an opportunity to take any action that may be necessary to allow the variation to be approved.

             (2)  If an undertaking is not complied with, the Commission, after giving the persons who varied the agreement an opportunity to be heard, may:

                     (a)  order the one or more persons who gave the undertaking to comply with it; or

                     (b)  by order, vary the agreement so as to undo the effect of the approved variation; or

                     (c)  by order, terminate the agreement.

##### 170MG  Terminating a certified agreement where valid majority approve at any time

             (1)  Either:

                     (a)  if paragraph (b) does not apply—the employer; or

                     (b)  if one or more organisations are bound by the agreement—the employer and the one or more organisations; 

may, in writing, terminate the agreement.

             (2)  The termination has no effect unless the Commission approves it.

             (3)  The Commission must, by order, approve the termination of the agreement if, and must not approve the termination unless, it is satisfied that a valid majority of the employees whose employment is subject to the agreement at the time genuinely approve its termination.

             (4)  The termination takes effect when the Commission’s order takes effect.

##### 170MH  Terminating a certified agreement in public interest after nominal expiry date

                     (c)  an organisation of employees that is bound by the agreement and that has at least one member whose employment is subject to the agreement;

may apply to the Commission to have the agreement terminated.

             (2)  On receiving the application, the Commission must take such steps as it considers appropriate to obtain the views of persons bound by the agreement about whether it should be terminated.

             (3)  If, after complying with subsection (2), the Commission considers that it is not contrary to the public interest to terminate the agreement, the Commission must, by order, terminate the agreement.

             (4)  The termination takes effect when the Commission’s order takes effect.

##### 170MHA  Terminating an agreement in a way provided under agreement after nominal expiry date

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a certified agreement makes provision for it to be terminated if certain conditions are met; and

                     (b)  those conditions are met after the agreement’s nominal expiry date has passed;

any of the persons mentioned in subsection (2) may apply to the Commission to have the termination approved.

             (2)  The persons are:

                     (a)  the employer; or

                     (b)  an employee whose employment is subject to the agreement; or

                     (c)  an organisation of employees that is bound by the agreement and that has at least one member whose employment is subject to the agreement.

             (3)  If the Commission is satisfied that the requirements of paragraphs (1)(a) and (b) are complied with, it must, by order, approve the termination.

             (4)  If the Commission does so, the agreement terminates when the Commission’s order takes effect.

                     (b)  if the initiating party is an employer who intends to try to make an agreement under section 170LJ or 170LL or Division 3—the organisation or organisations who are proposed to be bound by the agreement;

                     (c)  if the initiating party is an employer who intends to try to make an agreement under section 170LK—the employees at the time whose employment will be subject to the agreement;

                     (d)  if the initiating party is an organisation of employees—the employer who is proposed to be bound by the agreement;

##### 170MJ  Particulars to accompany notice

                   The notice is to be accompanied by particulars of:

                     (a)  the single business or part of the single business to be covered by the proposed agreement; and

##### 170ML  Protected action

             (1)  This section identifies certain action (**_protected action_**) to which the provisions in section 170MT (which confers certain legal immunity on protected action) are to apply.

             (2)  During the bargaining period:

                     (a)  an organisation of employees that is a negotiating party; or

                     (b)  a member of such an organisation who is employed by the employer; or

                     (c)  an officer or employee of such an organisation acting in that capacity; or

                     (d)  an employee who is a negotiating party;

is entitled, for the purpose of:

                     (e)  supporting or advancing claims made in respect of the proposed agreement; or

                      (f)  responding to a lockout by the employer of employees whose employment will be subject to the agreement;

to organise or engage in industrial action directly against the employer and, if the organisation, member, officer or employee does so, the organising of, or engaging in, that industrial action is protected action.

             (3)  Subject to subsection (6), during the bargaining period, the employer is entitled, for the purpose of:

                     (b)  responding to industrial action by any of the employees whose employment will be subject to the agreement; 

to lock out from their employment all or any of the employees whose employment will be subject to the agreement and, if the employer does so, the lockout is protected action.

Note 1:       The existence of this entitlement does not affect any right of the employer to refuse to pay the employee where, under the common law, the employer is permitted to do so because the employee has not performed work as directed.

Note 2:       The existence of this entitlement also does not affect any authorisation of the employer to stand-down the employee as a result of a variation of an award under section 126, nor does it affect the Commission’s powers under that section to vary an award to give such an authorisation.

             (4)  The reference in subsection (3) to the employer locking out employees from their employment is a reference to the employer preventing employees from performing work under their contracts of employment without terminating those contracts.

             (5)  If the employer locks out employees from their employment in accordance with subsection (3), the employer is entitled to refuse to pay any remuneration to the employees in respect of the period of the lockout.

             (6)  The employer is not entitled to lock out employees from their employment under subsection (3) unless the continuity of the employees’ employment for such purposes as are prescribed by the regulations is not affected by the lockout.

             (2)  If, under subsection 135(2B), the Commission has ordered that a vote of employees be taken by secret ballot in respect of a proposed agreement, the organising of, or engaging in, industrial action by the employees after the making of the order is not protected action unless:

                     (a)  such a ballot has been taken; and

                     (b)  the industrial action has been approved by a majority of the valid votes cast in the ballot.

##### 170MR  Industrial action must be duly authorised

             (1)  Engaging in industrial action by members of an organisation of employees that is a negotiating party is not protected action unless, before the industrial action begins:

                     (a)  the industrial action is duly authorised by a committee of management of the organisation or by someone authorised by such a committee to authorise the industrial action; and

                     (b)  if the rules of the organisation provide for the way in which the industrial action is to be authorised—the industrial action is duly authorised under those rules; and

                     (c)  written notice of the giving of the authorisation is given to a Registrar.

             (2)  Industrial action is taken, for the purposes of this section, to be duly authorised under the rules of an organisation of employees even though a technical breach has occurred in authorising the industrial action, so long as the person or persons who committed the breach acted in good faith.

             (3)  Examples of a technical breach in authorising industrial action are as follows:

                     (a)  a contravention of the rules of the organisation;

                     (b)  an error or omission in complying with the requirements of this Act;

                     (c)  participation, by a person not eligible to do so, in the making of a decision by a committee of management, or by members, of the organisation.

             (4)  Industrial action is taken, for the purposes of this section, to have been duly authorised under the rules of an organisation of employees, and to have been so authorised before the industrial action began, unless:

                     (a)  the Court declares in a proceeding that the industrial action was not duly authorised under those rules; and

                     (b)  the proceeding was brought in the Court within 6 months after the notification in relation to the industrial action was given to a Registrar under paragraph (1)(c).

             (5)  In so far as the rules of an organisation of employees provide for the way in which industrial action that section 170ML entitles the organisation to organise or engage in is to be authorised, the rules do not contravene section 196 unless the manner provided for contravenes that section.

##### 170MS  What happens if application to certify agreement is not made within 21 days

                   Unless an application to the Commission to certify an agreement is made within 21 days after the day when the agreement is made, nothing that was done during the bargaining period by an employee whose employment is subject to the agreement or by a person bound by the agreement is protected action.

##### 170MT  Immunity provisions

             (1)  An order made by the Commission under section 127 does not apply to protected action.

             (2)  Subject to subsection (3), no action lies under any law (whether written or unwritten) in force in a State or Territory in respect of any industrial action that is protected action unless the industrial action has involved or is likely to involve:

                     (a)  personal injury; or

                     (b)  wilful or reckless destruction of, or damage to, property; or

                     (c)  the unlawful taking, keeping or use of property.

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not prevent an action for defamation being brought in respect of anything that occurred in the course of industrial action.

##### 170MU  Employer not to dismiss employee etc. for engaging in protected action

             (1)  An employer must not:

                     (a)  dismiss an employee, injure an employee in his or her employment or alter the position of an employee to the employee’s prejudice; or

                     (b)  threaten to dismiss an employee, injure an employee in his or her employment or alter the position of an employee to the employee’s prejudice;

wholly or partly because the employee is proposing to engage, is engaging, or has engaged, in protected action.

             (2)  Subsection (1) of this section does not apply to any of the following actions taken by the employer:

                     (a)  standing-down the employee;

                     (b)  refusing to pay the employee where, under the common law, the employer is permitted to do so because the employee has not performed work as directed;

                     (c)  action of the employer that is itself protected action.

             (3)  In proceedings under section 170NF for an alleged contravention of subsection (1) of this section, it is to be presumed, unless the employer proves otherwise, that the alleged conduct of the employer was carried out wholly or partly because the employee was proposing to engage, was engaging, or had engaged, in protected action.

##### 170MV  When bargaining period ends

                   The bargaining period ends if any of the following events occurs:

                     (a)  an agreement under Division 2 or 3 is made by the employer and any one or more of the other negotiating parties; or

                     (b)  the initiating party tells the other negotiating party or each of the other negotiating parties in writing that the initiating party no longer wants to reach an agreement under Division 2 or 3 with that other party or those other parties; or

                     (c)  the Commission terminates the bargaining period.

##### 170MW  Power of Commission to suspend or terminate bargaining period

             (1)  Subject to subsection (8), the Commission may, by order, suspend or terminate the bargaining period if, after giving the negotiating parties an opportunity to be heard, it is satisfied that any of the circumstances set out in subsections (2) to (7) exists or existed.

             (2)  A circumstance for the purposes of subsection (1) is that a negotiating party that, before or during the bargaining period, has organised or taken, or is organising or taking, industrial action to support or advance claims in respect of the proposed agreement:

                     (a)  did not genuinely try to reach an agreement with the other negotiating parties before organising or taking the industrial action; or

                     (b)  is not genuinely trying to reach an agreement with the other negotiating parties; or

                     (c)  has failed to comply with any directions by the Commission that relate to the proposed agreement or to a matter that arose during the negotiations for the proposed agreement; or

                     (d)  has failed to comply with a recommendation of the Commission under section 111AA that relates to the proposed agreement or to a matter that arose during the negotiations for the proposed agreement.

             (3)  A circumstance for the purposes of subsection (1) is that industrial action that is being taken to support or advance claims in respect of the proposed agreement is threatening:

                     (a)  to endanger the life, the personal safety or health, or the welfare, of the population or of part of it; or 

                     (b)  to cause significant damage to the Australian economy or an important part of it.

             (4)  A circumstance for the purposes of subsection (1) is that industrial action is being organised or taken by:

                     (a)  an organisation that is a negotiating party; or

                     (b)  a member of such an organisation who is employed by the employer; or

                     (c)  an officer or employee of such an organisation acting in that capacity;

against an employer to support or advance claims in respect of employees:

                     (d)  whose employment will be subject to the agreement; and

                     (e)  who are neither members, nor eligible to become members, of the organisation.

             (5)  A circumstance for the purposes of subsection (1) is that industrial action that is being organised or taken by an organisation that is a negotiating party:

                     (a)  relates, to a significant extent, to a demarcation dispute; or

                     (b)  contravenes an order of the Commission that relates, to a significant extent, to a demarcation dispute.

             (6)  If the bargaining period relates to employees employed in a part of a single business, a circumstance for the purposes of subsection (1) is that the initiating party is not complying with an award or order, a direction of the Commission, or a certified agreement, in relation to another part of the single business.

             (7)  A circumstance for the purposes of subsection (1) is that:

                     (a)  immediately before the commencement of this section, the wages and conditions of the kind of employees whose employment will be subject to the agreement were determined by a paid rates award, or would have been so determined if a certified agreement, an enterprise flexibility agreement (within the meaning of this Act as then in force) or a State employment agreement had not prevailed over the award; and

                     (b)  so far as the wages and conditions of the kind of employees whose employment will be subject to the agreement were, before the commencement of this section, customarily determined by an award or a State award, they were determined by a paid rates award; and

                     (c)  there is no reasonable prospect of the negotiating parties reaching an agreement under Division 2 or 3 during the bargaining period.

             (8)  The Commission:

                     (a)  may not make an order under subsection (1), in a circumstance set out in subsection (2), (4), (5), (6) or (7), except on application by a negotiating party; but

                     (b)  may make an order under subsection (1), in a circumstance set out in subsection (3):

                              (i)  on its own initiative; or

                             (ii)  on application by a negotiating party or the Minister.

             (9)  Anything done by a negotiating party or any other person in respect of the proposed agreement is not protected action if it is done at a time when the bargaining period is suspended.

           (10)  An order under subsection (1) terminating the bargaining period may, if the Commission considers it to be in the public interest, contain a declaration that, during a specified period beginning at the time of the termination, a specified negotiating party or employee of the employer:

                     (a)  is not allowed to initiate a new bargaining period in relation to specified matters that are dealt with by the proposed agreement; or

                     (b)  may initiate such a bargaining period only on conditions specified in the declaration.

##### 170MX  What happens if Commission terminates a bargaining period under subsection 170MW(3) or (7)

             (1)  This section applies if a bargaining period is terminated on the ground set out in subsection 170MW(3) or (7).

             (2)  As soon as practicable, the Commission must begin to exercise the conciliation powers mentioned in section 170MY:

                     (a)  to facilitate the making of an agreement under Division 2 or 3; or

                     (b)  otherwise to settle any matter or issue that could be covered by such an agreement.

This subsection applies even if the Commission has already attempted conciliation during the bargaining period.

             (3)  If, after exercising conciliation powers as required by subsection (2), the Commission is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the negotiating parties have not settled the matters that were at issue during the bargaining period (whether or not by making an agreement); and

                     (b)  it is not likely that further conciliation will result in the matters being settled within a reasonable time;

the Commission must, if it considers it appropriate, exercise the arbitration powers mentioned in section 170MY to make an award that deals with the matters.

             (4)  Despite any other provision of this Act, those arbitration powers may only be exercised by a Full Bench.

             (5)  In exercising those arbitration powers, the Full Bench must have regard to the following:

                     (a)  the matters that were at issue during the bargaining period;

                     (b)  the merits of the case;

                     (c)  the interests of the negotiating parties and the public interest;

                     (d)  how productivity might be improved in the business or part of the business concerned;

                     (e)  the extent to which the conduct of the negotiating parties during the bargaining period was reasonable;

                      (f)  any relevant principles formulated by a Full Bench for the purposes of this subsection.

             (6)  Subsection (5) does not, by implication, limit the matters to which the Full Bench may have regard.

##### 170MY  Commission’s powers where section 170MX applies

             (1)  The Commission has the conciliation and arbitration powers in relation to the matters mentioned in subsections 170MX(2) and (3) that it would have under Part VI in relation to the matters if that Part applied to conciliation and arbitration in relation to the matters instead of in relation to industrial disputes.

             (2)  To avoid doubt, the Commission’s powers under subsection (1) are not limited by section 89A.

##### 170MZ  Awards under section 170MX

             (1)  An award under subsection 170MX(3) must specify a date as its nominal expiry date.

             (2)  Subject to this section, the award remains in operation at all times after it commences.

             (3)  The award has effect subject to any conditions that are specified in the award.

             (4)  Before the award’s nominal expiry date has passed, the Full Bench must not revoke the award unless it is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the employer and the one or more organisations, or a majority of the employees, who are bound by the award have agreed to the revocation (for example, because they propose to make an agreement under Division 2 or 3); and

                     (b)  the revocation would not be against the public interest.

             (5)  If:

                     (a)  the award’s nominal expiry date has passed; and

                     (b)  either:

                              (i)  the employer, or an organisation, bound by the award; or

                             (ii)  a majority of the employees to whom the award applies;

                            request the Commission in writing to terminate the award; and

                     (c)  the Commission has given the following a reasonable opportunity to be heard in relation to the request:

                              (i)  the employer bound by the award;

                             (ii)  any organisations bound by the award;

                            (iii)  the employees to whom the award applies; and

                     (d)  the Commission considers that it is not contrary to the public interest to terminate the award;

the Commission must terminate the award.

             (6)  The award may only be varied for the purpose of:

                     (a)  removing ambiguity or uncertainty; or

                     (b)  including, omitting or varying a term (however expressed) that authorises an employer to stand-down an employee.

             (7)  Before the award’s nominal expiry date has passed, no bargaining period may be initiated under section 170MI for negotiating an agreement in relation to the employment of employees whose employment is dealt with in the award.

##### 170N  Commission not to arbitrate during bargaining period

                   During a bargaining period, the Commission must not exercise its arbitration powers under Part VI in relation to a matter that is at issue between the negotiating parties.

##### 170NA  Conciliation in respect of agreements

             (1)  The Commission has the conciliation powers in relation to a matter arising under this Part that it would have under Part VI in relation to the matter if that Part applied to conciliation in relation to the matters instead of in relation to industrial disputes.

             (2)  If 2 or more organisations of employees are involved in the negotiations or proposed negotiations, the Commission may order that all of the organisations be represented, for the purposes of conciliating the matter, by a single person or group of persons, where the person or persons are authorised by the organisations to represent them (whether generally or in relation to the particular negotiations).

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not, by implication, limit the powers mentioned in subsection (1).

##### 170NB  Employers not to discriminate between unionist and non-unionist

             (1)  An employer must not, in negotiating an agreement under Division 2 or 3, discriminate between employees of the employer:

                     (a)  because some of those employees are members of an organisation of employees while others are not members of such an organisation; or

                     (b)  because some of those employees are members of a particular organisation of employees, while others are not members of that organisation or are members of a different organisation of employees.

             (2)  In so far as a purpose of the agreement is to settle some or all of the matters that are the subject of an industrial dispute to which the employer is a party, subsection (1) does not require the agreement to cover:

                     (a)  matters that are not the subject of that dispute; or

                     (b)  employees whose terms and conditions of employment are not the subject of that dispute.

             (3)  In so far as a purpose of the agreement is to prevent industrial disputes of a particular kind, subsection (1) does not require the agreement to cover:

                     (a)  matters that are not likely to be the subject of a dispute of that kind; or

                     (b)  employees whose terms and conditions of employment are not likely to be the subject of a dispute of that kind.

### Division 9—Prohibition of coercion in relation to agreements

##### 170NC  Coercion of persons to make, vary or terminate certified agreements etc.

             (1)  A person must not:

                     (a)  take or threaten to take any industrial action or other action; or

                     (b)  refrain or threaten to refrain from taking any action;

with intent to coerce another person to agree, or not to agree, to:

                     (c)  making, varying or terminating, or extending the nominal expiry date of, an agreement under Division 2 or 3; or

                     (d)  approving any of the things mentioned in paragraph (c).

Note:          The Court has certain remedial powers in relation to a contravention of this section: see Division 10.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply to action, or industrial action, that is protected action (within the meaning of Division 8).

             (3)  An employer must not coerce, or attempt to coerce, an employee of the employer:

                     (a)  not to make a request as mentioned in subsection 170LK(4) in relation to an agreement that the employer proposes to make; or

                     (b)  to withdraw such a request.

##### 170XA  When does an agreement pass the no-disadvantage test?

             (2)  Subject to sections 170XB, 170XC and 170XD, an agreement disadvantages employees in relation to their terms and conditions of employment only if its approval or certification would result, on balance, in a reduction in the overall terms and conditions of employment of those employees under:

                     (b)  any other law of the Commonwealth, or of a State or Territory, that the Employment Advocate or the Commission (as the case may be) considers relevant.

Note:          The Supported Wage System was endorsed by the Commission in the Full Bench decision dated 10 October 1994 (print L5723).

##### 170XC  Special case—employee undertaking approved traineeship

             (1)  If an agreement provides for the payment of wages to an employee undertaking an approved traineeship at a rate that is not less than the appropriate percentage of the rate (**_benchmark rate_**) that would be applicable to the employee under the relevant award or designated award (as the case may be) if:

                     (a)  that award applied to him or her; and

                     (b)  he or she were not undertaking the traineeship;

the approval or certification of the agreement is not to be taken to result in a reduction of the employee’s wages.

             (2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), the **_appropriate percentage of the benchmark rate_** is such percentage of that rate as is determined in writing by the approving authority having regard to the reduction in the productive time of an employee undertaking the approved traineeship due to time spent in training.

             (3)  If the agreement adopts, as the qualification for a wage level, a criterion determined by the approving authority instead of the criterion applying under the relevant award or designated award (as the case may be), that award is taken, for the purposes of this section, to have effect as if the criterion determined by the approving authority were substituted for the last-mentioned criterion.

##### 170XD  Special case—employee undertaking approved apprenticeship

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  an agreement provides for the payment of wages to an employee undertaking an approved apprenticeship in a particular trade, occupation or kind of work; and

                     (b)  there is a relevant award or designated award regulating the payment of wages to employees undertaking an apprenticeship (**_benchmark apprenticeship_**) in the same trade, occupation or kind of work.

             (2)  The approval or certification of the agreement is to be taken to result in a reduction of the employee’s wages only if the agreement provides for the payment of wages to employees undertaking the approved apprenticeship at a rate that is less than the rate applicable under the relevant award or designated award (as the case may be) to employees undertaking the benchmark apprenticeship adjusted (if necessary) as provided in subsection (3).

             (3)  For the purposes of subsection (2), the rate that is applicable to an employee undertaking the benchmark apprenticeship is to be adjusted to take into account the proportionate difference, as determined by the approving authority, between the productive time of an employee under the approved apprenticeship and the productive time of an employee under the benchmark apprenticeship.

             (4)  If the agreement adopts, as the qualification for a wage level, a criterion determined by the approving authority instead of the criterion applying under the relevant award or designated award (as the case may be), that award is taken, for the purposes of this section, to have effect as if the criterion determined by the approving authority were substituted for the last-mentioned criterion.

             (2)  Upon application, the Employment Advocate must determine, and inform the employer in writing, that an award or awards (being an award or awards under this Act regulating terms or conditions of employment of employees engaged in the same kind of work as that of the person under the AWA) are appropriate for the purpose of deciding whether the agreement passes the no-disadvantage test.

##### 170XF  Determination of designated award or awards for the purposes of a certified agreement

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  an employer or organisation of employees proposes to make a certified agreement; and

                     (b)  there is no relevant award in relation to some or all of the persons to whom the agreement will apply;

the employer or organisation may apply in writing to the Commission for the making of a determination under subsection (2).

             (2)  Upon application, the Commission must determine, and inform the employer or organisation in writing, that an award or awards (being an award or awards under this Act regulating terms or conditions of employment of persons engaged in the same kind of work as that of those persons under the agreement) are appropriate for the purpose of deciding whether the agreement passes the no-disadvantage test.

##### 45DD  Situations in which boycotts permitted

Dominant purpose of conduct relates to employment matters—conduct by a person

             (1)  A person does not contravene, and is not involved in a contravention of, subsection 45D(1), 45DA(1) or 45DB(1) by engaging in conduct if the dominant purpose for which the conduct is engaged in is substantially related to the remuneration, conditions of employment, hours of work or working conditions of that person or of another person employed by an employer of that person.

Dominant purpose of conduct relates to employment matters—conduct by employee organisation and employees

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  an employee, or 2 or more employees who are employed by the same employer, engage in conduct in concert with another person who is, or with other persons each of whom is:

                              (i)  an organisation of employees; or

                             (ii)  an officer of an organisation of employees; and

                     (b)  the conduct is only engaged in by the persons covered by paragraph (a); and

                     (c)  the dominant purpose for which the conduct is engaged in is substantially related to the remuneration, conditions of employment, hours of work or working conditions of the employee, or any of the employees, covered by paragraph (a); 

the persons covered by paragraph (a) do not contravene, and are not involved in a contravention of, subsection 45D(1), 45DA(1) or 45DB(1) by engaging in the conduct.

Dominant purpose of conduct relates to environmental protection or consumer protection

             (3)  A person does not contravene, and is not involved in a contravention of, subsection 45D(1), 45DA(1) or 45DB(1) by engaging in conduct if:

                     (a)  the dominant purpose for which the conduct is engaged in is substantially related to environmental protection or consumer protection; and

                     (b)  engaging in the conduct is not industrial action.

Note 1:       If an environmental organisation or a consumer organisation is a body corporate:

(a)           it is a “person” who may be subject to the prohibitions in subsections 45D(1), 45DA(1) and 45DB(1) and who may also be covered by this exemption; and

(b)           each of its members is a “person” who may be subject to the prohibitions in subsections 45D(1), 45DA(1) and 45DB(1) and who may also be covered by this exemption.

Note 2:       If an environmental organisation or a consumer organisation is not a body corporate:

(a)           it is not a “person” and is therefore not subject to the prohibitions in subsections 45D(1), 45DA(1) and 45DB(1) (consequently, this exemption does not cover the organisation as such); but

(b)           each of its members is a “person” who may be subject to the prohibitions in subsections 45D(1), 45DA(1) and 45DB(1) and who may also be covered by this exemption.

Meaning of**industrial action**—basic definition

             (4)  In subsection (3), **_industrial action_** means:

                     (a)  the performance of work in a manner different from that in which it is customarily performed, or the adoption of a practice in relation to work, the result of which is a restriction or limitation on, or a delay in, the performance of the work, where:

                              (i)  the terms and conditions of the work are prescribed, wholly or partly, by an industrial instrument or an order of an industrial body; or

                             (ii)  the work is performed, or the practice is adopted, in connection with an industrial dispute; or

                     (b)  a ban, limitation or restriction on the performance of work, or on acceptance of or offering for work, in accordance with the terms and conditions prescribed by an industrial instrument or by an order of an industrial body; or

                     (c)  a ban, limitation or restriction on the performance of work, or on acceptance of or offering for work, that is adopted in connection with an industrial dispute; or

                     (d)  a failure or refusal by persons to attend for work or a failure or refusal to perform any work at all by persons who attend for work.

For this purpose, **_industrial body_**,**_industrial dispute_** and **_industrial instrument_** have the meanings given by subsection 298B(1) of the _Workplace Relations Act 1996_.

Meaning of **industrial action**—further clarification

             (5)  For the purposes of subsection (3):

                     (a)  conduct is capable of constituting industrial action even if the conduct relates to part only of the duties that persons are required to perform in the course of their employment; and

                     (b)  a reference to industrial action includes a reference to a course of conduct consisting of a series of industrial actions.

Subsections (1), (2) and (3) do not protect people not covered by them

             (6)  In applying subsection 45D(1), 45DA(1) or 45DB(1) to a person who is not covered by subsection (1), (2) or (3) in respect of certain conduct, disregard the fact that other persons may be covered by one of those subsections in respect of the same conduct. 

Defences to contravention of subsection 45DB(1)

             (7)  In a proceeding under this Act in relation to a contravention of subsection 45DB(1), it is a defence if the defendant proves:

                     (a)  that a notice in respect of the conduct concerned has been duly given to the Commission under subsection 93(1) and the Commission has not given a notice in respect of the conduct under subsection 93(3) or (3A); or

                     (b)  that the dominant purpose for which the defendant engaged in the conduct concerned was to preserve or further a business carried on by him or her.

Each person to prove defence

             (8)  If:

                     (a)  a person engages in conduct in concert with another person; and

                     (b)  the other person proves a matter specified in paragraph (7)(a) or (b) in respect of that conduct;

in applying subsection 45DB(1) to the first person, ignore the fact that the other person has proved that matter.

Note:          Section 170MT of the _Workplace Relations Act 1996_ limits the right to bring actions under this Act  in respect of industrial action that is protected action for the purposes of that section.

Meaning of **accustomed to acquire**

#####  45DD  Situations in which boycotts permitted

Dominant purpose of conduct relates to employment matters—conduct by a person

             (1)  A person does not contravene, and is not involved in a contravention of, subsection 45D(1) or 45DA(1) by engaging in conduct if the dominant purpose for which the conduct is engaged in is substantially related to the remuneration, conditions of employment, hours of work or working conditions of that person or of another person employed by an employer of that person.

Dominant purpose of conduct relates to employment matters—conduct by employee organisation and employees

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  an employee, or 2 or more employees who are employed by the same employer, engage in conduct in concert with another person who is, or with other persons each of whom is:

                              (i)  an organisation of employees; or

                             (ii)  an officer of an organisation of employees; and

                     (b)  the conduct is only engaged in by the persons covered by paragraph (a); and

                     (c)  the dominant purpose for which the conduct is engaged in is substantially related to the remuneration, conditions of employment, hours of work or working conditions of the employee, or any of the employees, covered by paragraph (a);

the persons covered by paragraph (a) do not contravene, and are not involved in a contravention of, subsection 45D(1) or 45DA(1) by engaging in the conduct.

Dominant purpose of conduct relates to environmental protection or consumer protection

             (3)  A person does not contravene, and is not involved in a contravention of, subsection 45D(1) or 45DA(1) by engaging in conduct if:

                     (a)  the dominant purpose for which the conduct is engaged in is substantially related to environmental protection or consumer protection; and

                     (b)  engaging in the conduct is not industrial action.

Note 1:       If an environmental organisation or a consumer organisation is a body corporate:

(a)           it is a “person” who may be subject to the prohibitions in subsections 45D(1) and 45DA(1) and who may also be covered by this exemption; and

(b)           each of its members is a “person” who may be subject to the prohibitions in subsections 45D(1) and 45DA(1) and who may also be covered by this exemption.

Note 2:       If an environmental organisation or a consumer organisation is not a body corporate:

(a)           it is not a “person” and is therefore not subject to the prohibitions in subsections 45D(1) and 45DA(1) (consequently, this exemption does not cover the organisation as such); but

(b)           each of its members is a “person” who may be subject to the prohibitions in subsections 45D(1) and 45DA(1) and who may also be covered by this exemption.

Meaning of**industrial action**—basic definition

             (4)  In subsection (3), **_industrial action_** means:

                     (a)  the performance of work in a manner different from that in which it is customarily performed, or the adoption of a practice in relation to work, the result of which is a restriction or limitation on, or a delay in, the performance of the work, where:

                              (i)  the terms and conditions of the work are prescribed, wholly or partly, by an industrial instrument or an order of an industrial body; or

                             (ii)  the work is performed, or the practice is adopted, in connection with an industrial dispute; or

                     (b)  a ban, limitation or restriction on the performance of work, or on acceptance of or offering for work, in accordance with the terms and conditions prescribed by an industrial instrument or by an order of an industrial body; or

                     (c)  a ban, limitation or restriction on the performance of work, or on acceptance of or offering for work, that is adopted in connection with an industrial dispute; or

                     (d)  a failure or refusal by persons to attend for work or a failure or refusal to perform any work at all by persons who attend for work.

For this purpose, **_industrial body_**,**_industrial dispute_** and **_industrial instrument_** have the meanings given by subsection 298B(1) of the _Workplace Relations Act 1996_.

Meaning of **industrial action**—further clarification

             (5)  For the purposes of subsection (3):

                     (a)  conduct is capable of constituting industrial action even if the conduct relates to part only of the duties that persons are required to perform in the course of their employment; and

                     (b)  a reference to industrial action includes a reference to a course of conduct consisting of a series of industrial actions.

Subsections (1), (2) and (3) do not protect people not covered by them

             (6)  In applying subsection 45D(1) or 45DA(1) to a person who is not covered by subsection (1), (2) or (3) in respect of certain conduct, disregard the fact that other persons may be covered by one of those subsections in respect of the same conduct.

_Note:       Section 170MT of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 limits the right to bring actions under the Competition Code in respect of industrial action that is protected action for the purposes of that section._

                     (c)  after the end of the period, the second person has been supplied with such goods or services by another person and has not also been supplied with such goods or services by the first person;

then, for the purposes of the application of this section in relation to anything done after the second person has been supplied with goods or services as mentioned in paragraph (c), the first person is not to be taken to be a person who has been accustomed to supply such goods or services to the second person.

Meaning of **accustomed to acquire**
