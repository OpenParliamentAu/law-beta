##### <a id="18"></a>18  Operation of the Corporations Act after conversion time

                   Nothing in this Part prevents any of the following, after the conversion time:

                     (a)  a variation of the share capital of HoldCo;

                     (b)  a change in the name of HoldCo;

                     (c)  a change in the structure, constitution or membership of HoldCo.

##### <a id="19"></a>19  Accounting records

                     (b)  an annual report and financial statements prepared in relation to a financial year by HoldCo under section 9 of the _Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997_, or under section 76 of the _Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993_, are to be treated as a financial report of HoldCo for that financial year.

### Division 5—Shares in HoldCo

##### <a id="20"></a>20  List of Eligible Woolgrowers

             (1)  Before the conversion time, the Minister must cause a list to be prepared of the persons who will become the shareholders of HoldCo at the conversion time.

             (2)  The list is to be known as the List of Eligible Woolgrowers.

             (3)  The list must show the number of shares of each class to which each person is entitled.

             (4)  After the list has been prepared, the Minister must certify that the Minister is satisfied that the list was prepared in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the regulations.

             (5)  The Minister may be satisfied that the list was prepared in accordance with those procedures even if some steps in the preparation of the list occurred before the regulations were made.

             (6)  After certifying the list, the Minister must give HoldCo a copy of the list. The Minister must certify the copy to be a true copy.

##### <a id="21"></a>21  Issue of shares to eligible woolgrowers

             (1)  At the conversion time, shares in HoldCo are taken to be issued as fully paid, in accordance with the List of Eligible Woolgrowers, as follows:

                     (a)  if the list provides for shares to be issued to a person, the shares are taken to be issued to that person;

                     (b)  if the list provides for shares to be issued to 2 or more persons jointly, the shares are taken to be issued to those persons jointly.

             (2)  A person to whom shares are taken to be issued under subsection (1):

                     (a)  becomes a member of HoldCo, by force of this section, and is taken to have consented to become a member; and

                     (b)  is entitled to the same rights, privileges and benefits in respect of that membership as if the person had become a member under the constitution of HoldCo; and

                     (c)  is subject to the same duties, liabilities and obligations in respect of that membership as if the person had become a member under the constitution of HoldCo.

##### <a id="22"></a>22  Incorrectly issued shares

                   If, within 6 months after the conversion time, HoldCo determines, in accordance with its constitution, that any of the shares issued under section 21 should not have been issued, then those shares are taken never to have been issued.

Note:          This section could apply, for example, where too many shares were issued to a person under section 21 because of incorrect information about the amount of wool tax paid by the person. In this case, the shares in excess of the proper entitlement would be taken never to have been issued to the person.

##### <a id="23"></a>23  Cancellation of shares in HoldCo

                   If HoldCo determines, in accordance with its constitution, that any of its shares should be cancelled, then those shares are cancelled by force of this section.

### Division 6—Taxation

##### <a id="24"></a>24  Exemption from stamp duty etc.

             (1)  No stamp duty or other tax is payable under a law of a State or Territory in respect of an exempt matter, or anything connected with an exempt matter.

             (2)  The Minister may certify in writing:

                     (a)  that a specified matter is an exempt matter; or

                     (b)  that a specified thing was done in connection with a specified exempt matter.

             (3)  In all courts, and for all purposes, a certificate under subsection (2) is evidence of the matter stated in the certificate.

             (4)  In this section:

                    <a name="exempt-matter"></a>**_exempt matter_** means any of the following:

                     (a)  the registration of HoldCo as a Corporations Law company;

                     (b)  the issue of shares to a person under section 21;

                     (c)  the issue of shares to a person in accordance with HoldCo’s constitution, where the issue is certified under section 36;

                     (d)  any of the following things that happens during the restructuring period and is certified by the Minister under section 36:

                              (i)  the transfer of an asset or liability between 2 restructuring bodies;

                             (ii)  the operation of Division 3 in relation to particular assets, liabilities or contracts;

                            (iii)  the transfer by HoldCo, to a shareholder in HoldCo, of any of HoldCo’s shares in a subsidiary;

                            (iv)  the issue of shares by a subsidiary of HoldCo to a shareholder in HoldCo;

                             (v)  the cancellation of shares in HoldCo (whether by buy‑back, capital reduction or any other means).

##### <a id="25"></a>25  Share capital

                   For the purposes of section 160ARDM of the 1936 Tax Act, the creation of share capital by section 17 of this Act is not taken to be, or to result from, the transfer of an amount by HoldCo to its share capital account from another account.

##### <a id="26"></a>26  No assessable income from issue of HoldCo shares

                   For the purposes of the 1936 Tax Act and the 1997 Tax Act, no amount is to be included in the assessable income of a person because of:

                     (a)  the issue of shares to a person under section 21; or

                     (b)  the issue of shares to a person in accordance with HoldCo’s constitution, where the issue is certified under section 36.

##### <a id="27"></a>27  No assessable income to arise from transfers between restructuring bodies

             (1)  For the purposes of the 1936 Tax Act and the 1997 Tax Act, if an asset or liability of a restructuring body becomes an asset or liability of another restructuring body as a result of an exempt transfer, then no amount is to be included in the assessable income of the transferor or transferee because of the transfer.

             (2)  To the extent that an exempt transfer involves a CGT event, Subdivision 126‑B of the 1997 Tax Act is to be applied on the basis that:

                     (a)  subsection 126‑50(4) of that Act were omitted; and

                     (b)  in deciding whether the condition in paragraph 126‑55(1)(a) of that Act is met, it is to be assumed that the transferor was not, at any relevant time, exempt from income tax; and

                     (c)  the condition in paragraph 126‑55(1)(b) of that Act were taken to be met.

Note:          The broad effect of subsection (2) is that the transfer will qualify for roll‑over concessions under the rules that apply to certain transactions within a wholly‑owned group.

             (3)  To the extent that an exempt transfer involves a disposal of property for the purposes of Subdivision 41‑A of the 1997 Tax Act, that Subdivision is to be applied on the basis that:

                     (a)  in deciding whether the condition in paragraph 41‑20(1)(a) of that Act is met, it is to be assumed that the transferor was not, at any relevant time, exempt from income tax; and

                     (b)  Subdivision 126‑B of that Act applies, for the purposes of Subdivision 41‑A of that Act, with the modifications set out in subsection (2) of this section; and

                     (c)  the transferor and transferee had made a joint election under section 41‑55 of that Act.

Note:          The broad effect of subsection (3) is that the transfer will qualify for roll‑over concessions under the provisions of the 1997 Tax Act that deal with capital allowances.

             (4)  In this section:

                    <a name="exempt-transfer"></a>**_exempt transfer_** means either of the following that is certified under section 36:

##### <a id="30"></a>30  Declaration of research body

             (1)  The Minister may, in writing, declare a body to be the research body for the purposes of this Division.

Note:          Subsection 33(3) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ provides for repeal, variation etc. of instruments.

             (2)  The Minister must not declare a body to be the research body unless the body is registered as a company under the _Corporations Act 2001_.

             (3)  A declaration under this section is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

##### <a id="31"></a>31  Funding contract with research body

Funding contract

             (1)  The Minister, on behalf of the Commonwealth, may enter into a contract with the research body (or with the research body and other persons) that provides for the Commonwealth to make payments of the following kinds to the research body:

                     (a)  payments in relation to wool levy (**_category A payments_**);

                     (b)  payments per financial year in relation to research and development (**_category B payments_**).

             (2)  Before entering into the contract, the Minister must be satisfied that the terms of the contract make adequate provision to ensure that:

                     (a)  category A payments are spent by the research body on research and development activities, other activities or both, for the benefit of Australian woolgrowers; and

                     (b)  category B payments are spent by the research body on:

                              (i)  research and development activities for the benefit of Australian woolgrowers and the Australian community generally; and

                             (ii)  making payments to the Commonwealth under subsection (7).

             (3)  The contract does not have to oblige the Commonwealth to pay the full amounts that could be paid out of the money appropriated by this section.

Appropriation for payments under funding contract

             (4)  The Consolidated Revenue Fund is appropriated for the purposes of payments by the Commonwealth under this section.

Overall limit on appropriation for category A payments

             (5)  For category A payments, the total limit on the appropriation is the total amount of wool levy received by the Commonwealth. For this purpose, amounts received by the Commonwealth as penalties for late payment of wool levy are to be treated as amounts of wool levy.

Overall limit on appropriation for category B payments

             (6)  For category B payments, the total limit on the appropriation is the total amount of wool levy received by the Commonwealth. For this purpose, amounts received by the Commonwealth as penalties for late payment of wool levy are not to be treated as amounts of wool levy.

Retention limit for category B payments

             (7)  The category B payments made to the research body during a particular financial year are subject to the condition that, if:

                     (a)  before the end of 31 October next following the financial year, the Minister determines the amount of the gross value of eligible wool produced in Australia in the financial year; and

                     (b)  as at the end of 31 October next following the financial year, the sum of the category B payments that were paid to the research body during the financial year exceeds the lesser of:

                              (i)  0.5% of the amount of the gross value of eligible wool produced in Australia in the financial year as determined by the Minister; and

                             (ii)  50% of the amount spent by the research body in the financial year on activities that qualify, under the contract, as research and development activities;

the research body will pay to the Commonwealth an amount equal to the excess.

Note:          This ensures that the sum of the category B payments that are retained by the research body in relation to the financial year does not exceed the lesser of the amounts calculated under subparagraphs (b)(i) and (b)(ii).

          (7A)  If:

                     (a)  before the end of 31 October next following a financial year, the Minister has not determined under subsection (7) the amount of the gross value of eligible wool produced in Australia in the financial year; and

                     (b)  the Minister has determined under subsection (7) the amount of the gross value of eligible wool produced in Australia in the previous financial year;

the Minister is taken to have made, immediately before the end of that 31 October, a determination under subsection (7) that the amount of the gross value of eligible wool produced in Australia in the financial year is equal to the amount of the gross value of eligible wool produced in Australia determined under subsection (7) for the previous financial year.

          (7B)  An amount payable under subsection (7) by the research body:

                     (a)  is a debt due to the Commonwealth; and

                     (b)  may be recovered by the Minister, on behalf of the Commonwealth, by action in a court of competent jurisdiction.

          (7C)  A determination made under subsection (7) is not a legislative instrument.

             (8)  For the purposes of subsection (7), the regulations may prescribe the manner in which the Minister is to determine the gross value of eligible wool produced in Australia in a financial year.

          (8A)  If there is an unmatched R&amp;D excess for a financial year that started or starts on or after 1 July 2001, the amount spent by the research body in the following financial year on activities that qualify, under the funding contract, as research and development activities is taken, for the purposes of this section (including for the purposes of this subsection and subsection (8B)), to be increased by the amount of the unmatched R&amp;D excess.

Note:          This means that research and development expenditure that is not “50% matched” in one financial year because of the cap in subsection (6) or the condition in subparagraph (7)(b)(i) can be carried forward into later years.

          (8B)  For the purposes of subsection (8A), there is an **_unmatched R&amp;D excess_** for a financial year if:

                     (a)  the research body spends a particular amount (the **_R&amp;D spend amount_**) in the financial year on activities that qualify, under the funding contract, as research and development activities; and

                     (b)  because of the operation of subsection (6) or subparagraph (7)(b)(i), the net category B payments in respect of the financial year are less than 50% of the R&amp;D spend amount;

and the amount of the unmatched R&amp;D excess is:

Set off

          (8C)  If:

                     (a)  an amount (the **_first amount_**) is payable by the research body under subsection (7); and

                     (b)  another amount (the **_second amount_**) is payable by the Commonwealth to the research body under the funding contract;

the Minister may, on behalf of the Commonwealth, set off the whole or a part of the first amount against the whole or a part of the second amount.

Net category B payments

          (8D)  For the purposes of this section, **_net category B payments_** for a financial year means the total of the category B payments made to the research body during the financial year, less the amount payable by the research body under subsection (7) as a condition of those category B payments.

             (9)  In this section:

                    <a name="elig-wool"></a>**_eligible wool_** has the meaning given by the regulations.

##### <a id="32"></a>32  Setting the rate of wool levy

             (1)  The research body is taken to be a designated body in relation to wool levy for the purposes of the rate‑setting clauses.

             (2)  Before 1 January 2004, the research body must make a single recommendation for the purposes of the rate‑setting clauses.

             (3)  The research body must continue to make recommendations in relation to the rate‑setting clauses so that each recommendation is made not later than the third anniversary of the previous recommendation.

             (4)  Before making each recommendation, the research body must conduct a poll in accordance with the regulations. The recommendation must be in accordance with the results of the poll.

             (5)  This section does not apply in relation to the regulations that initially impose wool levy.

             (6)  In this section:

                    <a name="rate-set-claus"></a>**_rate‑setting clauses_** means:

                     (a)  clause 14 of Schedule 27 to the _Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Act 1999_; and

                     (b)  clause 13 of Schedule 14 to the _Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Act 1999_.

The object of this Part is to ensure that, despite the repeals and amendments made by this Act, the full legal and administrative consequences of:

                     (a)  any act done or omitted to be done; or

                     (b)  any state of affairs existing; or

                     (c)  any period ending;

before such a repeal or amendment applies, can continue to arise and be carried out, directly or indirectly through an indefinite number of steps, even if some or all of those steps are taken after the repeal or amendment applies.

## 7  Making and amending assessments, and doing other things, in relation to past matters

Even though an Act is repealed or amended by this Act, the repeal or amendment is disregarded for the purpose of doing any of the following under any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_):

                     (a)  making or amending an assessment (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

                     (b)  exercising any right or power, performing any obligation or duty or doing any other thing (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

Example 1: On 31 July 1999, Greg Ltd lodged its annual return under former section 160ARE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The return stated that the company had a credit on its franking account and that no franking deficit tax was payable for the 1998‑99 franking year. Under former section 160ARH of that Act, the Commissioner was taken to have made an assessment consistent with the return.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of Part IIIAA of that Act, the Commissioner concludes that Greg Ltd fraudulently overfranked dividends it paid during the 1998‑99 franking year, and had a franking account deficit for that franking year. As a result, the Commissioner considers that franking deficit tax and a penalty by way of additional tax are payable.

                   The Commissioner can amend the assessment under former section 160ARN of that Act, because item 7 of this Schedule disregards the repeal of that section for the purposes of making an assessment in relation to the 1998‑99 franking year. Item 7 will also disregard the repeal of Division 11 of former Part IIIAA to the extent necessary for the Commissioner to assess Greg Ltd’s liability to a penalty by way of additional tax.

                   Despite the repeal of sections 160ARU and 160ARV, item 9 will ensure that the general interest charge will accrue on the unpaid franking deficit tax and penalty until they are paid.

                   Item 7 will also preserve Greg Ltd’s right, under former section 160ART of that Act, to object against the Commissioner’s amended assessment (including the penalty), since the objection is the exercise of a right in relation to a franking year that ended before the repeal of Part IIIAA.

Example 2: During the 1997‑98 income year, Duffy Property Ltd withheld amounts from its employees’ wages as required by former Divisions 1AAA and 2 of Part VI of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The company failed to notify the Commissioner of those amounts, and failed to remit them to the Commissioner.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of those Divisions, the Commissioner discovers that the withheld amounts have not been remitted. The company’s records are incomplete and the Commissioner is unable to completely ascertain the extent of its liability for the withheld amounts. Under section 222AGA of that Act, the Commissioner makes an estimate of the liability.

                   Item 7 will disregard the repeal of section 220AAZA of that Act (which empowered the Commissioner to recover the amount of the estimate). Even though the estimate is made after the repeal, it relates to amounts withheld before the repeal.

## 8  Saving of provisions about effect of assessments

If a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act deals with the effect of an assessment, the repeal or amendment is disregarded in relation to assessments made, before or after the repeal or amendment applies, in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

## 9  Saving of provisions about general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty

If:

                     (a)  a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act provides for the payment of:

                              (i)  general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty (all within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_); or

                             (ii)  interest under the _Taxation (Interest on Overpayments and Early Payments) Act 1983_; and

                     (b)  in a particular case, the period in respect of which the charge, penalty or interest is payable (whether under the provision or under the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_) has not begun, or has begun but not ended, when the provision is repealed or amended;

then, despite the repeal or amendment, the provision or part continues to apply in the particular case until the end of the period.

## 10  Repeals disregarded for the purposes of dependent provisions

If the operation of a provision (the **_subject provision_**) of any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_) made under any Act depends to any extent on an Act, or a provision of an Act, that is repealed by this Act, the repeal is disregarded so far as it affects the operation of the subject provision.

## 11  Schedule does not limit operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_

This Schedule does not limit the operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.
