	(6)	After certifying the list, the Minister must give HoldCo a copy of the list. The Minister must certify the copy to be a true copy.
21  Issue of shares to eligible woolgrowers
	(1)	At the conversion time, shares in HoldCo are taken to be issued as fully paid, in accordance with the List of Eligible Woolgrowers, as follows:

Note:	This section could apply, for example, where too many shares were issued to a person under section 21 because of incorrect information about the amount of wool tax paid by the person.

	(2)	For the purposes of the 1936 Tax Act and the 1997 Tax Act, no amount is to be included in the assessable income of a person because of a certified demerger matter.
29  CGT cost base for share acquisitions
		For the purposes of the 1997 Tax Act, if any of the following results in the acquisition of a CGT asset, then the first element of the cost base of the asset is taken to be nil:
