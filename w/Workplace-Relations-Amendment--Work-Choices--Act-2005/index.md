                      (i)  balancing the right to take industrial action for the purposes of collective bargaining at the workplace level with the need to protect the public interest and appropriately deal with illegitimate and unprotected industrial action; and

                    (m)  respecting and valuing the diversity of the work force by helping to prevent and eliminate discrimination on the basis of race, colour, sex, sexual preference, age, physical or mental disability, marital status, family responsibilities, pregnancy, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin; and

Note 1:       In this context, **_Australia_** includes the Territory of Christmas Island, the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands and the coastal sea. See section 15B and paragraph 17(a) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

Note 2:       Provisions of section 86 giving inspectors power to enter certain premises and places and do certain things there also extend to some premises and places outside Australia, subject to Australia’s international obligations relating to foreign-flagged ships and foreign-registered aircraft.

Note 3:       Part VC (Industrial action) and related provisions of this Act may extend in relation to Australia’s exclusive economic zone, and in relation to Australia’s continental shelf, as prescribed by the regulations. See section 106C.

             (2)  If the regulations prescribe modifications of this Act for its operation in relation to all or part of Australia’s exclusive economic zone, then, so far as this Act extends to the zone or part apart from this subsection, it has effect as modified in relation to the zone or part.

             (3)  For the purposes of subsection (2), the regulations may prescribe different modifications in relation to different parts of Australia’s exclusive economic zone.

Modified application in relation to Australia’s continental shelf

             (4)  If the regulations prescribe modifications of this Act for its operation in relation to all or part of Australia’s continental shelf, then, so far as this Act extends in relation to the continental shelf or part apart from this subsection, it has effect as modified in relation to the continental shelf or part.

Note:          Part 2.7 of the _Criminal Code_ is about geographical jurisdiction in connection with offences. Section 7AA, the sections mentioned there and sections 86 and 106C deal with extraterritorial operation of this Act.

## 9  At the end of Part I

Add:

##### <a id="7C"></a>7C  Act excludes some State and Territory laws

             (1)  This Act is intended to apply to the exclusion of all the following laws of a State or Territory so far as they would otherwise apply in relation to an employee or employer:

                     (a)  a State or Territory industrial law;

                     (b)  a law that applies to employment generally and deals with leave other than long service leave;

                     (c)  a law providing for a court or tribunal constituted by a law of the State or Territory to make an order in relation to equal remuneration for work of equal value (as defined in section 170BB);

                     (d)  a law providing for the variation or setting aside of rights and obligations arising under a contract of employment, or another arrangement for employment, that a court or tribunal finds is unfair;

                     (e)  a law that entitles a representative of a trade union to enter premises.

Note:          Subsection 4(1) defines **_applies to employment generally_**.

State and Territory laws that are not excluded

             (2)  However, subsection (1) does not apply to a law of a State or Territory so far as:

                     (a)  the law deals with the prevention of discrimination, the promotion of EEO or both, and is neither a State or Territory industrial law nor contained in such a law; or

                     (b)  the law is prescribed by the regulations as a law to which subsection (1) does not apply; or

                     (c)  the law deals with any of the matters (the **_non-excluded matters_**) described in subsection (3).

             (3)  The non-excluded matters are as follows:

                     (a)  superannuation;

                     (b)  workers compensation;

                     (c)  occupational health and safety (including entry of a representative of a trade union to premises for a purpose connected with occupational health and safety);

                    (ca)  matters relating to outworkers (including entry of a representative of a trade union to premises for a purpose connected with outworkers);

                     (d)  child labour;

                     (e)  long service leave;

                      (f)  the observance of a public holiday, except the rate of payment of an employee for the public holiday;

                     (g)  the method of payment of wages or salaries;

                     (h)  the frequency of payment of wages or salaries;

                      (i)  deductions from wages or salaries;

                     (k)  industrial action (within the ordinary meaning of the expression) affecting essential services;

                      (l)  attendance for service on a jury;

                    (m)  regulation of any of the following:

                              (i)  associations of employees;

                             (ii)  associations of employers;

                            (iii)  members of associations of employees or of associations of employers.

Note:          Part IX (Right of entry) sets prerequisites for a trade union representative to enter certain premises under a right given by a prescribed law of a State or Territory. The prerequisites apply even though the law deals with such entry for a purpose connected with occupational health and safety and paragraph (2)(c) says this Act is not to apply to the exclusion of a law dealing with that.

This Act excludes prescribed State and Territory laws

             (4)  This Act is intended to apply to the exclusion of a law of a State or Territory that is prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this subsection.

          (4A)  To avoid doubt, subsection (4) has effect even if the law is covered by subsection (2) (so that subsection (1) does not apply to the law). This subsection does not limit subsection (4).

Definition

             (5)  In this section:

##### <a id="7D"></a>7D  Awards, agreements and Commission orders prevail over State and Territory law etc.

             (1)  An award or workplace agreement prevails over a law of a State or Territory, a State award or a State employment agreement, to the extent of any inconsistency.

             (2)  However, a term of an award or workplace agreement dealing with any of the following matters has effect subject to a law of a State or Territory dealing with the matter, except a law that is prescribed by the regulations as a law to which awards and workplace agreements are not subject:

                     (a)  occupational health and safety;

                     (b)  workers compensation;

                     (c)  training arrangements;

                     (d)  a matter prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph.

             (3)  An order of the Commission under Part VIA prevails over a law of a State or Territory, a State award or a State employment agreement, to the extent of any inconsistency.

Note:          Part VIA is about minimum entitlements of employees.

##### <a id="7E"></a>7E  Act may exclude State and Territory laws in other cases

##### <a id="44L"></a>44L  Review on application by Minister

             (1)  The Minister may apply to the President for a review by a Full Bench of an award or order, or a decision relating to the making of an award or order, made by a member of the Commission (whether under this Act, the Registration and Accountability of Organisations Schedule or otherwise) if it appears to the Minister that the award, order or decision is contrary to the public interest.

## Part VA—The Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard

### Division 1—Preliminary

##### <a id="89"></a>89  Purpose of Part

             (1)  The purpose of this Part is to set out key minimum entitlements of employment.

             (2)  The key minimum entitlements relate to the following matters:

                     (a)  basic rates of pay and casual loadings (see Division 2);

                     (b)  maximum ordinary hours of work (see Division 3);

                     (c)  annual leave (see Division 4);

                     (d)  personal leave (see Division 5);

                     (e)  parental leave and related entitlements (see Division 6).

             (3)  The provisions of Divisions 2 to 6 constitute the **_Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard_**.

##### <a id="89A"></a>89A  Operation of the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard

             (1)  The Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard provides key minimum entitlements of employment for the employees to whom it applies.

             (2)  The Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard prevails over a workplace agreement or a contract of employment that operates in relation to an employee to the extent to which, in a particular respect, the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard provides a more favourable outcome for the employee.

          (2A)  A dispute about:

                     (a)  whether the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard provides a more favourable outcome for an employee in a particular respect than a workplace agreement that operates in relation to that employee; or

                     (b)  what the outcome is for an employee in a particular respect under the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard, where a workplace agreement operates in relation to that employee;

is to be resolved using the dispute settlement procedure included (or taken to be included) in the agreement.

             (3)  The regulations may prescribe:

                     (a)  what a particular respect is or is not for the purposes of subsection (2) or (2A); or

                     (b)  the circumstances in which the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard provides or does not provide a more favourable outcome in a particular respect.

Example 1: The way in which particular amounts of annual leave are accrued could be prescribed as a particular respect under paragraph (3)(a).

Example 2: Both the Standard and a workplace agreement require an employee to attest to certain matters in a statutory declaration made for the purposes of maternity leave. The matters required by the agreement are different in some respects from those set out in the Standard. Regulations made for the purposes of paragraph (3)(b) could prescribe the matters to be attested in a statutory declaration as a circumstance in which the Standard is not taken to provide a more favourable outcome.

##### <a id="89B"></a>89B  Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard cannot be excluded

                   A term of a workplace agreement or a contract has no effect to the extent to which it purports to exclude the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard or any part of it.

##### <a id="89D"></a>89D  Extraterritorial extension

             (1)  This Part, and the rest of this Act so far as it relates to this Part, extend:

                     (a)  to an employee outside Australia who meets any of the conditions in this section; and

                     (b)  to the employee’s employer (whether the employer is in or outside Australia); and

                     (c)  to acts, omissions, matters and things relating to the employee (whether they are in or outside Australia).

Note:          In this context, **_Australia_** includes the Territory of Christmas Island, the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands and the coastal sea. See section 15B and paragraph 17(a) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

In Australia’s exclusive economic zone

                     (a)  the employment of an employee is covered by an APCS; and

                     (b)  the employee is not an APCS piece rate employee;

the employee must be paid a basic periodic rate of pay for each of the employee’s guaranteed hours (pro-rated for part hours) that is at least equal to the basic periodic rate of pay (the **_guaranteed basic periodic rate of pay_**) that is payable to the employee under the APCS.

Note:          For what are the employee’s guaranteed hours, see section 90G.

Guarantee of APCS piece rates of pay

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  the employment of an employee is covered by an APCS; and

                     (b)  the employee is an APCS piece rate employee;

the employee must be paid basic piece rates of pay for his or her work that are at least equal to the basic piece rates of pay (the **_guaranteed basic piece rates of pay_**) that are payable to the employee under the APCS.

Guarantee of standard FMW

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  the employment of an employee is not covered by an APCS; and

                     (b)  the employee is not a junior employee, an employee with a disability, or an employee to whom a training arrangement applies;

the employee must be paid a basic periodic rate of pay for each of the employee’s guaranteed hours (pro-rated for part hours) that is at least equal to the standard FMW (the **_guaranteed basic periodic rate of pay_**).

Note:          For what are the employee’s guaranteed hours, see section 90G.

Guarantee of special FMW

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  the employment of an employee is not covered by an APCS; and

                     (b)  the employee is a junior employee, an employee with a disability, or an employee to whom a training arrangement applies; and

                     (c)  there is a special FMW for the employee;

the employee must be paid a basic periodic rate of pay for each of the employee’s guaranteed hours (pro-rated for part hours) that is at least equal to that special FMW (the **_guaranteed basic periodic rate of pay_**).

Note:          For what are the employee’s guaranteed hours, see section 90G.

##### <a id="90G"></a>90G  An employee’s _guaranteed hours_ for the purpose of section 90F

Employees employed to work a specified number of hours

             (1)  For the purposes of section 90F, if an employee is employed to work a specified number of hours per week, the **_guaranteed hours_** for the employee, for each week, are to be worked out as follows:

                     (a)  start with that specified number of hours (subject to subsection (4));

                     (b)  deduct all of the following:

                              (i)  any hours in the week when the employee is absent from work on deductible authorised leave (as defined in subsection (6));

                            (iii)  any other hours of unauthorised absence from work by the employee in the week;

                     (c)  if, during the week, the employee works, and is required or requested  to work, additional hours that are, under the terms and conditions of the employee’s employment, not counted towards the specified number of hours—add on those additional hours.

Note:          The actual hours worked from week to week by an employee who is employed to work a specified number of hours per week may vary, due to averaging as mentioned in section 91C or to some other kind of flexible working hours scheme that applies to the employee’s employment.

             (2)  If an employee is employed on a full-time basis, but the terms and conditions of the employee’s employment do not determine the number of hours in a period that is to constitute employment on a full-time basis for the employee, the employee is, for the purpose of subsection (1), taken to be employed to work 38 hours per week.

             (3)  If an employee is employed to work a specified number (the **_number of non-week specified hours_**) of hours per period (the **_non-week period_**), but that period is not a week (for example, it is a fortnight), then, for the purpose of subsection (1), the employee is taken to be employed to work the number of hours per week determined, subject to the regulations (if any), in accordance with the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2007C00183/Html/WorkplaceRelationsAmdtWorkChoices2005_image002.gif)

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  subsection (1) applies to the employment of an employee to whom a training arrangement applies; and

                     (b)  an APCS includes provisions that determine, in relation to the employee’s employment, that hours attending off-the-job training (including hours attending an educational institution) are hours for which a basic periodic rate of pay is payable; and

                     (c)  the hours that would otherwise be the specified number of hours referred to in subsection (1) for the employee for a week do not include all the hours (the **_paid training hours_**) in the week that the APCS so determines are hours for which a basic periodic rate of pay is payable;

subsection (1) applies as if the specified number of hours were increased to such number of hours as includes all the paid training hours.

Employees not employed to work a specified number of hours

             (5)  For the purpose of section 90F, if subsection (1) of this section does not apply to the employment of an employee, the **_guaranteed hours_** for the employee are the hours that the employee both is required or requested to work, and does work, for the employer, less any period in relation to which the employer is prohibited by section 114 from making a payment to the employee.

                     (e)  any leave or absence that is authorised in order for the employee to attend paid training hours (within the meaning of paragraph (4)(c)) of off-the-job training.

                    <a name="hour"></a>**_hour_** includes a part of an hour.

Note:          An employee’s guaranteed hours may therefore be a number of hours and part of an hour.

                    <a name="public-holidai"></a>**_public holiday_** means:

                     (a)  a day declared by or under a law of a State or Territory to be observed generally within the State or Territory, or a region of that State or Territory, as a public holiday by people who work in that State, Territory or region, other than:

##### <a id="90GA"></a>90GA  Modified operation of section 90F to continue effect of Supported Wage System for certain employees with a disability

             (1)  This section applies to the employment of an employee with a disability if:

                     (a)  subsection 90F(1) applies (disregarding this section) to the employment of the employee; and

                     (b)  the APCS that covers the employee’s employment does not determine the basic periodic rate of pay for the employee as a rate that is specific to employees with disabilities; and

                     (c)  the employee is eligible for the Supported Wage System; and

                     (d)  the employee’s employment is covered by a workplace agreement; and

                     (e)  the workplace agreement provides for the payment of a basic periodic rate of pay to the employee at a rate that is not less than the rate (the **_SWS-compliant rate of pay_**) set in accordance with the Supported Wage System.

Note:          The Supported Wage System was endorsed by the Commission in the Full Bench decision dated 10 October 1994 (print L5723).

             (2)  If this section applies to the employment of the employee, subsection 90F(1) has effect as if the guaranteed basic periodic rate of pay under that subsection for the employment of the employee were instead a rate equal to the SWS-compliant rate of pay.

             (1)  This section applies to a casual employee for whom, under section 90F, there is a guaranteed basic periodic rate of pay, other than a casual employee in relation to whom the following paragraphs are satisfied:

                     (a)  subsection 90F(1) applies to the employee;

                     (b)  the APCS that covers the employment of the employee does not contain casual loading provisions under which a casual loading is payable to the employee;

                     (c)  the employee’s employment is not covered by a workplace agreement.

             (2)  The casual employee must be paid, in addition to his or her actual basic periodic rate of pay, a casual loading that is at least equal to the guaranteed casual loading percentage of that actual basic periodic rate of pay.

Note:          The employee’s actual basic periodic rate of pay should at least equal the guaranteed basic periodic rate of pay under section 90F.

             (3)  The **_guaranteed casual loading percentage_** is as set out in the following table:

##### <a id="90I"></a>90I  Default casual loading percentage

             (1)  The **_default casual loading percentage_** is 20%, subject to the power of the AFPC to adjust the percentage.

             (2)  Any adjustment of the default casual loading percentage must be such that the adjusted rate is still expressed as a percentage.

##### <a id="90J"></a>90J  Adjustment of default casual loading percentage

             (1)  The AFPC may adjust the default casual loading percentage.

             (2)  The power to adjust the default casual loading percentage is subject to:

                     (a)  sections 90 and 90A; and

                     (b)  subsection 90I(2); and

                     (c)  section 90K; and

##### <a id="90K"></a>90K  Only one default casual loading percentage

                   The AFPC must ensure that there is only ever one default casual loading percentage at any one time.

#### Subdivision CA—Guarantee of frequency of payment

##### <a id="90KA"></a>90KA  The guarantee

APCS applies and contains frequency of payment provisions

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  the employment of an employee is covered by an APCS; and

                     (b)  the APCS contains frequency of payment provisions that apply in relation to the employee’s employment;

the employer must comply with those provisions in relation to the employee.

APCS applies but does not contain frequency of payment provisions

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  the employment of an employee is covered by an APCS; but

                     (b)  the APCS does not contain frequency of payment provisions that apply in relation to the employee’s employment;

then:

                     (c)  if a workplace agreement that covers the employment of the employee contains frequency of payment provisions that apply in relation to the employee’s employment—the employer must comply with those provisions in relation to the employee; or

                     (d)  if paragraph (c) does not apply, and the employee’s contract of employment contains frequency of payment provisions that apply in relation to the employee’s employment—the employer must comply with those provisions in relation to the employee; or

                     (e)  if neither paragraph (c) nor (d) applies—the employer must pay the employee on the basis of fortnightly payments in arrears.

Other situations

             (3)  If the employment of an employee is not covered by an APCS, then:

                     (a)  if a workplace agreement that covers the employment of the employee contains frequency of payment provisions that apply in relation to the employee’s employment—the employer must comply with those provisions in relation to the employee; or

                     (b)  if paragraph (a) does not apply, and the employee’s contract of employment contains frequency of payment provisions that apply in relation to the employee’s employment—the employer must comply with those provisions in relation to the employee; or

                     (c)  if neither paragraph (a) nor (b) applies—the employer must pay the employee on the basis of fortnightly payments in arrears.

#### Subdivision D—Guarantee against reductions below pre-reform commencement rates

##### <a id="90L"></a>90L  The guarantee where only basic periodic rates of pay are involved

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  the AFPC proposes to exercise any of the following powers (subject to subsection (4)):

                              (i)  adjusting the standard FMW;

                             (ii)  adjusting a preserved APCS;

                            (iii)  determining or adjusting a new APCS;

                            (iv)  revoking a preserved or new APCS; and

                     (b)  immediately  after the exercise of the power takes effect, there will, under section 90F, be a guaranteed basic periodic rate of pay (the **_resulting guaranteed basic periodic rate_**) for a particular employee affected by the exercise of the power; and

                     (c)  immediately after the reform commencement (and after any relevant adjustments mentioned in sections 90ZE to 90ZH took effect), there would, under section 90F, have been a guaranteed basic periodic rate of pay (the **_commencement guaranteed basic periodic rate_**) for the employee if the employee had at that time been in his or her current circumstances of employment.

             (2)  The AFPC must ensure that the result of the exercise of the power, so far as it affects the employee, is such that the resulting guaranteed basic periodic rate of pay for the employee will not be less than the commencement guaranteed basic periodic rate of pay for the employee.

             (3)  In applying this section in relation to a particular exercise of a power by the AFPC, the effect of any other exercise of a power by the AFPC that takes effect at the same time must also be taken into account.

             (4)  This section does not limit the AFPC’s power to make APCSs for the purpose of section 90ZP or 90ZQ, or to adjust APCSs made for the purpose of either of those sections.

##### <a id="90M"></a>90M  The guarantee where basic piece rates of pay are involved

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  the AFPC proposes to exercise any of the following powers (subject to subsection (4)):

                              (i)  adjusting the standard FMW;

                             (ii)  adjusting a preserved APCS;

                            (iii)  determining or adjusting a new APCS;

                            (iv)  revoking a preserved or new APCS; and

                     (b)  either or both of the following subparagraphs apply in relation to a particular employee who will be affected by the exercise of the power:

                              (i)  immediately  after the exercise of the power takes effect, there will, under section 90F, be guaranteed basic piece rates of pay for the employee;

                             (ii)  immediately after the reform commencement (and after any relevant adjustments mentioned in sections 90ZE to 90ZH took effect), there would, under section 90F, have been guaranteed basic piece rates of pay for the employee if the employee had at that time been in his or her current circumstances of employment.

             (2)  The AFPC must exercise the power in a way that it considers will not result in an employee of average capacity, after the exercise of the power takes effect, being entitled to less basic pay per week  than he or she would have been entitled to because of this Division immediately after the reform commencement if the employee had at that time been in his or her current circumstances of employment.

             (3)  In applying this section in relation to a particular exercise of a power by the AFPC, the effect of any other exercise of a power by the AFPC that takes effect at the same time must also be taken into account.

             (4)  This section does not limit the AFPC’s power to make APCSs for the purpose of section 90ZP or 90ZQ, or to adjust APCSs made for the purpose of either of those sections.

##### <a id="90N"></a>90N  The guarantee for casual loadings that apply to basic periodic rates of pay

             (1)  This section applies in relation to the exercise by the AFPC of any of the following powers:

                     (a)  adjusting a preserved APCS;

                     (b)  determining or adjusting a new APCS;

                     (c)  revoking a preserved or new APCS;

                     (d)  adjusting the default casual loading percentage.

             (2)  The AFPC must ensure that the result of the exercise of the power, so far as it affects any particular employee to whom this Division applies (other than an employee who will, after the exercise of the power, be an APCS piece rate employee), is such that the resulting guaranteed casual loading percentage for the employee will not be less than the commencement guaranteed casual loading percentage for the employee.

             (3)  For the purposes of subsection (2):

                     (a)  the **_resulting guaranteed casual loading percentage_** for the employee is the guaranteed casual loading percentage referred to in section 90H for the employee, as it will be immediately after the exercise of the power takes effect; and

                     (b)  subject to subsection (4), the **_commencement guaranteed casual loading percentage_** for the employee is the percentage that, immediately after the reform commencement (and after any relevant adjustments mentioned in sections 90ZE to 90ZH took effect), would have been the guaranteed casual loading percentage referred to in section 90H for the employee if the employee had, at that time, been in his or her current circumstances of employment.

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  the employee is a casual employee; and

                     (b)  the resulting guaranteed casual loading percentage is the default casual loading percentage because of item 3 of the table in subsection 90H(3);

the **_commencement guaranteed casual loading percentage_** for the employee is taken to be the default casual loading percentage, as it was immediately after the reform commencement.

             (5)  In applying this section in relation to a particular exercise of a power by the AFPC, the effect of any other exercise of a power by the AFPC that takes effect at the same time must also be taken into account.

#### Subdivision E—The guarantee against reductions below Federal Minimum Wages (FMWs)

##### <a id="90O"></a>90O  The guarantee

             (1)  Subject to subsection (3), when exercising its power to make an APCS, or to adjust an APCS, the AFPC must ensure that the rate provisions in the APCS are such that the resulting APCS basic periodic rate of pay for each employee:

                     (a)  whose employment will be covered by the APCS immediately after the exercise of the power; and

                     (b)  for whom there will be an FMW immediately after the exercise of the power; and

                     (c)  who will not be an APCS piece rate employee immediately after the exercise of the power;

is not less than that FMW.

Note 1:       This section does not apply to rates determined by rate provisions as initially included in a preserved APCS from a pre-reform wage instrument as mentioned paragraph 90ZD(1)(a). However, this section does apply to any subsequent adjustment of those rate provisions, or to any new APCS that replaces the preserved APCS.

Note 2:       See also section 90ZC (deeming APCS rates to at least equal FMW rates after first exercise of powers under this Division by the AFPC).

             (2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), the **_resulting APCS basic periodic rate of pay_** for an employee is the basic periodic rate of pay that will be payable to the employee under the APCS immediately after the exercise of the power by the AFPC takes effect.

             (3)  The requirement in subsection (1) does not apply in relation to a special FMW unless the determination of the special FMW includes a statement to the effect that the special FMW is a minimum standard for all APCSs, for a class of APCSs that includes the APCS or for the particular APCS (see section 90T).

             (4)  In applying this section in relation to a particular exercise of a power by the AFPC, the effect of any other exercise of a power by the AFPC that takes effect at the same time must also be taken into account.

#### Subdivision F—Federal Minimum Wages (FMWs)

##### <a id="90P"></a>90P  When is there an FMW for an employee?

             (1)  There is an FMW for an employee if the employee is not:

                     (a)  a junior employee; or

                     (b)  an employee with a disability; or

                     (c)  an employee to whom a training arrangement applies; or

                     (d)  an APCS piece rate employee.

The FMW for the employee is the standard FMW.

             (2)  There is an FMW for a junior employee (other than an APCS piece rate employee) if the AFPC has determined a special FMW that applies to all junior employees, or to a class of junior employees that includes the employee. The FMW for the employee is that special FMW.

             (3)  There is an FMW for an employee with a disability (other than an APCS piece rate employee) if the AFPC has determined a special FMW that applies to all employees with a disability, or to a class of employees with a disability that includes the employee. The FMW for the employee is that special FMW.

             (4)  There is an FMW for an employee to whom a training arrangement applies (other than an APCS piece rate employee) if the AFPC has determined a special FMW that applies to all employees to whom training arrangements apply, or to a class of employees to whom training arrangements apply that includes the employee. The FMW for the employee is that special FMW.

##### <a id="90Q"></a>90Q  Standard FMW

             (1)  The **_standard FMW_** is $12.75 per hour, subject to the power of the AFPC to adjust the standard FMW.

             (2)  Any adjustment of the standard FMW must be such that the adjusted rate is still expressed as a monetary amount per hour.

##### <a id="90R"></a>90R  Adjustment of standard FMW

             (1)  The AFPC may adjust the standard FMW.

             (2)  The power to adjust the standard FMW is subject to:

                     (a)  sections 90 and 90A; and

                     (b)  section 90L; and

                     (c)  section 90M; and

                     (d)  subsection 90Q(2); and

                     (e)  section 90ZR.

##### <a id="90S"></a>90S  Determination of special FMWs

                   The AFPC may determine a **_special FMW_** for any of the following:

                     (a)  all junior employees, or a class of junior employees;

                     (b)  all employees with a disability, or a class of employees with a disability;

                     (c)  all employees to whom training arrangements apply, or a class of employees to whom training arrangements apply.

##### <a id="90T"></a>90T  AFPC to state whether special FMW is a minimum standard for APCSs

             (1)  When determining a special FMW, the AFPC must consider whether the FMW is to operate as a minimum standard for all, or one or more, APCSs.

             (2)  If the AFPC considers that the special FMW should operate as a minimum standard for all APCSs, the AFPC must, in the instrument determining the special FMW, include a statement to that effect.

             (3)  If the AFPC considers that the special FMW should operate as a minimum standard for one or more (but not all) APCSs, the AFPC must, in the instrument determining the special FMW, include a statement to that effect that identifies those APCSs, whether by description of a class or identification of the particular APCS or APCSs.

             (4)  If the AFPC considers that the special FMW should not operate as a minimum standard for any APCS, the AFPC must, in the instrument determining the special FMW, include a statement to that effect.

##### <a id="90U"></a>90U  How a special FMW is to be expressed

             (1)  A special FMW is to be expressed in a way that produces a monetary amount per hour.

             (2)  The means by which a special FMW may be expressed to produce a monetary amount per hour include:

                     (a)  specification of a monetary amount per hour; or

                     (b)  specification of a method for calculating a monetary amount per hour.

             (3)  Any adjustment of a special FMW must be such that the adjusted special FMW still complies with this section.

##### <a id="90V"></a>90V  Adjustment of a special FMW

             (1)  The AFPC may adjust a special FMW.

             (2)  The power to adjust a special FMW is subject to:

                     (a)  sections 90 and 90A; and

                     (b)  section 90U; and

                     (c)  section 90ZR.

             (3)  The AFPC may adjust statements of a kind mentioned in section 90T that are included in the instrument determining the special FMW.

#### Subdivision G—Australian Pay and Classification Scales (APCSs): general provisions

##### <a id="90W"></a>90W  What is an APCS?

             (1)  An APCS is a set of provisions relating to pay and loadings for particular employees that complies with this Subdivision.

             (2)  An APCS is either:

                     (a)  a preserved APCS (see section 90ZD); or

                     (b)  a new APCS (see section 90ZJ).

##### <a id="90X"></a>90X  What must or may be in an APCS?

             (1)  An APCS must contain:

                     (a)  either or both of the following:

                              (i)  rate provisions determining basic periodic rates of pay for employees whose employment is covered by the APCS;

                             (ii)  rate provisions determining basic piece rates of pay for employees whose employment is covered by the APCS; and

                     (b)  if the rate provisions determine different rates of pay for employees of different classifications—provisions describing those classifications; and

                     (c)  coverage provisions.

             (2)  An APCS may also contain:

                     (a)  casual loading provisions determining casual loadings for employees whose employment is covered by the APCS and for whom there are not basic piece rates of pay; and

                     (b)  if the casual loading provisions determine different casual loadings for employees of different classifications—provisions describing those classifications; and

                     (c)  provisions that determine, in relation to employees to whom training arrangements apply, whether hours attending off-the-job training (including hours attending an educational institution) are hours for which a basic periodic rate of pay is payable; and

                    (ca)  frequency of payment provisions; and

                     (d)  other incidental provisions.

             (3)  Subject to subsection 90ZD(3A), rate provisions or casual loading provisions in an APCS must not include provisions under which a rate or casual loading provided for by the APCS will or may be increased by operation of the provisions and without anyone having to take any other action.

Note:          This does not prevent an APCS, or an adjustment of an APCS, from being expressed to take effect at a future date. However, it does prevent an APCS from containing provisions under which (for example):

(a)           there will be one or more specified increases of a rate or loading at a specified future time or times; or

(b)           rates of pay or loading are indexed periodically.

             (4)  The AFPC must not include in a new APCS, or adjust a preserved or new APCS so that it includes, provisions that:

                     (a)  determine whether an employer who acquires a business (whether by transfer or in some other way) is covered by the APCS; or

                     (b)  give a person or body a power to make a decision that affects whether a person is covered by the APCS; or

                     (c)  give the Commission a direct or indirect role in determining a rate of pay or loading.

Note:          A preserved APCS may contain provisions referred to in subsection (4) that were contained in the pre-reform wage instrument from which the APCS is derived, but the effect of those provisions is limited by sections 90Z and 90ZE.

             (5)  An APCS must not contain any provisions that purport to limit the duration of the APCS.

             (6)  Subject to the regulations, an APCS must not contain any other provisions.

##### <a id="90Y"></a>90Y  How pay rates and loadings are to be expressed in an APCS

             (1)  Rate provisions in an APCS must be such that basic periodic rates of pay determined by the provisions are expressed as a monetary amount per hour.

             (2)  Rate provisions in an APCS must be such that basic piece rates of pay determined by the provisions are expressed as a monetary amount.

             (3)  Casual loading provisions in an APCS must be such that casual loadings determined by the provisions are expressed as percentages to be applied to basic periodic rates of pay.

             (4)  The AFPC must ensure these rules are complied with in exercising its powers to adjust a preserved APCS or make or adjust a new APCS.

##### <a id="90Z"></a>90Z  When is employment covered by an APCS?

             (1)  The question whether the employment of a particular employee is covered by a particular APCS is to be determined by reference to the coverage provisions of the APCS.

             (2)  If coverage provisions of a preserved APCS include provisions that determine whether an employer who acquires a business (whether by transfer or in some other way) is covered by the APCS, those provisions only have effect, for the purpose of determining whether the employment of a particular employee is covered by the APCS, in relation to acquisitions of businesses that occurred before the reform commencement.

             (3)  If coverage provisions of a preserved APCS include provisions that give a person or body a power to make a decision that affects whether a person is covered by the APCS, those provisions only have effect, for the purpose of determining whether the employment of a particular employee is covered by the APCS, in relation to decisions made by the person or body before the reform commencement.

##### <a id="90ZA"></a>90ZA  What if 2 or more APCSs would otherwise cover an employee?

             (1)  If, but for this section, 2 or more APCSs would cover the employment of the same employee, the employment of the employee is taken to be covered only by the APCS that prevails.

             (2)  Apply the following rules to work out which APCS prevails:

                     (a)  the preserved APCS derived from the pre-reform federal wage instrument referred to in paragraph (b) of the definition of **_pre-reform federal wage instrument_** in section 90B (as that preserved APCS is adjusted from time to time) prevails over any other APCS;

                     (b)  subject to paragraph (a), an APCS made in accordance with Subdivision L (as that APCS is adjusted from time to time) prevails over any other APCS;

                     (c)  subject to paragraphs (a) and (b):

                              (i)  a new APCS prevails over a preserved APCS; and

                             (ii)  a preserved APCS that is derived from a pre-reform federal wage instrument prevails over a preserved APCS that is derived from a pre-reform non-federal wage instrument;

                     (d)  subject to paragraphs (a), (b) and (c):

                              (i)  as between 2 or more APCSs that are made or adjusted on different days, the APCS that is made or adjusted on the more recent day prevails; and

                             (ii)  as between 2 or more APCSs that are made or adjusted on the same day, the APCS that is more generous to the employee prevails.

             (3)  For the purpose of this section, all preserved APCSs are taken to have been made on the day on which the reform commencement occurs.

##### <a id="90ZB"></a>90ZB  AFPC to remove coverage rules described by reference to State or Territory boundaries

             (1)  The AFPC must (through exercise of its powers to adjust, revoke and make APCSs) ensure that, by the end of the period of 3 years  starting on the reform commencement, all APCSs comply with the following rules:

                     (a)  the question whether the employment of a particular employee is covered by an APCS must not be determined by reference to State or Territory boundaries;

                     (b)  the question whether a particular employee is entitled to a particular basic periodic rate of pay, basic piece rate of pay, or casual loading provided for by an APCS must not be determined by reference to State or Territory boundaries.

             (2)  In complying with this obligation, the AFPC must do so in a way that also complies with the rest of this Division, including (in particular) sections 90L, 90M, 90N and 90O.

##### <a id="90ZC"></a>90ZC  Deeming APCS rates to at least equal FMW rates after first exercise of AFPC’s powers takes effect

             (1)  This section applies at all times after the first exercise of powers by the AFPC under this Division takes effect. If the first exercise of powers involves the exercise of powers taking effect at different times, this section applies at all times after the earliest of those times.

             (2)  Subject to subsection (3), if:

                     (a)  there is an FMW for an employee at a particular time when this section applies; and

                     (b)  an APCS that covers the employment of the employee determines a basic periodic rate of pay for the employee at that time that is less than that FMW;

the basic periodic rate of pay determined by the APCS for the employee at that time is taken to be equal to the rate that is the FMW for the employee at that time.

Note:          This subsection ensures that the employee will, under subsection 90F(1), be guaranteed a rate that equals the FMW rate, rather than the lower APCS rate.

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not apply in relation to a special FMW and a particular APCS unless the determination of the special FMW includes a statement to the effect that the special FMW is a minimum standard for all APCSs, for a class of APCSs that includes the APCS or for the particular APCS (see section 90T).

#### Subdivision H—Australian Pay and Classification Scales: preserved APCSs

##### <a id="90ZD"></a>90ZD  Deriving preserved APCSs from pre-reform wage instruments

             (1)  If a pre-reform wage instrument contains rate provisions determining one or more basic periodic rates of pay, or basic piece rates of pay, payable to employees, then, from the reform commencement, there is taken to be a **_preserved APCS_** that includes (subject to this Subdivision):

                     (a)  those rate provisions; and

                     (b)  if those rate provisions determine different basic periodic rates of pay, or different basic piece rates of pay, for employees of different classifications—the provisions of the instrument that describe those classifications; and

                     (c)  any casual loading provisions of the instrument that determine casual loadings payable to employees, other than employees for whom the instrument provides basic piece rates of pay; and

                     (d)  if the casual loading provisions determine different casual loadings for employees of different classifications—the provisions of the instrument that describe those classifications; and

                     (e)  any provisions of the instrument that determine, in relation to employees to whom training arrangements apply, whether hours attending off-the-job training (including hours attending an educational institution) count as hours for which a basic periodic rate of pay is payable; and

                    (ea)  any frequency of payment provisions for the instrument; and

                      (f)  the coverage provisions for the instrument.

             (2)  The preserved APCS is **_derived from_** the pre-reform wage instrument.

             (3)  Subject to subsection (3A) and the regulations, the preserved APCS is taken not to include any provision of the pre-reform wage instrument which, after the adjustments referred to in sections 90ZE to 90ZH take effect, will not comply with the requirements of sections 90X and 90Y.

Note:          For when regulations made for the purpose of subsection (3) may be expressed to take effect, see section 90ZI.

          (3A)  If:

                     (a)  the rate provisions referred to in paragraph (1)(a) include pay increases for particular employees, determined before the reform commencement, that are expressed to take effect at a time or times after the reform commencement; and

                     (b)  those increases were determined by the Commission, or by a State industrial authority, wholly or partly on the ground of work value change or pay equity;

then (despite subsection 90X(3)), the preserved APCS is taken to include provisions under which those increases will take effect for those employees at that time or those times.

             (4)  The adjustments referred to in sections 90ZE to 90ZH are, subject to the regulations, to be made in the following order:

                     (a)  adjustments referred to in section 90ZE;

                     (b)  adjustments referred to in section 90ZF;

                     (c)  adjustments referred to in section 90ZG;

                     (d)  adjustments referred to in subsection 90ZH(1).

Note:          For when regulations made for the purpose of subsection (4) may be expressed to take effect, see section 90ZI.

##### <a id="90ZE"></a>90ZE  Notional adjustment: rates and loadings determined as for reform comparison day

Rate provisions

             (1)  Subject to subsections (2) and (3), if rate provisions included in a preserved APCS as mentioned in section 90ZD would, apart from this subsection, determine a basic periodic rate of pay otherwise than by direct specification of the monetary amount of the rate, then the APCS is taken to be adjusted as necessary immediately after the reform commencement so that those rate provisions instead directly specify, as that rate of pay, the rate as determined by the provisions for the reform comparison day.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply to the rate provisions included in the preserved APCS derived from the pre-reform federal wage instrument referred to in paragraph (b) of the definition of **_pre-reform federal wage instrument_** in section 90B.

             (3)  If the rate provisions included in a preserved APCS as mentioned in section 90ZD determine a basic periodic rate of pay by (or by referring to) a pro-rata disability pay method, subsection (1) applies to any other rate of pay that the method refers to, but does not otherwise apply to the method.

             (4)  If the rate provisions included in a preserved APCS as mentioned in section 90ZD determine a basic piece rate of pay by (or by referring to) a method, subsection (1) does not apply to the rate provisions that determine that rate.

             (5)  The regulations may provide for other situations in which subsection (1) is not to apply to rate provisions, or is to apply with specified modifications.

Note:          For when regulations made for the purpose of subsection (5) may be expressed to take effect, see section 90ZI.

Casual loading provisions

             (6)  If casual loading provisions included in a preserved APCS as mentioned in section 90ZD would, apart from this subsection, determine a loading otherwise than by direct specification of the loading, then the APCS is taken to be adjusted as necessary immediately after the reform commencement so that those loading provisions instead directly specify, as that loading, the loading as determined by the provisions for the reform comparison day.

##### <a id="90ZF"></a>90ZF  Notional adjustment: deducing basic periodic rate of pay and casual loading from composite rate

                   If:

                     (a)  a particular rate of pay determined by rate provisions included in a preserved APCS as mentioned in section 90ZD would, apart from this subsection, be a basic periodic rate of pay for a casual employee; and

                     (b)  the rate of pay is, by an amount (the **_inbuilt casual loading amount_**), higher than it would have been if the employee had not been a casual employee; and

                     (c)  apart from this subsection, the preserved APCS does not contain casual loading provisions that determine a casual loading for the employee;

the APCS is taken to be adjusted as necessary immediately after the reform commencement so that:

                     (d)  the rate provisions instead determine a basic periodic rate of pay for the employee that equals the rate referred to in paragraph (a), reduced by the inbuilt casual loading amount; and

                     (e)  the preserved APCS contains casual loading provisions that determine a casual loading for the employee that equals the inbuilt casual loading amount.

##### <a id="90ZG"></a>90ZG  Notional adjustment: how basic periodic rates and loadings are expressed

             (1)  If a particular basic periodic rate of pay determined by rate provisions included in a preserved APCS as mentioned in section 90ZD would, apart from this subsection, be expressed as a monetary amount for a period other than an hour (for example, it would be expressed as a rate for a week), the rate provisions are taken to be adjusted as necessary immediately after the reform commencement so that they produce the result that the rate is expressed as the equivalent monetary hourly rate.

             (2)  If a particular casual loading determined by casual loading provisions included in a preserved APCS as mentioned in section 90ZD would, apart from this subsection, be expressed as an amount of money that is to be added to a basic periodic rate of pay, the loading provisions are taken to be adjusted as necessary immediately after the reform commencement so that they produce the result that the loading is expressed as the equivalent percentage of the basic periodic rate of pay.

##### <a id="90ZH"></a>90ZH  Regulations dealing with notional adjustments

             (1)  The regulations may provide for other adjustments (including by determining methods for working out adjustments) that are to be taken to be made to a preserved APCS.

             (2)  The regulations may determine methods for working out the adjustments mentioned in any of sections 90ZE to 90ZG, or may otherwise clarify the operation of any aspect of those sections. Those sections have effect accordingly.

Note:          For when regulations made for the purpose of this section may be expressed to take effect, see section 90ZI.

##### <a id="90ZI"></a>90ZI  Certain regulations relating to preserved APCSs may take effect before registration

             (1)  This section applies to regulations made for the purpose of any of the following provisions:

                     (a)  paragraph (c) or (d) of the definition of **_pre-reform federal wage instrument_** in section 90B;

                     (b)  paragraph (c) or (d) of the definition of **_pre-reform State wage instrument_** in section 90B;

                     (e)  subsection 90ZE(5);

                      (f)  section 90ZH.

             (2)  Despite subsection 12(2) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_, regulations to which this section applies may be expressed to take effect from a date before the regulations are registered under that Act.

             (3)  If regulations to which this section applies take effect before their registration under the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_, those regulations are not to be taken into account in determining the effect of sections 90F, 90H, 90L, 90M and 90N in relation to periods of employment before the registration of those regulations.

#### Subdivision I—Australian Pay and Classification Scales: new APCSs

##### <a id="90ZJ"></a>90ZJ  AFPC may determine new APCSs

             (1)  The AFPC may determine an APCS (a **_new APCS_**).

             (2)  The power to determine a new APCS is subject to:

                     (a)  sections 90 and 90A; and

                     (b)  section 90L; and

                     (h)  Subdivision L; and

                      (i)  section 90ZR.

#### Subdivision J—Australian Pay and Classification Scales: duration, adjustment and revocation of APCSs (preserved or new)

##### <a id="90ZK"></a>90ZK  Duration of APCSs

                   An APCS continues to have effect indefinitely (subject to revocation or adjustment by the AFPC under this Subdivision, and to the rules in section 90ZA about when one APCS prevails over another).

##### <a id="90ZL"></a>90ZL  Adjustment of APCSs

             (1)  The AFPC may adjust an APCS.

             (2)  The power to adjust an APCS is subject to:

                     (a)  sections 90 and 90A; and

                     (b)  section 90L; and

                     (c)  section 90M; and

##### <a id="90ZM"></a>90ZM  Revocation of APCSs

             (1)  The AFPC may revoke an APCS.

             (2)  The power to revoke an APCS is subject to:

                     (a)  sections 90 and 90A; and

                     (b)  section 90L; and

                     (c)  section 90M; and

                     (e)  section 90ZR.

#### Subdivision K—Adjustments to incorporate 2005 Safety Net Review etc.

##### <a id="90ZN"></a>90ZN  Adjustments to incorporate 2005 Safety Net Review

             (1)  This section applies in relation to a preserved APCS if:

                     (a)  the APCS is derived from a pre-reform federal wage instrument referred to in paragraph (a) of the definition of **_pre-reform federal wage instrument_** in section 90B; and

                     (b)  either:

                              (i)  in accordance with the Commission’s  wage fixing principles that applied at that time, the Commission (before the reform commencement) adjusted the instrument in accordance with the Commission’s 2004 Safety Net Review decision; or

                             (ii)  the instrument took effect after the Commission’s 2004 Safety Net Review decision; and

                     (c)  the Commission did not, before the reform commencement, adjust the instrument in accordance with the Commission’s 2005 Safety Net Review decision.

             (2)  The AFPC must adjust the rate provisions of the preserved APCS to increase rates  in accordance with the Commission’s 2005 Safety Net Review decision (if applicable), except to the extent that the AFPC is satisfied it is not appropriate to do so because of the effect of subsection 90ZD(3A).

             (3)  The adjustment must be made as part of the first exercise of the powers of the AFPC under this Division.

             (4)  After the adjustment has been made, section 90L  has effect in relation to an employee as if the adjustment had been made to the pre-reform federal wage instrument immediately before the reform commencement.

Note:          This subsection ensures that the post-adjustment rate is the rate against which compliance with the guarantee in section 90L is measured.

##### <a id="90ZO"></a>90ZO  Regulations may require adjustments to incorporate other decisions

             (1)  The regulations may require the AFPC to adjust rate provisions in a class of preserved APCSs that are derived from non-federal pre-reform wage instruments to increase rates  to take account of decisions that were made before the reform commencement but that were not given effect to in those instruments before the reform commencement.

             (2)  Regulations made for the purposes of subsection (1) may also modify how section 90L applies in relation to any APCSs that are so adjusted.

#### Subdivision L—Special provisions relating to APCSs for employees with disabilities and employees to whom training arrangements apply

##### <a id="90ZP"></a>90ZP  Employees with disabilities

             (1)  If the AFPC considers that there should be an APCS that applies to all, or a class of, employees with a disability that determines basic periodic rates of pay for those employees, the AFPC must determine an APCS containing rate provisions that determine basic periodic rates of pay for those employees, and that so determines those rates as rates specific to employees with disabilities.

Note:          The usual provisions relating to the content of an APCS apply (see Subdivision G).

             (2)  The determination of the APCS must include a statement to the effect that it is determined for the purpose of this section.

Note:          APCSs determined for the purpose of this section generally prevail over all other APCSs—see section 90ZA.

             (3)  The APCS (the **_special APCS_**) is taken not to cover the employment of a particular employee if:

                     (a)  there is another APCS that covers the employment of the employee (disregarding the effect that paragraph 90ZA(2)(b) would otherwise have because of the special APCS); and

                     (b)  that other APCS determines a basic periodic rate of pay specifically for a particular class of employees with disabilities; and

                     (c)  the employee’s employment is covered by that other APCS because the employee is a member of that class; and

                     (d)  that class is the same as, or is a subclass of, the employees whose employment would otherwise be covered by the special APCS.

             (4)  This section does not limit the powers of the AFPC to determine APCSs, or to revoke or adjust APCSs (including APCSs determined for the purpose of this section).

##### <a id="90ZQ"></a>90ZQ  Employees to whom training arrangements apply

             (1)  If the AFPC considers that there should be an APCS that applies to all, or a class of, employees to whom training arrangements apply that determines basic periodic rates of pay that are payable to those employees, the AFPC must determine an APCS containing rate provisions that determine basic periodic rates of pay to be payable to those employees, and that so determines those rates as rates specific to employees to whom training arrangements apply.

Note:          The usual provisions relating to the content of an APCS apply (see Subdivision G).

             (2)  The determination of the APCS must include a statement to the effect that it is determined for the purpose of this section.

Note:          APCSs determined for the purpose of this section generally prevail over all other APCSs—see section 90ZA.

             (3)  The APCS (the **_special APCS_**) is taken not to cover the employment of a particular employee if:

                     (a)  there is another APCS that covers the employment of the employee (disregarding the effect that paragraph 90ZA(2)(b) would otherwise have because of the special APCS); and

                     (b)  that other APCS determines a basic periodic rate of pay specifically for a particular class of employees to whom training arrangements apply; and

                     (c)  the employee’s employment is covered by that other APCS because the employee is a member of that class; and

                     (d)  that class is the same as, or is a subclass of, the employees whose employment would otherwise be covered by the special APCS.

             (4)  The AFPC must, as part of the first exercise of the powers of the AFPC under this Division, consider whether it should determine APCSs for the purpose of this section. This does not limit the AFPC’s power to consider whether it should determine APCSs for the purpose of this section at other times.

             (5)  This section does not limit the powers of the AFPC to determine APCSs, or to revoke or adjust APCSs (including APCSs determined for the purpose of this section).

#### Subdivision M—Miscellaneous

##### <a id="90ZR"></a>90ZR  Anti-discrimination considerations

             (1)  Without limiting sections 90 and 90A, in exercising any of its powers under this Division, the AFPC is to:

                     (a)  apply the principle that men and women should receive equal remuneration for work of equal value; and

                     (b)  have regard to the need to provide pro-rata disability pay methods for employees with disabilities; and

                     (c)  take account of the principles embodied in the _Racial Discrimination Act 1975_, the _Sex Discrimination Act 1984_, the _Disability Discrimination Act 1992_ and the _Age Discrimination Act 2004_ relating to discrimination in relation to employment; and

                     (d)  take account of the principles embodied in the Family Responsibilities Convention, in particular those relating to:

                              (i)  preventing discrimination against workers who have family responsibilities; or

                             (ii)  helping workers to reconcile their employment and family responsibilities; and

                     (e)  ensure that its decisions do not contain provisions that discriminate because of, or for reasons including, race, colour, sex, sexual preference, age, physical or mental disability, marital status, family responsibilities, pregnancy, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin.

             (2)  For the purposes of the Acts referred to in paragraph (1)(c), and of paragraph (1)(e), the AFPC does not discriminate against an employee or employees by (in accordance with this Division) determining or adjusting rate provisions in an APCS that determine a basic periodic rate of pay, or by (in accordance with this Division) determining or adjusting a special FMW, for:

                     (a)  all junior employees, or a class of junior employees; or

                     (b)  all employees with a disability, or a class of employees with a disability; or

                     (c)  all employees to whom training arrangements apply, or a class of employees to whom training arrangements apply.

### Division 3—Maximum ordinary hours of work

                     (c)  by or under a law, or an instrument in force under a law, of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory.

                    <a name="employe"></a>**_employee_** means an employee to whom this Division applies under section 91.

##### <a id="91B"></a>91B  Agreement between employees and employers

Via a workplace agreement

             (1)  For the purposes of this Division, an employee and an employer are taken to agree about a particular matter in a particular way if a provision of a workplace agreement binding the employee and the employer specifies that the matter is to be dealt with in that way.

Via an award

             (2)  For the purposes of this Division, an employee and an employer are taken to agree about a particular matter in a particular way if a term of an award that binds the employee and the employer specifies that the matter is to be dealt with in that way.

Via other means

             (3)  To avoid doubt, nothing in this section prevents employees and employers agreeing about matters by other means.

#### Subdivision B—Guarantee of maximum ordinary hours of work

##### <a id="91C"></a>91C  The guarantee

             (1)  An employee must not be required or requested by an employer to work more than:

                     (a)  either:

                              (i)  38 hours per week; or

                             (ii)  subject to subsection (3), if the employee and the employer agree in writing that the employee’s hours of work are to be averaged over a specified averaging period that is no longer than 12 months—an average of 38 hours per week over that averaging period; and

Note 1:       An employee and an employer may agree that the employee is to work less than 38 hours per week, or less than an average of 38 hours per week over the employee’s averaging period.

Note 2:       A requirement for an employee to work a particular number of hours may come, for example, from an award or a workplace agreement.

Calculating the number of hours worked

             (2)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), in calculating the number of hours that an employee has worked in a particular week, or the average number of hours that an employee has worked per week over an averaging period, the hours worked by the employee are taken to include any hours of authorised leave taken by the employee during the week, or during that period.

Start of averaging period

             (3)  For the purpose of subparagraph (1)(a)(ii), if an employee starts to work for an employer after the start of a particular averaging period that applies to the employee, that averaging period is taken, in relation to the employee, not to include the period before the employee started to work for the employer.

Reasonable additional hours

             (5)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), in determining whether additional hours that an employee is required or requested by an employer to work are reasonable additional hours, all relevant factors must be taken into account. Those factors may include, but are not limited to, the following:

                     (b)  the employee’s personal circumstances (including family responsibilities);

                     (c)  the operational requirements of the workplace, or enterprise, in relation to which the employee is required or requested to work the additional hours;

                     (d)  any notice given by the employer of the requirement or request that the employee work the additional hours;

                     (e)  any notice given by the employee of the employee’s intention to refuse to work the additional hours;

                      (f)  whether any of the additional hours are on a public holiday;

                     (g)  the employee’s hours of work over the 4 weeks ending immediately before the employee is required or requested to work the additional hours.

Note:          An employee and an employer may agree that the employee may take breaks during any additional hours worked by the employee.

Definition

             (6)  In this section:

                    <a name="public-holidai"></a>**_public holiday_** means:

                     (a)  a day declared by or under a law of a State or Territory to be observed generally within the State or Territory, or a region of that State or Territory, as a public holiday by people who work in that State, Territory or region, other than:

                              (i)  a union picnic day; or

##### <a id="92AA"></a>92AA  Meaning of _nominal hours worked_

Employees employed to work a specified number of hours

             (1)  For the purposes of this Division, if an employee is employed by an employer to work a specified number of hours per week, the number of **_nominal hours worked_**, by the employee for the employer during a week, is to be worked out as follows:

                     (a)  start with that specified number of hours;

                     (b)  deduct all of the following:

                              (i)  the number of hours (if any) in the week when the employee is absent from his or her work for the employer on leave which does not count as service;

                             (ii)  the number of hours (if any) in the week (other than hours mentioned in subparagraph (i)) in relation to which the employer is prohibited by section 114 from making a payment to the employee.

Note:          The actual hours worked from week to week by an employee who is employed to work a specified number of hours per week may vary, due to averaging as mentioned in section 91C or to some other kind of flexible working hours scheme that applies to the employee’s employment.

             (2)  If an employee is employed on a full-time basis, but the terms and conditions of the employee’s employment do not determine the number of hours in a week that is to constitute employment on a full-time basis for the employee, the employee is, for the purpose of subsection (1), taken to be employed to work 38 hours per week.

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2007C00183/Html/WorkplaceRelationsAmdtWorkChoices2005_image003.gif)

Employees not employed to work a specified number of hours

             (4)  For the purposes of this Division, if subsection (1) does not apply to the employment of an employee by an employer, the number of **_nominal hours worked_**, by the employee  for the employer during a week, is the lesser of the following:

                     (a)  the number worked out as follows:

                              (i)  start with the number of hours (if any) in the week that the employee both works, and is required or requested to work, for the employer;

                             (ii)  add the number of hours (if any) in the week when the employee is absent from his or her work for the employer on leave that counts as service;

                            (iii)  deduct the number of hours (if any) in the week in relation to which the employer is prohibited by section 114 from making a payment to the employee;

                     (b)  the number of nominal hours the employee would be taken to have worked for the employer under subsection (1) during the week if the employee were employed to work 38 hours per week.

Definition

             (5)  In this section:

                    <a name="hour"></a>**_hour_** includes a part of an hour.

Note 1:       The regulations may prescribe a different definition of **_nominal hours worked_** for piece rate employees (see section 92C).

Note 2:       An employee’s hours of work may be varied (by number or time) in accordance with a workplace agreement, award or contract of employment that binds the employee and his or her employer.

Note 3:       For whether leave guaranteed under this Part counts as service, see subsections 92I(2) (annual leave), 93T(2) (paid personal leave), 93U(2) (unpaid carer’s leave) and 94ZZB(2) (parental leave).

Note 4:       Because of the definition of **_hour_** in subsection (5), an employee’s nominal hours worked may be a number of hours and part of an hour.

##### <a id="92B"></a>92B  Agreement between employees and employers

Via a workplace agreement

             (1)  For the purposes of this Division, an employee and an employer are taken to agree about a particular matter in a particular way if a provision of a workplace agreement binding the employee and the employer specifies that the matter is to be dealt with in that way.

Via other means

             (2)  To avoid doubt, nothing in this section prevents employees and employers agreeing about matters by other means.

##### <a id="92C"></a>92C  Regulations may prescribe different definitions for piece rate employees

                   The regulations may prescribe:

                     (a)  a different definition of **_basic periodic rate of pay_** for the purpose of the application of this Division in relation to piece rate employees; and

##### <a id="92D"></a>92D  The guarantee

             (1)  For the purposes of this Division, **_annual leave_** means leave to which an employee is entitled under this Subdivision.

All employees to whom this Division applies

             (2)  An employee is entitled to accrue an amount of paid annual leave, for each completed 4 week period of continuous service with an employer, of 1/13 of the number of nominal hours worked by the employee for the employer during that 4 week period.

Example:    An employee whose nominal hours worked for a 12 month period were 38 hours per week would be entitled under this subsection to 152 hours of annual leave (which would be the equivalent of 4 weeks of annual leave if his or her nominal hours worked remained unchanged).

Additional leave entitlement for shift workers

             (3)  An employee is also entitled to accrue an amount of paid annual leave, for each completed 12 month period of continuous service with an employer, of 1/52 of the number of nominal hours worked by the employee, for the employer, as a shift worker during that 12 month period.

Example:    A shift worker whose nominal hours worked for a 12 month period were 38 hours per week, and who worked as a shift worker throughout that period, would be entitled under this subsection to an additional 38 hours of annual leave (which would be the equivalent of one week of annual leave if his or her nominal hours worked remained unchanged).

##### <a id="92E"></a>92E  Entitlement to cash out annual leave

             (1)  An employee is entitled to forgo an entitlement to take an amount of annual leave credited to the employee by an employer if:

                     (a)  a provision in a workplace agreement binding the employee and the employer entitles the employee to forgo the entitlement to the amount of annual leave; and

                     (b)  the employee gives the employer a written election to forgo the amount of annual leave; and

                     (c)  a provision in a workplace agreement binding the employee and the employer entitles the employee to receive pay in lieu of the amount of annual leave at a rate that is no less than the employee’s basic periodic rate of pay at the time that the election is made; and

                     (d)  the employer authorises the employee to forgo the amount of annual leave.

Note:          If, under this section, an employee forgoes an entitlement to take an amount of annual leave, the employee’s employer may deduct that amount from the amount of accrued annual leave credited to the employee.

             (2)  However, during each 12 month period, an employee is not entitled to forgo an amount of annual leave credited to the employee by an employer that is equal to more than 1/26 of the nominal hours worked by the employee for the employer during the period.

             (3)  An employer must not:

                     (a)  require an employee to forgo an entitlement to take an amount of annual leave; or

                     (b)  exert undue influence or undue pressure on an employee in relation to the making of a decision by the employee whether or not to forgo an entitlement to take an amount of annual leave.

             (4)  If, under this section, an employee forgoes an entitlement to take an amount of annual leave, the employer must, within a reasonable period, give the employee the amount of pay that the employee is entitled to receive in lieu of the amount of annual leave.

             (3)  Paid personal/carer’s leave accrues on a pro-rata basis.

Crediting

##### <a id="94U"></a>94U  Period of paternity leave

             (1)  In this section:

                    <a name="relat-authorised-leav"></a>**_related authorised leave_**, in relation to paternity leave taken (or to be taken) by an employee because his spouse has given birth to a living child, means any of the following types of authorised leave other than the paternity leave:

                     (a)  authorised leave taken by the employee because of any of the following:

                              (i)  the birth of the child;

                             (ii)  the death of the child;

                     (b)  maternity leave, or any other authorised leave of the same type as maternity leave, taken by the employee’s spouse because of the birth of the child or the pregnancy.

                   Rachel has not taken any special maternity leave or other authorised leave during her pregnancy. She intends to take 20 weeks of maternity leave because of the birth of the child.

                   The maximum amount of long paternity leave to which Max is entitled is 27 weeks, worked out as follows:

(a)           the maximum entitlement of any employee to paternity leave is 52 weeks;

(b)           the maximum amount of long paternity leave available to Max must be reduced by 1 week for his short paternity leave;

(c)           the maximum amount must also be reduced by 4 weeks for Max’s annual leave;

(d)           the maximum amount must be further reduced by 20 weeks for Rachel’s maternity leave.

Note:          A period of long paternity leave must end within 12 months after the date of birth of the child (see section 94ZB).

##### <a id="94V"></a>94V  Short paternity leave—concurrent leave taken by spouse

##### <a id="94W"></a>94W  Long paternity leave—not to be concurrent with maternity leave taken by spouse

                   A period of long paternity leave taken by an employee in relation to the birth of a child by his spouse must not include any period during which the spouse is taking maternity leave, or any other authorised leave of the same type as maternity leave, because of the birth.

Note:          The employee may shorten a period of long adoption leave by agreement with the employer under section 94ZX. However, if the period of leave including (or constituted by) long adoption leave is longer than 4 weeks, to take advantage of the return to work guarantee under section 94ZZ, the employee must also give the employer at least 4 weeks written notice of the proposed day of his or her return to work.

             (4)  The employee’s employer may give the employee written notice that, from a stated day no earlier than 4 weeks after the day the notice is given, any untaken long adoption leave that the employee remains entitled to at the stated day is cancelled with effect from that day.

             (2)  The employee’s employer may give the employee written notice that, from a stated day no earlier than 4 weeks after the day the notice is given, any untaken long adoption leave that the employee remains entitled to at the stated day is cancelled with effect from that day.

             (3)  The employee’s entitlement to any untaken long adoption leave in relation to the placement ends with effect from the day stated in the notice.

                     (a)  a term or condition of his or her employment; or

                     (b)  a law, or an instrument in force under a law, of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory.

##### <a id="94ZZ"></a>94ZZ  Return to work guarantee—adoption leave

(b)  if he or she was promoted or voluntarily transferred to a new position during the adoption-related leave period—to the new position.

             (3)  However, if the position (the **_former position_**) no longer exists, and the employee is qualified and able to work for his or her employer in another position, the employer must employ the employee in:

                     (a)  that position; or

##### <a id="98"></a>98  Providing employees with ready access and information statement

             (1)  If an employer intends to have a workplace agreement (other than a greenfields agreement) approved under section 98C, the employer must take reasonable steps to ensure that all eligible employees in relation to the agreement either have, or have ready access to, the agreement in writing during the period:

                     (a)  beginning 7 days before the agreement is approved; and

                     (b)  ending when the agreement is approved.

             (3)  Despite subsections (1) and (2), if the agreement is a collective agreement and a person becomes an eligible employee at a time during the period mentioned in subsection (1), the employer must take reasonable steps to ensure that:

                     (a)  the person is given an information statement at or before that time; and

                     (b)  the person either has, or has ready access to, the agreement in writing during the period:

                              (i)  beginning at that time; and

                             (ii)  ending when the agreement is approved under section 98C.

             (4)  The information statement mentioned in subsection (2) and paragraph (3)(a) must contain:

                     (d)  any other information that the Employment Advocate requires by notice published in the _Gazette_.

             (5)  If a waiver has been made under section 98A in relation to the workplace agreement, subsection (1) and paragraph (3)(b) do not apply in relation to a time after the waiver takes effect.

             (6)  For the purposes of this section, if the workplace agreement incorporates terms from an industrial instrument mentioned in subsection 101C(2), the eligible employees have ready access to the workplace agreement only if they have ready access to that instrument in writing.

             (7)  To avoid doubt, if the content of the workplace agreement is changed during the period mentioned in subsection (1), the change results in a separate workplace agreement for the purposes of this section.

Note:          If the content of an agreement for which the employer intends to seek approval is changed, the procedural steps set out in subsections (1), (2) and (3) must be repeated for the resulting separate agreement.

             (4)  A declaration is given to the Employment Advocate for the purposes of subsection (2) only if the declaration is actually received by the Employment Advocate.

Note:          This means that section 29 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ (to the extent that it deals with the time of service of documents) and section 160 of the _Evidence Act 1995_ do not apply to lodgment of a declaration.

             (5)  The Employment Advocate is not required to consider or determine whether any of the requirements of this Part have been met in relation to the making or content of anything annexed to a declaration lodged in accordance with subsection (2).

### Division 6—Operation of workplace agreements and persons bound

##### <a id="100"></a>100  When a workplace agreement is in operation

             (1)  A workplace agreement comes into operation on the day the agreement is lodged.

             (2)  A workplace agreement comes into operation even if the requirements in Divisions 3 and 4 and section 99 have not been met in relation to the agreement.

             (3)  A multiple-business agreement comes into operation only if it has been authorised under section 96F.

             (4)  A workplace agreement ceases to be in operation if:

                     (a)  it is terminated in accordance with Division 9; or

                     (b)  in the case of an AWA—it is replaced by another AWA; or

                     (c)  the Court declares it to be void under paragraph 105F(a).

             (5)  A collective agreement ceases to be in operation in relation to an employee if it has:

                     (a)  passed its nominal expiry date; and

                     (b)  been replaced by another collective agreement in relation to that employee.

Note:          Part VIAA sets out the circumstances in which a workplace agreement binding an employer because of transmission of business will cease to operate.

             (6)  A multiple-business agreement ceases to operate in relation to a single business (or a part of a single business) if:

                     (a)  the multiple-business agreement came into operation on a particular day; and

                     (b)  a collective agreement (other than a multiple-business agreement) was lodged on a later day; and

                     (c)  the multiple-business agreement and the collective agreement apply in relation to the same single business (or the same part of the single business).

 Example:   Employers A, B and C lodge a multiple-business agreement which has a nominal expiry date 5 years after it is lodged. Six months later employer B lodges a collective agreement that applies in relation to its single business. This means that the multiple-business agreement ceases to operate in relation to that single business.

             (7)  If a workplace agreement has ceased operating under subsection (4), it can never operate again.

             (8)  If a workplace agreement has ceased operating in relation to an employee because of subsection (5), the agreement can never operate again in relation to that employee.

             (9)  If a multiple-business agreement has ceased operating in relation to a single business (or a part of a single business), the agreement can never operate again in relation to that single business (or part of a business).

           (10)  If:

                     (a)  a person or entity is the employer bound by a workplace agreement; and

                     (b)  the person or entity ceases to be an employer within the meaning of subsection 4AB(1);

the agreement ceases to be in operation.

           (11)  Despite subsection (10), if the agreement mentioned in that subsection is a multiple-business agreement, it ceases to be in operation only in relation to a single business or part of a single business carried on by the person or entity.

##### <a id="100A"></a>100A  Relationship between overlapping workplace agreements

             (1)  Only one workplace agreement can have effect at a particular time in relation to a particular employee.

             (2)  A collective agreement has no effect in relation to an employee while an AWA operates in relation to the employee.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  a collective agreement (the **_first agreement_**) binding an employee is in operation; and

                     (b)  another collective agreement (the **_later agreement_**) binding the employee is lodged before the nominal expiry date of the first agreement;

the later agreement has no effect in relation to the employee until the nominal expiry date of the first agreement.

Note:          After that date, the first agreement ceases operating in relation to the employee (see subsection 100(5)), and the later agreement takes effect in relation to the employee.

##### <a id="100B"></a>100B  Effect of awards while workplace agreement is in operation

                   An award has no effect in relation to an employee while a workplace agreement operates in relation to the employee.

##### <a id="100C"></a>100C  Workplace agreement displaces certain Commonwealth laws

             (1)  To the extent of any inconsistency, a workplace agreement displaces prescribed conditions of employment specified in a Commonwealth law that is prescribed by the regulations.

             (2)  In this section:

                    <a name="commonwealth-law"></a>**_Commonwealth law_** means an Act or any regulations or other instrument made under an Act.

                    <a name="prescrib-condition"></a>**_prescribed conditions_** means conditions that are identified by the regulations.

##### <a id="100D"></a>100D  Persons bound by workplace agreements

                   A workplace agreement that is in operation binds:

                     (a)  the employer in relation to the agreement; and

                     (b)  all persons whose employment is, at any time when the agreement is in operation, subject to the agreement; and

                     (c)  if the agreement is a union collective agreement or a union greenfields agreement—the organisation or organisations of employees with which the employer made the agreement.

Note:          A person can be bound by a workplace agreement because of Part VIAA (which deals with transmission of business).

                     (c)  have that effect subject to any terms of the workplace agreement that expressly exclude or modify all or part of them.

          (2A)  Despite paragraph (2)(c), those protected award conditions have effect in relation to the employment of that person to the extent that those protected award conditions are about outworker conditions, despite any terms of the workplace agreement that provide, in a particular respect, a less favourable outcome for that person.

             (3)  In this section:

                    <a name="outwork"></a>**_outworker_** means an employee who, for the purposes of the business of the employer, performs work at private residential premises or at other premises that are not business or commercial premises of the employer.

##### <a id="106A"></a>106A  Meaning of _industrial action_

             (1)  For the purposes of this Act, **_industrial action_** means any action of the following kinds:

                     (a)  the performance of work by an employee in a manner different from that in which it is customarily performed, or the adoption of a practice in relation to work by an employee, the result of which is a restriction or limitation on, or a delay in, the performance of the work;

                     (b)  a ban, limitation or restriction on the performance of work by an employee or on the acceptance of or offering for work by an employee;

                     (c)  a failure or refusal by employees to attend for work or a failure or refusal to perform any work at all by employees who attend for work;

                     (d)  the lockout of employees from their employment by the employer of the employees;

but does not include the following:

                     (e)  action by employees that is authorised or agreed to by the employer of the employees;

                      (f)  action by an employer that is authorised or agreed to by or on behalf of employees of the employer;

                     (g)  action by an employee if:

                              (i)  the action was based on a reasonable concern by the employee about an imminent risk to his or her health or safety; and

                             (ii)  the employee did not unreasonably fail to comply with a direction of his or her employer to perform other available work, whether at the same or another workplace, that was safe and appropriate for the employee to perform.

Note 1:       See also subsection (4), which deals with the burden of proof of the exception in subparagraph (g)(i) of this definition.

Note 2:       The issue of whether action that is not industrial in character is industrial action was considered by the Commission in _Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union v The Age Company Limited_, PR946290\. In that case, the Full Bench of the Commission drew a distinction between an employee who does not attend for work in support of a collective demand that the employer agree to alteration of the conditions of employment as being clearly engaged in industrial action and an employee who does not attend for work on account of illness.

             (2)  For the purposes of this Act:

                     (a)  conduct is capable of constituting industrial action even if the conduct relates to part only of the duties that employees are required to perform in the course of their employment; and

                     (b)  a reference to industrial action includes a reference to a course of conduct consisting of a series of industrial actions.

Meaning of **lockout**

             (3)  For the purposes of this section, an employer **_locks out_** employees from their employment if the employer prevents the employees from performing work under their contracts of employment without terminating those contracts (except to the extent that this would be an expansion of the ordinary meaning of that expression).

Burden of proof

             (4)  Whenever a person seeks to rely on subparagraph (g)(i) of the definition of **_industrial action_** in subsection (1), that person has the burden of proving that subparagraph (g)(i) applies.

##### <a id="106B"></a>106B  Meaning of _pattern bargaining_

What is pattern bargaining?

             (1)  For the purposes of this Part, a course of conduct by a person is **_pattern bargaining_** if:

                     (a)  the person is a negotiating party to 2 or more proposed collective agreements; and

                     (b)  the course of conduct involves seeking common wages or conditions of employment for 2 or more of those proposed collective agreements; and

                     (c)  the course of conduct extends beyond a single business.

Exception: terms or conditions determined as national standards

             (2)  The course of conduct is not pattern bargaining to the extent that the negotiating party is seeking, for 2 or more of the proposed collective agreements, terms or conditions of employment determined by the Full Bench in a decision establishing national standards.

Exception: genuinely trying to reach an agreement for a single business or part of a single business

             (3)  The course of conduct, to the extent that it relates to a particular single business or part of a single business, is not pattern bargaining if the negotiating party is genuinely trying to reach an agreement for the business or part.

             (4)  For the purposes of subsection (3), factors relevant to working out whether the negotiating party is genuinely trying to reach an agreement for a single business or part of a single business include (but are not limited to) the following:

                     (a)  demonstrating a preparedness to negotiate an agreement which takes into account the individual circumstances of the business or part;

                     (b)  demonstrating a preparedness to negotiate a workplace agreement with a nominal expiry date which takes into account the individual circumstances of the business or part;

                     (c)  negotiating in a manner consistent with wages and conditions of employment being determined as far as possible by agreement between the employer and its employees at the level of the single business or part;

                     (d)  agreeing to meet face-to-face at reasonable times proposed by another negotiating party;

                     (e)  considering and responding to proposals made by another negotiating party within a reasonable time;

                      (f)  not capriciously adding or withdrawing items for bargaining.

             (5)  Whenever a person seeks to rely on subsection (3), the person has the burden of proving that subsection (3) applies.

             (6)  This section does not affect, and is not affected by, the meaning of the term “genuinely trying to reach an agreement”, or any variant of the term, as used elsewhere in this Act.

                     (b)  contravenes an order of the Commission that relates, to a significant extent, to a demarcation dispute.

Orders on application or Commission’s initiative

             (9)  The Commission:

                     (a)  may not make an order under subsection (1), in a circumstance set out in subsection (2), (7) or (8), except on application by a negotiating party; but

##### <a id="107J"></a>107J  Suspension of bargaining periods—significant harm to third party

Suspension if industrial action threatens significant harm to a person

             (1)  The Commission must, by order, suspend a bargaining period for a period specified in the order if:

                     (d)  any other matters that the Commission considers relevant.

Period of suspension

             (3)  The period of suspension specified in the order must be a period that the Commission considers appropriate. The period of suspension (as extended under subsection (4), if applicable) must not exceed 3 months.

Extension of suspension

             (4)  The Commission must, by order, extend the period of suspension by a specified period that the Commission considers appropriate if:

##### <a id="107K"></a>107K  Industrial action without further protected action ballot after end of suspension of bargaining period

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  before a bargaining period was suspended under subsection 107G(1), 107H(1), 107I(1) or 107J(1), industrial action was authorised by a protected action ballot; and

                     (b)  the ballot authorised industrial action:

                              (i)  some or all of which had not been taken before the period of suspension began; or

                             (ii)  that had not ended before the period of suspension began; or

                            (iii)  beyond the period of suspension.

             (2)  After the period of suspension, as extended under subsection 107I(3) or 107J(4) (if applicable), has ceased (whether because the period ended or was revoked):

                     (a)  a relevant employee (within the meaning of Division 4) may organise, or engage in, that industrial action without another protected action ballot; and

                     (b)  a negotiating party that is an organisation of employees may organise, or engage in, that industrial action without another protected action ballot.

For the purposes of working out when that industrial action may be organised, or engaged in, the period of suspension (including any dates authorised by a protected action ballot as dates on which action is to be taken) is to be ignored.

             (3)  However, that industrial action is not protected action unless, after the period of suspension, the organisation, or the employee, gives the employer at least the required written notice of the intention to take the action. The notice must state the nature of the intended action and the day when it will begin.

             (4)  For the purposes of subsection (3), the **_required written notice_** is:

                     (a)  3 working days’ written notice; or

                     (b)  if the Commission, in the order under subsection 107G(1), 107H(1), 107I(1) or 107J(1) suspending the bargaining period, or an order under subsection 107I(3) or 107J(4) extending the period of suspension, specifies a higher number of days—that number of days’ written notice.

Note:          For the maximum number of days the suspension order can specify, see subsection 107G(14), 107H(8), 107I(7) or 107J(8).

             (5)  Nothing in this section authorises industrial action after the end of the period of suspension that is different in type or duration from the industrial action that was authorised by the protected action ballot.

Example 1: A protected action ballot authorised strike action for 20 consecutive working days from a specified date. Fourteen working days into the strike, the bargaining period was suspended for one month.

                   Under this section, once the period of suspension ends, the initiating party could give the required written notice, without another protected action ballot, of 6 further consecutive working days of strike action (the balance of the strike action authorised).

Example 2: A protected action ballot authorised the imposition of certain work bans every Monday, for a period of 8 consecutive weeks starting from a specified date. After 3 weeks, the bargaining period was suspended for a period of 2 weeks.

                   Under this section, once the period of suspension ends, the initiating party could give the required written notice, without another protected action ballot, that the work bans authorised by the ballot will be imposed for 5 further consecutive Mondays (the balance of the industrial action authorised).

### Division 3—Protected action

#### Subdivision A—What is protected action?

##### <a id="108"></a>108  Protected action

General

             (1)  Action by a person is **_protected action_** if:

                     (a)  the action is protected action under subsection (2) or (3); and

                     (b)  no provision of Subdivision B excludes the action from being protected action; and

                     (c)  subsection 107K(3) does not exclude the action from being protected action.

Employee and employee organisation actions

             (2)  During a bargaining period:

                     (a)  an organisation of employees that is a negotiating party; or

                     (b)  a member of such an organisation who is employed by the employer; or

                     (c)  an officer or employee of such an organisation acting in that capacity; or

                     (d)  an employee who is a negotiating party;

is entitled, for the purpose of:

                     (e)  supporting or advancing claims made in respect of the proposed collective agreement; or

                      (f)  responding to industrial action by the employer against  employees whose employment will be subject to the proposed collective agreement;

to organise or engage in industrial action against the employer and, if the organisation, member, officer or employee does so, the organising of, or engaging in, that industrial action is protected action.

Employer actions

             (3)  Subject to subsection (5), during a bargaining period, the employer is entitled, for the purpose of:

                     (a)  supporting or advancing claims made by the employer in respect of the proposed collective agreement; or

                     (b)  responding to industrial action by any of the employees whose employment will be subject to the proposed collective agreement;

to engage in industrial action against all or any of the employees whose employment will be subject to the agreement and, if the employer does so, the organising of, or engaging in, that industrial action is protected action.

Note 1:       The existence of this entitlement does not affect any right of the employer to refuse to pay the employee where, under the common law, the employer is permitted to do so because the employee has not performed work as directed.

Note 2:       The existence of this entitlement also does not affect any authorisation of the employer to stand-down the employee under an award.

             (4)  If the employer engages in industrial action against employees in accordance with subsection (3), the employer is entitled to refuse to pay any remuneration to the employees in respect of the period of the industrial action.

             (5)  The employer is not entitled to engage in industrial action against employees under subsection (3) (and so the industrial action will not be protected action) unless the continuity of the employees’ employment, for such purposes as are prescribed by the regulations, is not affected by the industrial action.

#### Subdivision B—Exclusions from protected action

##### <a id="108A"></a>108A  Exclusion—claims in support of inclusion of prohibited content

                     (b)  it is intended to be engaged in other than solely by one or more protected persons for the industrial action.

             (3)  In this section:

                     (a)  an organisation of employees that is a negotiating party to the proposed collective agreement; or

                     (d)  an employee who is a negotiating party to the proposed collective agreement; or

                   Industrial action engaged in by an employer against employees is not protected action unless the employer has, before the employer begins to engage in the industrial action:

                     (a)  if the employees are members of an organisation or organisations that are negotiating parties—genuinely tried to reach agreement with the organisation or organisations; and

                     (b)  if the employees are negotiating parties—genuinely tried to reach agreement with the employees; and

                     (c)  complied with all orders or directions made or given by the Commission during the bargaining period that relate to, or that relate to industrial action relating to, the making of the proposed collective agreement or to a matter that has arisen in the negotiations for the proposed collective agreement, so far as the orders or directions apply to the employer.

##### <a id="108J"></a>108J  Exclusion—employee and employee organisation action to be authorised by secret ballot or be in response to employer action

                   Any action taken as mentioned in subsection 108(2) by:

                     (a)  an organisation of employees; or

                     (b)  a member of such an organisation; or

                     (c)  an officer or employee of such an organisation acting in that capacity; or

                     (d)  an employee who is a negotiating party;

is not protected action unless:

                     (e)  the action is in response to industrial action by the employer against employees whose employment will be subject to the proposed collective agreement; or

                      (f)  the action has been authorised by a protected action ballot (see section 109ZC).

Note:          The question whether industrial action is authorised by a protected action ballot is also affected by section 107K.

##### <a id="108K"></a>108K  Exclusion—employee organisation action must be duly authorised

             (1)  Engaging in industrial action by members of an organisation of employees that is a negotiating party is not protected action unless, before the industrial action begins:

                     (a)  the industrial action is duly authorised by a committee of management of the organisation or by someone authorised by such a committee to authorise the industrial action; and

                     (b)  if the rules of the organisation provide for the way in which the industrial action is to be authorised—the industrial action is duly authorised under those rules; and

                     (c)  written notice of the giving of the authorisation is given to a Registrar.

             (2)  Industrial action is taken, for the purposes of this section, to be duly authorised under the rules of an organisation of employees even though a technical breach has occurred in authorising the industrial action, so long as the person or persons who committed the breach acted in good faith.

             (3)  Examples of a technical breach in authorising industrial action are as follows:

                     (a)  a contravention of the rules of the organisation;

                     (b)  an error or omission in complying with the requirements of this Act;

                     (c)  participation, by a person not eligible to do so, in the making of a decision by a committee of management, or by members, of the organisation.

             (4)  Industrial action is taken, for the purposes of this section, to have been duly authorised under the rules of an organisation of employees, and to have been so authorised before the industrial action began, unless:

                     (a)  the Court declares in a proceeding that the industrial action was not duly authorised under those rules; and

                     (b)  the proceeding was brought in the Court within 6 months after the notification in relation to the industrial action was given to a Registrar under paragraph (1)(c).

             (5)  In so far as the rules of an organisation of employees provide for the way in which industrial action that section 108 entitles the organisation to organise or engage in is to be authorised, the rules do not contravene section 159 of the Registration and Accountability of Organisations Schedule unless the manner provided for contravenes that section.

#### Subdivision C—Significance of action being protected action

##### <a id="108L"></a>108L  Immunity provisions

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), no action lies under any law (whether written or unwritten) in force in a State or Territory in respect of any industrial action that is protected action unless the industrial action has involved or is likely to involve:

                     (a)  personal injury; or

                     (b)  wilful or reckless destruction of, or damage to, property; or

                     (c)  the unlawful taking, keeping or use of property.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not prevent an action for defamation being brought in respect of anything that occurred in the course of industrial action.

Note:          Subsection 111(13) provides that an order under subsection 111(1) or (6) directing that industrial action stop or not occur does not apply to protected action.

##### <a id="108M"></a>108M  Employer not to dismiss employee etc. for engaging in protected action

             (1)  An employer must not:

                     (a)  dismiss an employee, injure an employee in his or her employment or alter the position of an employee to the employee’s prejudice; or

                     (b)  threaten to dismiss an employee, injure an employee in his or her employment or alter the position of an employee to the employee’s prejudice;

wholly or partly because the employee is proposing to engage, is engaging, or has engaged, in protected action.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply to any of the following actions taken by the employer:

                     (a)  standing-down the employee;

                     (b)  refusing to pay the employee, if:

                              (i)  the refusal is in accordance with section 114; or

                             (ii)  under the common law, the employer is permitted to do so because the employee has not performed work as directed;

                     (c)  action that is itself protected action.

Civil remedy provisions

             (3)  Subsection (1) is a civil remedy provision.

             (4)  The Court may make one or more of the following orders in relation to a person who has contravened subsection (1):

                     (a)  an order imposing a pecuniary penalty on the person;

                     (b)  injunctions, and any other orders, that the Court considers necessary to stop the contravention or remedy its effects.

             (5)  The pecuniary penalty under paragraph (4)(a) cannot be more than 300 penalty units for a body corporate or 60 penalty units in any other case.

             (6)  Other orders the Court may make under paragraph (4)(b) include (but are not limited to):

                     (a)  if the contravention was constituted by dismissing an employee—an order to reinstate the person dismissed to the position that the person occupied immediately before the dismissal or to a position no less favourable than that position; and

                     (b)  in any case—to pay, to the person dismissed, injured or prejudiced, compensation for loss suffered as a result of the dismissal, injury or prejudice.

             (7)  An application for an order under subsection (4) may be made by:

                     (a)  the employee concerned; or

                     (b)  an organisation of employees of which that employee is a member; or

                     (c)  a workplace inspector; or

                     (d)  any other person prescribed by the regulations.

             (8)  In proceedings for an order under subsection (4), it is to be presumed, unless the employer proves otherwise, that the alleged conduct of the employer was carried out wholly or partly because the employee was proposing to engage, was engaging, or had engaged, in protected action.

Note:          For other provisions about civil remedy provisions, see Division 4 of Part VIII.

### Division 4—Secret ballots on proposed protected action

#### Subdivision A—General

##### <a id="109"></a>109  Object of Division and overview of Division

Object

             (1)  The object of this Division is to establish a transparent process which allows employees directly concerned to choose, by means of a fair and democratic secret ballot, whether to authorise industrial action supporting or advancing claims by organisations of employees, or by employees.

Overview of Division

             (2)  Under Division 3, industrial action by employees is not protected action unless it has been authorised in advance by a secret ballot held under this Division (a **_protected action ballot_**). This Division establishes the steps that organisations of employees, or employees, who wish to organise or engage in protected action must take in order to:

                     (a)  obtain an order from the Commission that will authorise a protected action ballot to be held; and

                     (b)  hold a protected action ballot that may authorise the industrial action.

             (3)  The rule that industrial action by employees is not protected action unless it has been authorised by a protected action ballot does not apply to action in response to an employer engaging in industrial action against the employees (see section 108J).

When application can be made

             (1)  A person referred to in subsection (3) may, during a bargaining period, apply to the Commission for an order for a ballot to be held to determine whether proposed industrial action has the support of relevant employees.

Note:          For the duration of a bargaining period, see sections 107D (when it begins) and 107E (when it ends).

             (2)  However, if there are one or more existing collective agreements binding on relevant employees, the application must not be made before:

Who can apply

             (3)  The following people may apply:

Note:          For joint applications, see section 109F.

Employee applications need support of prescribed number of employees

             (4)  An employee, or a group of such employees acting jointly, cannot make an application unless the application has the support of at least the prescribed number of relevant employees.

Note:          **_Prescribed number_** is defined in section 109A.

Employee applicants can appoint agent

             (5)  A person or persons referred to in paragraph (3)(b) who wish to make an application under this section without disclosing their identities to their employer may appoint an agent to represent them for all purposes connected with the application.

             (1)  The application must include the following:

                     (a)  the question or questions to be put to the relevant employees in the ballot, including the nature of the proposed industrial action;

                     (b)  details of the types of employees who are to be balloted;

                     (c)  any details required by Rules of the Commission (see subsection (3)).

             (2)  The application may include the name of a person nominated by the applicant to conduct the ballot.

Note:          The question of who conducts the ballot is ultimately decided by the Commission—see paragraph 109N(1)(e) and section 109ZE.

             (3)  Without limiting the generality of section 48, Rules of the Commission made under that section may deal with:

                     (a)  the matters to be included in an application for a ballot order; and

                     (b)  the form in which the application is to be made.

##### <a id="109D"></a>109D  Material to accompany application

             (1)  The application must be accompanied by:

                     (a)  a copy of the notice given under subsection 107(3) to initiate the relevant bargaining period; and

                     (c)  a declaration by the applicant under subsection (4) of this section.

             (2)  If the applicant is an organisation of employees, the application must be accompanied by a written notice showing that the application has been duly authorised by a committee of management of the organisation or by someone authorised by such a committee to authorise the application.

             (3)  If the applicant is an employee, or a group of employees, represented by an applicant’s agent, the application must be accompanied by a document containing the name of the employee, or each of those employees.

             (4)  The applicant’s declaration must state that the industrial action to which the application relates is not for the purpose of supporting or advancing claims to include in the proposed collective agreement any prohibited content.

             (5)  The declaration must be in the form prescribed by the regulations.

             (6)  A person commits an offence if:

                     (a)  the person makes, or joins in making, a declaration under subsection (4); and

                     (b)  the declaration contains a statement that is false or misleading in a material particular.

             (3)  If employees have made a joint application, the name of another employee who is a negotiating party may, before the application is determined, be joined to the application if the other applicants consent.

             (4)  Without limiting the generality of section 48, Rules of the Commission made under that section may deal with:

                     (a)  in the case of a provision of this Act permitting an applicant for a ballot order to do any thing—how the provision is to apply to joint applicants; and

                     (b)  in the case of a provision of this Act requiring an applicant for a ballot order to be given notice, or otherwise informed, of any thing—how the requirement is to be fulfilled in relation to joint applicants.

#### Subdivision C—Determination of application and order for ballot to be held

##### <a id="109G"></a>109G  Commission may notify parties etc. of procedure

                   If:

                     (a)  an application for a ballot order is lodged with the Commission; and

                     (b)  the Commission considers that notifying the parties, or a person who may become the authorised ballot agent, of the procedure to be followed by the Commission in dealing with that application will not delay, and may expedite, the determination of the application;

the Commission may notify the parties or person concerned accordingly.

##### <a id="109H"></a>109H  Commission to act quickly in relation to application etc.

             (1)  In exercising its powers under this Division, the Commission:

                     (a)  must act as quickly as is practicable; and

                     (b)  must, as far as is reasonably possible, determine all applications made under this Division within 2 working days after the application is made.

Note:          In exercising its powers, the Commission is also required to act according to equity, good conscience and the substantial merits of the case, without regard to technicalities and legal forms (see paragraph 44H(1)(c)). It is not bound by the rules of evidence, and may inform itself in any manner it considers just (see paragraph 44H(1)(b)).

             (2)  However, the Commission must not determine an application for a ballot order until it is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the applicant has complied with section 109E; and

                     (b)  the persons referred to in subsections 109I(1) and (2) have had a reasonable opportunity to make submissions in relation to the application.

##### <a id="109I"></a>109I  Parties and relevant employees may make submissions and apply for directions

             (1)  A party or a relevant employee may make submissions, and may apply for directions, relating to:

                     (a)  an application for a ballot order; or

                     (b)  any aspect of the conduct of a protected action ballot.

             (2)  A person nominated in an application to conduct a ballot may make submissions, and apply for directions, relating to the application.

             (3)  An authorised ballot agent may make submissions, and apply for directions, relating to any aspect of a protected action ballot.

             (4)  The Commission may decline to consider a person’s submission if the Commission is satisfied that the submission is vexatious, frivolous, misconceived or lacking in substance.

##### <a id="109J"></a>109J  Commission may make orders or give directions

             (1)  The Commission may make orders, or give directions, in connection with:

                     (a)  an application for a ballot order; or

                     (b)  any aspect of the conduct of a protected action ballot.

             (2)  Without limiting subsection (1), the Commission may make orders, or give directions, aimed at ensuring that a protected action ballot is conducted expeditiously.

             (3)  In deciding whether to make an order, or give a direction, under this section, and in deciding the content of any such order or direction, the Commission must have regard to the desirability of the ballot results being available to the parties within 10 days after the ballot order is made.

##### <a id="109K"></a>109K  Commission procedure regarding multiple applications

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  more than one application for a ballot order is before the Commission for determination; and

                     (b)  the applications relate to industrial action by employees of the same employer or by employees at the same place of work; and

                     (c)  the Commission considers that determining the applications at the same time will not unreasonably delay the determination of any of the applications;

the Commission may determine the applications at the same time.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  the Commission has made an order requiring a ballot to be held in relation to industrial action by employees of an employer, or by employees at a place of work; and

                     (b)  the Commission proposes to make another order requiring a ballot to be held in relation to industrial action against that employer, or at the same place of work; and

                     (c)  the Commission considers that the level of disruption of the employer’s business, or at the place of work (as the case requires), could be reduced if the ballots were held at the same time; and

                     (d)  the Commission considers that requiring the ballots to be held at the same time will not unreasonably delay the conduct of either ballot;

the Commission may make, or vary, the relevant orders so as to require the ballots to be held at the same time.

##### <a id="109L"></a>109L  Application not to be granted unless certain conditions are met

Commission must be satisfied of various matters

             (1)  The Commission must grant an application for a ballot order if, and must not grant the application unless, it is satisfied that:

                     (a)  during the bargaining period, the applicant genuinely tried to reach agreement with the employer of the relevant employees; and

                     (b)  the applicant is genuinely trying to reach agreement with the employer; and

                     (c)  the applicant is not engaged in pattern bargaining.

Note 1:       An application for a ballot order must comply with the requirements set out in Subdivision B.

Note 2:       To work out when a bargaining period began, see section 107D.

Note 3:       For other provisions relating to pattern bargaining, see:

(a)           section 107H; and

(b)           section 108D; and

(c)           section 111A.

When Commission has discretion to refuse application

             (2)  Despite subsection (1), the Commission may refuse the application if it is satisfied:

                     (a)  that granting the application would be inconsistent with the object of this Division (see section 109); or

                     (b)  that the applicant, or a relevant employee, has at any time contravened a provision of this Division or an order made, or direction given, under this Division.

##### <a id="109M"></a>109M  Grant of application—order for ballot to be held

                   If the Commission grants the application, the Commission must order the applicant to hold a protected action ballot.

##### <a id="109N"></a>109N  Matters to be included in order

             (1)  An order for a protected action ballot to be held must specify the following:

                     (a)  the name of:

                              (i)  if the applicant is an organisation of employees—the organisation; or

                             (ii)  if the applicant is an employee, or a group of employees, represented by an applicant’s agent—the applicant’s agent; or

                            (iii)  if the applicant is an employee, or a group of employees, not represented by an applicant’s agent—the employee or employees;

                     (b)  the types of employees who are to be balloted;

                     (c)  the voting method;

                     (d)  the timetable for the ballot, including:

                              (i)  the day on which the roll of voters is to close, which must be a day at least 2 working days before the day on which the ballot is to be held, or is to start to be held; and

                             (ii)  the day on which the ballot is to close, and the time (the **_voting closing time_**) on that day by which votes must be received (if the order specifies a postal ballot) or by which votes must be cast (if the order specifies an attendance ballot);

                     (e)  the name of the person authorised by the Commission to conduct the ballot;

                      (f)  the name of the person (if any) authorised by the Commission to be the independent adviser for the ballot;

                     (g)  the question or questions to be put to the relevant employees in the ballot, including the nature of the proposed industrial action.

Note 1:       Section 109ZE specifies who may be authorised by the Commission to conduct protected action ballots.

Note 2:       Section 109ZF specifies who may be authorised by the Commission to be the independent adviser for a protected action ballot.

             (2)  The order must specify a postal ballot as the voting method unless:

                     (a)  the order specifies another voting method; and

                     (b)  the Commission is satisfied that the other voting method is more efficient and expeditious than a postal ballot.

             (3)  If the order specifies a postal ballot as the voting method, it must specify that the voting must take place by way of declaration voting. For this purpose, a person votes by way of **_declaration voting_** if the person:

                     (a)  marks his or her vote on a ballot paper; and

                     (b)  places the ballot paper in a declaration envelope; and

                     (c)  seals that envelope and signs his or her name in the space provided on the back flap of that envelope; and

                     (d)  places that envelope in an outer envelope that is addressed to the authorised ballot agent; and

                     (e)  posts the outer envelope so that it reaches the authorised ballot agent before the voting closing time on the day on which the ballot is to close.

             (4)  If the order specifies an attendance ballot as the voting method, then:

That industrial action would prevent the employer making a payment to the employee in relation to 4 hours of the shift, but would not prevent the employer from making a payment in relation to the remaining 5 hours of the shift.

             (4)  For the purposes of subsection (3), overtime is taken not to be a separate shift.

             (5)  An employee must not accept a payment from an employer if the employer would contravene subsection (2) by making the payment.

Note:          This subsection is a civil remedy provision: see subsection (6).

                     (d)  a member of the organisation, who performs the function of dealing with an employer on behalf of the member and other members of the organisation, acting in that capacity.

             (3)  Paragraphs (2)(c) and (d) do not apply if:

                     (a)  a committee of management of the organisation; or

                     (b)  a person authorised by the committee; or

                     (c)  an officer of the organisation;

                     (d)  any other person prescribed by the regulations.

Note:          For other provisions about civil remedy provisions, see Division 4 of Part VIII.

             (9)  A regulation prescribing persons for the purposes of paragraph (8)(d) may limit its application to specified circumstances.

##### <a id="114B"></a>114B  Persons not to coerce people for payments in relation to periods of industrial action

## Part VI—Awards

### Division 1—Preliminary

##### <a id="115"></a>115  Objects of Part

                   The objects of this Part are:

                     (a)  to ensure that minimum safety net entitlements are protected through a system of enforceable awards maintained by the Commission; and

                     (b)  to ensure that awards are rationalised and simplified so they are less complex and are more conducive to the efficient performance of work; and

                     (c)  to ensure that the Commission performs its functions under this Part in a way that:

                              (i)  encourages the making of agreements between employers and employees at the workplace or enterprise level; and

                             (ii)  protects the competitive position of young people in the labour market, promotes youth employment, youth skills and community standards, and assists in reducing youth unemployment.

##### <a id="115A"></a>115A  Performance of functions by the Commission

             (1)  The Commission must perform its functions under this Part in a way that furthers the objects of this Act and, in particular, the objects of this Part.

             (2)  In performing its functions under this Part, the Commission must have regard to:

                     (a)  the desirability of high levels of productivity, low inflation, creation of jobs and high levels of employment; and

                     (b)  decisions of the AFPC, and, in particular, the need to ensure that Commission decisions are not inconsistent with AFPC decisions; and

                     (c)  the importance of providing minimum safety net entitlements that do not act as a disincentive to bargaining at the workplace level.

##### <a id="115C"></a>115C  Extraterritorial extension

             (1)  This Part, and the rest of this Act so far as it relates to this Part, extend:

                     (a)  to an employee outside Australia who meets any of the conditions in this section; and

                     (b)  to the employee’s employer (whether the employer is in or outside Australia); and

                     (c)  to acts, omissions, matters and things relating to the employee (whether they are in or outside Australia).

Note:          In this context, **_Australia_** includes the Territory of Christmas Island, the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands and the coastal sea. See section 15B and paragraph 17(a) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

In Australia’s exclusive economic zone

             (2)  One condition is that the employee is in Australia’s exclusive economic zone and either:

                     (a)  is an employee of an Australian employer and is not prescribed by the regulations as an employee to whom this subsection does not apply; or

                     (b)  is an employee prescribed by the regulations as an employee to whom this subsection applies.

Note:          The regulations may prescribe the employee by reference to a class. See subsection 13(3) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_.

On Australia’s continental shelf outside exclusive economic zone

             (3)  Another condition is that the employee:

                     (a)  is outside the outer limits of Australia’s exclusive economic zone, but is in, on or over a part of Australia’s continental shelf prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this subsection, in connection with the exploration of the continental shelf or the exploitation of its natural resources; and

                     (b)  meets the requirements that are prescribed by the regulations for that part.

Note:          The regulations may prescribe different requirements relating to different parts of Australia’s continental shelf. The regulations may need to do so to give effect to Australia’s international obligations.

Outside Australia’s exclusive economic zone and continental shelf

             (4)  Another condition is that the employee:

                     (a)  is neither in Australia’s exclusive economic zone nor in, on or over a part of Australia’s continental shelf described in paragraph (3)(a); and

                     (b)  is an Australian-based employee of an Australian employer; and

                     (c)  is not prescribed by the regulations as an employee to whom this subsection does not apply.

             (2)  Despite subsection (1), an award may include a term about ordinary time hours of work.

Note:          An award may also include preserved award terms (see section 116G).

##### <a id="116D"></a>116D  Awards may not include terms involving discrimination and preference

                   To the extent that a term of an award requires or permits, or has the effect of requiring or permitting, any conduct that would contravene Part XA, it is taken not to be about allowable award matters.

it is taken not to be about allowable award matters.

                     (b)  essential for the purpose of making a particular term operate in a practical way.

             (2)  For the purposes of this section, to the extent that a term of an award is about a matter that is not an allowable award matter because of the operation of section 116B, 116D, 116E or 116F, the term is not, and cannot be, incidental to an allowable award matter, and is of no effect to that extent.

          (2A)  However, to avoid doubt, paragraph 116B(1)(g) does not limit the operation of subsections (1) and (3) to the extent that those subsections relate to the matter referred to in paragraph 116(1)(m).

             (3)  An award (the **_rationalised award_**) made under section 118E or varied under section 118J may include a term that appoints, or gives power to appoint, a board of reference, but the term has effect only to the extent that:

                     (a)  the term was included in one or more of the following awards (the **_replaced award_**):

                              (i)  any award that the rationalised award has the effect of replacing;

             (4)  A term of an award that appoints, or gives power to appoint, a board of reference:

                     (a)  may confer upon the board of reference an administrative function in respect of allowing, approving, fixing or dealing with, in the manner and subject to the conditions specified in the award, a matter or thing that, under the award, may from time to time be required to be allowed, approved, fixed or dealt with; and

                     (b)  must not confer upon the board of reference a function of settling or determining disputes about any matter arising under the award.

             (5)  A function conferred under subsection (4) may relate only to allowable award matters or terms permitted by this Subdivision to be included in the award.

             (6)  A board of reference may consist of or include a Commissioner.

             (7)  Subject to this section, the regulations may make provision in relation to:

             (1)  Immediately after the reform commencement, a term of an award ceases to have effect to the extent that it is about matters that are not allowable award matters, except to the extent (if any) that the term is permitted by Subdivision B to be included in the award.

             (2)  This section does not affect the operation of preserved award terms.

#### Subdivision D—Regulations relating to part-time employees

##### <a id="116M"></a>116M  Award conditions for part-time employees

             (1)  The regulations may do either or both of the following in relation to an award:

                     (a)  provide for the award to have effect so that a part-time employee is entitled to conditions to which a full-time employee is entitled under the award;

                     (b)  provide for the award to have effect so that conditions to which a part-time employee is otherwise entitled under the award (including because of paragraph (a)) are adjusted (in accordance with the regulations or a method set out in the regulations) in proportion to the hours worked by the part-time employee.

             (2)  The award has effect accordingly.

### Division 3—Preserved award entitlements

##### <a id="117"></a>117  Preservation of certain award terms

             (1)  A **_preserved award term_** is a term, or more than one term, of an award that is about a matter referred to in subsection (2), and:

                     (a)  if the award is a pre-reform award that has not been varied under section 118J—was in effect immediately before the reform commencement; or

                     (b)  in any other case—is taken to be included in the award because of the operation of section 117A.

Note:          Section 116L, which provides for certain terms of awards to cease immediately after the reform commencement, does not affect the operation of preserved award terms—see subsection 116L(2).

             (2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), the matters are as follows:

                     (a)  annual leave;

                     (b)  personal/carer’s leave;

                     (c)  parental leave, including maternity and adoption leave;

                     (d)  long service leave;

                     (e)  notice of termination;

                      (f)  jury service;

                     (g)  superannuation.

             (3)  If a term of an award referred to in subsection (1) is about both matters referred to in subsection (2) and other matters, it is taken to be a preserved award term only to the extent that it is about the matters referred to in subsection (2).

          (3A)  If more than one term of an award is about a matter referred to in subsection (2), then those terms, taken together, constitute the preserved award term of that award about that matter.

             (4)  A preserved award term about the matter referred to in paragraph (2)(g) (superannuation) ceases to have effect at the end of 30 June 2008.

             (5)  A preserved award term continues to have effect for the purposes of this Act.

Note:          Preserved award terms may not be varied.

             (6)  In this section:

                    <a name="person-carer-leav"></a>**_personal/carer’s leave_** includes war service sick leave, infectious diseases sick leave and other like forms of sick leave.

             (7)  The regulations may provide that for the purposes of subsection (2):

                     (a)  the matter referred to in paragraph (2)(c) does not include one or both of the following:

                              (i)  special maternity leave (within the meaning of section 94C);

(ii)  the entitlement under section 94F to transfer to a safe job or to take paid leave; and

                     (b)**_personal/carer’s leave_** does not include one or both of the following:

                              (i)  compassionate leave (within the meaning of section 93Q);

                             (ii)  unpaid carer’s leave (within the meaning of section 93D).

Note:          The effect of excluding a form of leave or an entitlement in relation to a matter is that the entitlement in relation to that form of leave or matter under the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard will automatically apply.

             (8)  Regulations under subsection (7) may be expressed to apply generally or in respect of employees engaged in specified types of employment, such as full-time employment, part-time employment, casual employment, regular part-time employment or shift work.

##### <a id="117A"></a>117A  Preserved award terms of rationalised awards

             (1)  This section applies to an award (the **_rationalised award_**) if:

                     (a)  the award is made under section 118E or is varied under section 118J; and

                     (b)  immediately before the making or variation, a preserved award term was included in one or more of the following awards (the **_replaced award_**):

                              (i)  any award that the rationalised award has the effect of replacing;

                             (ii)  if the rationalised award is an award varied under section 118J—the award as in force immediately before the variation.

Note:          A replaced award may be either an award made under section 118E or a pre-reform award (which may subsequently have been varied).

             (2)  The preserved award term of the replaced award is taken to be included in the rationalised award.

             (3)  The preserved award term is taken to have the effect that:

                     (a)  employees belonging to the class of employees that had entitlements under the preserved award term of the replaced award have corresponding entitlements under the rationalised award; and

                     (b)  employees belonging to any class of employees that did not have entitlements under the preserved award term of the replaced award do not gain entitlements under the rationalised award.

Note:          This means that the class of employees who had preserved award entitlements under replaced awards retain those preserved award entitlements after award rationalisation, but the class of employees who have such entitlements is not expanded.

             (4)  The preserved award term is taken to have the effect that:

                     (a)  only an employer bound by the preserved award term of the replaced award is bound by the corresponding preserved award term of the rationalised award; and

                     (b)  other employers are not so bound.

Note 1:       This means that the class of employers bound by preserved award terms is not expanded as a result of award rationalisation.

Note 2:       The operation of this subsection is affected by Part VIAA, which deals with transmission of business.

             (5)  For the purposes of subsection (3), whether an employee belongs to a class of employees that had entitlements under a preserved award term of a replaced award is to be determined without reference to whether the employee was employed before or after the making of the rationalised award.

##### <a id="117B"></a>117B  When preserved award entitlements have effect

             (1)  This section applies to an employee if:

                     (a)  the employee’s employment is regulated by an award that includes a preserved award term about a matter; and

                     (b)  the employee has an entitlement (the **_preserved award entitlement_**) in relation to that matter under the preserved award term.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  the preserved award term is about a matter referred to in paragraph 117(2)(a), (b) or (c); and

                     (b)  the employee’s preserved award entitlement in relation to the matter is more generous than the employee’s entitlement in relation to the corresponding matter under the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard;

the employee’s entitlement under the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard is excluded, and the employee’s preserved award entitlement has effect in accordance with the preserved award term. Otherwise, the employee’s entitlement under the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard has effect.

Note:          See section 117C for the meaning of **_more generous._**

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  the preserved award term is about a matter referred to in paragraph 117(2)(a), (b) or (c) and the employee has no entitlement in relation to the corresponding matter under the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard; or

                     (b)  the preserved award term is about a matter referred to in paragraph 117(2)(d), (e), (f) or (g);

the employee’s preserved award entitlement has effect in accordance with the preserved award term.

Note 1:       Preserved award terms relating to matters referred to in paragraph 117(2)(g) cease to have effect at the end of 30 June 2008—see subsection 117(4).

Note 2:       Subsection 7C(2) provides that State laws dealing with long service leave, jury service or superannuation (among other things) are not excluded by this Act, but section 7D provides that awards prevail over State laws to the extent of any inconsistency.

##### <a id="117C"></a>117C  Meaning of _more generous_

             (1)  Whether an employee’s entitlement under a preserved award term in relation to a matter is **_more generous_** than the employee’s entitlement in relation to the corresponding matter under the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard:

                     (a)  is as specified in, or as worked out in accordance with a method specified in, regulations made under this paragraph; or

                     (b)  to the extent that regulations made under paragraph (a) do not so specify—is to be ascertained in accordance with the ordinary meaning of the term **_more generous_**.

             (2)  If a matter to which an entitlement under a preserved award term relates does not correspond directly to a matter to which the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard relates, regulations made under paragraph (1)(a) may nevertheless specify that the matters correspond for the purposes of this Division.

##### <a id="117D"></a>117D  Modifications that may be prescribed—personal/carer’s leave

(1)  The regulations may provide that a preserved award term about personal/carer’s leave is to be treated as a separate preserved award term about separate matters, to the extent that the preserved award term is about any of the following:

                     (a)  war service sick leave;

                     (b)  infectious diseases sick leave;

                     (c)  any other like form of sick leave.

             (2)  If the regulations so provide, sections 117, 117A, 117B and 117C have effect in relation to each separate matter.

Note:          There is no entitlement in relation to war service sick leave, infectious diseases sick leave or any other like form of sick leave under the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard, so there is no corresponding matter for the purposes of subsection 117B(3).

##### <a id="117E"></a>117E  Modifications that may be prescribed—parental leave

             (1)  The regulations may provide that a preserved award term about parental leave is to be treated as being about separate matters to the extent that it is about paid and unpaid parental leave.

             (2)  If the regulations provide that a preserved award term about parental leave is to be treated as being about separate matters to the extent that it is about paid and unpaid parental leave:

                     (a)  sections 117, 117A and 117B have effect in relation to each separate matter; and

                     (b)  in accordance with section 94D, the entitlement that an employee would have to unpaid parental leave under the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard is reduced by any amount of paid parental leave to which the employee is entitled under the preserved award term.

Note 1:    There is no entitlement in relation to paid parental leave under the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard, so there is no corresponding matter for the purposes of subsection 117B(3).

Note 2:    Paragraph (b) does not have the effect of reducing entitlements. It simply ensures that the operation of section 94D is not affected by treating paid and unpaid parental leave separately under the regulations.

##### <a id="117F"></a>117F  Preserved award terms—employers bound after reform commencement

                   An employer that was not bound by a particular award immediately before the reform commencement, but is subsequently bound by the award under section 120, is not bound by any preserved award terms included in the award.

### Division 4—Award rationalisation and award simplification

#### Subdivision A—Award rationalisation

##### <a id="118"></a>118  Commission’s award rationalisation function

             (1)  It is a function of the Commission to undertake award rationalisation.

             (2)  Award rationalisation is to be carried out in accordance with a written request (an **_award rationalisation request_**) made to the President by the Minister.

             (3)  Each award rationalisation request must specify:

                     (a)  the award rationalisation process that is to be undertaken under this section; and

                     (b)  the principles  to be applied by the Commission in undertaking the award rationalisation process; and

                     (c)  the time by which the award rationalisation process must be completed, which must not be later than 3 years after the making of the request.

             (4)  Principles under paragraph (3)(b) relating to an award rationalisation request may include, but are not limited to the following:

                     (a)  the awards to which the award rationalisation process relates;

                     (b)  the nature of, and the extent of the coverage of, awards that may be made as a result of the award rationalisation process;

                     (c)  subject to this Act, the matters that may be included in such awards and limits on the matters that may be included in such awards.

             (5)  An award rationalisation request may be varied or revoked by the Minister by written instrument.

             (6)  The following are not legislative instruments:

                     (a)  an award rationalisation request;

                     (b)  an instrument under subsection (5).

##### <a id="118A"></a>118A  Commission must deal with State-based differences

             (1)  In undertaking the first award rationalisation process requested under subsection 118(2), the Commission must ensure that:

                     (a)  terms and conditions of employment included in awards are not determined by reference to State or Territory boundaries; and

                     (b)  awards have effect in each State and Territory.

             (2)  If the award rationalisation request under which the first award rationalisation process is undertaken is not expressed to relate to all awards, the Commission must nevertheless review all awards as part of that award rationalisation process to the extent necessary to satisfy the requirements of subsection (1).

             (3)  In undertaking subsequent award rationalisation processes, the Commission must ensure that:

                     (a)  terms and conditions of employment included in awards made or varied as a result of the subsequent award rationalisation process are not determined by reference to State or Territory boundaries; and

                     (b)  an award made or varied as a result of the subsequent award rationalisation process has effect in each State and Territory.

             (4)  This section does not affect the operation of Division 3.

##### <a id="118B"></a>118B  Award rationalisation to be undertaken by Full Bench

                   As soon as practicable after receiving an award rationalisation request, the President must establish one or more Full Benches to undertake the award rationalisation process requested.

##### <a id="118C"></a>118C  Award rationalisation request to be published

             (1)  As soon as practicable after receiving an award rationalisation request, the President must give a copy of the request to a Registrar.

             (2)  The Registrar must publish the request as follows:

                     (a)  if requirements relating to publication are prescribed by the regulations—in accordance with those requirements;

                     (b)  if no such requirements are prescribed—in such manner as the Registrar thinks appropriate.

##### <a id="118D"></a>118D  Minister may intervene

                   The Minister may intervene in a proceeding that relates to an award rationalisation process.

##### <a id="118E"></a>118E  Making awards as a result of award rationalisation

                   A Full Bench may make one or more awards to give effect to the outcome of an award rationalisation process.

##### <a id="118F"></a>118F  Making awards as a result of award rationalisation

                   The Commission must not make an award other than under section 118E.

##### <a id="118G"></a>118G  Awards may not include certain terms

                   A Full Bench must not include a term in an award made under section 118E if the term may not be included in the award because of the operation of Division 2.

##### <a id="118H"></a>118H  Awards must include term about regular part-time employment

                   A Full Bench must include in an award made under section 118E a term providing for regular part-time employment.

Note:          Clauses 15.3.1 to 15.3.5 of the Hospitality Industry—Accommodation, Hotels, Resorts and Gaming Award 1998 provide a model (see the Award Simplification Decision at P7500).

##### <a id="118I"></a>118I  Who is bound by awards

             (1)  An award made under section 118E binds the employers, employees and organisations that it is expressed to bind.

Note:          An award may be expressed to bind additional employers, employees and organisations under Division 6 and may bind eligible entities under Division 6A.

             (2)  An award must be expressed to bind the following:

                     (a)  specified employers;

                     (b)  specified employees of employers bound by the award, in respect of work that is expressed to be regulated by the award.

             (3)  An award may be expressed to bind one or more specified organisations.

             (4)  For the purposes of subsections (2) and (3):

                     (a)  employers may be specified by name or by inclusion in a specified class or specified classes; and

                     (b)  employees must be specified by inclusion in a specified class or specified classes; and

                     (c)  organisations must be specified by name.

             (5)  Without limiting the way in which a class may be described for the purposes of subsection (4), the class may be described by reference to a particular industry or particular kinds of work.

             (6)  The power of the Commission under subsections (2) and (3) must be exercised in accordance with the terms of the award rationalisation request to which the making of the award relates.

##### <a id="118J"></a>118J  Variation of awards as part of award rationalisation

             (1)  The Commission may make an order varying an award to give effect to the outcome of an award rationalisation process.

             (2)  The Commission must not vary an award under this section in such a way that the award includes a term that may not be included in the award because of the operation of Division 2.

             (3)  If the Commission varies an award under this section, the Commission must include in the award a term providing for regular part-time employment, unless such a term is already included in the award.

Note:          Clauses 15.3.1 to 15.3.5 of the Hospitality Industry—Accommodation, Hotels, Resorts and Gaming Award 1998 provide a model (see the Award Simplification Decision at P7500).

             (4)  If the Commission varies an award under this section, it must specify the additional employers, employees and organisations (if any) bound by the award.

Note:          An award may also be varied to bind eligible entities and employers under Division 6A.

             (5)  For the purposes of subsection (4), employers, employees and organisations must be specified in the same manner, and subject to the same limitations, as provided in subsections 118I(2) to (6) in relation to awards made under section 118E.

##### <a id="118K"></a>118K  Revocation of awards as part of award rationalisation

                   The Commission may make an order revoking an award to give effect to the outcome of an award rationalisation process.

##### <a id="118L"></a>118L  Preserved award terms

                   To avoid doubt, the Commission’s power under this Division to make or vary an award is subject to, and must not be exercised in a manner that is inconsistent with, Division 3.

#### Subdivision B—Award simplification

##### <a id="118M"></a>118M  Review and simplification of awards

             (1)  The Commission must review all awards for the purpose of determining whether the awards include terms that may not be included in awards under this Part.

Note:          Division 2 deals with terms that may be included in awards.

             (2)  The Commission may review awards for this purpose at the same time as reviewing them for other purposes.

             (3)  The Commission must carry out the review:

                     (a)  within the period prescribed by the regulations; and

                     (b)  in accordance with any directions prescribed by the regulations.

             (4)  After reviewing an award, the Commission must make an order varying the award to the extent (if any) necessary to ensure that the award includes only terms that may be included under this Part.

             (5)  After reviewing an award, the Commission must make an order revoking the award if the Commission is satisfied that the award is obsolete or no longer capable of operating.

##### <a id="118N"></a>118N  Principles for award simplification

             (1)  A Full Bench may (subject to section 118M) establish principles for the review and simplification of awards under section 118M.

             (2)  Principles under subsection (1) may relate to the following:

                     (a)  the making or varying of awards in relation to each of the allowable award matters;

                     (b)  terms that may be included in awards (including, subject to Division 2, about allowable award matters).

             (3)  After principles (if any) have been established under subsection (1), the power of the Commission to vary an award is exercisable only in a manner consistent with those principles.

             (4)  The President or a Full Bench may, in relation to the exercise of powers under this section, direct a member of the Commission to provide a report in relation to a specified matter.

             (5)  After making such investigation (if any) as is necessary, a member given a direction under subsection (4) must provide a report to the President or Full Bench.

             (6)  To avoid doubt, principles under subsection (1) must be consistent with, and cannot be such as to override, a provision of this Act that relates to the variation of awards.

##### <a id="118O"></a>118O  Minister may intervene

                   The Minister may intervene in a proceeding that relates to an award simplification process.

#### Subdivision C—Special technical requirements

##### <a id="118P"></a>118P  Inclusion of preserved award terms in written awards

             (1)  This section applies if a preserved award term is taken under Division 3 to be included in an award (a **_rationalised award_**) made under section 118E or varied under section 118J.

             (2)  In reducing the rationalised award to writing as required by section 121, the Commission must:

                     (a)  include the preserved award term in the rationalised award; and

                     (b)  identify it as a preserved award term; and

                     (c)  identify the employers bound by the preserved award term; and

                     (d)  identify the employees bound by the preserved award term.

Note:          Section 117A deals with the employers bound by preserved award terms.

             (3)  If more than one preserved award term to the same substantive effect is taken under Division 3 to be included in the rationalised award:

                     (a)  paragraph (2)(a) requires that the preserved award term be included only once in the rationalised award; and

                     (b)  to avoid doubt, paragraphs (2)(b), (c) and (d) have effect according to their terms in relation to the preserved award term.

             (4)  For the purposes of paragraphs (2)(c) and (d) respectively:

                     (a)  employers may be identified by name or by inclusion in a specified class or specified classes; and

                     (b)  employees must be identified by inclusion in a specified class or specified classes.

             (5)  Without limiting the way in which a class may be described for the purposes of this section, the class may be described by reference to a particular industry or particular kinds of work.

##### <a id="118Q"></a>118Q  Reprints of varied awards

             (1)  If an award is varied under this Division, the Registrar must, as soon as practicable after receiving a copy of the order varying the award under subsection 121(2), publish a consolidated reprint of the award as varied.

             (2)  To avoid doubt, this requirement is in addition to, and not instead of, the requirements of Division 7.

### Division 5—Variation and revocation of awards

#### Subdivision A—Variation of awards

##### <a id="119"></a>119  Variation of awards—general

             (1)  The Commission must not make an order varying an award except:

                     (a)  as a result of an award rationalisation process; or

                     (b)  as a result of an award simplification process; or

                     (c)  if the variation is essential to the maintenance of minimum safety net entitlements (see section 119A); or

                     (d)  on a ground set out in section 119B; or

                     (e)  to bind additional employers, employees or organisations in accordance with section 120; or

                      (f)  under section 273; or

                     (g)  in circumstances prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph.

Note:          The variation that the Commission can make as a result of an award rationalisation process is affected by sections 117F and 118P.

             (2)  The Commission must not vary a preserved award term.

             (3)  The Commission must not vary a facilitative provision within the meaning of section 116H except:

                     (a)  as a result of an award rationalisation process; or

                     (b)  as a result of an award simplification process; or

                     (c)  on a ground set out in section 119B.

             (4)  The Commission must not vary a term taken to be included in an award by section 116A (which deals with dispute settling procedures).

##### <a id="119A"></a>119A  Variation of awards if essential to maintain minimum safety net entitlements

             (1)  An employer, employee or organisation bound by an award may apply to the Commission for an order varying the award on the ground that that the variation is essential to the maintenance of minimum safety net entitlements.

.            (2)  If an application is made under subsection (1), the Commission must take such steps as it thinks appropriate to ensure that each employer, employee and organisation bound by the award, and any other interested persons and bodies, are made aware of the application.

             (3)  The Minister may intervene in relation to the application.

             (4)  The Commission may make an order under this subsection varying the award only if the Commission is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the variation is essential to the maintenance of minimum safety net entitlements; and

                     (b)  all of the following conditions are met:

                              (i)  the award as varied would not be inconsistent with decisions of the AFPC;

                             (ii)  the award as varied would provide only minimum safety net entitlements for employees bound by the award;

                            (iv)  the making of the variation would not operate as a disincentive to agreement-making at the workplace level;

                             (v)  such other requirements prescribed by the regulations (if any) for the purposes of this paragraph have been satisfied.

##### <a id="119B"></a>119B  Variation of awards—other grounds

             (1)  The Commission may, if it considers that an award or a term of an award is ambiguous or uncertain, make an order varying the award so as to remove the ambiguity or uncertainty.

             (2)  If an award is referred to the Commission under section 46PW of the _Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986_, the Commission must convene a hearing to review the award.

             (3)  In a review under subsection (2):

                     (a)  the Commission must take such steps as it thinks appropriate to ensure that each employer, employee and organisation bound by the award is made aware of the hearing; and

                     (b)  the Sex Discrimination Commissioner may intervene in the proceeding.

             (4)  If the Commission considers that an award reviewed under subsection (2) is a discriminatory award, the Commission must take the necessary action to remove the discrimination by making an order varying the award.

             (5)  The Commission may, on application by an employer or organisation bound by an award, make an order varying a term of the award referring by name to an employer or organisation bound by the award:

                     (a)  to reflect a change in the name of the employer or organisation; or

                     (b)  if:

                              (i)  the registration of the organisation has been cancelled; or

                             (ii)  the employer or organisation has ceased to exist;

                            to omit the reference to its name.

             (6)  The onus of demonstrating that an award should be varied as set out in an application under subsection (5) rests with the applicant.

             (7)  In this section:

                    <a name="discriminatori-award"></a>**_discriminatory award_** means an award that:

                     (a)  has been referred to the Commission under section 46PW of the _Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986_; and

                     (b)  requires a person to do any act that would be unlawful under Part II of the _Sex Discrimination Act 1984_, except for the fact that the act would be done in direct compliance with the award.

For the purposes of this definition, the fact that an act is done in direct compliance with the award does not of itself mean that the act is reasonable.

                   The Commission must not make an order revoking an award except:

             (3)  The Commission must make an order revoking the award if it is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the award is obsolete or is no longer capable of operating; and

                     (b)  revocation of the award would not be contrary to the public interest.

                     (a)  the employee or employees have requested that the organisation do so; and

##### <a id="121I"></a>121I  Expressions used in awards

                   Unless the contrary intention appears in an award or an award-related order, an expression used in the award or order has the same meaning as it has in an Act because of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ or as it has in this Act.

Paragraph (c) does not apply if the instrument is an APCS.

             (3)  This section applies to a preserved APCS as if it were an instrument.

### Division 3—Transmission of AWA

##### <a id="124"></a>124  Transmission of AWA

New employer bound by AWA

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  immediately before the time of transmission:

                              (i)  the old employer; and

                             (ii)  an employee;

                            were bound by an AWA; and

                     (b)  the employee is a transferring employee in relation to the AWA;

the new employer is bound by the AWA by force of this section.

Note:          The new employer must notify the transferring employee and lodge a copy of the notice with the Employment Advocate (see sections 129 and 129A).

Period for which new employer remains bound

             (2)  The new employer remains bound by the AWA, by force of this section, until whichever of the following first occurs:

                     (a)  the AWA is terminated (see Division 9 of Part VB as modified by section 124A);

                     (b)  the AWA ceases to be in operation because it is replaced by another AWA between the new employer and the transferring employee (see paragraph 100(4)(b));

                     (c)  the transferring employee ceases to be a transferring employee in relation to the AWA;

                     (d)  the transmission period ends.

Old employer’s rights and obligations that arose before time of transmission not affected

             (3)  This section does not affect the rights and obligations of the old employer that arose before the time of transmission.

##### <a id="124A"></a>124A  Termination of transmitted AWA

Modified operation of subsections 103K(2) and 103L(2)

             (1)  The AWA cannot be terminated under subsection 103K(2) or 103L(2) during the transmission period (even if the AWA has passed its nominal expiry date).

Subsection 103R(1) does not apply

             (2)  Despite subsection 103R(1), a workplace agreement or an award may have effect in relation to the transferring employee’s employment with the new employer even if:

                     (a)  the AWA is terminated during the transmission period; or

                     (b)  the new employer ceases to be bound by the AWA because the transmission period ends.

Note:          Paragraph (2)(b) is included for the avoidance of doubt. Subsection 103R(1) only applies if a workplace agreement is terminated. Technically, the end of the transmission period does not terminate the transmitted AWA. The new employer merely ceases to be bound by it.

### Division 4—Transmission of collective agreement

#### Subdivision A—General

##### <a id="125"></a>125  Transmission of collective agreement

New employer bound by collective agreement

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  immediately before the time of transmission:

                              (i)  the old employer; and

                             (ii)  employees of the old employer;

                            were bound by a collective agreement; and

                     (b)  there is at least one transferring employee in relation to the collective agreement;

the new employer is bound by the collective agreement by force of this section.

Note 1:       The new employer must notify transferring employees and lodge a copy of a notice with the Employment Advocate (see sections 129 and 129A).

Note 2:       See also section 125A for the interaction between the collective agreement and other industrial instruments.

Period for which new employer remains bound

             (2)  The new employer remains bound by the collective agreement, by force of this section, until whichever of the following first occurs:

                     (a)  the collective agreement is terminated (see Division 9 of Part VB as modified by section 125C);

                     (b)  there cease to be any transferring employees in relation to the collective agreement;

                     (c)  the new employer ceases to be bound by the collective agreement in relation to all the transferring employees in relation to the collective agreement;

                     (d)  the transmission period ends.

Note:          Paragraph (c)—see subsection (3).

Period for which new employer remains bound in relation to particular transferring employee

             (3)  The new employer remains bound by the collective agreement in relation to a particular transferring employee, by force of this section, until whichever of the following first occurs:

                     (a)  the collective agreement ceases to be in operation in relation to the transferring employee’s employment with the new employer because the new employer makes an AWA with the transferring employee (see subsection 125B(2));

                     (b)  the collective agreement ceases to be in operation in relation to the transferring employee’s employment with the new employer because it has been replaced by another collective agreement in relation to the transferring employee’s employment with the new employer (see subsection 100(5) as modified by subsection 125B(3));

                     (c)  the employer ceases to be bound by the collective agreement under subsection (2).

New employer bound only in relation to employment of transferring employees in the business being transferred

             (4)  The new employer is bound by the collective agreement, by force of this section, only in relation to the employment, in the business being transferred, of employees who are transferring employees in relation to the collective agreement.

New employer bound subject to Commission order

             (5)  Subsections (1), (2) and (3) have effect subject to any order of the Commission under section 125E.

Old employer’s rights and obligations that arose before time of transmission not affected

             (6)  This section does not affect the rights and obligations of the old employer that arose before the time of transmission.

##### <a id="125A"></a>125A  Interaction rules

Transmitted agreement

             (1)  This section applies if subsection 125(1) applies to a collective agreement (the **_transmitted collective agreement_**).

Existing collective agreement

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  the new employer is bound by a collective agreement (the **_existing collective agreement_**) immediately before the time of transmission; and

                     (b)  a person is a transferring employee in relation to the transmitted collective agreement; and

                     (c)  the existing collective agreement would, but for this subsection, apply, according to its terms, to the transferring employee when the transferring employee becomes employed by the new employer;

the existing collective agreement does not apply to the transferring employee.

             (3)  Subsection (2) ceases to apply at the end of the transmission period.

##### <a id="125B"></a>125B  Transmitted collective agreement ceasing in relation to transferring employee

Transmitted agreement

             (1)  This section applies if subsection 125(1) applies to a collective agreement (the **_transmitted collective agreement_**).

AWA

             (2)  Despite subsection 100A(2), the transmitted collective agreement ceases to be in operation in relation to a transferring employee’s employment with the new employer if the new employer makes an AWA with the transferring employee after the time of transmission.

Note:          Subsection 100A(2) provides that a collective agreement is normally only suspended while an AWA is in operation. The effect of subsection (2) of this section is to terminate the operation of the transmitted collective agreement in relation to the transferring employee’s employment when the AWA is made.

Replacement collective agreement

             (3)  Despite subsection 100(5), the transmitted collective agreement ceases to be in operation in relation to a transferring employee if the transmitted collective agreement has been replaced by another collective agreement in relation to the employee (even if the transmitted collective agreement has not passed its nominal expiry date).

##### <a id="125C"></a>125C  Termination of transmitted collective agreement

Transmitted agreement

             (1)  This section applies if subsection 125(1) applies to a collective agreement (the **_transmitted collective agreement_**).

Modified operation of subsections 103K(2) and 103L(2)

             (2)  The transmitted collective agreement cannot be terminated under subsection 103K(2) or 103L(2) during the transmission period (even if the transmitted collective agreement has passed its nominal expiry date).

Subsection 103R(1) does not apply

             (3)  Despite subsection 103R(1), a workplace agreement or an award may have effect in relation to a transferring employee’s employment with the new employer if:

                     (a)  the transmitted collective agreement is terminated during the transmission period; or

                     (b)  the new employer ceases to be bound by the transmitted collective agreement because the transmission period ends.

Note:          Paragraph (3)(b) is included for the avoidance of doubt. Subsection 103R(1) only applies if a workplace agreement is terminated. Technically, the end of the transmission period does not terminate the transmitted collective agreement. The new employer merely ceases to be bound by it.

Special rule for transmitted workplace determination

             (4)  If the transmitted collective agreement is a workplace determination, subsection 113F(3) ceases to apply to the transmitted collective agreement at the time of transmission.

Note 1:       Subsection 113F(1) provides that this Act generally applies to a workplace determination as if it were a collective agreement.

Note 2:       Subsection 113F(3) would otherwise prevent the transmitted workplace determination from being terminated under Subdivision B of Division 9 of Part VB before it had passed its nominal expiry date.

#### Subdivision B—Commission’s powers

##### <a id="125D"></a>125D  Application and terminology

             (1)  The Subdivision applies if:

                     (a)  a person is bound by a collective agreement; and

                     (b)  another person:

                              (i)  becomes at a later time; or

                             (ii)  is likely to become at a later time;

                            the successor, transmittee or assignee of the whole, or a part, of the business of the person referred to in paragraph (a).

             (2)  For the purposes of this Subdivision:

                     (a)  the **_outgoing employer_** is the person referred to in paragraph (1)(a); and

                     (b)  the **_incoming employer_** is the person first referred to in paragraph (1)(b); and

                     (c)  the **_business concerned_** is the business, or the part of the business, to which the incoming employer becomes, or is likely to become, the successor, transmittee or assignee; and

                     (d)  the **_transfer time_** is the time at which the incoming employer becomes, or is likely to become, the successor, transmittee or assignee of the business concerned.

##### <a id="125E"></a>125E  Commission may make order

             (1)  The Commission may make an order that the incoming employer:

                     (a)  is not, or will not be, bound by the collective agreement; or

                     (b)  is, or will be, bound by the collective agreement, but only to the extent specified in the order.

The order must specify the day from which the order takes effect. That day must not be before the day on which the order is made or before the transfer time.

             (2)  Without limiting paragraph (1)(b), the Commission may make an order under that paragraph that the incoming employer is, or will be, bound by the collective agreement but only for the period specified in the order.

             (3)  To avoid doubt, the Commission cannot make an order under subsection (1) that would have the effect of extending the transmission period.

##### <a id="125F"></a>125F  When application for order can be made

                   An application for an order under subsection 125E(1) may be made before, at or after the transfer time.

##### <a id="125G"></a>125G  Who may apply for order

             (1)  Before the transfer time, an application for an order under subsection 125E(1) may be made only by the outgoing employer.

             (2)  At or after the transfer time, an application for an order under subsection 125E(1) may be made only by:

                     (a)  the incoming employer; or

                     (b)  a transferring employee in relation to the collective agreement; or

                     (c)  an organisation of employees that is bound by the collective agreement; or

                     (d)  an organisation of employees that:

                     (a)  the applicant;

                     (b)  before the transfer time—the persons covered by subsection (2);

                              (i)  who is bound by the collective agreement; and

                             (ii)  who is employed in the business concerned; and

                     (b)  the incoming employer; and

                     (c)  an organisation of employees that is bound by the collective agreement; and

                     (d)  an organisation of employees that:

                             (ii)  has been requested by the employee to make submissions on the employee’s behalf in relation to the application for the order under subsection 125E(1).

             (3)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(c), this subsection covers:

### Division 5—Transmission of award

##### <a id="126"></a>126  Transmission of award

New employer bound by award

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  the old employer was, immediately before the time of transmission, bound by an award that regulated the employment of employees of the old employer; and

                     (b)  there is at least one transferring employee in relation to the award; and

                     (c)  but for this section, the new employer would not be bound by the award in relation to the transferring employees in relation to the award;

the new employer is bound by the award by force of this section.

Note 1:       Paragraph (c)—the award might already bind the new employer, for example, because the new employer happens to be a respondent to the award.

Note 2:       The new employer must notify transferring employees and lodge a copy of a notice with the Employment Advocate (see sections 129 and 129A).

Note 3:       See also section 126A for the interaction between the award and other industrial instruments.

Period for which new employer remains bound

             (2)  The new employer remains bound by the award, by force of this section, until whichever of the following first occurs:

                     (a)  the award is revoked;

                     (b)  there cease to be any transferring employees in relation to the award;

                     (c)  the new employer ceases to be bound by the award in relation to all the transferring employees in relation to the award;

                     (d)  the transmission period ends.

Note:          Paragraph (c)—see subsection (3).

Period for which new employer remains bound in relation to particular transferring employee

             (3)  The new employer remains bound by the award in relation to a particular transferring employee, by force of this section, until whichever of the following first occurs:

                     (a)  the award ceases to be in operation in relation to the transferring employee’s employment with the new employer because the new employer makes an AWA with the transferring employee after the time of transmission (see subsection 126B(2));

                     (b)  the award ceases to be in operation in relation to the transferring employee’s employment with the new employer because a collective agreement comes into operation, after the time of transmission, in relation to the transferring employee’s employment with the new employer (see subsection 126B(3));

                     (c)  the employer ceases to be bound by the award under subsection (2).

New employer bound only in relation to employment of transferring employees

             (4)  The new employer is bound by the award, by force of this section, only in relation to the employment of employees who are transferring employees in relation to the award.

Commission order

             (5)  Subsections (1), (2) and (3) have effect subject to any order of the Commission.

             (6)  To avoid doubt, the Commission cannot make an order under subsection (5) that would have the effect of extending the transmission period.

Old employer’s rights and obligations that arose before time of transmission not affected

             (7)  This section does not affect the rights and obligations of the old employer that arose before the time of transmission.

##### <a id="126A"></a>126A  Interaction rules

Transmitted award

             (1)  This section applies if subsection 126(1) applies to an award (the **_transmitted award_**).

Collective agreement

             (2)  Despite section 100B but subject to subsection (3), a collective agreement that is in operation at the time of transmission does not have effect in relation to an employee’s employment while the transmitted award operates, in accordance with subsection 126(1), in relation to that employment.

Note 1:       But for subsection (2), section 100B would have the effect that the transmitted award would not have effect in relation to the employee’s employment while a collective agreement operates in relation to that employment.

Note 2:       Section 126B modifies the operation of section 100B in relation to AWAs and collective agreements that come into operation after the time of transmission.

             (3)  Despite subsection 126(1), if the employee agrees that the collective agreement is to operate in relation to that employment:

                     (a)  the collective agreement comes into operation in relation to that employment; and

                     (b)  the transmitted award ceases to be in operation in relation to that employment in accordance with subsection 126B(3).

Transmitted award

             (1)  This section applies if subsection 126(1) applies to an award (the **_transmitted award_**).

AWA

             (2)  Despite section 100B, the transmitted award ceases to be in operation in relation to a transferring employee’s employment with the new employer if the new employer makes an AWA with the transferring employee after the time of transmission.

Note:          Section 100B provides that an award is normally only suspended while an AWA is in operation. The effect of subsection (2) of this section is to terminate the operation of the transmitted award in relation to the transferring employee when the AWA is made.

Collective agreement

             (3)  Despite section 100B, the transmitted award ceases to be in operation in relation to a transferring employee’s employment with the new employer if a collective agreement comes into operation in relation to the transferring employee’s employment with the new employer after the time of transmission.

Note:          Section 100B provides that an award is normally only suspended while a collective agreement is in operation. The effect of subsection (3) of this section is to terminate the operation of the transmitted award in relation to the transferring employee when the collective agreement is made.

### Division 6—Transmission of APCS

                     (b)  the employee is a transferring employee in relation to the APCS; and

                     (c)  but for this section, the transferring employee’s employment with the new employer would not be covered by the APCS;

the transferring employee’s employment with the new employer is covered by the APCS by force of this section.

Employee ceasing to be transferring employee

             (2)  The transferring employee’s employment with the new employer ceases to be covered by the APCS, by force of this section, if the employee ceases to be a transferring employee in relation to the APCS.

Old employer’s rights and obligations that arose before time of transmission not affected

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  documentation for parental leave, required under Division 6 of Part VA, is given to the old employer by a transferring employee before the time of transmission; and

                     (b)  the leave applied for has not started before the time of transmission; and

                     (c)  the entitlement to that leave arises under the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard; and

                     (d)  the old employer notifies the new employer of the documentation under subsection (4);

the documentation is treated as if it had been given to the new employer.

             (4)  The old employer must notify the new employer of:

                     (a)  any person who:

                              (i)  is, or who is likely to be, a transferring employee; and

                             (ii)  is on parental leave at the time of transmission on the basis of an entitlement under the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard; and

                     (b)  documentation for parental leave that is given to the old employer before the time of transmission by a person who is, or is likely to be, a transferring employee if the documentation was given to the old employer on the basis of an entitlement under the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard.

The notification must be given in writing within 14 days after the time of transmission.

Note:          This is a civil remedy provision, see section 129C.

##### <a id="128A"></a>128A  New employer assuming liability for particular entitlements

             (1)  This section applies if the new employer agrees, in writing, before the time of transmission:

##### <a id="129"></a>129  Informing transferring employees about transmission of instrument

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  an employer is bound by an instrument (the **_transmitted instrument_**) in relation to a transferring employee by force of:

                              (i)  section 124 (AWA); or

                             (ii)  section 125 (collective agreement); or

                            (iii)  section 126 (award); and

                     (b)  a person is a transferring employee in relation to the transmitted instrument.

The provision referred to in paragraph (a) is the **_transmission provision_**.

             (2)  Within 28 days after the transferring employee starts being employed by the employer, the employer must take reasonable steps to give the transferring employee a written notice that complies with subsection (3).

Note:          This is a civil remedy provision, see section 129C.

             (3)  The notice must:

                     (a)  identify the transmitted instrument; and

                     (b)  state that the employer is bound by the transmitted instrument; and

                     (c)  specify the date on which the transmission period for the transmitted instrument ends; and

                     (d)  state that the employer will remain bound by the transmitted instrument until the end of the transmission period unless the transmitted instrument is terminated, or otherwise ceases to be in operation, before the end of that period; and

                     (e)  specify the kinds of instruments (if any) that can replace, or exclude the operation of, the transmitted instrument; and

                      (f)  identify:

                              (i)  any provisions of the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard; or

                             (ii)  any other instrument;

                            that the employer intends to be the source for terms and conditions that will apply to the matters that are dealt with by the transmitted instrument when the transmitted instrument ceases to bind the employer; and

                     (g)  identify any collective agreement or award that binds:

                              (i)  the employer; and

                             (ii)  employees of the employer who are not transferring employees in relation to the transmitted instrument;

                            and that would bind the transferring employee but for the transmission provision.

          (3A)  Subject to subsection (3B), if the notice under subsection (3) identifies an instrument under paragraph (3)(g), the employer must give the transferring employee a copy of the instrument together with the notice.

Note:          This is a civil remedy provision, see section 129C.

          (3B)  Subsection (3A) does not apply if:

                     (a)  the transferring employee is able to easily access a copy of the instrument in a particular way; and

                     (b)  the notice under subsection (3) tells the transferring employee that a copy of the instrument is accessible in that way.

Note:          Paragraph (a)—the copy may be available, for example, on the Internet.

             (4)  Subsection (2) does not apply if:

                     (a)  the transmitted instrument is an award and the new employer and the transferring employee become bound by an AWA or a collective agreement at the time of transmission or within 14 days after the time of transmission; or

                     (b)  the transmitted instrument is a workplace agreement and the new employer and the transferring employee become bound by an AWA within 14 days after the time of transmission.

             (1)  If an employer:

                     (a)  gives a notice under subsection 129(2) to a transferring employee in relation to an AWA; or

                     (b)  gives a notice under subsection 129(2) to the only person who is a transferring employee in relation to a collective agreement or award;

the employer must lodge a copy of the notice with the Employment Advocate within 14 days after the notice is given to the transferring employee. The copy must be lodged in accordance with subsection (4).

Note 1:       This is a civil remedy provision, see section 129C.

Note 2:       Sections 137.1 and 137.2 of the _Criminal Code_ create offences for providing false or misleading information or documents.

Multiple transferring employees and notices all given on the one day

             (2)  If:

                     (b)  all of those notices are given on the one day;

the employer must lodge a copy of one of those notices with the Employment Advocate within 14 days after that notice is given. The copy must be lodged in accordance with subsection (4).

Note 2:       Sections 137.1 and 137.2 of the _Criminal Code_ create offences for providing false or misleading information or documents.

Multiple transferring employees and notices given on different days

                     (b)  the notices are given on different days;

the employer must lodge a copy of the notice, or one of the notices that was given on the earliest of those days, with the Employment Advocate within 14 days after that notice is given. The copy must be lodged in accordance with subsection (4).

Note 1:       This is a civil remedy provision, see section 129C.

Note 2:       Sections 137.1 and 137.2 of the _Criminal Code_ create offences for providing false or misleading information or documents.

Lodgment with Employment Advocate

             (4)  A notice is lodged with the Employment Advocate in accordance with this subsection only if it is actually received by the Employment Advocate.

Note:          This means that section 29 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ (to the extent that it deals with the time of service of documents) does not apply to lodgment of a notice.

##### <a id="129B"></a>129B  Employment Advocate must issue receipt for lodgment

             (1)  If a notice is lodged under section 129A, the Employment Advocate must issue a receipt for the lodgment.

             (2)  The receipt must state that the notice was lodged under section 129A on a particular day.

             (3)  The Employment Advocate must give a copy of the receipt to the person who lodged the notice under section 129A.

## Part VIIA—Dispute resolution processes

### Division 1—Preliminary

##### <a id="171"></a>171  Object

                   The objects of this Part are:

                     (a)  to encourage employers and employees who are parties to a dispute to resolve it at the workplace level; and

                     (b)  to introduce greater flexibility for the resolution of disputes by allowing the parties to determine the best forum in which to resolve them.

##### <a id="172"></a>172  Court process

                   The fact that the model dispute resolution process, an alternative dispute resolution process or any other dispute resolution process applies in relation to a dispute does not affect any right of a party to the dispute to take court action to resolve it.

### Division 2—Model dispute resolution process

##### <a id="173"></a>173  Model dispute resolution process

             (1)  This Division sets out the **_model dispute resolution process_**.

             (2)  The model dispute resolution process does not apply in relation to a particular dispute, unless it applies in relation to that dispute because of a provision of this Act, other than one contained in this Division, or a term of an award, a workplace agreement or a workplace determination.

Note:          The model dispute resolution process applies in relation to a variety of disputes, including:

(a)           disputes about entitlements under the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard (see section 89E); and

(b)           disputes about the terms of a workplace agreement, where the agreement itself includes the model dispute resolution process or is taken to include that process (see section 101A); and

(c)           disputes about the application of a workplace determination (see section 113D); and

(d)           disputes about the application of awards (see section 116A); and

(e)           disputes under Division 1 of Part VIA, which deals with meal breaks (see section 170AC); and

(f)            disputes under Division 1A of Part VIA, which deals with public holidays (see section 170AH); and

(g)           disputes under Division 5 of Part VIA, which deals with parental leave (see section 170KD).

##### <a id="174"></a>174  Resolving dispute at workplace level

                   The parties to a dispute must genuinely attempt to resolve the dispute at the workplace level.

Note:          This may involve an affected employee first discussing the matter in dispute with his or her supervisor, then with more senior management.

##### <a id="175"></a>175  Where dispute cannot be resolved at workplace level

Alternative dispute resolution process using an agreed provider

             (1)  If a matter in dispute cannot be resolved at the workplace level, a party to the dispute may elect to use an alternative dispute resolution process in an attempt to resolve the matter.

             (2)  The alternative dispute resolution process is to be conducted by a person agreed between the parties in dispute on the matter.

Where parties cannot agree on a provider

             (3)  If the parties cannot reach agreement on who is to conduct the alternative dispute resolution process, a party to the dispute on the matter may notify  the Industrial Registrar of that fact.

             (4)  On receiving notification under subsection (3), the Industrial Registrar must provide the parties with the prescribed information.

             (5)  If the parties cannot agree on who is to conduct the alternative dispute resolution process within the consideration period, a party to the dispute on the matter may apply to the Commission to have the alternative dispute resolution process conducted by the Commission.

             (6)  If an alternative dispute resolution process is used to resolve a dispute on a matter, the parties to the dispute must genuinely attempt to resolve the dispute using that process.

             (7)  In this section:

                    <a name="consider-period"></a>**_consideration period_** is a period beginning on the last day on which the Industrial Registrar gives the prescribed information to a party to the dispute on the matter and ending 14 days later.

##### <a id="176"></a>176  Conduct during dispute

             (1)  An employee who is a party to a dispute must, while the dispute is being resolved:

                     (a)  continue to work in accordance with his or her contract of employment, unless the employee has a reasonable concern about an imminent risk to his or her health or safety; and

                     (b)  comply with any reasonable direction given by his or her employer to perform other available work, either at the same workplace or at another workplace.

             (2)  In directing an employee to perform other available work, an employer must have regard to:

                     (a)  the provisions (if any) of the law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory dealing with occupational health and safety that apply to that employee or that other work; and

                     (b)  whether that work is appropriate for the employee to perform.
