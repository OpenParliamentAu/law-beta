An Act relating to the conservation of the Wet Tropics of Queensland World Heritage Area

Preamble
		This preamble sets out considerations taken into account by the Parliament of Australia in enacting the law that follows.
		Aboriginal people have occupied, used, and enjoyed land in the Area since time immemorial.
		The Area is part of the cultural landscape of Rainforest Aboriginal peoples and is important spiritually, socially, historically and culturally to aboriginal people particularly concerned with the land.
		It is, therefore, the intention of the Parliament to recognise a role for Aboriginal peoples particularly concerned with land and waters in the Area, and give Aboriginal peoples a role to play in its management.
