                     (b)  the person makes a representation to the individual that the contract is a contract for services under which the individual performs work, or is to perform work, for the person as an independent contractor; and

                     (c)  the contract, as in force at the time of the representation, is a contract of employment under which the person is the employer of the individual, rather than a contract for services under which the individual performs work as an independent contractor.

Note:          In this subsection,**_employer_** and **_employment_** have the meanings given by subsections 6(1) and 7(1) respectively.

             (2)  A person does not contravene subsection (1) if the person proves that, at the time the person made the representation concerned, the person did not know that, and was not reckless as to whether, the contract was a contract of employment rather than a contract for services.

Note:          In this subsection,**_employment_** has its ordinary meaning—see paragraph 4(2)(pa) of Schedule 2.

             (3)  Subsection (1) is a civil remedy provision.

Note:          In this subsection,**_employer_** and **_employment_** have the meanings given by subsections 6(1) and 7(1) respectively.

             (2)  A person does not contravene subsection (1) if the person proves that, at the time the person made the representation concerned, the person did not know that, and was not reckless as to whether, if the contract were entered into, the contract would be a contract of employment rather than a contract for services.

Note:          Division 3 of Part 14 contains other provisions relevant to civil remedies.

             (3)  In proceedings alleging a contravention of subsection (1) it is presumed, other than in relation to the granting of an interim injunction, that the employer’s sole or dominant purpose was the purpose referred to in paragraph (1)(b), unless the employer proves otherwise.

                     (a)  the person makes a statement that the person knows is false; and

Note 1:       This is a civil remedy provision, see clause 31.

Note 2:       Sections 137.1 and 137.2 of the _Criminal Code_ create offences for providing false or misleading information or documents.

             (2)  The notice must be lodged within 14 days after the day specified in paragraph (a) or (b):

                     (a)  if the employer gives a notice to an employee in respect of a redundancy provision that was included in a pre-reform AWA or a preserved individual State agreement—the day on which that notice is given; or

                     (b)  if the employer gives one or more notices to one or more employees in respect of a redundancy provision that was included in a pre-reform certified agreement or a preserved collective State agreement—the earliest day on which a notice was given.

Lodgment with Employment Advocate

             (3)  A notice is lodged with the Employment Advocate in accordance with this subclause only if it is actually received by the Employment Advocate.

Note:          This means that section 29 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_(to the extent that it deals with the time of service of documents) does not apply to lodgment of a notice.

### Division 7—Stand downs

##### <a id="691A"></a>691A  Employer may stand down employees in certain circumstances

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  an employee employed by an employer cannot usefully be employed during a period because of a particular circumstance; and

                     (b)  that circumstance is:

                              (i)  a strike; or

                             (ii)  a breakdown of machinery; or

                            (iii)  a stoppage of work for any cause for which the employer cannot reasonably be held responsible; and

                     (c)  either:

                              (i)  there is no contract of employment, and no industrial instrument, that binds the employer in respect of the employment of the employee and that contains provision for the standing down of the employee during that period because of that circumstance; or

                             (ii)  a contract of employment, or industrial instrument, that binds the employer in respect of the employment of the employee contains provision for the standing down of the employee during that period because of that circumstance, but the employer’s right to stand down the employee is dependent on the employer having to apply to the Commission, a State industrial authority or another person or body for an order or determination (however described) authorising the employer to stand down the employee.

             (2)  If this section applies, the employer:

                     (a)  may stand down the employee during the period referred to in paragraph (1)(a) because of the circumstance referred to in that paragraph; and

                     (b)  if the employer stands down the employee under paragraph (a) of this subsection—may deduct payment for the period during which the employee is stood down.

             (3)  A period during which an employee is stood down under subsection (2) does not break the employee’s continuity of service.

             (4)  A period during which an employee is stood down under subsection (2) counts as service for all purposes.

             (5)  A provision of a contract of employment or an industrial instrument that provides as mentioned in subparagraph (1)(c)(ii) has no effect. However, this section does not otherwise affect the operation of any provision of a contract of employment or industrial instrument that provides for the standing down of employees.

             (6)  In this section:

                    <a name="industri-instrum"></a>**_industrial instrument_** means any of the following:

                     (a)  a workplace agreement;

                     (b)  an award;

                     (c)  a pre-reform AWA;

                     (d)  a pre-reform certified agreement (within the meaning of Schedule 7);

                     (e)  a preserved State agreement;

                      (f)  a notional agreement preserving State awards;

                     (g)  a workplace determination;

                     (h)  an employment agreement (within the meaning of Division 12 of Part 21);

                      (i)  an exceptional matters order (within the meaning of Schedule 7);

                      (j)  a section 170MX award (within the meaning of Schedule 7);

                     (k)  an old IR agreement (within the meaning of Schedule 7).

##### <a id="691B"></a>691B  Prohibition of unauthorised stand downs

             (1)  An employer must not stand down an employee from his or her employment if the stand down is not authorised by:

                     (a)  subsection 691A(2); or

                     (b)  a provision of a contract of employment, or an industrial instrument (within the meaning of section 691A), that is binding on the employer in respect of the employment of the employee (other than a provision that is rendered of no effect by subsection 691A(5)).

Note 1:       Compliance with this subsection is dealt with as follows:

(a)           the model dispute resolution process applies (see subsection (2));

(b)           the Court may grant an injunction (see subsection (3));

(c)           the compliance provisions of Part 14 apply.

Note 2:       If the standing down of an employee is not authorised as mentioned in this subsection, the employee may recover any lost wages by taking appropriate enforcement action (whether under this Act or otherwise).

             (2)  The model dispute resolution process (other than section 697) applies to a dispute under subsection (1).

Note:          The model dispute resolution process is set out in Part 13.

             (3)  The Court, or the Federal Magistrates Court, on application by an employee who has been stood down or by an inspector, may grant an injunction requiring the employer of the employee to cease contravening (or not to contravene) subsection (1).

##### <a id="691C"></a>691C  Extraterritorial extension

             (1)  This Division, and the rest of this Act so far as it relates to this Division, extend:

                     (a)  to an employee outside Australia who meets any of the conditions in this section; and

                     (b)  to the employee’s employer (whether the employer is in or outside Australia); and

                     (c)  to acts, omissions, matters and things relating to the employee or the employee’s employment (whether those acts, omissions, matters or things are in or outside Australia).

Note:          In this context, **_Australia_** includes the Territory of Christmas Island, the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands and the coastal sea. See section 15B and paragraph 17(a) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

Employee in Australia’s exclusive economic zone

             (2)  One condition is that the employee is in Australia’s exclusive economic zone and either:

                     (a)  is an employee of an Australian employer and is not prescribed by the regulations as an employee to whom this subsection does not apply; or

                     (b)  is an employee prescribed by the regulations as an employee to whom this subsection applies.

Note:          The regulations may prescribe the employee by reference to a class. See subsection 13(3) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_.

On Australia’s continental shelf outside exclusive economic zone

             (3)  Another condition is that the employee:

                     (a)  is outside the outer limits of Australia’s exclusive economic zone, but is in, on or over a part of Australia’s continental shelf prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this subsection, in connection with the exploration of the continental shelf or the exploitation of its natural resources; and

                     (b)  meets the requirements that are prescribed by the regulations for that part.

Note:          The regulations may prescribe different requirements relating to different parts of Australia’s continental shelf. The regulations may need to do so to give effect to Australia’s international obligations.

Outside Australia’s exclusive economic zone and continental shelf

             (4)  Another condition is that the employee:

                     (a)  is neither in Australia’s exclusive economic zone nor in, on or over a part of Australia’s continental shelf described in paragraph (3)(a); and

                     (b)  is an Australian-based employee of an Australian employer; and

                     (c)  is not prescribed by the regulations as an employee to whom this subsection does not apply.

             (5)  In this section:

                    <a name="act"></a>**_this Act_** includes the Registration and Accountability of Organisations Schedule and regulations made under it.

                     (e)  if neither paragraph (c) nor (d) applies—the employer must comply with the frequency of payment provisions of the APCS in relation to the employee.

## 2  After subsection 226(1)

## 7  After subsection 229(4)

Insert:

Certain types of leave not to count as service

          (4A)  For the purposes of subparagraphs (1)(b)(i) and (4)(a)(ii), a period of authorised unpaid leave or unauthorised leave does not count as service in relation to an employee except:

                     (a)  as expressly provided by:

                              (i)  a term or condition of the employee’s employment; or

                             (ii)  a law, or an instrument in force under a law, of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; or

                     (b)  as prescribed by the regulations.

Note:          For whether leave guaranteed under this Part counts as service, see subsections 238(2) (annual leave), 260(2) (paid personal leave), 261(2) (unpaid carer’s leave) and 316(2) (parental leave).

## 8  Subsection 229(5) (note 3)

Repeal the note.

## 9  Paragraph 233(1)(c)

Omit all the words after “no less than”, substitute “the rate that, at the time the election is made, is the employee’s basic periodic rate of pay (expressed as an hourly rate); and”.

## 10  Subsection 235(1)

Omit all the words after “a period,”, substitute “the employee must be paid a rate for each hour (pro-rated for part hours) of annual leave taken that is no less than the rate that, immediately before the period begins, is the employee’s basic periodic rate of pay (expressed as an hourly rate).”.

## 11  Subsection 235(2)

Omit all the words after “a particular time,”, substitute “the employee must be paid a rate for each hour (pro-rated for part hours) of the employee’s untaken accrued annual leave that is no less than the rate that, immediately before that time, is the employee’s basic periodic rate of pay (expressed as an hourly rate).”.

## 12  At the end of section 236

Add:

Entitlement to leave for all nominal hours in a day also extends to other hours on that day

             (7)  If:

                     (a)  an employee to whom subparagraph 229(1)(a)(ii) applies is entitled to take annual leave on a particular day; and

                     (b)  the entitlement covers all the hours (or part hours) on that day that would count towards the nominal hours worked by the employee in the week that includes that day;

the employer is taken to have authorised the employee to be absent from work for any other hours (or part hours) on that day that the employee would otherwise have worked.

Example:    Bianca is employed by BBB Bakers Pty Ltd. She works 40 hours per week (consisting of 38 hours plus 2 reasonable additional hours).

                   Under subsection 232(2), Bianca is entitled to accrue paid annual leave of 1/13 of her nominal hours worked for each completed 4 week period of continuous service with BBB Bakers. Because of subparagraph 229(1)(a)(ii), Bianca’s nominal hours worked in a week are capped at 38 hours. If Bianca works her normal hours for a 12 month period, she will accrue 152 hours of paid annual leave.

                   The above subsection ensures that Bianca will be able to be absent from work for 4 full 40 hour weeks. Bianca’s absence for the additional 8 hours will not be paid leave, and will not count as service, but it will not break her continuity of service (see subsection (8)).

             (8)  An absence that is taken by subsection (7) to have been authorised:

                     (a)  is not annual leave; and

                     (b)  does not break the employee’s continuity of service; and

                     (c)  does not otherwise count as service.

             (9)  For the purposes of subsection (7), if a shift (or other period of work) occurs partly on 1 day and partly on the next day, the shift (or other period of work) is taken to be a day and the remaining parts of the days are taken not to be part of the day.

           (10)  For the purposes of subsection (7), the regulations may make provision for either or both of the following:

                     (a)  determining what hours (or part hours) on a particular day would count towards the nominal hours worked by an employee in a week;

                     (b)  determining what other hours (or part hours) on a particular day would be hours (or part hours) that an employee would otherwise have worked.

## 13  Section 240

Insert:

                    <a name="basic-period-rate-pai"></a>**_basic periodic rate of pay_** has the meaning given by section 178.

                     (a)  start with:

                              (i)  the specified number of hours; or

## 15  After subsection 241(4)

Insert:

Certain types of leave not to count as service

          (4A)  For the purposes of subparagraphs (1)(b)(i) and (4)(a)(ii), a period of authorised unpaid leave or unauthorised leave does not count as service in relation to an employee except:

                     (a)  as expressly provided by:

                              (i)  a term or condition of the employee’s employment; or

                             (ii)  a law, or an instrument in force under a law, of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; or

                     (b)  as prescribed by the regulations.

Note:          For whether leave guaranteed under this Part counts as service, see subsections 238(2) (annual leave), 260(2) (paid personal leave), 261(2) (unpaid carer’s leave) and 316(2) (parental leave).

## 16  Subsection 241(5) (note 3)

Repeal the note.

## 17  Section 243

Repeal the section, substitute:

##### <a id="243"></a>243  Regulations may prescribe different definitions for piece rate employees

                   The regulations may prescribe:

                     (a)  a different definition of **_basic periodic rate of pay_** for the purposes of the application of this Division in relation to piece rate employees; and

                     (b)  a different definition of **_nominal hours worked_** for the purposes of the application of this Division in relation to piece rate employees.

## 18  After section 245

Insert:

##### <a id="245A"></a>245A  Entitlement to cash out an amount of paid personal/carer’s leave

             (1)  This section applies to an employee if more than the protected amount of paid personal/carer’s leave is credited to the employee.

             (2)  The employee is entitled to forgo an entitlement to take any or all of the amount of paid personal/carer’s leave credited to the employee that exceeds the protected amount of paid personal/carer’s leave if:

                     (a)  a provision in a workplace agreement binding the employee and the employer entitles the employee to forgo the entitlement to the amount of paid personal/carer’s leave; and

                     (b)  the employee gives the employer a written election to forgo the amount of paid personal/carer’s leave; and

                     (c)  a provision in a workplace agreement binding the employee and the employer entitles the employee to receive pay in lieu of the amount of paid personal/carer’s leave at a rate that is no less than the rate that, at the time the election is made, is the employee’s basic periodic rate of pay (expressed as an hourly rate); and

                     (d)  the employer authorises the employee to forgo the amount of paid personal/carer’s leave.

Note:          If, under this section, an employee forgoes an entitlement to take an amount of paid personal/carer’s leave, the employee’s employer may deduct that amount from the amount of accrued paid personal/carer’s leave credited to the employee.

             (3)  For the purposes of subsections (1) and (2), the **_protected amount of paid personal/carer’s leave_** for the employee is 3/52 of the number of nominal hours worked by the employee for the employer during:

                     (a)  a continuous period of 12 months of service with the employer ending immediately before the day on which the employee makes an election under paragraph (2)(b); or

                     (b)  a sequence of periods totalling 12 months of service with the employer, the last of which ends immediately before the day on which the employee makes an election under paragraph (2)(b).

Note:          The protected amount of paid personal/carer’s leave for an employee whose nominal hours worked for an employer each week over a continuous period of 12 months service with the employer are 38 hours would be 114 hours (which would be equivalent to 15 days of paid personal/carer’s leave for that employee).

             (4)  An employer must not:

                     (a)  require an employee to forgo an entitlement to take an amount of paid personal/carer’s leave; or

                     (b)  exert undue influence or undue pressure on an employee in relation to the making of a decision by the employee whether or not to forgo an entitlement to take an amount of paid personal/carer’s leave.

             (5)  If, under this section, an employee forgoes an entitlement to take an amount of paid personal/carer’s leave, the employer must, within a reasonable period, give the employee the amount of pay that the employee is entitled to receive in lieu of the amount of paid personal/carer’s leave.

## 19  Section 247

Omit all the words after “a period,”, substitute “the employee must be paid a rate for each hour (pro-rated for part hours) of paid personal/carer’s leave taken that is no less than the rate that, immediately before the period begins, is the employee’s basic periodic rate of pay (expressed as an hourly rate).”.

## 20  After section 247

Insert:

##### <a id="247A"></a>247A  Entitlement to leave for all nominal hours in a day also extends to other hours on that day

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  an employee to whom subparagraph 241(1)(a)(ii) applies is entitled to take paid personal/carer’s leave on a particular day; and

                     (b)  the entitlement covers all the hours (or part hours) on that day that would count towards the nominal hours worked by the employee in the week that includes that day;

the employer is taken to have authorised the employee to be absent from work for any other hours (or part hours) on that day that the employee would otherwise have worked.

Example:    Tina is employed by Terrific Videos Pty Ltd. She works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, giving a weekly total of 40 hours per week (consisting of 38 hours plus 2 reasonable additional hours).

                   Under subsection 246(2), Tina is entitled to accrue paid personal/carer’s leave of 1/26 of her nominal hours worked for each completed 4 week period of continuous service with Terrific Videos. Because of subparagraph 241(1)(a)(ii), Tina’s nominal hours worked in a week are capped at 38 hours. If Tina works her normal hours for a 12 month period, she will accrue 76 hours of paid personal/carer’s leave.

                   The above subsection ensures that Tina will be able (subject to the requirements of this Division relating to entitlement to paid personal/carer’s leave) to be absent from work for 10 full 8 hour days. Tina’s absence for the additional 4 hours over those 10 days will not be paid leave, and will not count as service, but it will not break her continuity of service (see subsection (2)).

             (2)  An absence that is taken by subsection (1) to have been authorised:

                     (a)  is not paid personal/carer’s leave; and

                     (b)  does not break the employee’s continuity of service; and

                     (c)  does not otherwise count as service.

             (3)  For the purposes of subsection (1), if a shift (or other period of work) occurs partly on 1 day and partly on the next day, the shift (or other period of work) is taken to be a day and the remaining parts of the days are taken not to be part of the day.

             (4)  For the purposes of subsection (1), the regulations may make provision for either or both of the following:

                     (a)  determining what hours (or part hours) on a particular day would count towards the nominal hours worked by an employee in a week;

                     (b)  determining what other hours (or part hours) on a particular day would be hours (or part hours) that an employee would otherwise have worked.

## 21  Section 259

Omit all the words after “a period,”, substitute “the employee must be paid a rate for each hour (pro-rated for part hours) of compassionate leave taken that is no less than the rate that, immediately before the period begins, is the employee’s basic periodic rate of pay (expressed as an hourly rate).”.

## 30  After subsection 274(2)
