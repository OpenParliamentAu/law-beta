             (2)  It is not an offence against subsection (1) for a person to provide services to another person if the services are provided in compliance with conditions stated in a notice given to the first-mentioned person by the Minister under subsection 14(2).

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Request to the Minister for information

             (1)  If a person who wishes to supply goods, to export non-regulated goods or to provide services believes or suspects that the goods will or may be used in, or the provision of the services will or may assist, a WMD program, the person may request the Minister in writing for information as to whether the Minister has reason to believe or suspect that the goods will or may be used in, or the provision of the services will or may assist, a WMD program.

             (2)  A permit may be unconditional or subject to conditions stated in the permit.

             (3)  If a permit to supply or export goods or provide services was given to a person, the Minister may, by written notice given to the person, revoke the permit if the Minister is satisfied, having regard to any events that have occurred, or any information of which he or she has become aware, since the permit was given, that the supply or export of the goods or the provision of the services, as the case may be, would be contrary to Australia’s international or treaty obligations or the national interest.

                              (i)  if a person were to supply particular goods to another person or to export particular non-regulated goods to a particular place, the goods would or might be used in a WMD program; or

                             (ii)  if a person were to provide particular services to another person, the provision of the services would or might assist a WMD program; and

                     (b)  the Minister considers that a permit could not be given under section 13 in respect of such a supply or export of goods or the provision of such services, as the case may be;

             (5)  The Minister may, in relation to the supply or export of goods, or the provision of services, give a notice to a person under subsection (1) that is to take effect at the time when a previous notice given to the person under that subsection in relation to the supply or export of those goods, or the provision of those services, as the case may be, ceases to be in force.
