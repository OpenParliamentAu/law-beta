             (2)  An instrument under subsection (1) has no effect in relation to a reporting period unless it is made before the first day of that reporting period.

##### <a id="19A"></a>19A  Agency may review compliance with Act

             (1)  The Agency may, by written notice, require a relevant employer to give the Agency information:

                     (a)  that relates to the employer’s compliance with this Act or to the employer’s performance against the minimum standards; and

                     (b)  that is specified in the notice.

             (2)  The notice must specify the period within which, and the manner in which, the information must be given.

             (3)  A period specified in a notice under subsection (1) must be at least 14 days after the notice is given.

##### <a id="19B"></a>19B  Relevant employer fails to comply with Act if employer gives false or misleading information

                   For the purposes of section 19D, a relevant employer is taken to fail to comply with this Act if:

                     (b)  the employer gives the Agency information under section 19A and the information is false or misleading.

                   If:

                     (b)  in a case where a minimum standard (the **_base standard_**) applies in relation to the employer and the base period—at the end of the base period, the employer fails to meet that standard; and

                     (c)  the employer lodges a public report under section 13A in respect of the second reporting period (the **_comparison period_**) after the base period; and

                     (d)  at the end of the comparison period, the employer’s performance against the base standard has failed to improve from the employer’s performance against that standard at the end of the base period;

then the failure referred to in paragraph (d) is taken, for the purposes of section 19D, to be a failure to comply with this Act.

Note:          If the employer does not have a reasonable excuse for the failure referred to in paragraph (d) of this section, the Agency may name the employer in a report given to the Minister or by electronic or other means: see section 19D.

##### <a id="19D"></a>19D  Consequences of non‑compliance with Act

Note:          For example, the Agency may do this on the Agency’s website or in a newspaper.

Prior notice to employer

             (4)  If the Agency proposes to:

                     (a)  name an employer in a report under subsection 12(1) or (2); or

                     (b)  name an employer under subsection (3) of this section;

the Agency must:

                     (c)  give the employer notice in writing of the proposal and the reasons for the proposal; and

                     (d)  invite the employer to make written representations to the Agency about the proposal within the period of 28 days beginning on the day the notice is given; and

                     (e)  have regard to any written representations made by the employer within that period.

             (5)  If:

                     (a)  a relevant employer lodges a public report under section 13A in respect of a reporting period; and

                     (b)  the report is lodged within the time allowed by section 13B or 17;

then, during the period of 28 days beginning on the day the report is lodged, the Agency must not give the employer a notice under subsection (4) of this section in relation to the lodgement of that report.

##### <a id="19E"></a>19E  Agency to offer relevant employers advice and assistance if employers fail to meet minimum standards

                   If:

                     (a)  a relevant employer lodges a public report under section 13A in respect of a reporting period; and

                     (b)  in a case where a minimum standard applies in relation to the employer and that reporting period—the Agency becomes aware that, at the end of that reporting period, the employer fails to meet that standard;

the Agency must offer to provide the employer with advice and assistance in relation to improving the employer’s performance against that standard.
