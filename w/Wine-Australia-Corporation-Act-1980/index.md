                     (b)  it includes a registered geographical indication, and the wine did not originate in a country, region or locality in relation to which the geographical indication is registered; or

             (4)  For the purposes of paragraphs (2)(b), (c) and (d):

                     (b)  a registered translation of such an indication; or

is included in the description and presentation of wine even if the indication, translation or expression is accompanied by an expression such as “kind”, “type”, “style”, “imitation”, “method”, or any similar expression.

##### <a id="40DA"></a>40DA  Circumstances in which description and presentation is not false—general

Inclusion of geographical indication, translation or traditional expression registered for more than one place

                     (b)  the wine originated in that country, region or locality; and

                     (c)  the description and presentation indicates that the wine originated in that country, region or locality;

then the description and presentation is not false merely because the indication or term is also a registered geographical indication, a registered translation of such an indication, or a registered traditional expression, in relation to another country, region or locality.

Inclusion of common English word or term

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  the description and presentation of wine includes a word or term that is a registered geographical indication, a registered translation of such an indication, or a registered traditional expression, in relation to a country, region or locality; and

                     (b)  the word or term is a common English word or term; and

                     (c)  the word or term is not used in such a way as to indicate that the wine originated in the country, region or locality in relation to which the geographical indication, translation or traditional expression is registered; and

                     (d)  the description and presentation indicates the country, region or locality in which the wine originated; and

                     (e)  the word or term is used in good faith;

then the description and presentation is not false merely because it includes the word or term.

Inclusion of name of individual or address of winery

             (3)  The description and presentation of wine is not false merely because it includes:

                     (a)  the name of an individual who manufactured, sold, exported or imported the wine; or

                     (b)  if a person who manufactured, sold, exported or imported the wine is, apart from this subsection, lawfully permitted to use the name of an individual who previously manufactured, sold, exported or imported the wine—the name of that individual; or

                     (c)  the address of the winery at which the wine was manufactured.

##### <a id="40DB"></a>40DB  Circumstances in which description and presentation is not false—inclusion of registered traditional expressions

Inclusion of registered quality wine term

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  the description and presentation of wine includes a registered quality wine term; and

                     (b)  the wine originated in Australia; and

                     (c)  the description and presentation indicates that the wine originated in Australia or in a region or locality in Australia; and

                     (d)  the registered quality wine term is also a registered traditional expression; and

                     (e)  the wine is in a category of wine in relation to which the expression is registered;

then the description and presentation is not false merely because it includes the registered quality wine term.

Wine originating in non‑agreement country

             (2)  The description and presentation of wine that originates in a foreign country that is not an agreement country is not false merely because it includes a term that is a registered traditional expression if:

                     (a)  the term is not used in such a way as to be likely to mislead as to the country, region or locality in which the wine originated; and

                     (b)  the description and presentation indicates the country, region or locality in which the wine originated; and

                              (i)  unless subparagraph (ii) applies—the date on which the prescribed wine‑trading agreement to which that country is a party was signed; or

Practices, processes and requirements set out in wine‑trading agreements

          (1A)  The replacement practices, processes or requirements under this subsection are:

                     (a)  subject to paragraph (b), the oenological practices or processes, or compositional requirements, set out in a prescribed wine‑trading agreement as in force or existing from time to time; or

                     (b)  if, in accordance with such an agreement, Australia has been notified of the authorisation of modifications of the oenological practices or processes, or compositional requirements, set out in the agreement—the oenological practices or processes, or compositional requirements, as so modified.

                     (a)  must be by written notice signed by the Minister and published in the _Gazette_; and

                     (b)  takes effect on a day stated in the notice that is not earlier than the day following the date of publication; and
