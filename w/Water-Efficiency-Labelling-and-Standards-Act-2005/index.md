##### <a id="10"></a>10  Relationship between this Act and other Commonwealth laws

                   The provisions of this Act are in addition to, and not in substitution for, the requirements of any other law of the Commonwealth.

##### <a id="11"></a>11  State and Territory laws may operate concurrently

                   This Act is not intended to exclude or limit the operation of a law of a State or Territory to the extent that the law is capable of operating concurrently with this Act.

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Meaning of _corresponding State‑Territory law_

             (1)  For the purposes of this Act, **_corresponding State‑Territory law_** means a law of a State or Territory:

                     (a)  whose operation involves the use of determinations made under section 18 of this Act; and

                     (b)  that is declared by the Commonwealth Minister, in writing, to correspond to this Act;

and includes such a law as amended from time to time.

             (2)  A declaration under paragraph (1)(b) is a legislative instrument for the purposes of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ but neither section 42 of that Act nor Part 6 of that Act applies to the instrument.

##### <a id="13"></a>13  Commonwealth consent to conferral of functions etc. on the Regulator or inspectors by corresponding State‑Territory laws

             (1)  A corresponding State‑Territory law may confer functions or powers, or impose duties, on the Regulator.

Note:          Section 15 sets out when such a law imposes a duty on the Regulator.

             (2)  A corresponding State‑Territory law may confer functions or powers, or impose duties, on WELS inspectors.

Note:          Section 15 sets out when such a law imposes a duty on WELS inspectors.

             (3)  Subsections (1) and (2) do not authorise the conferral of a function or power, or the imposition of a duty, by a corresponding State‑Territory law to the extent to which:

                     (a)  the conferral or imposition, or the authorisation, would contravene any constitutional doctrines restricting the duties that may be imposed on the Regulator or WELS inspectors; or

                     (b)  the authorisation would otherwise exceed the legislative power of the Commonwealth.

             (4)  The Regulator or a WELS inspector cannot perform a duty or function, or exercise a power, under a corresponding State‑Territory law unless the conferral of the function or power, or the imposition of the duty, is in accordance with an agreement between the Commonwealth and the State or Territory concerned.

##### <a id="14"></a>14  How duty is imposed by corresponding State‑Territory laws

Application

             (1)  This section applies if a corresponding State‑Territory law purports to impose a duty on the Regulator or WELS inspectors.

Note:          Section 15 sets out when such a law imposes a duty on the Regulator or WELS inspectors.

State or Territory legislative power sufficient to support duty

             (2)  The duty is taken not to be imposed by this Act (or any other law of the Commonwealth) to the extent to which:

                     (a)  imposing the duty is within the legislative powers of the State or Territory concerned; and

                     (b)  imposing the duty by the law of the State or Territory is consistent with the constitutional doctrines restricting the duties that may be imposed on the Regulator or WELS inspectors.

Note:          If this subsection applies, the duty will be taken to be imposed by force of the law of the State or Territory (the Commonwealth having consented under section 13 to the imposition of the duty by that law).

Commonwealth legislative power sufficient to support duty but State or Territory legislative powers are not

             (3)  If, to ensure the validity of the purported imposition of the duty, it is necessary that the duty be imposed by a law of the Commonwealth (rather than by the law of the State or Territory), the duty is taken to be imposed by this Act to the extent necessary to ensure that validity.

             (4)  If, because of subsection (3), this Act is taken to impose the duty, it is the intention of the Parliament to rely on all powers available to it under the Constitution to support the imposition of the duty by this Act.

             (5)  The duty is taken to be imposed by this Act in accordance with subsection (3) only to the extent to which imposing the duty:

                     (a)  is within the legislative powers of the Commonwealth; and

                     (b)  is consistent with the constitutional doctrines restricting the duties that may be imposed on the Regulator or WELS inspectors.

             (6)  Subsections (1) to (5) do not limit section 13.

##### <a id="15"></a>15  When a corresponding State‑Territory law imposes a duty

                   For the purposes of sections 13 and 14, a corresponding State‑Territory law **_imposes a duty_** on the Regulator or WELS inspectors if:

                     (a)  the law confers a function or power on the Regulator or WELS inspectors; and

                     (b)  the circumstances in which the function or power is conferred give rise to an obligation on the Regulator or WELS inspectors to perform the function or to exercise the power.

##### <a id="16"></a>16  No doubling‑up of liabilities

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  an act or omission is an offence against this Act and is also an offence against a law of a State or Territory; and

                     (b)  the offender has been punished for the offence under the law of the State or Territory;

the offender is not liable to be punished for the offence under this Act.

             (2)  If a person has paid, or been ordered to pay, a pecuniary penalty under a law of a State or Territory, the person is not liable to a pecuniary penalty under this Act in respect of the same conduct.

##### <a id="17"></a>17  Review of decisions under corresponding State‑Territory laws

             (1)  Application may be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of a reviewable State‑Territory decision.

             (2)  A decision made by the Regulator in the performance of a function or the exercise of a power conferred by a corresponding State‑Territory law is a **_reviewable State‑Territory decision_** for the purposes of this section if:

                     (a)  the law under which the decision was made provides for review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal; and

                     (b)  the decision is declared by the regulations to be a reviewable State‑Territory decision for the purposes of this section.

             (3)  For the purposes of this section, the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ has effect as if a corresponding State‑Territory law were an enactment.

## Part 4—WELS products and WELS standards

##### <a id="18"></a>18  WELS products

             (1)  The Commonwealth Minister may, by writing and in accordance with subsection (4), determine that water‑use or water‑saving products of a specified kind are **_WELS products_**.

             (2)  A determination under subsection (1) must set out, or incorporate by reference, the WELS standard for the products.

             (3)  A determination under subsection (1) is a legislative instrument for the purposes of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ and, despite subsection 44(1) of that Act, section 42 of that Act applies to the determination. However, Part 6 of that Act does not apply to the determination.

             (4)  Before making a determination under subsection (1), the Commonwealth Minister must have agreement to the terms of the determination from a majority of the participating States and Territories.

             (5)  A State or Territory is a **_participating State or Territory_** if there is a corresponding State‑Territory law for the State or Territory.

##### <a id="19"></a>19  WELS standards

             (1)  The **_WELS standard_** must set out:

                     (a)  criteria for rating the products in relation to either or both of the following:

                              (i)  water efficiency;

                             (ii)  general performance; and

                     (b)  requirements in relation to communicating such ratings on product labels.

             (2)  The **_WELS standard_** may require the products to be registered for the purposes of specified supplies of the product.

             (3)  If the WELS standard requires the products to be registered, the **_WELS standard_** may also require either or both of the following:

                     (a)  that the products comply with specified minimum water efficiency requirements for the purposes of specified supplies of the product;

                     (b)  that the products comply with specified minimum general performance requirements for the purposes of specified supplies of the product.
