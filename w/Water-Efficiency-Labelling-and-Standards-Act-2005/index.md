                     (b)  imposing the duty by the law of the State or Territory is consistent with the constitutional doctrines restricting the duties that may be imposed on the Regulator or WELS inspectors.

Note:          If this subsection applies, the duty will be taken to be imposed by force of the law of the State or Territory (the Commonwealth having consented under section 13 to the imposition of the duty by that law).

Commonwealth legislative power sufficient to support duty but State or Territory legislative powers are not

             (3)  If, to ensure the validity of the purported imposition of the duty, it is necessary that the duty be imposed by a law of the Commonwealth (rather than by the law of the State or Territory), the duty is taken to be imposed by this Act to the extent necessary to ensure that validity.

             (4)  If, because of subsection (3), this Act is taken to impose the duty, it is the intention of the Parliament to rely on all powers available to it under the Constitution to support the imposition of the duty by this Act.

             (5)  The duty is taken to be imposed by this Act in accordance with subsection (3) only to the extent to which imposing the duty:

                     (a)  is within the legislative powers of the Commonwealth; and

                     (b)  is consistent with the constitutional doctrines restricting the duties that may be imposed on the Regulator or WELS inspectors.

                   For the purposes of sections 13 and 14, a corresponding State‑Territory law **_imposes a duty_** on the Regulator or WELS inspectors if:

                     (a)  the law confers a function or power on the Regulator or WELS inspectors; and

                     (b)  the circumstances in which the function or power is conferred give rise to an obligation on the Regulator or WELS inspectors to perform the function or to exercise the power.

##### <a id="16"></a>16  No doubling‑up of liabilities

             (1)  If:

##### <a id="17"></a>17  Review of decisions under corresponding State‑Territory laws

             (1)  Application may be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of a reviewable State‑Territory decision.

             (2)  A decision made by the Regulator in the performance of a function or the exercise of a power conferred by a corresponding State‑Territory law is a **_reviewable State‑Territory decision_** for the purposes of this section if:

                     (a)  the law under which the decision was made provides for review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal; and

                     (b)  the decision is declared by the regulations to be a reviewable State‑Territory decision for the purposes of this section.

             (3)  For the purposes of this section, the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ has effect as if a corresponding State‑Territory law were an enactment.

             (2)  The Regulator must make the application within 4 years of the alleged contravention.

Court may order person to pay pecuniary penalty

             (3)  If the relevant court is satisfied that the person has contravened the civil penalty provision, the court may order the person to pay to the Commonwealth such pecuniary penalty for the contravention as the court determines to be appropriate.

Note:          Subsection (5) sets out the maximum penalty that the court may order the person to pay.

##### <a id="44B"></a>44B  Civil enforcement of penalty

             (1)  A pecuniary penalty is a debt payable to the Commonwealth.

             (2)  The Commonwealth may enforce a civil penalty order as if it were an order made in civil proceedings against the person to recover a debt due by the person. The debt arising from the order is taken to be a judgement debt.

##### <a id="44C"></a>44C  Conduct contravening more than one civil penalty provision

             (1)  If conduct constitutes a contravention of 2 or more civil penalty provisions, proceedings may be instituted under this Part against a person in relation to the contravention of any one or more of those provisions.

##### <a id="44D"></a>44D  Multiple contraventions

             (1)  A relevant court may make a single civil penalty order against a person for multiple contraventions of a civil penalty provision if proceedings for the contraventions are founded on the same facts, or if the contraventions form, or are part of, a series of contraventions of the same or a similar character.

##### <a id="44H"></a>44H  Civil proceedings after criminal proceedings

                   A relevant court may not make a civil penalty order against a person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision if the person has been convicted of an offence constituted by conduct that is the same, or substantially the same, as the conduct constituting the contravention.

##### <a id="44J"></a>44J  Criminal proceedings during civil proceedings

                     (a)  the civil proceedings are dismissed; and

(b)  costs must not be awarded in relation to the civil proceedings.

##### <a id="44K"></a>44K  Criminal proceedings after civil proceedings

                   Criminal proceedings may be commenced against a person for conduct that is the same, or substantially the same, as conduct that would constitute a contravention of a civil penalty provision regardless of whether a civil penalty order has been made against the person in relation to the contravention.

##### <a id="44L"></a>44L  Evidence given in civil proceedings not admissible in criminal proceedings

             (1)  Evidence of information given, or evidence of production of documents by an individual, is not admissible in criminal proceedings against the individual if:

                     (a)  the individual previously gave the evidence or produced the documents in proceedings for a civil penalty order against the individual for an alleged contravention of a civil penalty provision (whether or not the order was made); and

                     (b)  the conduct alleged to constitute the offence is the same, or substantially the same, as the conduct alleged to constitute the contravention.

             (2)  However, subsection (1) does not apply to criminal proceedings in relation to the falsity of the evidence given by the individual in the proceedings for the civil penalty order.

### Division 3—Miscellaneous

##### <a id="44M"></a>44M  Ancillary contravention of civil penalty provisions

                     (e)  conspire with others to effect a contravention of a civil penalty provision.

Note:          Section 44Q (which provides that a person’s state of mind does not need to be proven in relation to a civil penalty provision) does not apply to subsection (1) of this section.

Civil penalty

             (2)  A person who contravenes subsection (1) in relation to a civil penalty provision is taken to have contravened the provision.

##### <a id="44N"></a>44N  Continuing contraventions of civil penalty provisions

             (1)  If an act or thing is required under a civil penalty provision to be done:

                     (a)  within a particular period; or

                     (b)  before a particular time;

then the obligation to do that act or thing continues until the act or thing is done (even if the period has expired or the time has passed).

             (2)  A person who contravenes a civil penalty provision that requires an act or thing to be done:

                     (a)  within a particular period; or

                     (b)  before a particular time;

commits a separate contravention of that provision in respect of each day during which the contravention occurs (including the day the relevant civil penalty order is made or any later day).

##### <a id="44P"></a>44P  Mistake of fact

             (1)  A person is not liable to have a civil penalty order made against the person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision if:

                     (a)  at or before the time of the conduct constituting the contravention, the person:

                              (i)  considered whether or not facts existed; and

                             (ii)  was under a mistaken but reasonable belief about those facts; and

                     (b)  had those facts existed, the conduct would not have constituted a contravention of the civil penalty provision.

             (2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), a person may be regarded as having considered whether or not facts existed if:

                     (a)  the person had considered, on a previous occasion, whether those facts existed in the circumstances surrounding that occasion; and

                     (b)  the person honestly and reasonably believed that the circumstances surrounding the present occasion were the same, or substantially the same, as those surrounding the previous occasion.

             (3)  A person who wishes to rely on subsection (1) or (2) in proceedings for a civil penalty order bears an evidential burden in relation to that matter.

##### <a id="44Q"></a>44Q  State of mind

             (1)  In proceedings for a civil penalty order against a person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision (other than section 32A or subsection 44M(1)), it is not necessary to prove:

Authority of warrant

             (9)  A form of warrant duly completed under subsection (6) is authority for the same powers as are authorised by the warrant signed by the magistrate.
