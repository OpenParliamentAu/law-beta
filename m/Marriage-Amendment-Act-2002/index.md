##### <a id="39I"></a>39I  Disciplinary measures

             (1)  The Registrar of Marriage Celebrants may only take disciplinary measures against a marriage celebrant if the Registrar:

                     (e)  is satisfied that the marriage celebrant’s application for registration was known by the marriage celebrant to be false or misleading in a material particular.

             (2)  The only disciplinary measures that the Registrar may take against a marriage celebrant are to:

                     (a)  caution the marriage celebrant in writing; or

                     (b)  in accordance with regulations made for the purposes of this paragraph, require the marriage celebrant to undertake professional development activities determined in writing by the Registrar; or

                     (c)  suspend the marriage celebrant’s registration for a period (the **_suspension period_**) of up to 6 months by annotating the register of marriage celebrants to include:

                              (i)  a statement that the registration is suspended; and

             (4)  If the Registrar decides to take disciplinary measures against a marriage celebrant, the Registrar:

                     (a)  must give the marriage celebrant written notice of:

                     (b)  to suspend a person’s registration as a marriage celebrant; or

                     (c)  to deregister a marriage celebrant.

             (2)  For the purposes of both the making of an application under subsection (1) and the operation of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ in relation to such an application, if:

                     (a)  a person has made application for registration as a marriage celebrant under section 39D; and

                     (b)  at the end of 3 months after the day on which the application was made, the person has not been:

                              (i)  registered; or

                             (ii)  notified by the Registrar that that person’s application has been refused;

the Registrar is taken to have decided, on the last day of the 3 month period, not to register that person as a marriage celebrant.

             (3)  The Registrar must take such action as is necessary to give effect to the Tribunal’s decision (even if doing so at the time the action is taken would cause a breach of a limit under section 39E).

##### <a id="39K"></a>39K  Additional functions of the Registrar

                   The Registrar of Marriage Celebrants must:

                     (a)  amend the register of marriage celebrants in accordance with regulations made for the purposes of this paragraph; and

                     (d)  perform any additional functions specified in regulations made for the purposes of this paragraph.

##### <a id="39L"></a>39L  Registrar not liable for damages

                     (a)  the exercise or performance; or

                     (b)  the purported exercise or performance;

of powers or functions under this Act.

##### <a id="39M"></a>39M  Evidence of registration etc.

                     (b)  a person’s registration as a marriage celebrant was suspended; or
