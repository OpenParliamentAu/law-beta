 Upon any kind of goods and merchandises, and also upon the body, tackle, apparel, ordnance, munition, artillery, boat, and other furniture, of and in the good ship or vessel called the	whereof is master under God, for this present voyage,	or whosoever else shall go for master in the said ship, or by whatsoever other name or names the said ship, or the master thereof, is or shall be named or called; beginning the adventure upon the said goods and merchandises from the loading thereof aboard the said ship,
 upon the said ship, &amp;c.
 and so shall continue and endure, during her abode there, upon the said ship, &amp;c.,
 and further, until the said ship, with all her ordnance, tackle, apparel, &amp;c.,

And it shall be lawful for the said ship, &amp;c., in this voyage, to proceed and sail to and touch and stay at any ports or places whatsoever
 without prejudice to this insurance. The said ship, &amp;c., goods and merchandises, &amp;c., for so much as concerns the assured by agreement between the assured and assurers in this policy, are and shall be valued at
 Touching the adventures and perils which we the assurers are contented to bear and do take upon us in this voyage: they are of the seas, men of war, fire, enemies, pirates, rovers, thieves, jettisons, letters of mart and countermart, surprisals, takings at sea, arrests, restraints, and detainments of all kings, princes, and people, of what nation, condition, or quality soever, barratry of the master and mariners, and of all other perils, losses, and misfortunes, that have or shall come to the hurt, detriment, or damage of the said goods, and merchandises, and ship, &amp;c., or any part thereof And in the case of any loss or misfortune it shall be lawful to the assured, their factors, servants and assigns, to sue, labour, and travel for, in and about the defence, safeguards, and recovery of the said goods and merchandises, and ship, &amp;c., or any part thereof,\[(a)] without prejudice to this insurance; to the charges whereof we, the assurers, will contribute each one according to the rate and quantity of his sum herein assured.\[(b)] And it is especially declared and agreed that no acts of the insurer or insured in recovering, saving, or preserving the property insured shall be considered as a waiver, or acceptance of abandonment. And it is agreed by us, the insurers, that this writing or policy of assurance shall be of as much force and effect as the surest writing or policy of assurance heretofore made in Lombard-street, or in the Royal Exchange, or elsewhere in London. And so we, the assurers, are contented, and do hereby promise and bind ourselves, each one for his own part, our heirs, executors, and goods to the assured, their executors, administrators, and assigns, for the true performance of the premises, confessing ourselves paid the consideration due unto us for this assurance by the assured, at and after the rate of
 IN WITNESS whereof we, the assurers, have subscribed our names and sums assured in London.
 \[Memorandum.]
 _N.B._&#151;Corn, fish, salt, fruit, flour, and seed are warranted free from average, unless general, or the ship be stranded&#151;sugar, tobacco, hemp, flax, hides and skins are warranted free from average, under five per centum, and all other goods also the ship and freight, are warranted free from average, under three per centum unless general, or the ship be stranded.
 <center>RULES FOR CONSTRUCTION OF POLICY</center>
 _The following are the rules referred to by this Act for the construction of a policy in the above or other like form, where the context does not otherwise require_:
 Lost or not lost
 1.	Where the subject-matter is insured "lost or not lost" , and the loss has occurred before the contract is concluded, the risk attaches unless, at such time, the assured was aware of the loss, and the insurer was not.
 From
 2.	Where the subject-matter is insured "from" a particular place, the risk does not attach until the ship starts on the voyage insured.
 At and from
 \[Ship.]
 3	(a)	Where a ship is insured "at and from" a particular place, and she is at that place in good safety when the contract is concluded, the risk attaches immediately.
 	(b)	If she be not at that place when the contract is concluded the risk attaches as soon as she arrives there in good safety, and, unless the policy otherwise provides, it is immaterial that she is covered by another policy for a specified time after arrival.
 \[Freight.]
 	(c)	Where chartered freight is insured "at and from" a particular place and the ship is at that place in good safety, when the contract is concluded the 
<center>Back to Top</center>
 risk attaches immediately. If she be not there when the contract is concluded, the risk attaches as soon as she arrives there in good safety.
 	(d)	Where freight, other than chartered freight, is payable without special conditions and is insured "at and from" a particular place, the risk attaches _pro rata_ as the goods or merchandise are shipped; provided that if there be cargo in readiness which belongs to the ship-owner, or which some other person has contracted with him to ship, the risk attaches as soon as the ship is ready to receive such cargo.
 From the loading thereof
 4.	Where goods or other movables are insured "from the loading thereof," the risk does not attach until such goods or movables are actually on board, and the insurer is not liable for them while in transit from the shore to the ship.
 Safely landed 
 5.	Where the risk on goods or other movables continues until they are "safely  landed," they must be landed in the customary manner and within a reasonable time after arrival at the port of discharge, and if they are not so landed the risk ceases.
 Touch and stay
 6.	In the absence of any further licence or usage, the liberty to touch and stay "at any port or place whatsoever" does not authorize the ship to depart from the course of her voyage from the port of departure to the port of destination.
 Perils of the seas
 7.	The term"perils of the seas" refers only to fortuitous accidents or casualties of the seas. It does not include the ordinary action of the winds and waves.
 Pirates 
 8.	The term "pirates" includes passengers who mutiny and rioters who attack the ship from the shore.
 Thieves
 9.	The term "thieves" does not cover clandestine theft or a theft committed by any one of the ship's company, whether crew or passengers.
 Restraint of princes
 10	The term "arrest, &amp;c., of kings, princes, and people" refers to political or executive acts, and does not include a loss caused by riot or by ordinary judicial process.
 Barratry
 11	The term "barratry" includes every wrongful act wilfully committed by the master or crew to the prejudice of the owner, or, as the case may be, the charterer.
 All other perils
 12.	The term "all other perils" includes only perils similar in kind to the perils specifically mentioned in the policy.
 Average unless general
 13.	The term "average unless general" means a partial loss of the subject-matter insured other than a general average loss, and does not include "particular  charges."
 Stranded
 14.	Where the ship has stranded, the insurer is liable for the excepted losses, although the loss is not attributable to the stranding, provided that when the stranding takes place the risk has attached and, if the policy be on goods, that the damaged goods are on board.
 Ship
 15.	The term "ship" includes the hull, materials and outfit, stores and provisions for the officers and crew, and, in the case of vessels engaged in a special trade, the ordinary fittings requisite for the trade, and also, in the case of a steam-ship, the machinery, boilers, and coals and engine stores, if owned by the assured.
 Freight
 16.	The term "freight" includes the profit derivable by a ship-owner from the employment of his ship to carry his own goods or movables, as well as freight payable by a third party, but does not include passage money.
 Goods
 17.	The term "goods" means goods in the nature of merchandise, and does not include personal effects or provisions and stores for use on board.
 	In the absence of any usage to the contrary, deck cargo and living animals must be insured specifically, and not under the general denomination of goods.
