                     (a)  an undertaking by the foreign regulator to the effect that information or evidence obtained from the person and provided to the foreign regulator under this Act:

                              (i)  will not be used for the purposes of criminal proceedings against the person or of proceedings against the person for the imposition of a penalty; and

                             (ii)  to the extent to which it is within the ability of the foreign regulator to ensure it, will not be used by any other person, authority or agency for the purposes of any such proceedings; and

                     (b)  such information in relation to the request as is required by the regulations.

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Commonwealth regulator’s consideration of requests

             (1)  Subject to subsection 6(2), a Commonwealth regulator that has received a foreign request must, in writing:

                     (a)  inform the Minister that the Commonwealth regulator:

                              (i)  does not oppose the request; or

                             (ii)  does not oppose the request subject to conditions specified by the Commonwealth regulator being imposed in relation to the providing of anything in compliance with the request and the giving by the foreign regulator of any undertakings so specified for the purpose of ensuring compliance with any such conditions; or

                     (b)  refuse the request.

             (2)  Conditions mentioned in subparagraph (1)(a)(ii) may include (but need not be limited to) conditions relating to any or all of the following:

                     (a)  maintaining the confidentiality of anything provided in compliance with the request, in particular, information that is personal information within the meaning of the _Privacy Act 1988_;

                     (b)  the storing of, use of, or access to, any such thing;

                     (c)  copying, returning or disposing, of copies of documents provided in compliance with the request.

             (3)  When considering what action to take in relation to the request, the Commonwealth regulator is to take into account the following matters and any other matters that the Commonwealth regulator thinks relevant:

                     (a)  whether the Commonwealth regulator is likely to be able to obtain the requested information, documents or evidence;

                     (b)  the cost to the Commonwealth regulator of complying with the request;

                     (c)  whether the foreign regulator could more conveniently have the request satisfied from another source;

                     (d)  the extent to which the functions of the foreign regulator correspond with the functions of the Commonwealth regulator;

                     (e)  whether the foreign regulator would be likely to comply with a similar request made by the Commonwealth regulator and whether any arrangement with the foreign regulator to that effect exists;

                      (f)  whether, in the opinion of the Commonwealth regulator, it would be more appropriate for the request to be dealt with under the Mutual Assistance in _Criminal Matters Act 1987_.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Minister’s consideration of matter

             (1)  If the Commonwealth regulator informs the Minister as mentioned in subparagraph 7(1)(a)(i) or (ii), the Minister must, in writing:

                     (a)  authorise the obtaining of the information, documents or evidence, as the case may be, from the person in compliance with the request; or

                     (b)  refuse the request.

             (2)  In considering action under this section or subsection 9(2) in relation to the request, the Minister is to take into account the following matters and any other matters that he or she thinks relevant:

                     (a)  whether it is in Australia’s national interest to comply with the request;

                     (b)  whether complying with the request is consistent with international law and international comity;

                     (c)  whether anything provided in compliance with the request is likely to be used for punishing a person for an offence of a political character;

                     (d)  whether anything provided in compliance with the request is likely to be used for prosecuting, punishing or otherwise harming a person because of the person’s race, sex, religion, nationality or political opinions;

                     (e)  whether it would be more appropriate for the request to be dealt with under the _Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987_.

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Conditions etc. relevant to an authorisation

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), if:

                     (a)  the Commonwealth regulator, in relation to a foreign request, has informed the Minister as mentioned in subparagraph 7(1)(a)(ii); and

                     (b)  the Minister gives an authorisation under section 8 in relation to the request;

the authorisation is subject to compliance with any conditions and the giving of any undertaking specified by the Commonwealth regulator.

             (2)  In giving an authorisation under section 8, the Minister may:

                     (a)  impose conditions or further conditions subject to which anything may be provided in compliance with the request; and

                     (b)  require undertakings to be given by the foreign regulator to ensure compliance with any such conditions; and

                     (c)  omit or vary any condition or undertaking to which the authorisation would, under subsection (1), otherwise be subject.

             (3)  An authorisation under section 8 that is subject to compliance with conditions or the giving of undertakings (including conditions or undertakings imposed or required under subsection (2)) must specify those conditions and any such undertaking.

##### <a id="10"></a>10  Taking of evidence etc.

             (1)  Where the Minister gives an authorisation under section 8, the following provisions of this section apply.

             (2)  The Commonwealth regulator may, by written notice served on the person to whom the authorisation relates, require the person:

                     (a)  to give to the Commonwealth regulator, by instrument signed by the person or, in the case of a body corporate, by a competent officer of the body corporate, within the time and in the manner specified in the notice, information to which the foreign request relates; or

                     (b)  to produce to the Commonwealth regulator, or to a person specified in the notice acting on behalf of the Commonwealth regulator, in accordance with the notice, documents to which the foreign request relates; or

                     (c)  to appear before a person specified in the notice acting on behalf of the Commonwealth regulator, at a time and place specified in the notice, to give evidence to which the foreign request relates, either orally or in writing, and produce any such documents.

             (3)  In addition to such information, documents or evidence, an authorisation under section 8 extends to any other information, documents or evidence that, in the opinion of the Commonwealth regulator, is relevant to the matter to which the foreign request relates.

             (4)  A person mentioned in paragraph (2)(c) may require the evidence mentioned in that paragraph to be given on oath or affirmation and for that purpose the person may administer an oath or affirmation.

##### <a id="11 "></a>11  Appearance to be in private

             (1)  An appearance for the purpose of giving evidence by a person in accordance with a requirement under section 10 is to take place in private and may be attended only by a person mentioned in subsection (2).

##### <a id="14"></a>14  Self-incrimination

             (1)  For the purposes of subsection 13(1A), it is not a reasonable excuse for a person to refuse or fail to give information or evidence, or to produce documents, in accordance with a requirement under section 10, that the information, evidence or production of the documents might tend to incriminate the person or make the person liable to a penalty.

             (2)  Subsection (3) applies if:

                     (a)  before giving information or evidence in accordance with such a requirement, a person claims that the information or evidence might tend to incriminate the person or make the person liable to a penalty; and

             (2)  The lawyer is entitled to refuse to comply with the requirement unless:

                     (a)  if the person to whom, or by or on behalf of whom, the communication was made is a body corporate that is under official management or being wound up—the official manager or liquidator of the body; or

                     (b)  otherwise—the person to whom, or by or on behalf of whom, the communication was made; consents to the lawyer complying with the requirement.

             (3)  If the lawyer so refuses, he or she must, as soon as practicable, give to the person who made the requirement a written notice setting out:

                   A person taking evidence under this Act is to cause the evidence to be put in writing and certify that the evidence was taken by the person.

##### <a id="18"></a>18  Evidence etc. to be sent to foreign regulator

             (1)  Subject to this section, if a person complies with a requirement by a Commonwealth regulator under section 10, the Commonwealth regulator must:

                     (a)  in the case of the giving of information—send the information, or a copy of the information certified by the Commonwealth regulator to be a true copy, to the foreign regulator by whom the relevant foreign request was made; or

                     (b)  in the case of the production of documents—send copies of the documents certified by the Commonwealth regulator to be true copies to that foreign regulator; or

                     (c)  in the case of the taking of evidence—send the evidence, as put in writing and certified by the person taking it, to that foreign regulator.

             (2)  The Commonwealth regulator may send information, evidence or copies of documents (in this section called the **_requested material_**) to the foreign regulator in such form, and may edit or otherwise organise the requested material, as seems to the Commonwealth regulator to be appropriate in the circumstances.

             (3)  The Commonwealth regulator may refuse to cause the requested material to be transmitted to the foreign regulator or may cause part only of the material to be so transmitted if, upon examination of the material, it appears to the Commonwealth regulator for any reason to be appropriate to do so.

             (4)  Where an authorisation under section 8 specifies an undertaking to be given by a foreign regulator, the requested material must not be transmitted to the foreign regulator until the undertaking is given.

## Part 3—Miscellaneous

##### <a id="19"></a>19  Act not to limit other provision of assistance

                   Nothing in this Act prevents the obtaining for, or transmitting to, a foreign regulator of information, evidence or copies of documents otherwise than as mentioned in this Act if, apart from this Act, the information, evidence or copies would be lawfully so obtained or transmitted.
