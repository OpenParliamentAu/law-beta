          (1A)  A request by a foreign country for assistance under this Act must be refused if it relates to the prosecution or punishment of a person charged with, or convicted of, an offence in respect of which the death penalty may be imposed in the foreign country, unless the Attorney‑General is of the opinion, having regard to the special circumstances of the case, that the assistance requested should be granted.

                     (b)  the request relates to the prosecution or punishment of a person in respect of an act or omission that occurred, or is alleged to have occurred, outside the foreign country and a similar act or omission occurring outside Australia in similar circumstances would not have constituted an offence against Australian law; or

                     (c)  the request relates to the prosecution or punishment of a person in respect of an act or omission where, if it had occurred in Australia at the same time and had constituted an offence against Australian law, the person responsible could no longer be prosecuted by reason of lapse of time or any other reason; or

                     (d)  the provision of the assistance could prejudice an investigation or proceeding in relation to a criminal matter in Australia; or

                     (b)  proceeds or an instrument of the offence, or a property‑tracking document in relation to the offence, is reasonably suspected of being located in Australia; and

                     (c)  the foreign country requests the Attorney‑General to obtain the issue of a search warrant relating to the proceeds, instrument or document;

             (2)  The State or Territory specified must be a State or Territory in which:

                     (a)  the proceeds, or some or all of the proceeds, are reasonably suspected of being located; or

                     (b)  the instrument is, or some or all of the instruments are, reasonably suspected of being located; or

                     (c)  the document is, or some or all of the documents are, reasonably suspected of being located.

##### <a id="34ZB"></a>34ZB  Applying for and issuing search warrants

             (1)  If so authorised, the authorised officer may apply for such a search warrant, in relation to those proceeds, that instrument or that document, in respect of the offence.

             (2)  Part 3‑5 of the Proceeds of Crime Act applies to the application, and to any search warrant issued as a result.

             (3)  It applies as if:

                     (a)  references in that Part to a property‑tracking document were references to a property‑tracking document relating to the offence; and

                     (b)  references in that Part to a magistrate were references to a magistrate of the State or Territory specified in the authorised officer’s authorisation under subsection 34ZA(1); and

                     (c)  paragraph 228(1)(d) and sections 256 to 258 of that Act were omitted.

##### <a id="34ZC"></a>34ZC  Seizure of other property and documents

             (1)  A search warrant issued under Part 3‑5 of the Proceeds of Crime Act in relation to a foreign serious offence authorises an authorised officer to seize property or a thing that he or she finds and that he or she believes on reasonable grounds to be:

                     (a)  proceeds or an instrument of the offence or a property‑tracking document in relation to the offence, although not of the kind specified in the warrant; or

                     (b)  proceeds or an instrument of, or a property‑tracking document in relation to, another foreign serious offence in relation to which a search warrant issued under that Part is in force; or

                     (c)  something that:

                              (i)  is relevant to a criminal proceeding in the foreign country in respect of the foreign serious offence; or

                             (ii)  will afford evidence as to the commission of an Australian criminal offence.

             (2)  However, this section only applies if the authorised officer believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary to seize the property or thing in order to prevent its concealment, loss or destruction or its use in committing an offence.

##### <a id="34ZD"></a>34ZD  Return of seized property to third parties

             (1)  A person who claims an interest in property (other than a property‑tracking document) that has been seized under a search warrant issued under Part 3‑5 of the Proceeds of Crime Act in relation to a foreign serious offence may apply to a court for an order that the property be returned to the person.

             (2)  The court must be a court of the State or Territory in which the warrant was issued that has proceeds jurisdiction.

             (3)  The court must order the head of the authorised officer’s enforcement agency to return the property to the applicant if the court is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the applicant is entitled to possession of the property; and

                     (b)  the property is not proceeds or an instrument of the relevant foreign serious offence; and

                     (c)  the person who is believed or alleged to have committed the relevant foreign serious offence has no interest in the property.

             (4)  If the court makes such an order, the head of the authorised officer’s enforcement agency must arrange for the property to be returned to the applicant.

             (5)  This section does not apply to property that has been seized because it may afford evidence as to the commission of an Australian criminal offence.

##### <a id="34ZE"></a>34ZE  Dealing with seized property (other than property‑tracking documents)

             (1)  Property (other than a property‑tracking document) must be dealt with in accordance with this section if:

the head of the enforcement agency whose authorised officer seized the property:

                     (c)  if there is in force, at the end of that period, a direction by a court that the Official Trustee take custody and control of the property—must arrange for the property to be given to the Official Trustee in accordance with the direction; or

                     (d)  if there is in force at the end of that period an order under subsection (6) in relation to the property—must arrange for the property to be retained until it is dealt with in accordance with another provision of this Act or the Proceeds of Crime Act.

             (4)  If the property is subject to a direction of a kind referred to in paragraph (3)(c), the Proceeds of Crime Act applies to the property as if it were controlled property within the meaning of that Act.

Retaining property despite restraining orders

                     (b)  a restraining order has been made under Subdivision B in respect of the property in relation to the foreign serious offence;

             (6)  If the court is satisfied that the head of the enforcement agency requires the property to be dealt with in accordance with:

                     (a)  a request under section 34 that the restraining order be registered; or

                     (b)  a request under section 34J that the restraining order be obtained;

Effect of foreign forfeiture orders being registered or obtained

             (7)  If, while the property is in the possession of the head of the enforcement agency whose authorised officer seized it, a foreign forfeiture order in respect of the property is registered in a court under Subdivision A, the head of the enforcement agency must deal with the property as required by the forfeiture order.

##### <a id="34ZF"></a>34ZF  Dealing with seized property‑tracking documents

             (1)  An authorised officer who takes possession of a property‑tracking document under a warrant issued in respect of a foreign serious offence may retain the document for a period not exceeding one month pending a written direction from the Attorney‑General as to how to deal with the document.

             (2)  Directions from the Attorney‑General may include a direction that the document be sent to an authority of the foreign country that requested the issue of the warrant.

## Schedule 3

## 3  At the end of section 35J

Add:

             (4)  Subsection 73(2) of the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_ applies to the charge (to the extent, if any, to which that Act applies in relation to the property charged).

Note 1:       The effect of this subsection is that the priority between the charge and a security interest in the property to which the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_ applies is to be determined in accordance with this Act rather than the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_.

Note 2:       Subsection 73(2) of the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_ applies to charges created by this section after the commencement of subsection (4) (which is at the registration commencement time within the meaning of the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_).

## 4  Subsection 35L(4) (definition of _registration authority_)

Repeal the definition, substitute:

                    <a name="registr-author"></a>**_registration authority_**, in relation to property of a particular kind, means:

                     (a)  an authority responsible for administering a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory providing for registration of title to, or charges over, property of that kind; or

                     (b)  the Registrar of Personal Property Securities, if the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_ provides for the registration of data in relation to that kind of personal property for the purposes of paragraph 148(c) of that Act.

Note:       The _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_ provides for the registration of such data if regulations are made for the purposes of paragraph 148(c) of that Act.

As at 7 March 2011 the amendments are not incorporated in this compilation.

                     (b)  making provision to the effect that that Act applies to a country, or to a number of countries, subject to such limitations, conditions, exceptions or qualifications as are necessary to give effect, in whole or in part, to a particular mutual assistance treaty;

continue in force on and after the commencement of that item, and may be amended or repealed, as if they were regulations made under subsection 7(2) of that Act as amended by that item.
