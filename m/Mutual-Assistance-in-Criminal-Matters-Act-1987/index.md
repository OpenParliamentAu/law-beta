                             (ii)  a related foreign serious offence; and

                     (c)  the foreign pecuniary penalty order has been registered under Subdivision A of Division 2;

the registration of the foreign restraining order or the foreign pecuniary penalty order (whichever last occurs) creates, by force of this section, a charge on the property to secure the payment of an amount to the Commonwealth.

             (2)  The amount is to be the amount that would be the penalty amount under the Proceeds of Crime Act if the foreign pecuniary penalty order were a pecuniary penalty order under that Act.

             (3)  The charge:

Note 1:       The effect of this subsection is that the priority between the charge and a security interest in the property to which the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_ applies is to be determined in accordance with this Act rather than the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_.

Note 2:       Subsection 73(2) of the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_ applies to charges created by this section after the commencement of subsection (4) (which is at the registration commencement time within the meaning of the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_).

##### <a id="35K"></a>35K  When the charge ceases to have effect

                   The charge ceases to have effect in respect of the property on the earliest of the following events:

                     (b)  the sale or other disposition of the property:

                              (i)  under an order under subsection 35F(3); or

                             (ii)  by the owner of the property with the consent of the court in which the foreign pecuniary penalty order is registered; or

                            (iii)  if an order under section 35 ordered the Official Trustee to take control of the property—by the owner of the property with the consent of the Official Trustee;

                     (c)  the sale of the property to a purchaser in good faith for value who, at the time of purchase, has no notice of the charge;

                     (d)  the cancellation of the registration of the relevant foreign restraining order or foreign pecuniary penalty order under section 34G.

##### <a id="35L"></a>35L  Registering charges

             (1)  A registration authority that keeps a register of property of a particular kind may record in the register a charge created by section 35J on property of that kind.

             (2)  The registration authority may only do so on the application of the proceeds of crime authority authorised under section 34 or the Official Trustee.

             (3)  Each person who subsequently deals with the property is taken to have notice of the charge for the purposes of paragraph 35K(c).

             (4)  In this section:

                    <a name="registr-author"></a>**_registration authority_**, in relation to property of a particular kind, means:

                     (a)  an authority responsible for administering a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory providing for registration of title to, or charges over, property of that kind; or

                     (b)  the Registrar of Personal Property Securities, if the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_ provides for the registration of data in relation to that kind of personal property for the purposes of paragraph 148(c) of that Act.

Note:       The _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_ provides for the registration of such data if regulations are made for the purposes of paragraph 148(c) of that Act.

##### <a id="35M"></a>35M  When order ceases to be in force

                   A foreign restraining order registered under Subdivision A of Division 2 ceases to be in force when the registration is cancelled under section 34G.
