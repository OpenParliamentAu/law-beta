                              (i)  relates to an incident that occurs in the course of, or in connection with, the person’s practice as an eligible midwife; and

                             (ii)  has been certified as a qualifying claim; and

##### <a id="10"></a>10  Level 1 and Level 2 claim thresholds

Level 1 claim threshold

             (1)  The **_Level 1 claim threshold_** is:

                     (a)  $100,000; or

                     (b)  such other amount as is specified in the Rules for the purposes of this paragraph.

Note:          Claims cannot be aggregated to reach the Level 1 claim threshold: see paragraph 11(3)(j).

Level 2 claim threshold

                     (a)  $2 million; or

                     (b)  such other amount as is specified in the Rules for the purposes of this paragraph.

Note:          Claims cannot be aggregated to reach the Level 2 claim threshold: see paragraph 11(3)(j).

             (3)  A Rule specifying an amount as the Level 1 claim threshold (or changing the amount previously so specified) only applies in relation to a payment made or payable under a contract of insurance entered into, or renewed, after the Rule takes effect.

             (4)  A Rule specifying an amount as the Level 2 claim threshold (or changing the amount previously so specified) only applies in relation to a contract of insurance entered into, or renewed, at the time or after the Rule takes effect.

             (5)  A Rule changing the Level 1 claim threshold or Level 2 claim threshold (which could be the threshold originally applicable under subsection (1) or (2), or that threshold as already changed by Rules) takes effect on the date specified in the Rules, which must be the date on which the Rules are entered on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments or a later day.

### Division 2—Certification

##### <a id="11"></a>11  When may the Chief Executive Medicare certify a claim as a qualifying claim?

Criteria for certification—Level 1

             (1)  The Chief Executive Medicare may issue a certificate stating that a claim is a Level 1 qualifying claim if the Chief Executive Medicare is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the claim meets the common requirements set out in subsection (3); and

                     (b)  a person has applied for a Level 1 qualifying claim certificate in relation to the claim in accordance with section 12.

Criteria for certification—Level 2

             (2)  The Chief Executive Medicare may issue a certificate stating that a claim is a Level 2 qualifying claim if the Chief Executive Medicare is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the claim meets the common requirements set out in subsection (3); and

                     (b)  the claim meets the additional Level 2 requirements set out in subsection (4); and

                     (c)  a person has applied for a Level 2 qualifying claim certificate in relation to the claim in accordance with section 12.

Common requirements for both Level 1 and Level 2 qualifying claim certificates

             (3)  A claim in relation to which an application for a Level 1 or Level 2 qualifying claim certificate has been made meets the **_common requirements_** set out in this subsection if:

                     (a)  the claim is or was made against a person (the **_midwife_**); and

                     (b)  the claim relates to an incident that occurs or occurred in the course of, or in connection with, the midwife’s practice as an eligible midwife; and

                     (c)  there is a contract of insurance entered into by an eligible insurer that provides midwife professional indemnity cover in relation to the claim; and

                     (d)  except in the circumstances specified in Rules made for the purposes of this paragraph, the incident occurs or occurred in Australia or an external Territory; and

                     (e)  the claim does not relate to an incident that occurs or occurred in the course of, or in connection with, the provision of treatment of a public patient of a hospital; and

                      (f)  the claim does not relate to an incident that occurs or occurred in the course of, or in connection with, practice of a kind for which:

                              (i)  the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; or

                             (ii)  a local governing body; or

                            (iii)  an authority established under a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory;

                            indemnifies eligible midwives from liability relating to compensation; and

                     (g)  the claim does not relate to an incident that occurs or occurred in the course of, or in connection with, practice of a kind in relation to which eligible midwives are ordinarily, or could reasonably be expected in the ordinary course of business to be, engaged as employees (and therefore indemnified from liability by their employer); and

                     (h)  if the application is for a Level 1 qualifying claim certificate, the incident occurs or occurred:

                              (i)  on or after 1 July 2010; and

                             (ii)  on or before the Level 1 termination date (if any); and

                      (i)  if the application is for a Level 2 qualifying claim certificate the incident occurs or occurred:

                              (i)  on or after 1 July 2010; and

                             (ii)  on or before the Level 2 termination date (if any); and

                      (j)  the claim is not in substance an aggregation of two or more separate claims against the midwife; and

                     (k)  the claim is not a claim included in a class specified in Rules made for the purposes of this paragraph; and

                      (l)  the claim does not relate to an incident of a kind specified in Rules made for the purposes of this paragraph; and

                    (m)  the claim does not relate to a type of midwifery practice specified in Rules made for the purposes of this paragraph.

          (3A)  For the purposes of paragraph 11(3)(g), the Rules may specify one or more classes of practice that are taken not to be practice of a kind referred to in that paragraph and, without limiting the way in which a class may be specified, the class may be described by reference to the following:

                     (a)  the ownership or control (however described) of a corporation of which one or more eligible midwives are employees;

                     (b)  the true nature of the class of practice.

          (3B)  To avoid doubt, Rules made for the purposes of subsection (3A) may be expressed to take effect from a date before the Rules are registered under the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_.

Additional requirements for Level 2 qualifying claim certificates

             (4)  A claim in relation to which an application for a Level 2 qualifying claim certificate has been made meets the **_additional Level 2 requirements_** set out in this subsection if:

                     (a)  there is a contract of insurance entered into by an eligible insurer in relation to which the following requirements are satisfied:

                              (i)  the contract provides midwife professional indemnity cover for the eligible midwife in relation to the claim, or would, but for the limit of the eligible insurer’s liability under the contract in relation to a particular claim against the eligible midwife, provide such cover for the midwife in relation to the claim;

                             (ii)  the limit of the eligible insurer’s liability under the contract, in relation to each claim against the midwife, equals or exceeds the Level 2 claim threshold;

                            (iii)  the eligible insurer is a general insurer, within the meaning of the _Insurance Act 1973_;

                            (iv)  the eligible insurer entered into the contract in the ordinary course of the eligible insurer’s business; and

                     (b)  the contract of insurance is not a contract included in a class specified in Rules made for the purposes of this paragraph.

When a certificate is in force

             (5)  The certificate comes into force when it is issued and remains in force until it is revoked.

Matters to be identified or specified in certificate

             (6)  The certificate must:

                     (a)  identify:

                              (i)  the midwife; and

                             (ii)  the claim; and

                            (iii)  if the certificate is a Level 2 qualifying claim certificate—the contract of insurance that provides midwife professional indemnity cover for the midwife; and

                     (b)  specify the Level 1 claim threshold or the Level 2 claim threshold, as the case requires.

The certificate may also contain other material.

AAT review of decision to refuse

             (7)  An application may be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of a decision of the Chief Executive Medicare to refuse to issue a qualifying claim certificate.

Note:          Section 27A of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ requires notification of a decision that is reviewable.

Chief Executive Medicare to give applicant copy of certificate

             (8)  If the Chief Executive Medicare decides to issue a qualifying claim certificate, the Chief Executive Medicare must, within 28 days of making his or her decision, unless it is not reasonably practicable to do so, give the applicant a copy of the certificate. However, a failure to comply does not affect the validity of the decision.

             (9)  A qualifying claim certificate is not a legislative instrument.

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Application for a qualifying claim certificate

             (1)  An application for the issue of a Level 1 qualifying claim certificate may be made by an eligible insurer.

             (2)  An application for the issue of a Level 2 qualifying claim certificate may be made by:

                     (a)  an eligible insurer; or

                     (b)  the person against whom the claim is or was made or a person acting on that person’s behalf.

             (3)  The application must:

                     (a)  be made in writing using a form approved by the Chief Executive Medicare; and

                     (b)  specify whether it is an application for a Level 1 qualifying claim certificate or a Level 2 qualifying claim certificate; and

                     (c)  specify each person, other than the midwife concerned, against whom a claim has been or is reasonably likely to be made, in relation to the incident to which the claim relates; and

                     (d)  be accompanied by the documents and other information required by the form approved by the Chief Executive Medicare.

##### <a id="13"></a>13  Time by which an application must be decided

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), the Chief Executive Medicare is to decide an application for the issue of a qualifying claim certificate on or before the 21st day after the day on which the application is received by the Chief Executive Medicare.

             (2)  If the Chief Executive Medicare requests a person to give information under section 62 in relation to the application, the Chief Executive Medicare does not have to decide the application until the 21st day after the day on which the person gives the information to the Chief Executive Medicare.

##### <a id="14"></a>14  Obligation to notify the Chief Executive Medicare if information is incorrect or incomplete

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a qualifying claim certificate is in force in relation to a claim; and

                     (b)  a person becomes aware that the information provided to the Chief Executive Medicare in connection with the application for the certificate was incorrect or incomplete, or is no longer correct or complete; and

                     (c)  the person is:

                              (i)  the person who applied for the certificate; or

                             (ii)  another person who has applied for a payment of Level 1 or Level 2 Commonwealth contribution in relation to the claim;

the person must notify the Chief Executive Medicare of the respect in which the information was incorrect or incomplete, or is no longer correct or complete.

Note:          Failure to notify is an offence (see section 67).

             (2)  The notification must:

                     (a)  be made in writing; and

                     (b)  be given to the Chief Executive Medicare within 28 days after the person becomes aware as mentioned in subsection (1).

##### <a id="15"></a>15  Revocation and variation of qualifying claim certificates

Revocation

             (1)  The Chief Executive Medicare may revoke a qualifying claim certificate if the Chief Executive Medicare is no longer satisfied as mentioned in subsection 11(1) or (2) in relation to the claim.

             (2)  To avoid doubt, in considering whether he or she is still satisfied as mentioned in subsection 11(1) or (2) in relation to the claim, the Chief Executive Medicare may have regard to matters that have occurred since the decision to issue the qualifying claim certificate was made, including for example:

                     (a)  the making of Rules for the purpose of paragraph 11(3)(k),(l) or (m) or (4)(b); or

                     (b)  changes to the terms and conditions of the contract of insurance identified in the certificate.

Variation

             (3)  If the Chief Executive Medicare is satisfied that a matter is not correctly identified or specified in a qualifying claim certificate, the Chief Executive Medicare must vary the certificate so that it correctly identifies or specifies the matter.

Effect of revocation

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  the Chief Executive Medicare revokes a qualifying claim certificate; and

                     (b)  an amount of Level 1 or Level 2 Commonwealth contribution has already been paid in relation to the claim;

the amount is an amount overpaid to which section 64 applies.

Effect of variation

             (5)  If:

                     (a)  the Chief Executive Medicare varies a qualifying claim certificate; and

                     (b)  an amount of Level 1 or Level 2 Commonwealth contribution has already been paid in relation to the claim, and that amount exceeds the amount that would have been paid if the amount of Level 1 or Level 2 Commonwealth contribution had been determined having regard to the certificate as varied;

the amount of the excess is an amount overpaid to which section 64 applies.

AAT review of decision to revoke or vary

             (6)  An application may be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of a decision of the Chief Executive Medicare to revoke or vary a qualifying claim certificate.

Note:          Section 27A of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ requires notification of a decision that is reviewable.

Chief Executive Medicare to give applicant copy of varied certificate

             (7)  If the Chief Executive Medicare decides to vary a qualifying claim certificate, the Chief Executive Medicare must, within 28 days of making his or her decision, give the applicant a copy of the varied certificate. However, a failure to comply does not affect the validity of the decision.

### Division 3—Payability

#### Subdivision A—Level 1 payability

##### <a id="16"></a>16  When is a Level 1 Commonwealth contribution payable?

Basic payability rule

             (1)  A Level 1 Commonwealth contribution is payable to an eligible insurer under this section if:

                     (a)  a claim (the **_current claim_**) is, or was, made against a person (the **_midwife_**); and

                     (b)  a Level 1 qualifying claim certificate is in force in relation to the current claim; and

                     (c)  in a case where there is a person, other than the midwife, against whom a claim has been, or could reasonably be made in relation to the incident to which the current claim relates—either:

                              (i)  an apportionment certificate in relation to the current claim is in force; or

                             (ii)  the Chief Executive Medicare has not issued an apportionment certificate because of the operation of section 52 (which deals with claims for which there is a final judgment or order of a court); and

                     (d)  the eligible insurer has a qualifying payment in relation to the current claim (see subsection (3)); and

                     (e)  the amount of the qualifying payment exceeds what was the Level 1 claim threshold at the time the eligible insurer was first notified of the current claim or the incident to which the current claim relates; and

                      (f)  a person has applied for the Level 1 Commonwealth contribution in accordance with section 58; and

                     (g)  any other requirements (however described) that are specified in the Rules have been met; and

                     (h)  the current claim is not a claim included in a class specified in Rules made for the purposes of this paragraph.

             (2)  Rules made for the purposes of paragraph (1)(g) or (h) do not apply in relation to an incident if the claim to which the incident relates was made before the Rules in question take effect.

Qualifying payments

             (3)  The eligible insurer has a **_qualifying payment_** in relation to the current claim if:

                     (a)  the eligible insurer:

                              (i)  pays an amount in relation to the current claim; or

                             (ii)  is liable to pay an amount in relation to a payment or payments that someone makes, or is liable to make, in relation to the current claim under a written agreement between the parties to the current claim; or

                            (iii)  is liable to pay an amount in relation to a payment or payments that someone makes, or is liable to make, in relation to the current claim under a judgment or order of a court that is not stayed and is not subject to appeal; and

                     (b)  the eligible insurer pays, or is liable to pay, the amount under an insurance contract between the eligible insurer and the midwife; and

                     (c)  the eligible insurer pays, or becomes liable to pay, the amount in the ordinary course of the eligible insurer’s business; and

                     (d)  if an apportionment certificate is in force in relation to the current claim—the amount paid or payable in relation to the current claim is consistent with the proportion of the overall liability specified in the apportionment certificate as the proportion that is to be attributed to the midwife against whom the claim was made.

##### <a id="17"></a>17  Amount of Level 1 Commonwealth contribution

                   The amount of a Level 1 Commonwealth contribution in relation to a claim is:

                     (a)  80%; or

                     (b)  such other percentage as is specified in the Rules;

of the amount by which the amount of the eligible insurer’s qualifying payment, or the sum of the eligible insurer’s qualifying payments (see subsection 16(3)), in relation to the claim, exceeds the Level 1 claim threshold but does not exceed the Level 2 claim threshold.

#### Subdivision B—Level 2 payability

##### <a id="18"></a>18  When is a Level 2 Commonwealth contribution payable?

Basic payability rule

             (1)  The Chief Executive Medicare may decide that a Level 2 Commonwealth contribution (the **_contribution_**) is payable in relation to a liability of a person (the **_midwife_**) if:

                     (a)  a claim (the **_current claim_**) is, or was, made against the midwife by another person; and

                     (b)  a Level 2 qualifying claim certificate is in force in relation to the current claim; and

                     (c)  the liability is a qualifying liability in relation to the claim (see section 19); and

                     (d)  in a case where there is a person, other than the midwife, against whom a claim has been, or could reasonably be made in relation to the incident to which the current claim relates—either:

                              (i)  an apportionment certificate in relation to the current claim is in force; or

                             (ii)  the Chief Executive Medicare has not issued an apportionment certificate because of the operation of section 52 (which deals with claims for which there is a final judgment or order of a court); and

                     (e)  because of the limit of the eligible insurer’s liability under the contract of insurance identified in the qualifying claim certificate, the contract does not cover, or does not fully cover, the liability; and

                      (f)  the amount that, if the limit had been high enough to cover the whole of the liability, the eligible insurer would (subject to the other terms and conditions of the contract) have been liable to pay under the contract of insurance in relation to the liability exceeds the actual amount (if any) that the eligible insurer has paid or is liable to pay under the contract in relation to the liability; and

                     (g)  the aggregate of:

                              (i)  the amount (if any) the insurer has paid, or is liable to pay, in relation to the liability under the contract of insurance; and

                             (ii)  the other amounts (if any) that the insurer has already paid, or has already become liable to pay, under the contract in relation to the current claim; and

                            equals or exceeds the Level 2 claim threshold identified in the qualifying claim certificate; and

                     (h)  a person has applied for the Level 2 Commonwealth contribution in accordance with section 60; and

                      (i)  the claim is not a claim included in a class specified in Rules made for the purposes of this paragraph.

Note 1:       For how paragraphs (f) and (g) interact with Level 1 Commonwealth contributions, see section 20.

Note 2:       For the purpose of subparagraphs (d)(i) and (ii), payments and liabilities to pay must meet the ordinary course of business requirement set out in subsection (3).

Who the contribution is payable to

             (2)  The contribution is to be paid to the person who applies for it.

Note:          For who can apply, see section 60.

Ordinary course of business test for insurance payments

             (3)  An amount that an eligible insurer has paid, or is liable to pay, under a contract of insurance does not count for the purpose of subparagraph (1)(d)(i) or (ii) unless it is an amount that the eligible insurer paid, or is liable to pay, in the ordinary course of the eligible insurer’s business.

AAT review of decision to refuse, or to pay a particular amount of contribution

             (4)  An application may be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of a decision of the Chief Executive Medicare to refuse an application for Level 2 Commonwealth contribution, or a decision of the Chief Executive Medicare to pay a particular amount of Level 2 Commonwealth contribution.

Note:          Section 27A of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ requires notification of a decision that is reviewable.

##### <a id="19"></a>19  Qualifying liabilities

             (1)  A person (the **_midwife_**) has a qualifying liability in relation to a claim made against the midwife if:

                     (a)  one of the following applies:

                              (i)  the liability is under a judgment or order of a court in relation to the claim, being a judgment or order that is not stayed and is not subject to appeal;

                             (ii)  the liability is under a settlement of the claim that takes the form of a written agreement between the parties to the claim;

                            (iii)  the liability is some other kind of liability of the midwife (for example, a liability to legal costs) that relates to the claim; and

                     (b)  the defence of the claim against the midwife was conducted appropriately (see subsection (2)) up to the time when:

                              (i)  if the liability is under a judgment or order of a court—the date on which the judgment or order became a judgment or order that is not stayed and is not subject to appeal; or

                             (ii)  if the liability is under a settlement of the claim—the date on which the settlement agreement was entered into; or

                            (iii)  if the liability is some other kind of liability—the date on which the liability was incurred; and

                     (c)  if the liability is under a settlement of the claim, or is under a consent order made by a court—a legal practitioner has given a statutory declaration certifying that the amount of the liability is reasonable; and

                     (d)  if an apportionment certificate is in force in relation to the current claim—the amount paid or payable in relation to the current claim is consistent with the proportion of the overall liability specified in the apportionment certificate as the proportion that is to be attributed to the midwife against whom the claim was made.

             (2)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), the defence of the claim is conducted appropriately if, and only if:

                     (a)  to the extent it is conducted on the midwife’s behalf by an insurer, or by a legal practitioner engaged by the insurer—the defence is conducted to a standard that is consistent with the insurer’s usual standard for the conduct of the defence of claims; and

                     (b)  to the extent it is conducted by the midwife, or by a legal practitioner engaged by the midwife—the defence is conducted prudently.

             (3)  In this section:

                    <a name="defenc-claim"></a>**_defence of the claim_** includes any settlement negotiations on behalf of the midwife.

##### <a id="20"></a>20  Interaction with Level 1 Commonwealth contribution and run‑off cover

                   For the following purposes:

                     (a)  determining the limit of the eligible insurer’s liability under the contract of insurance;

                     (b)  paragraphs 18(1)(f) and (g);

an amount that an eligible insurer has paid or is liable to pay, or would have been liable to pay, under a contract of insurance is not to be reduced on account of a Level 1 Commonwealth contribution, or a run‑off cover Commonwealth contribution, paid or payable, or that would have been payable, to the eligible insurer.

##### <a id="21"></a>21  Amount of Level 2 Commonwealth contribution

                   The amount of Level 2 Commonwealth contribution that is payable in relation to a particular qualifying liability is the amount of the excess referred to in paragraph 18(1)(f).

Note:          It is only liabilities that exceed the limit that will be covered by a Level 2 Commonwealth contribution (even if the Level 2 claim threshold is less than that limit).

##### <a id="22"></a>22  How Level 2 Commonwealth contribution is to be applied

             (1)  This section applies if a Level 2 Commonwealth contribution (the **_contribution_**) is paid to a person (the **_recipient_**) in relation to a liability of a person (the **_midwife_**).

Note:          The recipient will either be the midwife himself or herself, or a person acting on behalf of the midwife.

Chief Executive Medicare to give recipient of payment a notice identifying the liability to be discharged

             (2)  The Chief Executive Medicare must give the recipient a written notice (the **_payment notice_**) identifying the liability in relation to which the contribution is paid, and advising the recipient how this section requires the contribution to be dealt with.

Recipient’s obligation if the amount of the contribution equals or is less than the liability

             (3)  If the amount of the contribution equals or is less than the undischarged amount of the liability identified in the payment notice, the recipient must apply the whole of the contribution towards the discharge of the liability.

Recipient’s obligation if the amount of the contribution exceeds the liability

             (4)  If the amount of the contribution is greater than the undischarged amount of the liability identified in the payment notice, the recipient must:

                     (a)  apply so much of the contribution as equals the undischarged amount of the liability towards the discharge of the liability; and

                     (b)  if the recipient is not the midwife—deal with the balance of the contribution in accordance with the directions of the midwife.

Time by which recipient must comply with obligation

             (5)  The recipient must comply with whichever of subsections (3) and (4) applies:

                     (a)  by the time specified in a written direction (whether contained in the payment notice or otherwise) given to the recipient by the Chief Executive Medicare; or

                     (b)  if no such direction is given to the recipient—as soon as practicable after the Commonwealth contribution is received by the recipient.

To avoid doubt, the Chief Executive Medicare may vary a direction under paragraph (a) to specify a different time.

Debt to Commonwealth if recipient does not comply with obligation on time

             (6)  If the recipient does not comply with whichever of subsections (3) and (4) applies by the time required by subsection (5), the amount of the contribution is a debt due to the Commonwealth.

             (7)  The debt may be recovered:

                     (a)  by action by the Chief Executive Medicare against the recipient in a court of competent jurisdiction; or

                     (b)  under section 65.

             (8)  If the amount of the contribution is recoverable, or has been recovered, as mentioned in subsection (7), no amount is recoverable under section 25 or section 64 in relation to the same payment of contribution.

##### <a id="23"></a>23  Who is liable to repay an overpayment of Level 2 Commonwealth contribution?

             (1)  This section applies if, in relation to a Level 2 Commonwealth contribution (the **_contribution_**) that has been paid, there is an amount overpaid as described in subsection 25(2) or 64(2).

             (2)  The **_liable person_**, in relation to the amount overpaid, is:

                     (a)  if the contribution has not yet been dealt with in accordance with whichever of subsections 22(3) and (4) applies—the recipient referred to in subsection 22(1); or

                     (b)  if the contribution has been dealt with in accordance with whichever of those subsections applies—the midwife referred to in subsection 22(1).

Note:          The recipient and the midwife will be the same person if the contribution was paid to the midwife.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  the recipient and the midwife referred to in subsection 22(1) are not the same person; and

                     (b)  when the overpayment is recovered as a debt, the liable person is the recipient;

the fact that the recipient may later deal with the remainder of the contribution in accordance with subsection 22(3) or (4) does not mean that the overpayment should instead have been recovered from the midwife.

#### Subdivision C—Payments that would have reduced the amount paid out under the contract of insurance

##### <a id="24"></a>24  Amounts paid before payment of Level 2 Commonwealth contribution

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  an amount (the **_insurance payment_**) has been paid under a contract of insurance that provides midwife professional indemnity cover for a person (the **_midwife_**) in relation to a liability of the midwife; and

                     (b)  another amount (not being an amount referred to in subsection (2)) has been paid to the midwife, the eligible insurer or another person in relation to the incident to which the liability relates; and

                     (c)  the other amount was not taken into account in working out the amount of the insurance payment; and

                     (d)  if the other amount had been taken into account in working out the amount of the insurance payment, a lesser amount would have been paid under the contract of insurance in relation to the liability;

then, for the purpose of calculating the amount of Level 2 Commonwealth contribution (if any) that is payable in relation to a liability of the midwife, the lesser amount is taken to have been the amount of the insurance payment.

             (2)  This section does not apply to any of the following:

                     (a)  an amount paid to an eligible insurer by another insurer under a right of contribution;

                     (b)  a payment of Level 1 Commonwealth contribution;

                     (c)  a payment of run‑off cover Commonwealth contribution;

                     (d)  an amount of a kind specified in the Rules for the purposes of this paragraph.

##### <a id="25"></a>25  Amounts paid after payment of Level 2 Commonwealth contribution

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  an amount (the **_actual contribution amount_**) of Level 2 Commonwealth contribution has been paid in relation to a qualifying liability that relates to a claim made against a person (the **_midwife_**); and

                     (b)  another amount (not being an amount referred to in subsection (5)) is paid to the midwife, an eligible insurer or another person in relation to the incident to which the claim relates; and

                     (c)  the other amount was not taken into account in calculating the actual contribution amount; and

                     (d)  if the other amount had been so taken into account, a lesser amount (the **_reduced contribution amount_**, which could be zero) of Level 2 Commonwealth contribution would have been paid in relation to the liability.

             (2)  The **_amount overpaid_** is the amount by which the actual contribution amount exceeds the reduced contribution amount.

             (3)  If the Chief Executive Medicare has given the liable person (see subsection 23(2)) a notice under subsection 27(1) in relation to the amount overpaid, the amount overpaid is a debt owed to the Commonwealth by the liable person.

Note 1:       If the contribution is or was not dealt with in accordance with whichever of subsections 22(3) and (4) applies by the time required by subsection 22(5), the whole amount of the contribution is a debt owed by the recipient, and no amount is recoverable under this section (see subsections 22(6) to (8)).

Note 2:       If:

(a)    the recipient and the midwife referred to in subsection 22(1) are not the same person; and

(b)    the midwife becomes the liable person;

                   then (subject to subsection 23(3)), the recipient ceases to be the liable person, and the amount overpaid must instead be recovered from the midwife.

             (4)  The amount overpaid may be recovered:

                     (a)  by action by the Chief Executive Medicare against the liable person in a court of competent jurisdiction; or

                     (b)  under section 65.

             (5)  This section does not apply to any of the following:

                     (a)  an amount paid to an eligible insurer by another insurer under a right of contribution;

                     (b)  a payment of Level 1 Commonwealth contribution;

                     (c)  a payment of run‑off cover Commonwealth contribution;

                     (d)  an amount of a kind specified in the Rules for the purposes of this paragraph.

##### <a id="26"></a>26  Obligation to notify the Chief Executive Medicare that amount has been paid

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  an amount of Level 2 Commonwealth contribution has been paid in relation to a qualifying liability that relates to a claim made against a person (the **_midwife_**); and

                     (b)  the person (the **_applicant_**) who applied for the Level 2 Commonwealth contribution becomes aware that another amount has been paid to the midwife, an insurer or another person in relation to the incident to which the claim relates; and

                     (c)  because of the payment of the other amount, there is an amount overpaid as described in subsection 25(2);

the applicant must notify the Chief Executive Medicare that the other amount has been paid.

Note:          Failure to notify is an offence (see section 67).

             (2)  The notification must:

                     (a)  be in writing; and

                     (b)  be given to the Chief Executive Medicare within 28 days after the applicant becomes aware that the other amount has been paid.

##### <a id="27"></a>27  The Chief Executive Medicare to notify of amount of debt due

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  an amount of Level 2 Commonwealth contribution has been paid in relation to a qualifying liability that relates to a claim made against a person (the **_midwife_**); and

                     (b)  another amount is paid to the midwife, an insurer or another person in relation to the incident to which the claim relates; and

                     (c)  because of the payment of the other amount, there is an amount overpaid as described in subsection 25(2);

the Chief Executive Medicare may give the liable person (see subsection 23(2)) a written notice that specifies:

                     (d)  the amount overpaid, and that it is a debt owed to the Commonwealth under subsection 25(3); and

                     (e)  the day before which the amount must be paid to the Commonwealth; and

                      (f)  the effect of section 28.

The day specified under paragraph (e) must be at least 28 days after the day on which the notice is given.

             (2)  The debt becomes due and payable on the day specified under paragraph (1)(e).

##### <a id="28"></a>28  Penalty imposed if an amount is repaid late

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a person owes a debt to the Commonwealth under subsection 25(3); and

                     (b)  the debt remains wholly or partly unpaid after it becomes due and payable;

the person is liable to pay a late payment penalty under this section.

             (2)  The late payment penalty is calculated:

                     (a)  at the rate specified in the Rules for the purposes of this paragraph; and

                     (b)  on the unpaid amount; and

                     (c)  for the period:

                              (i)  starting when the amount becomes due and payable; and

                             (ii)  ending when the amount, and the penalty payable under this section in relation to the amount, have been paid in full.

             (3)  The Chief Executive Medicare may remit the whole or a part of an amount of late payment penalty if the Chief Executive Medicare considers that there are good reasons for doing so.

             (4)  An application may be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of a decision of the Chief Executive Medicare not to remit, or to remit only part of, an amount of late payment penalty.

Note:          Section 27A of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ requires notification of a decision that is reviewable.

             (5)  If:

                     (a)  the recipient and the midwife referred to in subsection 22(1) are not the same person; and

                     (b)  the midwife becomes the liable person; and

                     (c)  the recipient has or had a liability under this section to pay late payment penalty;

the recipient’s liability to the late payment penalty is not affected by the fact that the recipient is no longer the person who owes the debt to the Commonwealth under subsection 25(3), except that the period referred to in paragraph (2)(c) ends when the midwife becomes the liable person.

##### <a id="31"></a>31  Eligible run‑off claims

             (1)  A claim is an **_eligible run‑off claim_** if:

                     (a)  it is a claim made against a person who, at the time the claim is made, is a person to whom subsection (2) applies; and

                     (b)  it relates to an incident that occurred on or after 1 July 2010 and on or before the run‑off cover termination date in the course of, or in connection with, the person’s practice as an eligible midwife; and

                     (c)  if there is a run‑off cover termination date, the person:

                              (i)  was, immediately before the run‑off cover termination date, a person to whom subsection (2) applies; and

                             (ii)  continued to be such a person for the whole of the period between the run‑off cover termination date and the time when an eligible insurer was first notified of the claim, or of facts that might give rise to the claim; and

                     (d)  the person has midwife professional indemnity run‑off cover that indemnifies the person in relation to the claim.

             (2)  This subsection applies to a person who is one or more of the following:

                     (a)  a person aged 65 years or over who has retired permanently from private practice as an eligible midwife;

                     (b)  a person who has not engaged in private practice as an eligible midwife at any time during the preceding period of 3 years;

                     (c)  a person who has ceased (temporarily or permanently) the person’s practice as an eligible midwife because of maternity (see subsection (3));

                     (d)  a person who has ceased the person’s practice as an eligible midwife because of permanent disability (see subsection (4));

                     (e)  a person who is the legal personal representative of a deceased person who had been an eligible midwife;

                      (f)  a person who is included in a class of persons that the Rules specify as persons to whom this subsection applies.

However, a person is not a person to whom this subsection applies if the person is included in a class of persons that the Rules specify as a class of persons to whom this subsection does not apply.

             (3)  A person is taken, for the purposes of paragraph (2)(c), to have ceased the person’s practice as an eligible midwife because of maternity if and only if:

                     (a)  the person:

                              (i)  is pregnant; or

                             (ii)  has given birth; or

                            (iii)  is recovering from a pregnancy (including a miscarriage or a stillbirth); and

                     (b)  another person who is a medical practitioner has certified, in the form approved by the Chief Executive Medicare, that the person is pregnant, has given birth or is recovering from a pregnancy, as the case requires; and

                     (c)  the person has ceased all practice as an eligible midwife:

                              (i)  because she is pregnant; or

                             (ii)  in order to care for one or more children to whom she has given birth; or

                            (iii)  in order to recover from the pregnancy; and

                     (d)  any other requirements specified in the Rules have been met.

             (4)  A person is taken, for the purposes of paragraph (2)(d), to have ceased the person’s practice as an eligible midwife because of permanent disability if and only if:

                     (a)  the person has incurred an injury, or suffers from an illness, that is permanent, or is likely to be permanent; and

                     (b)  as a result of the injury or illness, the person can no longer practise the profession of midwifery; and

                     (c)  another person who is a medical practitioner has certified, in the form approved by the Chief Executive Medicare, that the person:

                              (i)  has incurred an injury, or suffers from an illness, that is permanent, or is likely to be permanent; and

                             (ii)  can no longer practice the profession of midwifery; and

                     (d)  the person has permanently ceased all practice as an eligible midwife.

             (5)  In this section:

                    <a name="privat-practic-midwif"></a>**_private practice as a midwife_** means practice as a midwife other than:

                     (a)  practice consisting of treatment of public patients of a hospital; or

                     (b)  practice for which:

                              (i)  the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; or

                             (ii)  a local governing body; or

                            (iii)  an authority established under a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory;

                            indemnifies eligible midwives from liability relating to compensation; or

                     (c)  practice of a kind in relation to which eligible midwives are ordinarily, or could reasonably be expected in the ordinary course of business to be, engaged as employees (and therefore indemnified from liability by their employer); or

                     (d)  practice conducted outside both Australia and the external Territories; or

                     (e)  practice of a kind specified in the Rules.

             (6)  For the purposes of paragraph (c) of the definition of **_private practice as a midwife_** in subsection (5), the Rules may specify one or more classes of practice that are taken not to be practice of a kind referred to in that paragraph and, without limiting the way in which a class may be specified, the class may be described by reference to the following:

                     (a)  the ownership or control (however described) of a corporation of which one or more eligible midwives are employees;

                     (b)  the true nature of the class of practice.

             (7)  To avoid doubt, Rules made for the purposes of subsection (6) may be expressed to take effect from a date before the Rules are registered under the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_.

### Division 2—Run‑off cover Commonwealth contributions

##### <a id="32"></a>32  Circumstances in which run‑off cover Commonwealth contributions are payable

             (1)  A run‑off cover Commonwealth contribution is payable to an eligible insurer under this section if:

                     (a)  an eligible run‑off claim (the **_current claim_**) is made that relates to an incident that occurred in the course of, or in connection with, a person’s practice as an eligible midwife; and

                     (b)  at the time the claim is first notified to the eligible insurer, the person is a person to whom subsection 31(2) applies; and

                     (c)  in a case where there is a person, other than the eligible midwife, against whom a claim has been, or could reasonably be made in relation to the incident to which the current claim relates—either:

                              (i)  an apportionment certificate in relation to the current claim is in force; or

                             (ii)  the Chief Executive Medicare has not issued an apportionment certificate because of the operation of section 52 (which deals with claims for which there is a final judgment or order of a court); and

                     (d)  the eligible insurer makes, or is liable to make, a payment in relation to the claim under a contract of insurance under which the insurer is liable to indemnify the person in relation to claims made by or against the person while he or she is a person to whom subsection 31(2) applies; and

                     (e)  either the incident occurs or occurred on or after 1 July 2010 and on or before the run‑off cover termination date; and

                      (f)  the eligible insurer applies to the Chief Executive Medicare for the run‑off cover Commonwealth contribution in accordance with section 58; and

                     (g)  if an apportionment certificate is in force in relation to the current claim—the amount paid or payable in relation to the current claim is consistent with the proportion of the overall liability specified in the apportionment certificate as the proportion that is to be attributed to the eligible midwife against whom the claim was made.

             (2)  Paragraph (1)(d) does not apply to a payment that an eligible insurer makes or is liable to make unless the payment is or would be made:

                     (a)  in relation to a claim made in relation to which the eligible midwife concerned has midwife professional indemnity run‑off cover; and

                     (b)  in the eligible insurer’s ordinary course of business.

##### <a id="33"></a>33  Clarification of circumstances in which run‑off cover Commonwealth contributions are payable

                   A run‑off cover Commonwealth contribution is payable to an eligible insurer under section 32 in relation to a payment the eligible insurer makes or is liable to make, in relation to a claim even if the eligible insurer:

                     (a)  has insured itself in relation to the payment; or

                     (b)  has already been paid an amount by an insurer in relation to the payment.

##### <a id="34"></a>34  Exceptions

                   A run‑off cover Commonwealth contribution is not payable to an eligible insurer under section 32 in relation to a payment the eligible insurer makes or is liable to make, in relation to a claim if:

                     (a)  the payment is an insurer‑to‑insurer payment; or

                     (b)  the payment is a payment specified in the Rules for the purposes of this section.

##### <a id="35"></a>35  Amount of run‑off cover Commonwealth contribution

             (1)  The amount of a run‑off cover Commonwealth contribution is the amount of the payment referred to in paragraph 32(1)(d), but only to the extent that the payment is or would be made:

                     (a)  in relation to a claim for which the midwife has midwife professional indemnity run‑off cover; and

                     (b)  in the eligible insurer’s ordinary course of business.

             (2)  However, if a Level 1 or Level 2 Commonwealth contribution is payable in respect of that payment, the amount of the run‑off cover Commonwealth contribution is reduced by the amount of the Level 1 or Level 2 Commonwealth contribution.

### Division 3—Payments that would have reduced the amount of run‑off cover Commonwealth contribution

##### <a id="36"></a>36  Amounts paid before payment of run‑off cover Commonwealth contribution

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  an amount (the **_relevant_** **_payment_**) has been paid, in relation to a liability of an eligible midwife (the **_midwife_**), under a contract of insurance with an eligible insurer that provides midwife professional indemnity run‑off cover for the midwife; and

                     (b)  another amount (not being an amount referred to in subsection (2)) has been paid to the midwife, eligible insurer or another person in relation to the incident to which the liability relates; and

                     (c)  the other amount was not taken into account in working out the amount of the relevant payment; and

                     (d)  if the other amount had been taken into account in working out the amount of the relevant payment, a lesser amount would have been paid under the contract of insurance, in relation to the liability;

then, for the purpose of calculating the amount of run‑off cover Commonwealth contribution (if any) that is payable in relation to a liability of the midwife, the lesser amount is taken to have been the amount of the relevant payment.

             (2)  This section does not apply to any of the following:

                     (a)  an amount paid to an eligible insurer by another insurer under a right of contribution;

                     (b)  a payment of Level 1 Commonwealth contribution;

                     (c)  a payment of Level 2 Commonwealth contribution;

                     (d)  an amount of a kind specified in the Rules for the purposes of this paragraph.

##### <a id="37"></a>37  Amounts paid after payment of run‑off cover Commonwealth contribution

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  an amount (the **_actual run‑off cover amount_**) of run‑off cover Commonwealth contribution has been paid in relation to an eligible run‑off claim made against an eligible midwife (the **_midwife_**); and

                     (b)  another amount (not being an amount referred to in subsection (5)) is paid to the midwife, an eligible insurer or another person in relation to the incident to which the claim relates; and

                     (c)  the other amount was not taken into account in calculating the actual run‑off cover amount; and

                     (d)  if the other amount had been so taken into account, a lesser amount (the **_reduced run‑off cover amount_**, which could be zero) of run‑off cover Commonwealth contribution would have been paid in relation to the liability.

             (2)  The **_amount overpaid_** is the amount by which the actual run‑off cover amount exceeds the reduced run‑off cover amount.

             (3)  If the Chief Executive Medicare has given an eligible insurer a notice under subsection 39(1) in relation to the amount overpaid, the amount is a debt owed to the Commonwealth by the eligible insurer.

             (4)  The amount overpaid may be recovered:

                     (a)  by action by the Chief Executive Medicare against the eligible insurer in a court of competent jurisdiction; or

                     (b)  under section 65.

             (5)  This section does not apply to any of the following:

                     (a)  an amount paid to an eligible insurer by another insurer under a right of contribution;

                     (b)  a payment of Level 1 Commonwealth contribution;

                     (c)  a payment of Level 2 Commonwealth contribution;

                     (d)  an amount of a kind specified in the Rules for the purposes of this paragraph.

##### <a id="38"></a>38  Obligation to notify the Chief Executive Medicare that amount has been paid

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a run‑off cover Commonwealth contribution has been paid to an eligible insurer in relation to a liability that relates to a claim made against an eligible midwife (the **_midwife_**); and

                     (b)  the eligible insurer becomes aware that another amount has been paid to the midwife, eligible insurer or another person in relation to the incident to which the claim relates; and

                     (c)  because of the payment of the other amount, there is an amount overpaid as described in subsection 37(2);

the eligible insurer must notify the Chief Executive Medicare that the other amount has been paid.

Note:          Failure to notify is an offence (see section 67).

             (2)  The notification must:

                     (a)  be in writing; and

                     (b)  be given to the Chief Executive Medicare within 28 days after the applicant becomes aware that the other amount has been paid.

##### <a id="39"></a>39  The Chief Executive Medicare to notify of amount of debt due

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a run‑off cover Commonwealth contribution has been paid to an eligible insurer in relation to a liability that relates to a claim made against an eligible midwife; and

                     (b)  another amount is paid to the midwife, eligible insurer or another person in relation to the incident to which the claim relates; and

                     (c)  because of the payment of the other amount, there is an amount overpaid as described in subsection 37(2);

the Chief Executive Medicare may give the eligible insurer a written notice that specifies:

                     (d)  the amount overpaid, and that it is a debt owed to the Commonwealth under subsection 37(3); and

                     (e)  the day before which the amount must be paid to the Commonwealth; and

                      (f)  the effect of section 40.

The day specified under paragraph (e) must be at least 28 days after the day on which the notice is given.

             (2)  The debt becomes due and payable on the day specified under paragraph (1)(e).

##### <a id="40"></a>40  Penalty imposed if an amount is repaid late

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a person owes a debt to the Commonwealth under subsection 37(3); and

                     (b)  the debt remains wholly or partly unpaid after it becomes due and payable;

the person is liable to pay a late payment penalty under this section.

             (2)  The late payment penalty is calculated:

                     (a)  at the rate specified in the Rules for the purposes of this paragraph; and

                     (b)  on the unpaid amount; and

                     (c)  for the period:

                              (i)  starting when the amount becomes due and payable; and

                             (ii)  ending when the amount, and the penalty payable under this section in relation to the amount, have been paid in full.

             (3)  The Chief Executive Medicare may remit the whole or a part of an amount of late payment penalty if the Chief Executive Medicare considers that there are good reasons for doing so.

             (4)  An application may be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of a decision of the Chief Executive Medicare not to remit, or to remit only part of, an amount of late payment penalty.

Note:          Section 27A of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ requires notification of a decision that is reviewable.

### Division 4—Effect of setting a run‑off cover termination date

##### <a id="41"></a>41  Commonwealth’s obligations if a run‑off cover termination date is set

             (1)  If a run‑off cover termination date has been set (see subsection 7(3)), the Commonwealth is liable to pay an amount in accordance with this Division in relation to each affected eligible midwife.

             (2)  However, this section does not apply if the Rules made on or before the run‑off cover termination date set out alternative arrangements for providing medical cover for eligible midwives in relation to eligible run‑off claims that will apply on and from that date.

##### <a id="42"></a>42  Affected eligible midwife

                   An eligible midwife is an **_affected eligible midwife_** if:

                     (a)  a run‑off cover termination date has been set (see subsection 7(3)); and

                     (b)  before that date, one or more premiums have been paid for midwife professional indemnity cover, for the eligible midwife, in relation to one or more periods totalling at least 12 months; and

                     (c)  immediately before that date, the eligible midwife was not a person to whom subsection 31(2) applies.

##### <a id="43"></a>43  Payments in relation to affected eligible midwife 

             (1)  A payment that the Commonwealth is liable to make in relation to an affected eligible midwife:

                     (a)  must be paid to a person who:

                              (i)  is nominated by the eligible midwife; and

                             (ii)  has, on or after the run‑off cover termination date, provided midwife professional indemnity cover for the eligible midwife under a contract of insurance; and

                     (b)  must be paid as all or part of the premium payable for the provision of that cover; and

                     (c)  must be paid within 12 months after that date; and

                     (d)  must not exceed the eligible midwife’s total run‑off cover credit.

             (2)  Amounts payable by the Commonwealth under this Division are payable out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which is appropriated accordingly.

##### <a id="44"></a>44  Total run‑off cover credits

             (1)  This is how to work out an affected eligible midwife’s **_total run‑off cover credit_**:

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.   For the first financial year after 30 June 2010 in which an eligible insurer provided midwife professional indemnity cover for the eligible midwife under a contract of insurance, multiply:

               (a)     the eligible midwife’s run‑off cover credit for the financial year; by

              (b)     the interest rate adjustment for the financial year (see subsection (4)).

Step 2.   For each subsequent financial year (if any) until the financial year in which the termination date occurs, multiply:

               (a)     the sum of the eligible midwife’s run‑off cover credit for the financial year and the amount worked out, under step 1 or this step, for the immediately preceding financial year; by

              (b)     the interest rate adjustment for the financial year (see subsection (4)).

Step 3.   Add together:

               (a)     the eligible midwife’s run‑off cover credit for the financial year in which the run‑off cover termination date occurs; and

              (b)     the last of the amounts worked out under step 1 or step 2.

              The result is the practitioner’s **_total run‑off cover credit_**.

* * *

             (2)  The eligible midwife’s **_run‑off cover credit_** for a financial year is the sum of all run‑off cover support payments paid or payable to the extent that they are attributable, under subsection (3), to the eligible midwife in relation to the financial year.

             (3)  Run‑off cover support payments are **_attributable_** to the practitioner in relation to the financial year to the extent that they relate to premiums paid during the financial year to an eligible insurer for midwife professional indemnity cover provided for the eligible midwife by one or more contracts of insurance with the eligible insurer.

             (4)  The **_interest rate adjustment_** for a financial year is the number worked out as follows:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00490/Html/e5958090-76f3-42b4-95df-14a92b81dfb7_files/image002.gif)

where:

                    <a name="applic-interest-rate"></a>**_applicable interest rate_** is:

                     (a)  the rate of interest, for the financial year, specified in the Rules for the purposes of this paragraph; or

                     (b)  if no rate is so specified—the short‑term bond rate for the June quarter immediately preceding the financial year.

                    <a name="june-quarter"></a>**_June quarter_** means a period of 3 months commencing on 1 April.

                    <a name="short-term-bond-rate"></a>**_short‑term bond rate_**, for a June quarter, means:

                     (a)  if:

                              (i)  the Reserve Bank of Australia has published, in respect of one or more days in the last 2 weeks of the quarter, an indicative secondary market mid‑rate yield for Australian Government fixed coupon Treasury bonds; and

                             (ii)  the maturity date of the bonds is the third anniversary of the 15th day of the quarter or (if there are no bonds with that maturity date) the closer or closest date to that date within 2 years after it;

                            the yield referred to in subparagraph (i) in respect of the day referred to in that subparagraph, or the average of the yields referred to in subparagraph (i) in respect of the days referred to in that subparagraph, as the case requires; or

                     (b)  in any other case—the rate of interest notified in the _Gazette_, by the Minister administering the _Loan (Income Equalization Deposits) Act 1976_, as the rate of interest in relation to the quarter for the purposes of this definition.

##### <a id="45"></a>45  Eligible insurers must provide information attributing run‑off cover support payments

             (1)  An eligible insurer must, in relation to each run‑off cover support payment that the eligible insurer is liable to make to the Chief Executive Medicare, notify the Chief Executive Medicare of:

                     (a)  each eligible midwife to whom the payment is attributable; and

                     (b)  for each such eligible midwife, each financial year in relation to which the payment is attributable; and

                     (c)  for each such eligible midwife and financial year, the extent to which the payment is attributable to the practitioner in relation to the financial year.

Note:          Failure to notify is an offence (see section 67).

             (2)  The notification must:

                     (a)  be made in writing; and

                     (b)  must be given to the Chief Executive Medicare on or before the payment day under section 75 for the run‑off cover support payment.

### Division 5—Miscellaneous

##### <a id="46"></a>46  Chief Executive Medicare must be notified of a person ceasing to be covered by the midwife run‑off cover provisions

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a person ceases to be a person to whom subsection 31(2) applies; and

                     (b)  immediately before the cessation, an eligible insurer was providing midwife professional indemnity run‑off cover to the person;

the eligible insurer must notify the Chief Executive Medicare of the cessation.

Note:          Failure to notify is an offence (see section 67).

             (2)  The notification must:

                     (a)  be in writing; and

                     (b)  set out details of the cessation; and

                     (c)  be given to the Chief Executive Medicare within a period, starting on the day after the day on which the person becomes aware of the cessation, of:

                              (i)  61 days; or

                             (ii)  such greater number of days specified in the Rules for the purposes of this subparagraph.

##### <a id="47"></a>47  Invoices for midwife professional indemnity cover

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  an eligible insurer gives to a person an invoice stating the premium that is or will be payable for midwife professional indemnity cover provided by a contract of insurance with the eligible insurer; and

                     (b)  payment of the premium would increase the eligible insurer’s liability to pay run‑off cover support payment;

the eligible insurer must ensure that the invoice states:

                     (c)  the amount of the eligible insurer’s premium income, for the contribution year in question, that represents the premium that is or will be payable for midwife professional indemnity cover provided by the contract of insurance; and

                     (d)  the applicable percentage relating to that contribution year; and

                     (e)  the amount of the run‑off cover support payment imposed on the eligible insurer, for that contribution year, that relates to the premium that is or will be payable for midwife professional indemnity cover provided by the contract of insurance.

Note:          Failure to comply with this section is an offence (see section 69).

             (2)  In this section:

                    <a name="applic-percentag"></a>**_applicable percentage_** has the same meaning as in subsection 6(2) of the _Midwife Professional Indemnity (Run‑off Cover Support Payment) Act 2010_.

                    <a name="premium-incom"></a>**_premium income_** has the same meaning as in the _Midwife Professional Indemnity (Run‑off Cover Support Payment) Act 2010_.

                    <a name="run-off-cover-support-payment"></a>**_run‑off cover support payment_** has the same meaning as in the _Midwife Professional Indemnity (Run‑off Cover Support Payment) Act 2010_.

##### <a id="48"></a>48  Reports on run‑off cover Commonwealth provisions

             (1)  The Minister must, in relation to each financial year starting on or after 1 July 2010:

                     (a)  cause a report to be prepared of the operation of this Part within 6 months after the end of the financial year; and

                     (b)  cause a copy of the report to be tabled in each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after its receipt by the Minister.

             (2)  Without limiting the matters that may be included in a report under subsection (1) in relation to a financial year, the report must include:

                     (a)  a statement of the number of persons who were, at the end of the financial year, persons to whom subsection 31(2) applies; and

                     (b)  a statement of the total of all the amounts of run‑off cover Commonwealth contribution paid by the Commonwealth during the financial year; and

                     (c)  a statement of the total of all the amounts of run‑off cover support payments paid to the Commonwealth during the financial year; and

                     (d)  estimates by the Actuary of the Commonwealth’s liabilities in relation to amounts of run‑off Commonwealth contributions in future financial years.

             (3)  If a run‑off cover termination date has been set (see subsection 7(3)), this section does not apply in relation to a financial year starting after the end of the financial year in which the termination date occurs.

##### <a id="49"></a>49  Modifications and exclusions

             (1)  The Rules may provide that this Part applies with specified modifications in relation to:

                     (a)  a specified class of claims; or

                     (b)  a specified class of contracts of insurance; or

                     (c)  a specified class of situations in which a liability is, whether wholly or partly, covered by more than one contract of insurance.

             (2)  The Rules may provide that this Part does not apply, or applies with specified modifications, in relation to a specified class of liabilities or payments.

             (3)  Without limiting subsection (2), the Rules may specify modifications regarding how this Part applies in relation to a liability under an order of a court requiring an amount to be paid pending the outcome of an appeal, including modifications:

                     (a)  to deal with what happens if, as a result of the appeal or another appeal, the amount paid later becomes wholly or partly repayable; and

                     (b)  to deal with what happens if the amount paid is later applied towards a liability that is confirmed as a result of the appeal or another appeal.

             (4)  This section does not allow the Rules to modify a provision that creates an offence, or that imposes an obligation which, if contravened, constitutes an offence.

## Part 4—Administration of provisions relating to Commonwealth contributions

### Division 1—Guide

             (1)  The Chief Executive Medicare may issue a certificate (an **_apportionment certificate_**) in relation to a claim against a midwife if:

                     (a)  either:

                              (i)  a qualifying claim certificate has been issued by the Chief Executive Medicare in relation to the claim; or

                             (ii)  the claim is an eligible run‑off claim; and

                     (b)  the Chief Executive Medicare is satisfied that there is a person, other than the midwife, against whom a claim has been or is reasonably likely to be made, in relation to the incident to which the claim relates; and

                     (c)  an application for the certificate has been made in accordance with section 53.

             (2)  The apportionment certificate must specify the proportion of the overall liability in relation to the incident that is to be attributed to:

                     (a)  the midwife; and

                     (b)  the other person or persons against whom the Chief Executive Medicare is satisfied a claim has been, or is reasonably likely to be, made in relation to the incident.

             (3)  For the purposes of paragraph (2)(b), if there is more than one other person against whom the Chief Executive Medicare is satisfied a claim has been or is reasonably likely to be made, the proportion of the overall liability may be specified for:

                     (a)  each of those persons individually; or

                     (b)  those persons taken as a group.

             (4)  The proportion of the overall liability specified in the apportionment certificate may be the same as the apportionment proposed in the application if the Chief Executive Medicare is satisfied that the proposed apportionment is reasonable.

             (5)  The apportionment certificate may be different from the apportionment proposed in the application if the Chief Executive Medicare is satisfied that the alternative apportionment is reasonable.

             (6)  For the purposes of being satisfied that an apportionment is reasonable, the Medicare CEO may have regard to:

                     (a)   the information provided with the application; and

                     (b)  any other information that the Medicare CEO considers appropriate.

             (7)  However, the Chief Executive Medicare is not required to have regard to any information beyond the information that was included in the application.

             (2)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(d), the defence of the claim is conducted appropriately if, and only if:

                     (a)  to the extent it is conducted on the midwife’s behalf by an insurer, or by a legal practitioner engaged by the insurer—the defence is conducted to a standard that is consistent with the insurer’s usual standard for the conduct of the defence of claims; and

##### <a id="53"></a>53  Applications for apportionment certificates

             (1)  An eligible insurer in relation to a claim made against a midwife must apply for the issue of an apportionment certificate in relation to the claim if the eligible insurer considers that there is a person other than the midwife against whom a claim has been, or is reasonably likely to be, made in relation to the incident to which the claim relates.

             (7)  An offence against subsection (5) is an offence of strict liability.

Note:          For strict liability, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.
