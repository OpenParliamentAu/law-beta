             (4)  If it is necessary to do so, the maritime security inspector may apply for the warrant before the information is sworn or affirmed.

Issue of warrant

Obligations of magistrate and maritime security inspector once warrant issued

             (6)  If the magistrate completes and signs the warrant:

                     (a)  the magistrate must:

                     (b)  deal with them in the way in which the magistrate would have dealt with the information if the application had been made under section 145A.

Authority of warrant

             (9)  A form of warrant duly completed under subsection (6) is authority for the same powers as are authorised by the warrant signed by the magistrate.

           (10)  If:
