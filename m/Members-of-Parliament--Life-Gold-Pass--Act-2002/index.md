##### <a id="9B"></a>9B  Nomination of spouse or de facto partner

                     (a)  beginning on the start day; and

                     (b)  ending on the earlier of:

                              (i)  the day the person makes a written revocation of the nomination; or

                             (ii)  if the person makes a subsequent nomination naming another spouse or de facto partner of the person—the day before the start day for the subsequent nomination.

             (5)  If the start day for a subsequent nomination naming another spouse or de facto partner of a person includes a period during which a previously nominated spouse or de facto partner of the person took one or more domestic return trips, then, despite section 9A, the previously nominated spouse or de facto partner is taken to have been entitled to those domestic return trips.

Note:          Under section 14, the total trips that may be taken by the subsequently nominated spouse or de facto partner in the year in which the start day occurs cannot exceed the number of trips left untaken in that year by the previously nominated spouse or de facto partner.
