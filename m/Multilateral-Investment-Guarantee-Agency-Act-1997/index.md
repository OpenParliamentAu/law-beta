CONVENTION ESTABLISHING THE MULTILATERAL

INVESTMENT GUARANTEE AGENCY

PREAMBLE

**The Contracting States**

            **_Considering_** the need to strengthen international cooperation for economic development and to foster the contribution to such development of foreign investment in general and private foreign investment in particular;

            **_Recognising_** that the flow of foreign investment to developing countries would be facilitated and further encouraged by alleviating concerns related to non‑commercial risks;

            **_Desiring_**to enhance the flow to developing countries of capital and technology for productive purposes under conditions consistent with their development needs, policies and objectives, on the basis of fair and stable standards for the treatment of foreign investment;

            **_Convinced_** that the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency can play an important role in the encouragement of foreign investment complementing national and regional investment guarantee programs and private insurers of non‑commercial risk; and

            **_Realizing_** that such Agency should, to the extent possible, meet its obligations without resort to its callable capital and that such an objective would be served by continued improvement in investment conditions,

            **_Have_**_Agreed_ as follows:

**CHAPTER I**

**Establishment, Status, Purposes and Definitions**

**_Article 1._ Establishment and Status of the Agency**

            (a)  There is hereby established the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (hereinafter called the Agency).

            (b)  The Agency shall possess full juridical personality and, in particular, the capacity to:

                              (i)  contract;

                             (ii)  acquire and dispose of movable and immovable property; and

                            (iii)  institute legal proceedings.

**_Article 2._ Objective and Purposes**

            The objective of the Agency shall be to encourage the flow of investments for productive purposes among member countries, and in particular to developing member countries, thus supplementing the activities of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (hereinafter referred to as the Bank), the International Finance Corporation and other international development finance institutions.

            To serve its objective, the Agency shall:

            (a)  issue guarantees, including coinsurance and reinsurance, against non-commercial risks in respect of investments in a member country which flow from other member countries;

            (b)  carry out appropriate complementary activities to promote the flow of investments to and among developing member countries; and

            (c)  exercise such other incidental powers as shall be necessary or desirable in the furtherance of its objective.

            The Agency shall be guided in all its decisions by the provisions of this Article.

**_Article 3._ Definitions**

            For the purposes of this Convention:

            (a)  “Member” means a State with respect to which this Convention has entered into force in accordance with Article 61.

            (b)  “Host country” or “host government” means a member, its government, or any public authority of a member in whose territories, as defined in Article 66, an investment which has been guaranteed or reinsured, or is considered for guarantee or reinsurance, by the Agency is to be located.

            (c)  A “developing member country” means a member which is listed as such in Schedule A hereto as this Schedule may be amended from time to time by the Council of Governors referred to in Article 30 (hereinafter called the Council).

            (d)  A “special majority” means an affirmative vote of not less than two‑thirds of the total voting power representing not less than fifty-five percent of the subscribed shares of the capital stock of the Agency.

            (e)  A “freely usable currency” means (i) any currency designated as such by the International Monetary Fund from time to time and (ii) any other freely available and effectively usable currency which the Board of Directors referred to in Article 30 (hereinafter called the Board) may designate for the purposes of this Convention after consultation with the International Monetary Fund and with the approval of the country of such currency.

**CHAPTER II**

**Membership and Capital**

**_Article 4._ Membership**

            (a)  Membership in the Agency shall be open to all members of the Bank and to Switzerland.

            (b)  Original members shall be the States which are listed in Schedule A hereto and become parties to this Convention on or before October 30, 1987.

**_Article 5._ Capital**

            (a)  The authorized capital stock of the Agency shall be one billion Special Drawing Rights (SDR 1,000,000,000). The capital stock shall be divided into 100,000 shares having a par value of SDR 10,000 each, which shall be available for subscription by members. All payment obligations of members with respect to capital stock shall be settled on the basis of the average value of the SDR in terms of United States dollars for the period January 1, 1981 to June 30, 1985, such value being 1.082 United States dollars per SDR.

            (b)  The capital stock shall increase on the admission of a new member to the extent that the then authorized shares are insufficient to provide the shares to be subscribed by such member pursuant to Article 6.

            (c)  The Council, by special majority, may at any time increase the capital stock of the Agency.

**_Article 6._ Subscription of Shares**

            Each original member of the Agency shall subscribe at par to the number of shares of capital stock set forth opposite its name in Schedule A hereto. Each other member shall subscribe to such number of shares of capital stock on such terms and conditions as may be determined by the Council, but in no event at an issue price of less than par. No member shall subscribe to less that fifty shares. The Council may prescribe rules by which members may subscribe to additional shares of the authorized capital stock.

**_Article 7._ Division and Calls of Subscribed Capital**

            The initial subscription of each member shall be paid as follows:

                              (i)  Within ninety days from the date on which this Convention enters into force with respect to such member, ten percent of the price of each share shall be paid in cash as stipulated in Section (a) of Article 8 and an additional ten percent in the form of non-negotiable, non-interest-bearing promissory notes or similar obligations to be encashed pursuant to a decision of the Board in order to meet the Agency’s obligations.

            (b)  Calls on any portion of unpaid subscriptions shall be uniform on all shares.

            (c)  If the amount received by the Agency on a call shall be insufficient to meet the obligations which have necessitated the call, the Agency may make further successive calls on unpaid subscriptions until the aggregate amount received by it shall be sufficient to meet such obligations.

            (d)  Liability on shares shall be limited to the unpaid portion of the issue price.

**_Article 9._ Valuation of Currencies**

            Whenever it shall be necessary for the purposes of this Convention to determine the value of one currency in terms of another, such value shall be as reasonably determined by the Agency, after consultation with the International Monetary Fund.

**_Article 10._ Refunds**

            (a)  The Agency shall, as soon as practicable, return to members amounts paid on calls on subscribed capital if and to the extent that:

                              (i)  the call shall have been made to pay a claim resulting from a guarantee or reinsurance contract and thereafter the Agency shall have recovered its payment, in whole or in part, in a freely usable currency; or

                             (ii)  the call shall have been made because of a default in payment by a member and thereafter such member shall have made good such default in whole or in part; or

                            (iii)  the Council, by special majority, determines that the financial position of the Agency permits all or part of such amounts to be returned out of the Agency’s revenues.

            (b)  Any refund effected under this Article to a member shall be made in freely usable currency in the proportion of the payments made by that member to the total amount paid pursuant to calls made prior to such refund.

            (c)  The equivalent of amounts refunded under this Article to a member shall become part of the callable capital obligations of the member under Article 7 (ii).

**CHAPTER III**

**Operations**

            (a)  Subject to the provisions of Sections (b) and (c) below, the Agency may guarantee eligible investments against a loss resulting from one or more of the following types of risk:

                              (i)  _Currency Transfer_

                                   any introduction attributable to the host government of restrictions on the transfer outside the host country of its currency into a freely usable currency or another currency acceptable to the holder of the guarantee, including a failure of the host government to act within a reasonable period of time on an application by such holder for such transfer;

                             (ii)  _Expropriation and Similar Measures_

                                   any legislative action or administrative action or omission attributable to the host government which has the effect of depriving the holder of a guarantee of his ownership or control of, or a substantial benefit from, his investment, with the exception of non‑discriminatory measures of general application which governments normally take for the purpose of regulating economic activity in their territories;

                            (iii)  _Breach of Contract_

                                   any repudiation or breach by the host government of a contract with the holder of a guarantee, when (a) the holder of a guarantee does not have recourse to a judicial or arbitral forum to determine the claim of repudiation or breach, or (b) a decision by such forum is not rendered within such reasonable period of time as shall be prescribed in the contracts of guarantee pursuant to the Agency’s regulations, or (c) such a decision cannot be enforced; and

                            (iv)  _War and Civil Disturbance_

                                   any military action or civil disturbance in any territory of the host country to which this Convention shall be applicable as provided in Article 66.

            (b)  Upon the joint application of the investor and the host country, the Board, by special majority, may approve the extension of coverage under this Article to specific non-commercial risks other than those referred to in Section (a) above, but in no case to the risk of devaluation or depreciation of currency.

            (c)  Losses resulting from the following shall not be covered:

                              (i)  any host government action or omission to which the holder of the guarantee has agreed or for which he has been responsible; and

                             (ii)  any host government action or omission or any other event occurring before the conclusion of the contract of guarantee.

**_Article 12._ Eligible Investments**

            (a)  Eligible investments shall include equity interests, including medium- or long-term loans made or guaranteed by holders of equity in the enterprise concerned, and such forms of direct investment as may be determined by the Board.

            (b)  The Board, by special majority, may extend eligibility to any other medium- or long-term form of investment, except that loans other than those mentioned in Section (a) above may be eligible only if they are related to a specific investment covered or to be covered by the Agency.

            (c)  Guarantees shall be restricted to investments the implementation of which begins subsequent to the registration of the application for the guarantee by the Agency. Such investments may include:

                              (i)  any transfer of foreign exchange made to modernize, expand, or develop an existing investment; and

                             (ii)  the use of earnings from existing investments which could otherwise be transferred outside the host country.

            (d)  In guaranteeing an investment, the Agency shall satisfy itself as to:

                              (i)  the economic soundness of the investment and its contribution to the development of the host country;

                             (ii)  compliance of the investment with the host country’s laws and regulations;

                            (iii)  consistency of the investment with the declared development objectives and priorities of the host country; and

                            (iv)  the investment conditions in the host country, including the availability of fair and equitable treatment and legal protection for the investment.

**_Article 13._ Eligible Investors**

            (a)  Any natural person and any juridical person may be eligible to receive the Agency’s guarantee provided that:

                              (i)  such natural person is a national of a member other than the host country;

                             (ii)  such juridical person is incorporated and has its principal place of business in a member or the majority of its capital is owned by a member or members or nationals thereof, provided that such member is not the host country in any of the above cases; and

                            (iii)  such juridical person, whether or not it is privately owned, operates on a commercial basis.

            (b)  In case the investor has more than one nationality, for the purposes of Section (a) above the nationality of a member shall prevail over the nationality of a non-member, and the nationality of the host country shall prevail over the nationality of any other member.

            (c)  Upon the joint application of the investor and the host country, the Board, by special majority, may extend eligibility to a natural person who is a national of the host country or a juridical person which is incorporated in the host country or the majority of whose capital is owned by its nationals, provided that the assets invested are transferred from outside the host country.

**_Article 14._ Eligible Host Countries**

            Investments shall be guaranteed under this Chapter only if they are to be made in the territory of a developing member country.

**_Article 15._ Host Country Approval**

            The Agency shall not conclude any contract of guarantee before the host government has approved the issuance of the guarantee by the Agency against the risks designated for cover.

**_Article 16._ Terms and Conditions**

            The terms and conditions of each contract of guarantee shall be determined by the Agency subject to such rules and regulations as the Board shall issue, provided that the Agency shall not cover the total loss of the guaranteed investment. Contracts of guarantee shall be approved by the President under the direction of the Board.

**_Article 17._ Payment of Claims**

            The President under the direction of the Board shall decide on the payment of claims to a holder of a guarantee in accordance with the contract of guarantee and such policies as the Board may adopt. Contracts of guarantee shall require holders of guarantees to seek, before a payment is made by the Agency, such administrative remedies as may be appropriate under the circumstances, provided that they are readily available to them under the laws of the host country. Such contracts may require the lapse of certain reasonable periods between the occurrence of events giving rise to claims and payments of claims.

**_Article 18._ Subrogation**

            (a)  Upon paying or agreeing to pay compensation to a holder of a guarantee, the Agency shall be subrogated to such rights or claims related to the guaranteed investment as the holder of a guarantee may have had against the host country and other obligors. The contract of guarantee shall provide the terms and conditions of such subrogation.

            (b)  The rights of the Agency pursuant to Section (a) above shall be recognized by all members.

            (c)  Amounts in the currency of the host country acquired by the Agency as subrogee pursuant to Section (a) above shall be accorded, with respect to use and conversion, treatment by the host country as favorable as the treatment to which such funds would be entitled in the hands of the holder of the guarantee. In any case, such amounts may be used by the Agency for the payment of its administrative expenditures and other costs. The Agency shall also seek to enter into arrangements with host countries on other uses of such currencies to the extent that they are not freely usable.

**_Article 19._ Relationship to National and Regional Entities**

            The Agency shall cooperate with, and seek to complement the operations of, national entities of members and regional entities the majority of whose capital is owned by members, which carry out activities similar to those of the Agency, with a view to maximizing both the efficiency of their respective services and their contribution to increased flows of foreign investment. To this end, the Agency may enter into arrangements with such entities on the details of such cooperation, including in particular the modalities of reinsurance and coinsurance.

**_Article 20._ Reinsurance of National and Regional Entities**

            (a)  The Agency may issue reinsurance in respect of a specific investment against a loss resulting from one or more of the non-commercial risks underwritten by a member or agency thereof or by a regional investment guarantee agency the majority of whose capital is owned by members. The Board, by special majority, shall from time to time prescribe maximum amounts of contingent liability which may be assumed by the Agency with respect to reinsurance contracts. In respect of specific investments which have been completed more than twelve months prior to receipt of the application for reinsurance by the Agency, the maximum amount shall initially be set at ten percent of the aggregate contingent liability of the Agency under this Chapter. The conditions of eligibility specified in Articles 11 to 14 shall apply to reinsurance operations, except that the reinsured investments need not be implemented subsequent to the application for reinsurance.

            (b)  The mutual rights and obligations of the Agency and a reinsured member or agency shall be stated in contracts of reinsurance subject to such rules and regulations as the Board shall issue. The Board shall approve each contract for reinsurance covering an investment which has been made prior to receipt of the application for reinsurance by the Agency, with a view to minimizing risks, assuring that the Agency receives premiums commensurate with its risk, and assuring that the reinsured entity is appropriately committed toward promoting new investment in developing member countries.

            (c)  The Agency shall, to the extent possible, assure that it or the reinsured entity shall have the rights of subrogation and arbitration equivalent to those the Agency would have if it were the primary guarantor. The terms and conditions of reinsurance shall require that administrative remedies are sought in accordance with Article 17 before a payment is made by the Agency. Subrogation shall be effective with respect to the host country concerned only after its approval of the reinsurance by the Agency. The Agency shall include in the contracts of reinsurance provisions requiring the reinsured to pursue with due diligence the rights or claims related to the reinsured investment.

**_Article 21._ Cooperation with Private Insurers and with Reinsurers**

            (a)  The Agency may enter into arrangements with private insurers in member countries to enhance its own operations and encourage such insurers to provide coverage of non-commercial risks in developing member countries on conditions similar to those applied by the Agency. Such arrangements may include the provision of reinsurance by the Agency under the conditions and procedures specified in Article 20.

            (b)  The Agency may reinsure with any appropriate reinsurance entity, in whole or in part, any guarantee or guarantees issued by it.

            (c)  The Agency will in particular seek to guarantee investments for which comparable coverage on reasonable terms is not available from private insurers and reinsurers.

**_Article 22._ Limits of Guarantee**

            (b)  Subject to the provisions of Sections (b) and (c) of Article 3 of this Annex, each sponsoring member shall share with the other sponsoring members in losses under guarantees of sponsored investments, when and to the extent that such losses cannot be covered out of the Sponsorship Trust Fund referred to in Article 2 of this Annex, in the proportion which the amount of maximum contingent liability under the guarantees of investments sponsored by it bears to the total amount of maximum contingent liability under the guarantees of investments sponsored by all members.

            (c)  In its decisions on the issuance of guarantees under this Annex, the Agency shall pay due regard to the prospects that the sponsoring member will be in a position to meet its obligations under this Annex and shall give priority to investments which are co-sponsored by the host countries concerned.

            (d)  The Agency shall periodically consult with sponsoring members with respect to its operations under this Annex.

**_Article 2._ Sponsorship Trust Fund**

            (a)  Premiums and other revenues attributable to guarantees of sponsored investments, including returns on the investment of such premiums and revenues, shall be held in a separate account which shall be called the Sponsorship Trust Fund.

            (b)  All administrative expenses and payments on claims attributable to guarantees issued under this Annex shall be paid out of the Sponsorship Trust Fund.

            (c)  The assets of the Sponsorship Trust Fund shall be held and administered for the joint account of sponsoring members and shall be kept separate and apart from the assets of the Agency.

**_Article 3._ Calls on Sponsoring Members**

            (a)  To the extent that any amount is payable by the Agency on account of a loss under a sponsored guarantee and such amount cannot be paid out of assets of the Sponsorship Trust Fund, the Agency shall call on each sponsoring member to pay into such Fund its share of such amount as shall be determined in accordance with Section (b) of Article 1 of this Annex.

            (b)  No member shall be liable to pay any amount on a call pursuant to the provisions of this Article if as a result total payments made by that member will exceed the total amount of guarantees covering investments sponsored by it.

            (c)  Upon the expiry of any guarantee covering an investment sponsored by a member, the liability of that member shall be decreased by an amount equivalent to the amount of such guarantee; such liability shall also be decreased on a pro rata basis upon payment by the Agency of any claim related to a sponsored investment and shall otherwise continue in effect until the expiry of all guarantees of sponsored investments outstanding at the time of such payment.

            (d)  If any sponsoring member shall not be liable for an amount of a call pursuant to the provisions of this Article because of the limitation contained in Sections (b) and (c) above, or if any sponsoring member shall default in payment of an amount due in response to any such call, the liability for payment of such amount shall be shared pro rata by the other sponsoring members. Liability of members pursuant to this Section shall be subject to the limitation set forth in Sections (b) and (c) above.

            (e)  Any payment by a sponsoring member pursuant to a call in accordance with this Article shall be made promptly and in freely usable currency.

The provisions of this Annex concerning guarantees and of Articles 20 and 21 of this Convention shall be applied _mutatis mutandis_ to reinsurance provided under this Section.

            (b)  The Agency may obtain reinsurance for investments guaranteed by it under this Annex and shall meet the cost of such reinsurance out of the Sponsorship Trust Fund. The Board may decide whether and to what extent the loss‑sharing obligation of sponsoring members referred to in Section (b) of Article 1 of this Annex may be reduced on account of the reinsurance cover obtained.

**_Article 6._ Operational Principles**

            Without prejudice to the provisions of this Annex, the provisions with respect to guarantee operations under Chapter III of this Convention and to financial management under Chapter IV of this Convention shall be applied _mutatis mutandis_ to guarantees of sponsored investments except that (i) such investments shall qualify for sponsorship if made in the territories of any member, and in particular of any developing member, by an investor or investors eligible under Section (a) of Article 1 of this Annex, and (ii) the Agency shall not be liable with respect to its own assets for any guarantee or reinsurance issued under this Annex and each contract of guarantee or reinsurance concluded pursuant to this Annex shall expressly so provide.

**_Article 7._ Voting**

**ANNEX II**

**Settlement of Disputes Between A Member and the Agency Under Article 57**

**_Article 1._ Application of the Annex**

            All disputes within the scope of Article 57 of this Convention shall be settled in accordance with the procedure set out in this Annex, except in the cases where the Agency has entered into an agreement with a member pursuant to Section (b) (ii) of Article 57.

**_Article 2._ Negotiation**

            The parties to a dispute within the scope of this Annex shall attempt to settle such dispute by negotiation before seeking conciliation or arbitration. Negotiations shall be deemed to have been exhausted if the parties fail to reach a settlement within a period of one hundred and twenty days from the date of the request to enter into negotiation.

**_Article 3._ Conciliation**

            (a)  If the dispute is not resolved through negotiation, either party may submit the dispute to arbitration in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 of this Annex, unless the parties, by mutual consent, have decided to resort first to the conciliation procedure provided for in this Article.

            (b)  The agreement for recourse to conciliation shall specify the matter in dispute, the claims of the parties in respect thereof and, if available, the name of the conciliator agreed upon by the parties. In the absence of agreement on the conciliator, the parties may jointly request either the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (hereinafter called ICSID) or the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint a conciliator. The conciliation procedure shall terminate if the conciliator has not been appointed within ninety days after the agreement for recourse to conciliation.

            (c)  Unless otherwise provided in this Annex or agreed upon by the parties, the conciliator shall determine the rules governing the conciliation procedure and shall be guided in this regard by the conciliation rules adopted pursuant to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States.

            (d)  The parties shall cooperate in good faith with the conciliator and shall, in particular, provide him with all information and documentation which would assist him in the discharge of his functions; they shall give their most serious consideration to his recommendations.

            (e)  Unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties, the conciliator shall, within a period not exceeding one hundred and eighty days from the date of his appointment, submit to the parties a report recording the results of his efforts and setting out the issues controversial between the parties and his proposals for their settlement.

            (f)  Each party shall, within sixty days from the date of the receipt of the report, express in writing its views on the report to the other party.

            (g)  Neither party to a conciliation proceeding shall be entitled to have recourse to arbitration unless:

                              (i)  the conciliator shall have failed to submit his report within the period established in Section (e) above; or

                             (ii)  the parties shall have failed to accept all of the proposals contained in the report within sixty days after its receipt; or

                            (iii)  the parties, after an exchange of views on the report, shall have failed to agree on a settlement of all controversial issues within sixty days after receipt of the conciliator’s report; or

                            (iv)  a party shall have failed to express its views on the report as prescribed in Section (f) above.

            (h)  Unless the parties agree otherwise, the fees of the conciliator shall be determined on the basis of the rates applicable to ICSID conciliation. These fees and the other costs of the conciliation proceedings shall be borne equally by the parties. Each party shall defray its own expenses.

**_Article 4._  Arbitration**

            (a)  Arbitration proceedings shall be instituted by means of a notice by the party seeking arbitration (the claimant) addressed to the other party or parties to the dispute (the respondent). The notice shall specify the nature of the dispute, the relief sought and the name of the arbitrator appointed by the claimant. The respondent shall, within thirty days after the date of receipt of the notice, notify the claimant of the name of the arbitrator appointed by it. The two parties shall, within a period of thirty days from the date of appointment of the second arbitrator, select a third arbitrator, who shall act as President of the Arbitral Tribunal (the Tribunal).

            (b)  If the Tribunal shall not have been constituted within sixty days from the date of the notice, the arbitrator not yet appointed or the President not yet selected shall be appointed, at the joint request of the parties, by the Secretary-General of ICSID. If there is no such joint request, or if the Secretary‑General shall fail to make the appointment within thirty days of the request, either party may request the President of the International Court of Justice to make the appointment.

            (c)  No party shall have the right to change the arbitrator appointed by it once the hearing of the dispute has commenced. In case any arbitrator (including the President of the Tribunal) shall resign, die, or become incapacitated, a successor shall be appointed in the manner followed in the appointment of his predecessor and such successor shall have the same powers and duties of the arbitrator he succeeds.

            (d)  The Tribunal shall convene first at such time and place as shall be determined by the President. Thereafter, the Tribunal shall determine the place and dates of its meetings.

            (e)  Unless otherwise provided in this Annex or agreed upon by the parties, the Tribunal shall determine its procedure and shall be guided in this regard by the arbitration rules adopted pursuant to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States.

            (f)  The Tribunal shall be the judge of its own competence except that, if an objection is raised before the Tribunal to the effect that the dispute falls within the jurisdiction of the Board or the Council under Article 56 or within the jurisdiction of a judicial or arbitral body designated in an agreement under Article 1 of this Annex and the Tribunal is satisfied that the objection is genuine, the objection shall be referred by the Tribunal to the Board or the Council or the designated body, as the case may be, and the arbitration proceedings shall be stayed until a decision has been reached on the matter, which shall be binding upon the Tribunal.

            (g)  The Tribunal shall, in any dispute within the scope of this Annex, apply the provisions of this Convention, any relevant agreement between the parties to the dispute, the Agency’s by-laws and regulations, the applicable rules of international law, the domestic law of the member concerned as well as the applicable provisions of the investment contract, if any. Without prejudice to the provisions of this Convention, the Tribunal may decide a dispute _ex aequo et bono_ if the Agency and the member concerned so agree. The Tribunal may not bring a finding of _non liquet_ on the ground of silence or obscurity of the law.

            (h)  The Tribunal shall afford a fair hearing to all the parties. All decisions of the Tribunal shall be taken by a majority vote and shall state the reasons on which they are based. The award of the Tribunal shall be in writing, and shall be signed by at least two arbitrators and a copy thereof shall be transmitted to each party. The award shall be final and binding upon the parties and shall not be subject to appeal, annulment or revision.

            (i)  If any dispute shall arise between the parties as to the meaning or scope of an award, either party may, within sixty days after the award was rendered, request interpretation of the award by an application in writing to the President of the Tribunal which rendered the award. The President shall, if possible, submit the request to the Tribunal which rendered the award and shall convene such Tribunal within sixty days after receipt of the application. If this shall not be possible, a new Tribunal shall be constituted in accordance with the provisions of Sections (a) to (d) above. The Tribunal may stay enforcement of the award pending its decision on the requested interpretation.

            (j)  Each member shall recognize an award rendered pursuant to this Article as binding and enforceable within its territories as if it were a final judgment of a court in that member. Execution of the award shall be governed by the laws concerning the execution of judgments in force in the State in whose territories such execution is sought and shall not derogate from the law in force relating to immunity from execution.

            (k)  Unless the parties shall agree otherwise, the fees and remuneration payable to the arbitrators shall be determined on the basis of the rates applicable to ICSID arbitration. Each party shall defray its own costs associated with the arbitration proceedings. The costs of the Tribunal shall be borne by the parties in equal proportion unless the Tribunal decides otherwise. Any question concerning the division of the costs of the Tribunal or the procedure for payment of such costs shall be decided by the Tribunal.

**_Article 5._ Service of Process**

            Service of any notice or process in connection with any proceeding under this Annex shall be made in writing. It shall be made by the Agency upon the authority designated by the member concerned pursuant to Article 38 of this Convention and by that member at the principal office of the Agency.

*Countries listed under Category Two are developing member countries for the purposes of this Convention.

**SCHEDULE B**

**Election of Directors**

1.       Candidates for the office of Director shall be nominated by the Governors, provided that a Governor may nominate only one person.

2.       The election of Directors shall be by ballot of the Governors.

3.       In balloting for the Directors, every Governor shall cast for one candidate all the votes which the member represented by him is entitled to cast under Section (a) of Article 40.

4.       One-fourth of the number of Directors shall be elected separately, one by each of the Governors of members having the largest number of shares. If the total number of Directors is not divisible by four, the number of Directors so elected shall be one-fourth of the next lower number that is divisible by four.

5.       The remaining Directors shall be elected by the other Governors in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 6 to 11 of this Schedule.

6.       If the number of candidates nominated equals the number of such remaining Directors to be elected, all the candidates shall be elected in the first ballot; except that a candidate or candidates having received less than the minimum percentage of total votes determined by the Council for such election shall not be elected if any candidate shall have received more than the maximum percentage of total votes determined by the Council.

7.       If the number of candidates nominated exceeds the number of such remaining Directors to be elected, the candidates receiving the largest number of votes shall be elected with the exception of any candidate who has received less than the minimum percentage of the total votes determined by the Council.

8.       If all of such remaining Directors are not elected in the first ballot, a second ballot shall be held. The candidate or candidates not elected in the first ballot shall again be eligible for election.

9.       In the second ballot, voting shall be limited to (i) those Governors having voted in the first ballot for a candidate not elected and (ii) those Governors having voted in the first ballot for an elected candidate who had already received the maximum percentage of total votes determined by the Council before taking their votes into account.

10.     In determining when an elected candidate has received more than the maximum percentage of the votes, the votes of the Governor casting the largest number of votes for such candidate shall be counted first, then the votes of the Governor casting the next largest number, and so on until such percentage is reached.

11.     If not all the remaining Directors have been elected after the second ballot, further ballots shall be held on the same principles until all the remaining Directors are elected, provided that when only one Director remains to be elected, this Director may be elected by a simple majority of the remaining votes and shall be deemed to have been elected by all such votes.

Modernizing MIGA’s Mandate: Amendments to MIGA’s Convention

WHEREAS, Article 59 of the MIGA Convention Establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (“the MIGA Convention”) provides that, “this Convention and its Annexes may be amended by vote of three‑fifths of the Governors exercising four‑fifths of the total voting power”; and

WHEREAS, Article 60 of the MIGA Convention provides that, “Any proposal to amend this Convention, whether emanating from a member or a Governor or a Director, shall be communicated to the Chairman of the Board who shall bring the proposal before the Board. If the proposed amendment is recommended by the Board, it shall be submitted to the Council for approval in accordance with Article 59\. When an amendment has been duly approved by the Council, the Agency shall so certify by formal communication addressed to all members. Amendments shall enter into force for all members ninety days after the date of the formal communication unless the Council shall specify a different date.”

NOW THEREFORE the Council of Governors hereby resolves that:

1.         Article 11 of the MIGA Convention shall henceforth read as follows:

**Article 11\. Covered Risks**

(a) Subject to the provisions of Sections (b) and (c) below, the Agency may guarantee eligible investments against a loss resulting from one or more of the following types of risk:

(i) _Currency Transfer_

any introduction attributable to the host government of restrictions on the transfer outside the host country of its currency into a freely usable currency or another currency acceptable to the holder of the guarantee, including a failure of the host government to act within a reasonable period of time on an application by such holder for such transfer;

(ii) _Expropriation and Similar Measures_

any legislative action or administrative action or omission attributable to the host government which has the effect of depriving the holder of a guarantee of his ownership or control of, or a substantial benefit from, his investment, with the exception of non‑discriminatory measures of general application which governments normally take for the purpose of regulating economic activity in their territories;

(iii) _Breach of Contract_

any repudiation or breach by the host government of a contract with the holder of a guarantee, when (a) the holder of a guarantee does not have recourse to a judicial or arbitral forum to determine the claim of repudiation or breach, or (b) a decision by such forum is not rendered within such reasonable period of time as shall be prescribed in the contracts of guarantee pursuant to the Agency’s regulations, or (c) such a decision cannot be enforced; and

(iv) _War and Civil Disturbance_

any military action or civil disturbance in any territory of the host country to which this Convention shall be applicable as provided in Article 66.

(b) In addition, the Board, by special majority, may approve the extension of coverage under this Article to specific non‑commercial risks other than those referred to in Section (a) above, but in no case to the risk of devaluation or depreciation of currency.

(c) Losses resulting from the following shall not be covered:

(i) any host government action or omission to which the holder of the guarantee has agreed or for which he has been responsible; and

(ii) any host government action or omission or any other event occurring before the conclusion of the contract of guarantee.

2.         Article 12 of the MIGA Convention shall henceforth read as follows:

**Article 12\. _Eligible Investments_**

(a) Eligible investments shall include equity interests, including medium‑ or long‑term loans made or guaranteed by holders of equity in the enterprise concerned, and such forms of direct investment as may be determined by the Board.

(b) Loans other than those mentioned in Section (a) are eligible for coverage (i) if they are made to finance or are otherwise related to a specific investment or project in which some other form of direct investment is present, whether or not guaranteed by the Agency and regardless of when such other investment was made, or (ii) as may be otherwise approved by the Board by special majority.

(c) The Board, by special majority, may extend eligibility to any        other medium‑ or long‑term form of investment.

(d) Guarantees shall generally be restricted to investments the implementation of which begins subsequent to the registration of the application for the guarantee by the Agency or receipt by the Agency of other satisfactory evidence of investor intent to obtain guarantees from the Agency. Such investments may include:

(i) a transfer of foreign exchange made to modernize, expand, or develop an existing investment, in which case both the original investment and the additional investment may be considered eligible for coverage;

(ii) the use of earnings from existing investments which could otherwise be transferred outside the host country;

(iii) the acquisition of an existing investment by a new eligible investor;

(iv) existing investments where an eligible investor is seeking to insure a pool of existing and new investments;

(v) existing investments owned by an eligible investor where there is an improvement or enhancement of the underlying project or the investor otherwise demonstrates medium‑ or long‑term commitment to the project, and the Agency is satisfied that the project continues to have a high developmental impact in the host country; and

(vi) such other investments as may be approved by the Board by special majority.

(e) In guaranteeing an investment, the Agency shall satisfy itself as to:

(i) the economic soundness of the investment and its contribution to the development of the host country;

(ii) compliance of the investment with the host country’s laws and regulations;

(iii) consistency of the investment with the declared development objectives and priorities of the host country; and

(iv) the investment conditions in the host country, including the availability of fair and equitable treatment and legal protection for the investment.

As at 3 December 2010 the amendments are not incorporated in this compilation.
