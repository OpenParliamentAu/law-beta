## 70  Applications for registration made before 21 March 1998

(1)        This item makes special provision for an individual’s application to be registered as a registered agent if:

                     (a)  the application was made under section 288 of the _Migration Act 1958_ before 21 March 1998; and

                     (b)  the applicant had not been registered as a result of the application before that day; and

                     (c)  neither the Secretary nor the Migration Agents Registration Board had made a decision before that day not to register the applicant.

(2)        Part 3 of the _Migration Act 1958_ as amended by this Schedule applies to the application as if the applicant had made the application to the Migration Agents Registration Authority.

(3)        That Part applies as if the application were made on the form approved for the purposes of subsection 288(2) of the _Migration Act 1958_ as in force on and after 21 March 1998.

(4)        That Part applies as if any registration application fee on the application had been paid, if:

                     (a)  the applicant had paid levy on the application under the _Migration Agents Registration (Application) Levy Act 1992_; or

                     (b)  the application was exempt from levy under that Act.

(5)        If the Secretary had published notice of the application in the _Gazette_ and a statement under subsection 289(1) of the _Migration Act 1958_ as in force before 21 March 1998, Part 3 of that Act as in force on and after that day applies as if:

## 73  Special arrangements for renewal of registration of some migration agents in the voluntary sector

(1)        This item makes special provision for a registered agent if:

                     (a)  the agent’s registration is due for renewal under section 300 of the _Migration Act 1958_ on or after 21 March 1998 but no later than 20 September 1998; and

                     (b)  the agent gives immigration assistance only as an employee of, or a voluntary worker for, a person or organisation that does not charge people receiving the assistance a fee, or require any other reward from them, for the assistance.

(2)        Paragraph 302(1)(b) of the _Migration Act 1958_ has effect in relation to the renewal occurring in 1998 as if that paragraph referred to 6 months instead of 2 weeks.

_Note:       This gives the agent 6 months (rather than 2 weeks) to pay the renewal fee._

(3)        The Migration Agents Registration Authority must deregister the agent by removing his or her name from the Register of Migration Agents if, 6 months after the renewal in 1998 of the agent’s registration, the Authority is satisfied that the agent is not a fit and proper person to give immigration assistance because the agent does not have either:

                     (a)  a qualification prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of paragraph 290(2)(b) of the _Migration Act 1958_; or

                     (b)  a knowledge of migration procedure that the Authority considers to be sound.

_Note:       Subsections 3(2) and 25(7) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 allow the President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to specify a person to take the place of the Migration Agents Registration Board in proceedings before the Tribunal on or after 21 March 1998._

(2)        Without limiting subsection 43(1) of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_, the Tribunal may:

                     (a)  exercise the powers and discretions of the Migration Agents Registration Authority for the purpose of varying the Board’s decision or substituting another decision for the Board’s decision; or

                     (b)  remit the matter to the Migration Agents Registration Authority for consideration in accordance with any directions or recommendations of the Tribunal.

## 76  Continuation of investigations requested by Migration Agents Registration Board

(3)        A report or material arising out of an investigation requested by the Migration Agents Registration Board of a complaint about a registered agent relating to his or her provision of immigration assistance may be given to the Migration Agents Registration Authority only if the complainant agrees to its being given to the Authority.

## 77  Information required by Board

If, before 21 March 1998:

                     (a)  the Migration Agents Registration Board requires a registered agent to make a statutory declaration or provide specified documents or records under section 308 of the _Migration Act 1958_; and

                     (b)  the declaration, documents or records have not been given to the Board;

the declaration, documents or records must be given to the Migration Agents Registration Authority as soon as possible after that day.

## 78  Submissions to the Board under section 309

## 81  Final report

(1)        If an appointment of the Institute under section 315 of the _Migration Act 1958_ is in force immediately before the day (the **_sunset day_**) that Part 3 of that Act ceases to be in force because of section 333 of that Act, the Institute must give to the Minister for presentation to the Parliament a report on the administration of that Part during the period:
