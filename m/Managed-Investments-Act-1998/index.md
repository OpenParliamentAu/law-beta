		Sections 1069A to 1069C of the old Law apply, with necessary modifications,

then, in applying paragraph 601JA(2)(c) or 601JB(2)(b) of the new Law to the scheme, a person who was an officer or employee of the other of those bodies is not, merely because of things they did before the scheme's registration in the performance of their functions or duties as an officer or employee of that body, taken to have been substantially involved in business dealings, or in a professional capacity, with the responsible entity.

1465  References to prescribed interests etc. in existing laws and documents
