             (3)  Where an Act, a State Act or an Ordinance of any Territory of the Commonwealth provides that a person specified in the Act, State Act or Ordinance is to be the guardian of a minor, or requires that a specified person is to be deemed to be the guardian of a minor, to the exclusion of any parent or other guardian of the minor, that person is the person whose consent is required by this Act to the marriage of the minor.

             (4)  Where, under a State Act or an Ordinance of any Territory of the Commonwealth, a person specified in the State Act or Ordinance is to be, or is to be deemed to be, a guardian of a minor in addition to the parents or other guardian of the minor, the consent of that person is required to the marriage of the minor in addition to the consent of the person or persons ascertained in accordance with the Schedule.

##### <a id="15"></a>15  Prescribed authority may dispense with consent in certain cases

                     (b)  has no reason to believe that that person would refuse his or her consent to the proposed marriage; and

                     (c)  has no reason to believe that facts may exist by reason of which it could reasonably be considered improper that the consent should be dispensed with.

             (2)  An application under this section shall be supported by a statutory declaration by the applicant setting out the facts and circumstances on which the application is based and may be supported by the statutory declaration of some other person.

             (3)  The applicant shall state in his or her statutory declaration whether he or she has made any previous applications under this section that have been refused and the date on which each such application was refused.

             (4)  This section does not authorise a prescribed authority to dispense with the consent of a person to a marriage of a minor where any other person whose consent to the marriage is required by this Act has refused to give consent, unless a magistrate or a Judge has, in pursuance of this Part, given consent in place of the consent of that other person.

             (5)  For the purposes of this section, the fact that a person does not reside in, or is absent from, Australia shall not of itself be deemed to make it impracticable to ascertain the views of that person.

                     (a)  a person whose consent to the marriage is required by this Act refuses to consent to the marriage; or

                     (b)  in a case to which paragraph (1)(b) applies—that, having proper regard for the welfare of the minor, it would be unreasonable for the Judge or magistrate to refuse consent to the proposed marriage;

may give consent to the marriage in place of the consent of the person in relation to whose consent the application is made.

          (2A)  A Judge or magistrate shall not proceed with an inquiry in accordance with subsection (2) unless:

                     (a)  there has been produced to the Judge or magistrate a certificate in the prescribed form signed by a family counsellor certifying that the applicant has received counselling from the family counsellor in relation to the proposed marriage; or

             (3)  Where a magistrate to whom an application is made under this section is satisfied that the matter could more properly be dealt with by a magistrate sitting at a place nearer the place where the applicant ordinarily resides, the magistrate may, in his or her discretion, refuse to proceed with the hearing of the application, but such a refusal shall not, for the purposes of sections 17 and 19, be deemed to be a refusal of the application.

             (4)  Where a magistrate grants an application under subsection (1), the magistrate shall not issue consent in writing to the marriage before the expiration of the time prescribed for the purposes of section 17 and if, within that time, a request for a re‑hearing is made under that section, the magistrate shall not issue consent unless that request is withdrawn.

             (5)  Where a Judge or magistrate gives consent to the marriage of a minor in place of the consent of a person who has refused to consent to the marriage, the Judge or magistrate may also, upon application by the minor, give consent in place of the consent of any other person if the Judge or magistrate is satisfied that it is impracticable, or that it is impracticable without delay that would, in all the circumstances of the case, be unreasonable, to ascertain the views of that person with respect to the proposed marriage.

             (6)  For the purposes of subsection (5), the fact that a person does not reside in, or is absent from, Australia shall not of itself be deemed to make it impracticable to ascertain the views of that person.

             (7)  In this section **_family counsellor_** has the same meaning as in the _Family Law Act 1975_.

##### <a id="17"></a>17  Re‑hearing of applications by a Judge

             (2)  An inquiry by a Judge or a magistrate under this Part shall be held in private.

             (3)  An applicant or other person who is given an opportunity of being heard at an inquiry under this Part may be represented by a barrister or solicitor.

             (2)  The fact that an application is heard or dealt with in contravention of subsection (1) does not affect the validity of an order made, or the effectiveness of a consent given, upon the application or the re‑hearing of the application or make ineffective any dispensation with a consent granted on the application.

##### <a id="20"></a>20  Effect of consent of magistrate or Judge

                   Subject to section 21, where a magistrate or a Judge gives his or her consent to the marriage of a minor in place of the consent of another person, his or her consent operates, for the purposes of this Act, as the consent of that other person.

##### <a id="39H"></a>39H  Performance reviews

##### <a id="39I"></a>39I  Disciplinary measures

             (1)  The Registrar of Marriage Celebrants may only take disciplinary measures against a marriage celebrant if the Registrar:

                     (e)  is satisfied that the marriage celebrant’s application for registration was known by the marriage celebrant to be false or misleading in a material particular.

             (2)  The only disciplinary measures that the Registrar may take against a marriage celebrant are to:

                     (a)  caution the marriage celebrant in writing; or

                     (b)  to suspend a person’s registration as a marriage celebrant; or

                     (c)  to deregister a marriage celebrant.

             (2)  For the purposes of both the making of an application under subsection (1) and the operation of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ in relation to such an application, if:

                     (a)  a person has made application for registration as a marriage celebrant under section 39D; and

                     (b)  at the end of 3 months after the day on which the application was made, the person has not been:

                              (i)  registered; or

                             (ii)  notified by the Registrar that that person’s application has been refused;

the Registrar is taken to have decided, on the last day of the 3 month period, not to register that person as a marriage celebrant.

             (3)  The Registrar must take such action as is necessary to give effect to the Tribunal’s decision (even if doing so at the time the action is taken would cause a breach of a limit under section 39E).

                     (a)  the exercise or performance; or

                     (b)  the purported exercise or performance;

of powers or functions under this Act.

##### <a id="39M"></a>39M  Evidence of registration etc.

##### <a id="40"></a>40  Application of Division

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), this Division applies to and in relation to all marriages solemnised, or intended to be solemnised, in Australia.

             (2)  This Division does not apply to or in relation to marriages to which Division 3 of this Part applies.

##### <a id="41"></a>41  Marriages to be solemnised by authorised celebrant

                   A marriage shall be solemnised by or in the presence of an authorised celebrant who is authorised to solemnise marriages at the place where the marriage takes place.

##### <a id="42"></a>42  Notice to be given and declaration made

             (1)  Subject to this section, a marriage shall not be solemnised unless:

                     (a)  notice in writing of the intended marriage has been given in accordance with this section and has been received by the authorised celebrant solemnising the marriage not earlier than 18 months before the date of the marriage and not later than 1 month before the date of the marriage;

                     (b)  there has been produced to that authorised celebrant, in respect of each of the parties:

                              (i)  an official certificate, or an official extract of an entry in an official register, showing the date and place of birth of the party; or

                             (ii)  a statutory declaration made by the party or a parent of the party stating that, for reasons specified in the declaration, it is impracticable to obtain such a certificate or extract and stating, to the best of the declarant’s knowledge and belief and as accurately as the declarant has been able to ascertain, when and where the party was born; or

                            (iii)  a passport issued by a government of an overseas country, showing the date and place of birth of the party; and

                     (c)  each of the parties has made and subscribed before that authorised celebrant a declaration, in accordance with the prescribed form, as to:

                              (i)  the party’s conjugal status;

                             (ii)  the party’s belief that there is no legal impediment to the marriage; and

                            (iii)  such other matters as are prescribed.

             (2)  A notice under subsection (1):

                     (a)  shall be in accordance with the prescribed form and contain such particulars in relation to the parties as are indicated in the prescribed form; and

                     (b)  must be signed by each of the parties; and

                     (c)  if a party signs the notice in Australia—must be signed in the presence of:

                              (i)  an authorised celebrant; or

                             (ii)  a Commissioner for Declarations under the _Statutory Declarations Act 1959_; or

                            (iii)  a justice of the peace; or

                            (iv)  a barrister or solicitor; or

                             (v)  a legally qualified medical practitioner; or

                            (vi)  a member of the Australian Federal Police or the police force of a State or Territory; and

                     (d)  if a party signs the notice outside Australia—must be signed in the presence of:

                              (i)  an Australian Diplomatic Officer; or

                             (ii)  an Australian Consular Officer; or

                            (iii)  a notary public; or

                             (v)  an employee of the Australian Trade Commission authorised under paragraph 3(d) of the _Consular Fees Act 1955_.

             (3)  However, if the signature of a party to an intended marriage cannot conveniently be obtained at the time when it is desired to give notice under this section, a notice duly signed by the other party and otherwise complying with the provisions of this section shall, if it is signed by the first‑mentioned party in the presence of an authorised celebrant before the marriage is solemnised, be deemed to have been a sufficient notice.

             (4)  Where a party to an intended marriage is unable, after reasonable inquiry, to ascertain all of the particulars in relation to that party required to be contained in a notice under this section, the failure to include in the notice such of those particulars as the party is unable to ascertain does not make the notice ineffective for the purposes of this section if, at any time before the marriage is solemnised, that party furnishes to the authorised celebrant solemnising the marriage a statutory declaration as to that party’s inability to ascertain the particulars not included in the notice and the reason for that inability.

             (5)  Despite a notice required by subsection (1) having been received later than 1 month before the date of the marriage, a prescribed authority may authorise an authorised celebrant to solemnise a marriage if the authority is satisfied that one or more of the circumstances prescribed in the regulations have been met.

          (5A)  An authorised celebrant shall, as soon as practicable after receiving the notice referred to in subsection (1), give to the parties a document in the prescribed form outlining the obligations and consequences of marriage and indicating the availability of marriage education and counselling.

             (6)  Where, by reason of the death, absence or illness of an authorised celebrant to whom a notice of intention to marry has been given, or for any other reason, it is impracticable for that person to solemnise the marriage, the marriage may be solemnised by any authorised celebrant who has possession of the notice.

             (7)  The declarations of the parties required by subsection (1) shall both be written on the one paper and on the same side of that paper.

             (8)  An authorised celebrant shall not solemnise a marriage:

                     (a)  unless the authorised celebrant has satisfied himself or herself that the parties are the parties referred to in the notice given under this section in relation to the marriage; or

                     (b)  if the authorised celebrant has reason to believe that:

                              (i)  a notice given under this section; or

                             (ii)  a declaration made and subscribed under this section, or a statutory declaration made for the purposes of this section;

in relation to the marriage, contains a false statement or an error or is defective.

             (9)  An authorised celebrant may permit an error in a notice under this section to be corrected in his or her presence by either of the parties at any time before the marriage to which it relates has been solemnised and may treat the corrected notice as having been originally given in its corrected form.

           (10)  Where the declaration made by a party under subsection (1) states that that party is a divorced person or a widow or widower, an authorised celebrant shall not solemnise the marriage unless there is produced to him or her evidence of that party’s divorce, or of the death of that party’s spouse, as the case requires.

## Part VA—Recognition of foreign marriages

##### <a id="88A"></a>88A  Object of Part

                   The object of this Part is to give effect to Chapter II of the Convention on Celebration and Recognition of the Validity of Marriages signed at The Hague on 14 March 1978.

##### <a id="88B"></a>88B  Interpretation

             (1)  In this Part, unless the contrary intention appears:

                    <a name="australia"></a>**_Australia_** includes the external Territories.

                    <a name="local-law"></a>**_local law_**, in relation to a marriage solemnised in a foreign country, means the law in force in the foreign country or in that part of the foreign country in which the marriage was solemnised.

             (2)  A marriage shall be taken, for the purposes of this Part, to have been solemnised in a foreign country by or in the presence of a diplomatic or consular officer of another foreign country if the marriage was solemnised in the first‑mentioned foreign country by or in the presence of a person who was recognised by the government of that country as a diplomatic or consular representative of the other foreign country.

             (3)  In this Part, a reference to a marriage includes a reference to a purported marriage that is void or voidable but does not include a reference to a marriage solemnised under Part V.

             (4)  To avoid doubt, in this Part (including section 88E) **_marriage_** has the meaning given by subsection 5(1).

##### <a id="88C"></a>88C  Application of Part

             (1)  This Part applies to and in relation to every marriage solemnised, whether before or after the commencement of this Part, in a foreign country where:

                     (a)  under the local law, the marriage was, at the time when it was solemnised, recognised as valid; or

                     (b)  if the marriage was solemnised by or in the presence of a diplomatic or consular officer of another foreign country:

                              (i)  under the law of that other foreign country, the marriage was, at the time when it was solemnised, recognised as valid; and

                             (ii)  at the time when it was solemnised, the solemnisation of the marriage was not prohibited by the local law.

             (2)  Where a marriage (not being a marriage referred to in subsection (1)) that was solemnised, whether before or after the commencement of this Part, in a foreign country:

                     (a)  is, at any time in relation to which the validity of the marriage falls to be determined, recognised as valid under the local law; or

                     (b)  if the marriage was solemnised by or in the presence of a diplomatic or consular officer of another foreign country and, at the time when it was solemnised, the solemnisation of the marriage was not prohibited by the local law—is, at any time in relation to which the validity of the marriage falls to be determined, recognised as valid under the law of that other foreign country;

this Part applies to and in relation to the marriage from and including that time.

##### <a id="88D"></a>88D  Validity of marriages

             (1)  Subject to this section, a marriage to which this Part applies shall be recognised in Australia as valid.

             (2)  A marriage to which this Part applies shall not be recognised as valid in accordance with subsection (1) if:

                     (a)  either of the parties was, at the time of the marriage, a party to a marriage with some other person and the last‑mentioned marriage was, at that time, recognised in Australia as valid;

                     (b)  where one of the parties was, at the time of the marriage, domiciled in Australia—either of the parties was not of marriageable age within the meaning of Part II;

                     (c)  the parties are within a prohibited relationship within the meaning of section 23B; or

                     (d)  the consent of either of the parties was not a real consent for a reason set out in subparagraph 23B(1)(d)(i), (ii) or (iii).

             (3)  Where neither of the parties to a marriage to which this Part applies was, at the time of the marriage, domiciled in Australia, the marriage shall not be recognised as valid in accordance with subsection (1) at any time while either party is under the age of 16 years.

             (4)  A marriage solemnised in a foreign country, being a marriage to which this Part applies, shall not be recognised as valid in accordance with subsection (1) at any time while the marriage is voidable:

                     (a)  except in a case to which paragraph (b) applies—under the local law; or

                     (b)  if the marriage was solemnised in a foreign country by or in the presence of a diplomatic or consular officer of another foreign country—under the law of that other foreign country.

             (5)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Part, where:

                     (a)  a marriage (in this subsection referred to as the **_initial marriage_**) has, whether before or after the commencement of this Part, been solemnised in a foreign country;

                     (b)  at the time of the solemnisation of the initial marriage, that marriage was not recognised in Australia as valid;

                     (c)  after the solemnisation of the initial marriage, and whether before or after the commencement of this Part, either party to that marriage entered into another marriage (in this subsection referred to as the **_subsequent marriage_**); and

                     (d)  at the time when the subsequent marriage was solemnised:

                              (i)  the subsequent marriage was recognised in Australia as valid; and

                             (ii)  the initial marriage was not recognised in Australia as valid;

the initial marriage shall not be recognised at any time in Australia as valid.

##### <a id="88E"></a>88E  Validity of certain marriages not affected by this Part

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), a marriage solemnised in a foreign country that would be recognised as valid under the common law rules of private international law but is not required by the provisions of this Part apart from this subsection to be recognised as valid shall be recognised in Australia as valid, and the operation of this subsection shall not be limited by any implication arising from any other provision of this Part.

             (2)  Notwithstanding subsection (1), a marriage of a person domiciled in Australia, being a marriage solemnised in a foreign country, shall not be recognised in Australia as valid if, at the time of the marriage, either party to the marriage was not of marriageable age within the meaning of Part II.

             (3)  Where a marriage solemnised in a foreign country is not required by virtue of this Part to be recognised in Australia as valid, this Part shall not be taken to limit or exclude the operation of a provision of any other law of the Commonwealth, or of a law of a State or Territory, that provides, expressly or impliedly, for such a marriage to be recognised as a valid marriage for the purposes of the law in which the provision is included.

             (4)  This Part shall not be taken to limit or exclude the operation of a provision of any other law of the Commonwealth, or of a law of a State or Territory, that deems a union in the nature of a marriage to be a marriage for the purposes of the law in which the provision is included.

##### <a id="88EA"></a>88EA  Certain unions are not marriages

                   A union solemnised in a foreign country between:

                     (a)  a man and another man; or

                     (b)  a woman and another woman;

must not be recognised as a marriage in Australia.

##### <a id="88F"></a>88F  Incidental determination of recognition of certain foreign marriages

                   Notwithstanding any other law, the question whether a marriage solemnised in a foreign country is to be recognised in Australia as valid shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of this Part, whether or not the determination of the question is incidental to the determination of another question.

##### <a id="88G"></a>88G  Evidence

             (1)  A document purporting to be either the original or a certified copy of a certificate, entry or record of a marriage alleged to have been solemnised in, or under the law of, a foreign country and purporting to have been issued by:

                     (a)  in the case of a marriage alleged to have been solemnised in a foreign country—an authority of that country or of that part of the country in which the marriage was allegedly solemnised; or

                     (b)  in the case of a marriage alleged to have been solemnised under the law of a foreign country—an authority of that country;

is, for all purposes, _prima facie_ evidence of the facts stated in the document and of the validity of the marriage to which the document relates.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply to or in relation to a document if it is proved that the authority of the foreign country or of the part of a foreign country by which the document purports to have been issued was not, at the time of issue, a competent authority.

             (3)  In subsection (2), **_competent authority_** means:

                     (a)  in relation to a foreign country:

                              (i)  any authority that is prescribed in relation to that country by regulations made for the purposes of this paragraph; or

                             (ii)  any other authority that is competent, under the law in force in that country, to issue the original or a certified copy of a certificate, entry or record of a marriage solemnised in, or under the law of, that country; and

                     (b)  in relation to a part of a foreign country:

                              (i)  any authority that is prescribed in relation to that part of that country by regulations made for the purposes of this paragraph; or

                             (ii)  any other authority that is competent, under the law in force in that part of that country, to issue the original or a certified copy of a certificate, entry or record of a marriage solemnised in that part of that country.

## Part VI—Legitimation

##### <a id="89"></a>89  Legitimation by virtue of marriage of parents

             (1)  A child (whether born before or after the commencement of this Act) whose parents were not married to each other at the time of his or her birth but have subsequently married each other (whether before or after the commencement of this Act) is, by virtue of the marriage, for all purposes the legitimate child of his or her parents as from his or her birth or the commencement of this Act, whichever was the later.

             (2)  Subsection (1) applies in relation to a child whether or not there was a legal impediment to the marriage of his or her parents at the time of his or her birth and whether or not the child was still living at the time of the marriage or, in the case of a child born before the commencement of this Act, at the commencement of this Act.

             (3)  Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to a child unless:

                     (a)  at the time of the marriage of the child’s parents:

                              (i)  where that marriage took place before the commencement of section 24 of the _Marriage Amendment Act 1985_—the child’s father was domiciled in Australia; or

                             (ii)  in any other case—one of the child’s parents was domiciled in Australia; or

                     (b)  the marriage of the child’s parents took place in Australia, or outside Australia under Part V of this Act or under the _Marriage (Overseas) Act 1955_.

             (4)  Nothing in this section renders ineffective any legitimation that took place before the commencement of this Act by or under a law of a State or Territory or shall be taken to exclude the continued operation of such a law in relation to such a legitimation.

             (5)  This section does not apply in relation to a child so as to affect any estate, right or interest in real or personal property to which a person has become, or may become, entitled, either mediately or immediately, in possession or expectancy, by virtue of a disposition that took effect, or by devolution by law on the death of a person who died, before the marriage of the parents of the child or the commencement of this Act, whichever was the later.

##### <a id="90"></a>90  Legitimacy of children of certain foreign marriages

             (1)  Where:

                     (a)  the parents of a child born illegitimate have married each other or the parents of a child born in a place the law of which did not recognise the status of illegitimacy have married each other;

                     (b)  the marriage took place outside Australia;

                     (c)  neither parent of the child was domiciled in Australia at the time of the marriage; and

                     (d)  the law of the place where a parent of the child was then domiciled did not recognise the status of illegitimacy or, if the law of the place where a parent of the child was then domiciled did recognise that status, the child was, by that law, legitimated by virtue of the marriage;

the child is for all purposes the legitimate child of his or her parents as from the time of the marriage or the commencement of section 25 of the _Marriage Amendment Act 1985_, whichever was the later.

             (2)  Where the relationship of a child and his or her father and mother is, for the purposes of the law of a place, required by a law in force in that place to be determined irrespective of whether or not the father and mother are or have been married to each other, the law of that place shall, for the purposes of this section, be taken not to recognise the status of illegitimacy.

             (3)  Subsection (1) applies in relation to a child:

                     (a)  whether the child was born before or after the commencement of section 25 of the _Marriage Amendment Act 1985_, whether the marriage of the parents of the child took place before or after that commencement and whether or not the child was still living at the time of the marriage or, in the case of a child born before that commencement, at that commencement; and

                     (b)  in the case of a child born illegitimate who, by virtue of the marriage of the child’s parents, was legitimated by the law of the place where a parent of the child was domiciled at the time of the marriage—whether or not the law of the place in which that parent or the other parent was domiciled at the time of the birth of the child permitted or recognised legitimation by subsequent marriage.

##### <a id="91"></a>91  Legitimacy of children of certain void marriages

             (1)  Subject to this section, a child of a marriage that is void shall be deemed for all purposes to be the legitimate child of his or her parents as from his or her birth or the commencement of this Act, whichever was the later, if, at the time of the intercourse that resulted in the birth of the child or the time when the ceremony of marriage took place, whichever was the later, either party to the marriage believed on reasonable grounds that the marriage was valid.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply unless one of the parents of the child was domiciled in Australia at the time of the birth of the child or, having died before that time, was domiciled in Australia immediately before his or her death.

             (3)  Subsection (1) applies in relation to a child whether the child was born before or after the commencement of this Act, whether the ceremony of marriage took place before or after the commencement of this Act and whether the ceremony of marriage took place in or outside Australia.

             (4)  This section does not apply in relation to a child so as to affect any estate, right or interest in real or personal property to which a person has become, or may become, entitled, either mediately or immediately, in possession or expectancy, by virtue of a disposition that took effect, or by devolution by law on the death of a person who died, before the birth of the child or the commencement of this Act, whichever was the later.

##### <a id="92"></a>92  Declarations of legitimacy etc.

             (1)  A person may apply to the Family Court of Australia, the Federal Magistrates Court, a Family Court of a State or the Supreme Court of a State or Territory for an order declaring:

                     (a)  that the person is the legitimate child of his or her parents; or

                     (b)  that the person or his or her parent or child or a remoter ancestor or descendant is or was a legitimated person;

and the Court may, in its discretion, make the order.

             (2)  The Supreme Courts of the States and any Family Court of a State are invested with federal jurisdiction and jurisdiction is conferred, to the extent that the Constitution permits, on the Supreme Courts of the Territories, to hear and determine applications under this section.

             (4)  The Court to which an application under this section is made may:

                     (a)  direct that notice of the application be given to such persons (who may include the Attorney‑General of the Commonwealth or of a State or the Northern Territory) as the Court thinks fit;

                     (b)  direct that a person be made a party to the application; or

                     (c)  permit a person having an interest in the matter to intervene in, and become a party to, the proceedings.

             (5)  Where the Court makes an order upon the application, it may include in the order such particulars in relation to the legitimacy or legitimation of the person to whom it relates as the Court finds to be established.

             (6)  An order made under this section binds the Crown in right of the Commonwealth or of a State or the Northern Territory or Norfolk Island, whether or not notice was given to the Attorney‑General of the Commonwealth or of that State or Territory, but does not affect:

                     (a)  the rights of another person unless that other person was:

                              (i)  a party to the proceedings for the order or a person claiming through such a party; or

                             (ii)  a person to whom notice of the application for the order was given or a person claiming through such a person; or

                     (b)  an earlier judgment, order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, whether in exercise of federal jurisdiction or not.

             (7)  The Governor‑General may, by Proclamation, fix a date as the date on and after which proceedings under this section may not be instituted in, or transferred to, the Supreme Court of a State or Territory specified in the Proclamation and that Supreme Court shall not hear and determine any such proceedings so instituted in, or transferred to, that Court on or after that date.

##### <a id="93"></a>93  Operation of certain State and Territory laws

             (1)  Nothing in this Part shall be taken to operate in relation to a child so as to affect the validity or effect of an adoption of the child, whether the adoption took place before, or takes place after, the commencement of this Act.

             (2)  Nothing in this Part shall be taken to exclude the operation of a law of a State or Territory in so far as it provides for the making or altering of entries in a register, but a legitimation under this Part is not affected by any failure to comply with such a law.

             (3)  Nothing in this Part shall be taken to affect the validity or effect of a law of a State or Territory (however expressed and whether enacted before or after the commencement of this subsection) that operates to require a child born to a woman as a result of the carrying out of a artificial conception procedure in relation to the woman:

                     (a)  to be treated as the child of the woman;

                     (b)  to be treated as the child of the woman and a particular man; or

                     (c)  to be treated as the child of a particular man.

             (3)  For the purposes of subsection (2), proof by a defendant that the defendant’s spouse had been continually absent from the defendant for the period of 7 years immediately preceding the date of the alleged offence and that, at the time of the alleged offence, the defendant had no reason to believe that the defendant’s spouse had been alive at any time within that period is sufficient proof of the matters referred to in paragraph (2)(b).

          (7A)  In a prosecution for an offence against this section, the court may receive as evidence of the facts stated in it a document purporting to be either the original or a certified copy of a certificate, entry or record of a marriage alleged to have taken place whether in Australia or elsewhere.

             (8)  This section operates to the exclusion of any law of a State or Territory making it an offence:

                     (a)  for a person who is married to go through a form or ceremony of marriage with any person; or

                     (b)  for a person to go through a form or ceremony of marriage with a person who is married;

             (1)  Section 4 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ applies in relation to the provisions that are to come into operation on a date to be fixed by Proclamation as if those provisions were an Act.

                     (c)  any power conferred on a prescribed authority may be exercised;

at any time after the day on which the Proclamation under section 2 has been published in the _Gazette_ and before the commencement of this Act, as if the provisions of this Act to which the Proclamation relates had come into operation on that day.

             (3)  For the purposes of the operation of subsection (2), any person who is authorised under a law of a State or Territory to solemnise marriages shall be deemed to be an authorised celebrant.

             (2)  For the purposes of the application of section 98 and subsection 104(1) to and in relation to an act done or a notice given at a time before the commencement of this Act in relation to such a marriage, a person who at that time was authorised under a law of a State or Territory to solemnise marriages shall be deemed to have been an authorised celebrant at that time.

             (2)  Where the consent of a person to the marriage of a minor has, before the commencement of this Act, been dispensed with in pursuance of a law of a State or Territory, the consent of that person shall, if the marriage in respect of which it was dispensed with takes place after the commencement of this Act in that State or Territory, be deemed to have been dispensed with by a prescribed authority under Part II.

## Part IX—Miscellaneous

##### <a id="111"></a>111  Certain marriages and legitimations to be valid in all the Territories

             (2)  A person who is, or is deemed to be, as from a particular time, the legitimate child of that person’s parents by virtue of section 89, 90 or 91 is, or shall be deemed to be, for all purposes the legitimate child of that person’s parents as from that time in the external Territories.

             (3)  The operation of subsection (2) in relation to a child to whom section 89 or 91 applies is subject to a like qualification to that provided by subsection 89(5) or 91(4), as the case requires.

##### <a id="111A"></a>111A  Abolition of action for breach of promise

##### <a id="112"></a>112  Interpreters at marriage ceremonies

             (1)  Subject to this section, where the person by whom or in whose presence a marriage is to be solemnised considers that it is desirable to do so, the person may use the services of an interpreter, not being a party to the marriage, in or in connexion with the ceremony.

             (2)  A person shall not solemnise a marriage in or in connexion with the ceremony of which the services of an interpreter are used unless the person has received a statutory declaration by the interpreter stating that the interpreter understands, and is able to converse in, the languages in respect of which he or she is to act as interpreter.

             (3)  A person who has acted as interpreter in or in connexion with a ceremony of marriage shall, forthwith after the ceremony has taken place, furnish to the person solemnising the marriage a certificate signed by the first‑mentioned person, in the prescribed form, of the faithful performance of the first‑mentioned person’s services as interpreter.

             (4)  This section applies in relation to marriages to which Division 2 of Part IV applies and marriages under Part V.

##### <a id="113"></a>113  Second marriage ceremonies

             (1)  Except in accordance with this section:

                     (a)  persons who are already legally married to each other shall not, in Australia or under Part V, go through a form or ceremony of marriage with each other; and

                     (b)  a person who is authorised by this Act to solemnise marriages shall not purport to solemnise a marriage in Australia or under Part V between persons who inform the first‑mentioned person that they are already legally married to each other or whom the first‑mentioned person knows or has reason to believe to be already legally married to each other.

             (2)  Where:

                     (a)  2 persons have gone through a form or ceremony of marriage with each other, whether before or after the commencement of this Act; and

                     (b)  there is a doubt:

                              (i)  whether those persons are legally married to each other;

                             (ii)  where the form or ceremony of marriage took place outside Australia, whether the marriage would be recognised as valid by a court in Australia; or

                            (iii)  whether their marriage could be proved in legal proceedings;

those persons may, subject to this section, go through a form or ceremony of marriage with each other in accordance with Division 2 of Part IV or under Part V as if they had not previously gone through a form or ceremony of marriage with each other.

             (3)  Where 2 persons wish to go through a form or ceremony of marriage with each other in pursuance of subsection (2), they shall furnish to the person by whom, or in whose presence, the form or ceremony is to take place or be performed:

                     (a)  a statutory declaration by them stating that they have previously gone through a form or ceremony of marriage with each other and specifying the date on which, the place at which and the circumstances in which they went through that form or ceremony; and

                     (b)  a certificate by a barrister or solicitor, being a certificate endorsed on the statutory declaration, that, on the facts stated in the declaration, there is, in his or her opinion, a doubt as to one of the matters specified in paragraph (2)(b).

             (4)  The person by whom or in whose presence a form or ceremony of marriage takes place or is performed in pursuance of subsection (2) shall make an endorsement in accordance with the regulations on each certificate issued in respect of it.

          (4A)  A marriage which takes place after the commencement of this subsection in pursuance of subsection (2) is not invalid by reason of any failure to comply with the requirements of subsection (3) or (4).

             (5)  Nothing in this Act shall be taken to prevent 2 persons who are already legally married to each other from going through a religious ceremony of marriage with each other in Australia where those persons have:

                     (a)  produced to the person by whom or in whose presence the ceremony is to be performed a certificate of their existing marriage; and

                     (b)  furnished to that person a statement in writing, signed by them and witnessed by that person, that:

                              (i)  they have previously gone through a form or ceremony of marriage with each other;

                             (ii)  they are the parties mentioned in the certificate of marriage produced with the statement; and

                            (iii)  they have no reason to believe that they are not legally married to each other or, if their marriage took place outside Australia, they have no reason to believe that it would not be recognised as valid in Australia.

             (6)  The provisions of sections 42, 44, 50 and 51 do not apply to or in relation to a religious ceremony of marriage in accordance with subsection (5) and the person by whom, or in whose presence, the ceremony is performed shall not:

                     (a)  prepare or issue in respect of it any certificate of marriage under or referring to this Act; or

                     (b)  issue any other document to the parties in respect of the ceremony unless the parties are described in the document as being already legally married to each other.

             (7)  A person who is not an authorised celebrant does not commit an offence against section 101 by reason only of his or her having performed a religious ceremony of marriage between parties who have complied with the requirements of subsection (5) of this section.

##### <a id="114"></a>114  Correction of errors in marriage registries

             (1)  In this section, **_the registrar_** means the Registrar of Foreign Marriages or the Registrar of Overseas Marriages.

             (2)  Where the registrar is satisfied that a register of marriages kept by the registrar contains an error or a mis‑statement in, or an omission from, the particulars of a marriage entered in it, the registrar may correct the register by causing the true particulars of the marriage or the particulars omitted from the register, as the case may be, to be entered in the margin of the register opposite to the entry of the marriage.

             (3)  Where the registrar causes particulars to be entered in the margin of a register under this section, the registrar shall sign his or her name immediately under those particulars and write in the margin the date on which the particulars were so entered.

             (4)  The registrar may, before correcting an error, mis‑statement or omission under this section, require the true particulars of the marriage, or the particulars omitted from the register, as the case may be, to be verified by the statutory declaration of the parties to the marriage or a person who satisfies the registrar that that person has personal knowledge of those particulars.

             (5)  Subject to subsection (6), where a copy of, or extract from, an entry in a register of marriages that has been corrected under this section is issued, the copy or extract shall contain the particulars that would be contained in the entry if the particulars in fact contained in the entry were corrected so as to accord with the particulars entered in the margin of the register.

             (6)  A copy of, or extract from, an entry in a register shall contain the particulars contained in the entry and the particulars entered, in relation to the entry, in the margin of the register if the registrar is satisfied that the person requiring a copy or extract has proper reasons for requiring a copy or extract containing those particulars.

##### <a id="115"></a>115  Publication of lists of authorised celebrants

             (1)  The Minister shall cause to be published in such manner as the Minister considers appropriate, as soon as practicable after each 14 March:

             (3)  The list referred to in paragraph (1)(b) shall show the full name, designation (if any) and address of each prescribed authority.
