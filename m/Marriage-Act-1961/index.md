	(5)	Where an order is made under this section and the marriage to which the order relates does not take place within 3 months after the date of the order, the order ceases to have effect.
13  Marriage of minor not to be solemnized without consent of parents etc.

	(a)	in respect of each person whose consent is required by this Act to the marriage of the minor, not being a person to whom paragraph (b) is applicable:
	(i)	the consent in writing of that person, duly witnessed and dated not earlier than 3 months before the date on which the marriage is solemnized or, in such cases as are prescribed, such other evidence that the consent of that person to the intended marriage has been given not earlier than that time as the regulations declare to be sufficient for the purposes of this section; or
	(ii)	an effective consent in writing of a magistrate or a Judge under this Part in place of the consent of that person; and
	(b)	in respect of any person whose consent to the marriage of the minor has been dispensed with by a prescribed authority—the dispensation in writing signed by the prescribed authority.

	(3)	A person shall not subscribe his or her name as a witness to the signature of a person to a consent to a marriage unless:
	(a)	the person is satisfied on reasonable grounds as to the identity of that person; and
	(b)	the consent bears the date on which the person subscribes his or her name as a witness.
	(4)	A person shall not solemnize a marriage if the person has reason to believe that:
	(a)	a person whose consent in writing to the marriage of one of the parties is or has been produced for the purposes of this section has revoked his or her consent;
	(b)	the signature of a person to a consent produced for the purposes of this section is forged or has been obtained by fraud;
	(c)	a consent produced for the purposes of this section has been altered in a material particular without authority; or
	(d)	a dispensation with the consent of a person that has been produced in relation to the marriage has ceased to have effect.
14  Persons whose consent is required
	(1)	The person or persons whose consent is required by this Act to the marriage of a minor shall, subject to this section, be ascertained by reference to the Schedule according to the facts and circumstances existing in relation to the minor.
	(2)	For the purposes of the Schedule, a minor is an adopted child if the minor was adopted under the law of a State or Territory or under the law of any other place.
	(3)	Where an Act, a State Act or an Ordinance of any Territory of the Commonwealth provides that a person specified in the Act, State Act or Ordinance is to be the guardian of a minor, or requires that a specified person is to be deemed to be the guardian of a minor, to the exclusion of any parent or other guardian of the minor, that person is the person whose consent is required by this Act to the marriage of the minor.
	(4)	Where, under a State Act or an Ordinance of any Territory of the Commonwealth, a person specified in the State Act or Ordinance is to be, or is to be deemed to be, a guardian of a minor in addition to the parents or other guardian of the minor, the consent of that person is required to the marriage of the minor in addition to the consent of the person or persons ascertained in accordance with the Schedule.
15  Prescribed authority may dispense with consent in certain cases
	(1)	Subject to this section, a prescribed authority may, upon application in writing by a minor, dispense with the consent of a person to a proposed marriage of the minor where the prescribed authority:
	(a)	is satisfied that it is impracticable, or that it is impracticable without delay that would, in all the circumstances of the case, be unreasonable, to ascertain the views of that person with respect to the proposed marriage;
	(b)	has no reason to believe that that person would refuse his or her consent to the proposed marriage; and
	(c)	has no reason to believe that facts may exist by reason of which it could reasonably be considered improper that the consent should be dispensed with.
	(2)	An application under this section shall be supported by a statutory declaration by the applicant setting out the facts and circumstances on which the application is based and may be supported by the statutory declaration of some other person.
	(3)	The applicant shall state in his or her statutory declaration whether he or she has made any previous applications under this section that have been refused and the date on which each such application was refused.
	(4)	This section does not authorize a prescribed authority to dispense with the consent of a person to a marriage of a minor where any other person whose consent to the marriage is required by this Act has refused to give consent, unless a magistrate or a Judge has, in pursuance of this Part, given consent in place of the consent of that other person.
	(5)	For the purposes of this section, the fact that a person does not reside in, or is absent from, Australia shall not of itself be deemed to make it impracticable to ascertain the views of that person.
16  Consent by magistrate where parent etc. refuses consent etc.
	(1)	Where, in relation to a proposed marriage of a minor:
	(a)	a person whose consent to the marriage is required by this Act refuses to consent to the marriage; or
	(b)	an application by the minor under section 15 to dispense with the consent of a person to the marriage is refused;
the minor may apply to a Judge or magistrate for the consent of a Judge or the magistrate to the marriage in place of the consent of that person.
	(2)	The Judge or magistrate shall, subject to subsections (2A) and (3), hold an inquiry into the relevant facts and circumstances and, if satisfied:
	(a)	in a case to which paragraph (1)(a) applies—that the person who has refused to consent to the marriage has refused consent unreasonably; or
	(b)	in a case to which paragraph (1)(b) applies—that, having proper regard for the welfare of the minor, it would be unreasonable for the Judge or magistrate to refuse consent to the proposed marriage;
may give consent to the marriage in place of the consent of the person in relation to whose consent the application is made.
	(2A)	A Judge or magistrate shall not proceed with an inquiry in accordance with subsection (2) unless:
	(a)	there has been produced to the Judge or magistrate a certificate in the prescribed form signed by a family and child counsellor certifying that the applicant has received counselling from the family and child counsellor in relation to the proposed marriage; or
	(b)	the Judge or magistrate is satisfied that counselling by a family and child counsellor is not reasonably available to the applicant.

	(2)	The fact that an application is heard or dealt with in contravention of subsection (1) does not affect the validity of an order made, or the effectiveness of a consent given, upon the application or the re‑hearing of the application or make ineffective any dispensation with a consent granted on the application.
20  Effect of consent of magistrate or Judge
		Subject to section 21, where a magistrate or a Judge gives his or her consent to the marriage of a minor in place of the consent of another person, his or her consent operates, for the purposes of this Act, as the consent of that other person.

	(4)	Where a party to an intended marriage is unable, after reasonable inquiry, to ascertain all of the particulars in relation to that party required to be contained in a notice under this section, the failure to include in the notice such of those particulars as the party is unable to ascertain does not make the notice ineffective for the purposes of this section if, at any time before the marriage is solemnized, that party furnishes to the authorized celebrant solemnizing the marriage a statutory declaration as to that party’s inability to ascertain the particulars not included in the notice and the reason for that inability.
	(5)	A prescribed authority may, if satisfied that the circumstances of the particular case justify so doing:

	(a)	unless the authorized celebrant has satisfied himself or herself that the parties are the parties referred to in the notice given under this section in relation to the marriage; or
	(b)	if the authorized celebrant has reason to believe that:
	(i)	a notice given under this section; or
	 (ii)	a declaration made and subscribed under this section, or a statutory declaration made for the purposes of this section;
in relation to the marriage, contains a false statement or an error or is defective.
	(9)	An authorized celebrant may permit an error in a notice under this section to be corrected in his or her presence by either of the parties at any time before the marriage to which it relates has been solemnized and may treat the corrected notice as having been originally given in its corrected form.
	(10)	Where the declaration made by a party under subsection (1) states that that party is a divorced person or a widow or widower, an authorized celebrant shall not solemnize the marriage unless there is produced to him or her evidence of that party’s divorce, or of the death of that party’s spouse, as the case requires.
42A  Commissioner of Australian Federal Police or approved authority may issue special notice
	(1)	If the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police or a person who is an approved authority for the purposes of the Witness Protection Act 1994 gives to a Registrar a certificate under section 14 of that Act stating that the person has received the evidence referred to in paragraphs (b) and (c) of that section and the statutory declaration referred to in paragraph (d) of that section, the Registrar:
	(a)	if he or she is to solemnise the marriage himself or herself—is to treat the certificate as satisfying the requirements of section 42; or
	(b)	in any other case—is to give to the celebrant a notice in the prescribed form stating that the celebrant should treat the requirements of section 42 of this Act as having been met.
	(2)	The names specified in the certificate are to be used in the marriage certificate.
43  Marriage may be solemnized on any day etc.
		A marriage may be solemnized on any day, at any time and at any place.
44  Witnesses
		A marriage shall not be solemnized unless at least 2 persons who are, or appear to the person solemnizing the marriage to be, over the age of 18 years are present as witnesses.
45  Form of ceremony
	(1)	Where a marriage is solemnized by or in the presence of an authorized celebrant, being a minister of religion, it may be solemnized according to any form and ceremony recognized as sufficient for the purpose by the religious body or organization of which he or she is a minister.
	(2)	Where a marriage is solemnized by or in the presence of an authorized celebrant, not being a minister of religion, it is sufficient if each of the parties says to the other, in the presence of the authorized celebrant and the witnesses, the words:
“I call upon the persons here present to witness that I, A.B. (or C.D.), take thee, C.D. (or A.B.), to be my lawful wedded wife (or husband)”;
or words to that effect.
	(3)	Where a marriage has been solemnized by or in the presence of an authorized celebrant, a certificate of the marriage prepared and signed in accordance with section 50 is conclusive evidence that the marriage was solemnized in accordance with this section.

	(a)	where the fact that the marriage ceremony took place is in issue—as to that fact; or
	(b)	where the identity of a party to the marriage is in issue—as to the identity of that party.
46  Certain authorised celebrants to explain nature of marriage relationship
