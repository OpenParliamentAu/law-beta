                     (a)  is not consenting under subsection 57(2); or

                     (b)  is revoking his or her consent under subsection 57(3);

because he or she believes that the terms and conditions of employment, taken as a whole, that would apply to the staff member on and after his or her transfer time are not equivalent to the terms and conditions of employment, taken as a whole, applying to the staff member immediately before his or her transfer time.

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  accrued an entitlement to Long Service Leave Act benefits, recreation leave benefits and sickness leave benefits; and

                     (b)  an entitlement to recognition by Newco of years of service in connection with that employment;

that is equivalent to the entitlement that the person had as an officer or employee of the Authority, immediately before his or her transfer time.

             (4)  The post‑sale transferee is not entitled to receive any payment or other benefit by reason only of having ceased to be an officer or employee of the Authority because of this Act.

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not apply to a staff member who does not consent under subsection 59(2), or has revoked his or her consent under subsection 59(3), because the terms and conditions of employment, taken as a whole, that would apply to the staff member on and after his or her transfer time have been determined not to be equivalent in accordance with the staff transfer agreement to the terms and conditions of employment, taken as a whole, applying to the staff member immediately before his or her transfer time.

            (1)        If:

                   (b)    the acquisition would be invalid because of paragraph 51(xxxi) of the Constitution;

there is payable to the person by the Commonwealth such reasonable amount of compensation as is agreed upon between the person and the Commonwealth or, failing agreement, as is determined by the Federal Court.

             (2)  Any damages or compensation recovered or other remedy given in proceedings which are instituted otherwise than under this item must be taken into account in assessing compensation payable in proceedings that are instituted under this item and that arise out of the same event or transaction.

(3)       In this item:

                    <a name="acquisit-properti"></a>**_acquisition of property_** has the same meaning as in paragraph 51(xxxi) of the Constitution.

## 4  Saving provisions

                   (b)    the notification of that dispute has not been withdrawn or taken to have been withdrawn, and the dispute has not been resolved either through arbitration or proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia;

the provisions of Part 6 of that Act are taken to continue in force, in relation to that access dispute, until the notification of the dispute is withdrawn or taken to have been withdrawn, or until the dispute is resolved.

             (2)  A determination made under Part 6 of the MSP Act that is in force immediately before the commencement of this item continues in force after that commencement despite the repeal of that Part.

             (3)  If an access dispute referred to in subitem (1) is resolved under Part 6 of the MSP Act as continued in force for the purpose of resolving that dispute by the making of a determination at a time after the commencement of this item, that determination continues in force despite the repeal of that Part.

             (4)  For the purposes only of:

                    (a)    permitting the review by the Australian Competition Tribunal of a determination continued in force under subitem (2) or (3); and

                   (b)    facilitating the enforcement of a determination so continued in force; and

                    (c)    permitting appeals to the Federal Court of Australia from determinations so continued in force;

Part 6 of the MSP Act is taken to continue in force as if it had not been repealed.

             (5)  In this item:

                    <a name=""></a><a name="accc"></a>**_ACCC_** has the same meaning as in Part 6 of the MSP Act **_._**

                     (b)  the thing is taken, made, given or done under a provision of a Part 2 Act that had effect immediately before the commencement of this Act;

then the thing has the corresponding effect, for the purposes of the Part 2 Act as amended by this Act, as if it had been taken, made, given or done under the Part 2 Act as so amended.

             (2)  In this section:
