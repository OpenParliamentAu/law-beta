(1)        A person must not enter into a transaction if the transaction has the result, in relation to a Medibank Private company, that an unacceptable ownership situation comes into existence in relation to the company.

(2)        If an unacceptable ownership situation exists in relation to a Medibank Private company because there is or are one or more persons each of whom holds a particular type of stake in that company of more than 15%, a person must not enter into a transaction if the transaction has the result that there is an increase in any type of stake held by any of those persons.

(3)        A contravention of subitem (1) or (2) is not an offence. However, it is a ground for obtaining an injunction under Part 7.

## 29  Compliance by Medibank Private company

(1)        A Medibank Private company must take all reasonable steps to ensure that an unacceptable ownership situation does not exist in relation to the company.
