             (8)  For the purposes of this Act, a regulated insurance contract **_breaches the minimum cover rules_** if subsection 17(2), 18(3) or 19(3) applies to the regulated insurance contract.

Claim against health care professional during particular period

             (9)  A reference in this Act, in relation to:

                     (a)  a contract of insurance under which the insurer provides medical indemnity cover for a health care professional; or

                     (b)  an offer by an insurer to provide medical indemnity cover for a health care professional;

to a compensation claim against the health care professional being made, or having to be made, during a particular period is a reference to any one or more of the following happening, or having to happen, during that period:

                     (c)  the compensation claim being made against the health care professional;

                     (d)  the compensation claim being notified to the insurer;

                     (e)  the health care incident to which the compensation claim relates being notified to the insurer;

                      (f)  a claim being made against the insurer in relation to the compensation claim;

                     (g)  an event prescribed by the regulations.

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Providing medical indemnity cover

             (1)  A person **_provides medical indemnity cover_** for a health care professional if, under an arrangement, the person must or may indemnify the health care professional in relation to claims that may be made against the health care professional in relation to health care incidents.

             (2)  The arrangement:

                     (a)  may be one under which the indemnity is provided at the person’s discretion; and

                     (b)  may be, but need not be, an arrangement between the person and the health care professional; and

                     (c)  may be:

                              (i)  one under which the health care professional is indemnified directly; or

                             (ii)  one under which the health care professional is indemnified indirectly through an entity or entities interposed between the person and the health care professional.

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Claims-made based cover and incident-occurring based cover

             (1)  This section tells you what is meant by **_claims-made based cover_** and **_incident-occurring based cover_** when those terms are used in this Act. There are some kinds of medical indemnity cover that fall outside both those terms.

             (2)  For the purposes of this Act, the cover provided for by a contract of insurance is **_claims-made based cover_** if:

                     (a)  under the contract, the insurer provides medical indemnity cover for a health care professional in relation to a compensation claim against the health care professional in relation to a health care incident only if:

                              (i)  the incident occurs during a period specified in the contract (the **_incidents period_**); and

                             (ii)  the compensation claim is made against the health care professional during a period specified in the contract (the **_claims period_**); and

                     (b)  the incidents period is not a period that has ended before the claims period begins; and

                     (c)  the claims period is fixed.

Note 1:       Subparagraph (a)(ii)—subsection 4(9) operates on the reference in this subparagraph to the claim being made during a period.

Note 2:       Pure ERB cover (which has a defined incidents period that ends before the claims period begins) does not qualify because of paragraph (b). DDR cover (which does not have a fixed claims period) does not qualify because of paragraph (c).

             (3)  To avoid doubt, the claims period for the contract is taken to be fixed even if the claims period is capable of being extended:

                     (a)  by agreement between the parties to the contract; or

                     (b)  by renewal of the contract.

             (4)  For the purposes of this Act, the cover provided for by a contract of insurance is **_incident-occurring based cover_** if:

                     (a)  under the contract, the insurer provides medical indemnity cover for a health care professional in relation to a compensation claim in relation to a health care incident only if the incident occurs during a period specified in the contract; and

                     (b)  under the contract, the insurer provides that medical indemnity cover:

                              (i)  regardless of when the compensation claim is made against the health care professional; and

                             (ii)  whether or not the health care professional has died, become permanently disabled or retired.

Note:          ERB cover (which has a fixed claims period) does not qualify because of subparagraph (b)(i) and DDR cover does not qualify because of subparagraph (b)(ii).

##### <a id="7"></a>7  When certain DDR arrangements are taken to be entered into

             (1)  For the purposes of this Act, if:

                     (a)  under an arrangement, a person (the **_cover provider_**) will or may provide medical indemnity cover of a particular kind for a health care professional; and

                     (b)  the cover provider will or may provide that cover only if:

                              (i)  a particular period has expired; and

                             (ii)  the health care professional dies, becomes permanently disabled or retires; and

                     (c)  the arrangement is not a contract of insurance;

the cover provider is taken to **_enter into_** the arrangement, to the extent to which it relates to that cover, at the earliest time at which:

                     (d)  there are no conditions that need to be satisfied for the cover to be provided for the health care professional; or

                     (e)  the only conditions that need to be satisfied for the cover to be provided for the health care professional are conditions that relate to:

                              (i)  payments being made to the cover provider for the cover; or

                             (ii)  the making of a claim against the cover provider under the arrangement.

             (2)  Without limiting subparagraph (1)(b)(i), the period referred to in that subparagraph may be specified as a minimum period during which the health care professional is a member of a particular body.

##### <a id="7A"></a>7A  Reasonableness of premiums

                   In deciding whether the premium payable by an insured under a contract of insurance for particular cover is reasonable, regard is to be had to:

                     (a)  the nature of the risks being assumed by the insurer; and

                     (b)  the claims handling expenses, and other administrative expenses, the insurer has incurred and can reasonably be expected to incur; and

                     (c)  the expenses the insurer can reasonably be expected to incur in obtaining appropriate reinsurance; and

                     (d)  the expenses the insurer can reasonably be expected to incur in capital raising and prudential compliance; and

                     (e)  the amount that represents a reasonable profit margin for the insurer; and

                      (f)  the amount of any relevant taxes or statutory charges payable by the insurer; and

                     (g)  the information provided, or not provided, to the insurer by the client in relation to matters relevant to assessing the risk being assumed by the insurer; and

                     (h)  the amount that represents provisioning for future liabilities for medical indemnity cover that may be required to be offered under section 23 for a premium that does not reflect the cost of providing that medical indemnity cover; and

                      (i)  the receipt, or probable receipt, of Commonwealth assistance in relation to provision of the medical indemnity cover; and

                      (j)  such other matters as are specified in regulations made for the purposes of this paragraph.

                              (i)  regardless of where any resulting arrangement is entered into; and

                             (ii)  recommends that someone enter into or renew;

                            an arrangement under which a person (the **_cover provider_**) provides, or would provide, medical indemnity cover for a health care professional; and

## Part 3—Product standards for medical indemnity insurance contracts

### Division 1—Minimum cover

##### <a id="16"></a>16  Minimum cover amount

                     (a)  $5 million; or

                     (b)  such other amount as is prescribed by the regulations.

##### <a id="17"></a>17  Minimum cover for single claim

Circumstances in which section applies

             (1)  This subsection applies to a person if:

                     (a)  under a contract of insurance (the **_relevant contract_**), the person provides medical indemnity cover for a health care professional; and

                     (b)  the health care professional is:

                              (i)  a medical practitioner; or

                             (ii)  a registered health professional prescribed by the regulations.

Offence

             (2)  A person (the **_insurer_**) commits an offence if:

                     (a)  subsection (1) applies to the insurer; and

                     (b)  the relevant contract is entered into, comes into effect or is renewed at a particular time on or after <st1:date style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x" year="2003" day="1" month="7">1 July 2003</st1:date>; and

                     (c)  the maximum amount payable by the insurer under the relevant contract in relation to a single compensation claim made against the health care professional would, but for subsection (4), be less than the minimum cover amount applicable at that time.

                    Penalty:  Imprisonment for 12 months.

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not apply if it would be reasonable to assume, at the time the relevant contract is entered into, comes into effect or is renewed, that every health care incident to which the compensation claim would relate would be one occurring outside <st1:country-region><st1:place style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x">Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region> and the external Territories.

Note:          A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in this subsection (see subsection 13.3(3) of the _Criminal Code_).

Maximum amount payable for single claim

                     (a)  an otherwise uncovered prior incident of the health care professional; or

                     (b)  a compensation claim in relation to an incident of that kind;

                     (c)  the insurer has reasonable grounds for believing that the offer does extend to all the health care professional’s otherwise uncovered prior incidents.

Note:          A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in this subsection (see subsection 13.3(3) of the _Criminal Code)_.

          (4A)  The insurer commits an offence against subsection (1), (3) or (4) only if regulations are in force for the purposes of subparagraph (1)(c)(i) both:

                     (a)  when the event referred to in paragraph (1)(b) occurs; and

                     (b)  when the period of 28 days referred to in subparagraph (1)(c)(ii) ends.

If this is so, the requirements that the compulsory offer must satisfy are those specified in the regulations as in force when the event referred to in paragraph (1)(b) occurs.

Defences for offences against subsections (1), (3) and (4)

             (5)  Subsections (1), (3) and (4) do not apply if every health care incident covered by the regulated insurance contract is, or would be, one occurring outside Australia and the external Territories.

Note:          A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in this subsection (see subsection 13.3(3) of the _Criminal Code)_.

             (6)  Subsection (1) does not apply if:

                     (a)  the insurer makes an offer for the purposes of subsection (1); and

                     (b)  the only reason why the offer does not satisfy subparagraph (1)(c)(i) is that the offer does not extend to some of the health care professional’s otherwise uncovered prior incidents; and

                     (c)  the insurer has reasonable grounds for believing that the offer does extend to all the health care professional’s otherwise uncovered prior incidents.

Note:          A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in this subsection (see subsection 13.3(3) of the _Criminal Code)_.

Compulsory offer has no effect in certain circumstances<o:p></o:p>

             (7)  A compulsory offer made by an insurer for the purposes of subsection (1) ceases to have effect if the winding up of the insurer starts before the offer is accepted.

Note:          An insurer must not carry on insurance business after the winding up of the insurer has started: see section 116 of the _Insurance Act 1973_.

Effect of subsection (1)<o:p></o:p>

             (8)  Subsection (1) has effect subject to section 116 of the _Insurance Act 1973_.

Note:          This means that an insurer does not have to make a compulsory offer for the purposes of subsection (1) once the winding up of the insurer has started.

### Division 2A—Provision of run-off cover to certain medical practitioners

##### <a id="26A"></a>26A  Provision of run-off cover to certain medical practitioners

Offence—compulsory provision of medical indemnity cover

             (1)  A person (the **_insurer_**) commits an offence if:

                     (a)  the insurer is a medical indemnity insurer; and

                     (b)  the insurer, or another medical indemnity insurer, has provided medical indemnity cover for a medical practitioner (the **_practitioner_**) who is an eligible practitioner; and

                     (c)  the insurer:

                              (i)  is the last medical indemnity insurer to have provided medical indemnity cover for the practitioner in relation to incidents occurring during a medical practice period of the practitioner; or

                             (ii)  has taken over that last medical indemnity insurer; and

                     (d)  the insurer does not provide medical indemnity cover for the practitioner that satisfies all of the requirements of subsection (4); and

                     (e)  in a case where a termination date has been set for the purposes of subsection 34ZB(3) of the _Medical Indemnity Act 2002_—the insurer’s failure to provide that medical indemnity cover occurs before that date.

                    Penalty:  Imprisonment for 12 months.

             (2)  The medical indemnity cover referred to in paragraph (1)(b):

                     (a)  may be medical indemnity cover provided to the practitioner or to someone else; and

                     (b)  need not be medical indemnity cover provided while the practitioner was an eligible practitioner.

When a medical indemnity insurer is taken over

             (3)  The reference in paragraph (1)(c) to a medical indemnity insurer having taken over another medical indemnity insurer is a reference to it having assumed some or all of the financial responsibility for claims:

                     (a)  that are claims in relation to incidents that occurred in the course of, or in connection with, the practitioner’s practice as a medical practitioner; and

                     (b)  with which the other medical indemnity insurer would, but for that assumption of responsibility, have been concerned because of the other medical indemnity insurer having provided medical indemnity cover to the person.

Requirements for medical indemnity cover

             (4)  Medical indemnity cover meets the requirements of this subsection if:

                     (a)  it covers incidents that occurred while the practitioner:

                              (i)  had medical indemnity cover provided by the insurer or any other medical indemnity insurer, or (subject to subsection (6)) by an MDO; and

                             (ii)  was registered or licensed as a medical practitioner under a State or Territory law that provides for the registration or licensing of medical practitioners; and

                     (b)  the nature and range of incidents it covers is at least the same as the nature and range of incidents covered by the last medical indemnity cover provided for the practitioner; and

                     (c)  the contract of insurance under which the medical indemnity cover is provided satisfies subparagraph 34E(1)(e)(ii) of the _Medical Indemnity Act 2002_; and

Note:       Subparagraph 34E(1)(e)(ii) of the _Medical Indemnity Act 2002_ requires that the practitioner’s contract limit (see section 34B of that Act) equals or exceeds the relevant threshold under section 34F of that Act.

                     (d)  it is provided on such terms and conditions (if any) determined in writing by the Minister administering the _Medical Indemnity Act 2002_; and

                     (e)  it provides cover until the practitioner ceases to be an eligible practitioner; and

                      (f)  no premium or other consideration is payable for the medical indemnity cover by the person to whom it is provided.

             (5)  A determination under paragraph (4)(d) is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

             (6)  Subparagraph (4)(a)(i) applies to medical indemnity cover provided by an MDO only if that cover would have been claims-made cover within the meaning of subsections 6(2) and (3) of this Act if it had been provided for by a contract of insurance.

Practitioner etc. need not apply for medical indemnity cover

             (7)  The obligation under subsection (1) to provide medical indemnity cover applies whether or not the practitioner, or any other person, has applied to the insurer for the medical indemnity cover.

Effect of subsection (1)<o:p></o:p>

             (8)  Subsection (1) has effect subject to section 116 of the _Insurance Act 1973_.

Note:          This means that an insurer does not have to provide medical indemnity cover under subsection (1) once the winding up of the insurer has started.
