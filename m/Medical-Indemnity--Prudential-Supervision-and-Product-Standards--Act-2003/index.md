                     (a)  a contract of insurance under which the insurer provides medical indemnity cover for a health care professional; or

                     (b)  an offer by an insurer to provide medical indemnity cover for a health care professional;

                     (d)  the compensation claim being notified to the insurer;

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Providing medical indemnity cover

             (1)  A person **_provides medical indemnity cover_** for a health care professional if, under an arrangement, the person must or may indemnify the health care professional in relation to claims that may be made against the health care professional in relation to health care incidents.

             (2)  The arrangement:

                     (a)  may be one under which the indemnity is provided at the person’s discretion; and

                     (b)  may be, but need not be, an arrangement between the person and the health care professional; and

                     (c)  may be:

                              (i)  one under which the health care professional is indemnified directly; or

                             (ii)  one under which the health care professional is indemnified indirectly through an entity or entities interposed between the person and the health care professional.

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Claims-made based cover and incident-occurring based cover

             (1)  This section tells you what is meant by **_claims-made based cover_** and **_incident-occurring based cover_** when those terms are used in this Act. There are some kinds of medical indemnity cover that fall outside both those terms.

             (2)  For the purposes of this Act, the cover provided for by a contract of insurance is **_claims-made based cover_** if:

                     (a)  under the contract, the insurer provides medical indemnity cover for a health care professional in relation to a compensation claim against the health care professional in relation to a health care incident only if:

                              (i)  the incident occurs during a period specified in the contract (the **_incidents period_**); and

                             (ii)  the compensation claim is made against the health care professional during a period specified in the contract (the **_claims period_**); and

                     (b)  the incidents period is not a period that has ended before the claims period begins; and

                     (c)  the claims period is fixed.

Note 1:       Subparagraph (a)(ii)—subsection 4(9) operates on the reference in this subparagraph to the claim being made during a period.

Note 2:       Pure ERB cover (which has a defined incidents period that ends before the claims period begins) does not qualify because of paragraph (b). DDR cover (which does not have a fixed claims period) does not qualify because of paragraph (c).

             (3)  To avoid doubt, the claims period for the contract is taken to be fixed even if the claims period is capable of being extended:

                     (a)  by agreement between the parties to the contract; or

                     (b)  by renewal of the contract.

             (4)  For the purposes of this Act, the cover provided for by a contract of insurance is **_incident-occurring based cover_** if:

                     (a)  under the contract, the insurer provides medical indemnity cover for a health care professional in relation to a compensation claim in relation to a health care incident only if the incident occurs during a period specified in the contract; and

                     (b)  under the contract, the insurer provides that medical indemnity cover:

                              (i)  regardless of when the compensation claim is made against the health care professional; and

                             (ii)  whether or not the health care professional has died, become permanently disabled or retired.

Note:          ERB cover (which has a fixed claims period) does not qualify because of subparagraph (b)(i) and DDR cover does not qualify because of subparagraph (b)(ii).

##### <a id="7"></a>7  When certain DDR arrangements are taken to be entered into

             (1)  For the purposes of this Act, if:

                     (a)  under an arrangement, a person (the **_cover provider_**) will or may provide medical indemnity cover of a particular kind for a health care professional; and

                     (b)  the cover provider will or may provide that cover only if:

                              (i)  a particular period has expired; and

                             (ii)  the health care professional dies, becomes permanently disabled or retires; and

                     (c)  the arrangement is not a contract of insurance;

the cover provider is taken to **_enter into_** the arrangement, to the extent to which it relates to that cover, at the earliest time at which:

                     (d)  there are no conditions that need to be satisfied for the cover to be provided for the health care professional; or

                     (e)  the only conditions that need to be satisfied for the cover to be provided for the health care professional are conditions that relate to:

                              (i)  payments being made to the cover provider for the cover; or

                             (ii)  the making of a claim against the cover provider under the arrangement.

             (2)  Without limiting subparagraph (1)(b)(i), the period referred to in that subparagraph may be specified as a minimum period during which the health care professional is a member of a particular body.

##### <a id="7A"></a>7A  Reasonableness of premiums

                   In deciding whether the premium payable by an insured under a contract of insurance for particular cover is reasonable, regard is to be had to:

                     (a)  the nature of the risks being assumed by the insurer; and

                     (b)  the claims handling expenses, and other administrative expenses, the insurer has incurred and can reasonably be expected to incur; and

                     (c)  the expenses the insurer can reasonably be expected to incur in obtaining appropriate reinsurance; and

                     (d)  the expenses the insurer can reasonably be expected to incur in capital raising and prudential compliance; and

                     (e)  the amount that represents a reasonable profit margin for the insurer; and

                      (f)  the amount of any relevant taxes or statutory charges payable by the insurer; and

                     (g)  the information provided, or not provided, to the insurer by the client in relation to matters relevant to assessing the risk being assumed by the insurer; and

                     (h)  the amount that represents provisioning for future liabilities for medical indemnity cover that may be required to be offered under section 23 for a premium that does not reflect the cost of providing that medical indemnity cover; and

                      (i)  the receipt, or probable receipt, of Commonwealth assistance in relation to provision of the medical indemnity cover; and

                      (j)  such other matters as are specified in regulations made for the purposes of this paragraph.

### Division 3—Application of Act

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Application of Act

             (1)  This Act does not apply to State insurance (whether or not extending beyond the limits of the State concerned).

             (2)  This Act does not apply to:

                             (ii)  a State, a public authority of a State or an instrumentality or agency of the Crown in right of a State; or

Note:          Paragraph (c)—If a funding plan lodged with an application does not comply with the requirements set out in paragraph (d), the body corporate will need to make another application under this section and lodge another funding plan with that application.

          (3A)  APRA must make the determination within 30 days after receiving the application.

          (3B)  The determination must be in writing and APRA must give the body corporate a copy of the determination within 7 days after making the determination.

When determination ceases to have effect

             (4)  The determination ceases to have effect:

                     (a)  on 30 June 2008; or

                     (b)  if APRA revokes the determination before 30 June 2008—on the day specified in the revocation as the day on which the revocation takes effect.

##### <a id="17"></a>17  Minimum cover for single claim

Circumstances in which section applies

             (1)  This subsection applies to a person if:

                     (a)  under a contract of insurance (the **_relevant contract_**), the person provides medical indemnity cover for a health care professional; and

                     (b)  the health care professional is:

                              (i)  a medical practitioner; or

                             (ii)  a registered health professional prescribed by the regulations.

Offence

             (2)  A person (the **_insurer_**) commits an offence if:

                     (a)  subsection (1) applies to the insurer; and

                     (b)  the relevant contract is entered into, comes into effect or is renewed at a particular time on or after 1 July 2003; and

                     (c)  the maximum amount payable by the insurer under the relevant contract in relation to a single compensation claim made against the health care professional would, but for subsection (4), be less than the minimum cover amount applicable at that time.

                    Penalty:  Imprisonment for 12 months.

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not apply if it would be reasonable to assume, at the time the relevant contract is entered into, comes into effect or is renewed, that every health care incident to which the compensation claim would relate would be one occurring outside Australia and the external Territories.

Note:          A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in this subsection (see subsection 13.3(3) of the _Criminal Code_).

Maximum amount payable for single claim

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  subsection (1) applies to a person (the **_insurer_**); and

                     (b)  the relevant contract is entered into, comes into effect or is renewed at a particular time on or after 1 July 2003; and

                     (c)  a compensation claim is made against the health care professional; and

                     (d)  an amount is payable by the insurer under the relevant contract in relation to the compensation claim; and

                     (e)  the maximum amount payable by the insurer under the relevant contract in relation to the compensation claim would, but for this subsection, be less than the minimum cover amount applicable at that time;

the maximum amount payable by the insurer under the relevant contract in relation to the compensation claim is the minimum cover amount applicable at that time (instead of the maximum amount provided for in the relevant contract).

             (5)  Subsection (4) does not apply if every health care incident to which the compensation claim relates is one occurring outside Australia and the external Territories.

             (6)  To avoid doubt, subsection (4) applies whether or not the insurer is convicted of an offence against subsection (2).

##### <a id="18"></a>18  Minimum annual cover—incident-occurring based cover

Circumstances in which section applies

             (1)  This subsection applies to a person if:

                     (b)  the health care professional is:

                              (i)  a medical practitioner; or

                             (ii)  a registered health professional prescribed by the regulations; and

                     (c)  the relevant contract provides for incident-occurring based cover.

                     (b)  there is only one **_relevant period_** and it is the qualifying incident period if the qualifying incident period is a year or shorter than a year; and

                     (c)  the year starting at the beginning of the qualifying incident period, and each succeeding year or part of a year in the qualifying incident period, is a **_relevant period_** if the qualifying incident period is longer than a year.

Offence

             (3)  A person (the **_insurer_**) commits an offence if:

                     (a)  subsection (1) applies to the insurer; and

                     (b)  the relevant contract is entered into, comes into effect or is renewed at a particular time on or after 1 July 2003; and

                     (c)  the maximum amount payable, in aggregate, by the insurer under the relevant contract in relation to all the compensation claims that are made against the health care professional in relation to health care incidents that occur during a particular relevant period would, but for subsection (5), be less than the minimum cover amount applicable at that time.

                    Penalty:  Imprisonment for 12 months.

             (4)  Subsection (3) does not apply if it would be reasonable to assume, at the time the relevant contract is entered into, comes into effect or is renewed, that every health care incident to which the compensation claims would relate would be one occurring outside Australia and the external Territories.

Note:          A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in this subsection (see subsection 13.3(3) of the _Criminal Code_).

Maximum amount payable for multiple claims

             (5)  If:

                     (a)  subsection (1) applies to a person (the **_insurer_**); and

                     (c)  amounts are payable by the insurer under the relevant contract in relation to 2 or more compensation claims (the **_multiple claims_**) that are made against the health care professional in relation to health care incidents that occur in a particular relevant period; and

                     (d)  the maximum amount payable by the insurer under the relevant contract in relation to the multiple claims would, but for this subsection, be less than the minimum cover amount applicable at that time;

the maximum amount payable, in aggregate, by the insurer under the relevant contract in relation to the multiple claims is the minimum cover amount applicable at that time (instead of the maximum amount provided for in the relevant contract).

             (6)  Subsection (5) does not apply if every health care incident to which the multiple claims relate is one occurring outside Australia and the external Territories.

             (7)  To avoid doubt, subsection (5) applies whether or not the insurer is convicted of an offence against subsection (3).

##### <a id="19"></a>19  Minimum annual cover—other cover

Circumstances in which section applies

Offence

             (3)  A person (the **_insurer_**) commits an offence if:

                     (a)  subsection (1) applies to the insurer; and

Client

             (2)  For the purposes of this Division, the **_client_** for the regulated insurance contract is the other party to the regulated insurance contract (who may be the health care professional or someone else).

Claims period

             (3)  For the purposes of this Division, the **_claims period_** for the regulated insurance contract is the period specified in the contract as the period during which a compensation claim against the health care professional has to be made for medical indemnity cover to be provided in relation to the compensation claim.

                     (b)  for an offer to be made under section 23—the health care incidents:

                              (i)  that have occurred, or will occur, before the contract that arises from the offer would take effect; and

                             (ii)  for which the health care professional would otherwise be without medical indemnity cover.

#### Subdivision B—Insurer’s responsibilities

##### <a id="22"></a>22  Additional offer of retroactive cover when regulated insurance contract entered into, comes into effect or is renewed

Offence—compulsory offer

             (1)  A person (the **_insurer_**) commits an offence if:

                     (a)  a regulated insurance contract is entered into, comes into effect or is renewed; and

Note 1:       For **_complying offer_**, see section 24.

Note 2:       Subparagraph (c)(i)—subsection 4(9) operates on the reference in this subparagraph to the claims being made during a period.

                    Penalty:  Imprisonment for 12 months.

          (1A)  In determining whether an offer made by an insurer to provide medical indemnity cover for a health care professional satisfies subparagraph (1)(c)(i), disregard:

                     (a)  an otherwise uncovered prior incident of the health care professional; or

                     (b)  a compensation claim in relation to an incident of that kind;

if it is reasonable and appropriate for the insurer to exclude the incident or claim from the cover being offered, having regard to:

                     (c)  the nature of the health care provided by the health care professional during the period during which the otherwise uncovered prior incident occurred; and

                     (d)  the kinds of exclusions that are usually provided for in contracts of insurance that provide similar cover to the cover being offered; and

                     (e)  any other relevant consideration.

          (1B)  Strict liability applies to subparagraph (1)(c)(iii) to the extent that it relates to whether the premium referred to in paragraph 24(2)(f) is reasonable.

##### <a id="26A"></a>26A  Provision of run-off cover to certain medical practitioners

Offence—compulsory provision of medical indemnity cover

             (1)  A person (the **_insurer_**) commits an offence if:

                     (a)  the insurer is a medical indemnity insurer; and

                     (b)  the insurer, or another medical indemnity insurer, has provided medical indemnity cover for a medical practitioner (the **_practitioner_**) who is an eligible practitioner; and

                     (c)  the insurer:

                              (i)  is the last medical indemnity insurer to have provided medical indemnity cover for the practitioner in relation to incidents occurring during a medical practice period of the practitioner; or

                             (ii)  has taken over that last medical indemnity insurer; and

                     (d)  the insurer does not provide medical indemnity cover for the practitioner that satisfies all of the requirements of subsection (4); and

                     (e)  in a case where a termination date has been set for the purposes of subsection 34ZB(3) of the _Medical Indemnity Act 2002_—the insurer’s failure to provide that medical indemnity cover occurs before that date.

                    Penalty:  Imprisonment for 12 months.

             (2)  The medical indemnity cover referred to in paragraph (1)(b):

                     (a)  may be medical indemnity cover provided to the practitioner or to someone else; and

                     (b)  need not be medical indemnity cover provided while the practitioner was an eligible practitioner.

When a medical indemnity insurer is taken over

             (3)  The reference in paragraph (1)(c) to a medical indemnity insurer having taken over another medical indemnity insurer is a reference to it having assumed some or all of the financial responsibility for claims:

                     (a)  that are claims in relation to incidents that occurred in the course of, or in connection with, the practitioner’s practice as a medical practitioner; and

                     (b)  with which the other medical indemnity insurer would, but for that assumption of responsibility, have been concerned because of the other medical indemnity insurer having provided medical indemnity cover to the person.

Requirements for medical indemnity cover

             (4)  Medical indemnity cover meets the requirements of this subsection if:

                     (a)  it covers incidents that occurred while the practitioner:

                              (i)  had medical indemnity cover provided by the insurer or any other medical indemnity insurer, or (subject to subsection (6)) by an MDO; and

                             (ii)  was registered or licensed as a medical practitioner under a State or Territory law that provides for the registration or licensing of medical practitioners; and

                     (b)  the nature and range of incidents it covers is at least the same as the nature and range of incidents covered by the last medical indemnity cover provided for the practitioner; and

                     (c)  the contract of insurance under which the medical indemnity cover is provided satisfies subparagraph 34E(1)(e)(ii) of the _Medical Indemnity Act 2002_; and

Note:       Subparagraph 34E(1)(e)(ii) of the _Medical Indemnity Act 2002_ requires that the practitioner’s contract limit (see section 34B of that Act) equals or exceeds the relevant threshold under section 34F of that Act.

                     (d)  it is provided on such terms and conditions (if any) determined in writing by the Minister administering the _Medical Indemnity Act 2002_; and

                     (e)  it provides cover until the practitioner ceases to be an eligible practitioner; and

                      (f)  no premium or other consideration is payable for the medical indemnity cover by the person to whom it is provided.

             (5)  A determination under paragraph (4)(d) is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

             (6)  Subparagraph (4)(a)(i) applies to medical indemnity cover provided by an MDO only if that cover would have been claims-made cover within the meaning of subsections 6(2) and (3) of this Act if it had been provided for by a contract of insurance.

Practitioner etc. need not apply for medical indemnity cover

             (7)  The obligation under subsection (1) to provide medical indemnity cover applies whether or not the practitioner, or any other person, has applied to the insurer for the medical indemnity cover.

Effect of subsection (1)

             (8)  Subsection (1) has effect subject to section 116 of the _Insurance Act 1973_.

Note:          This means that an insurer does not have to provide medical indemnity cover under subsection (1) once the winding up of the insurer has started.

                     (a)  the insurer; and

                     (b)  the person to whom the medical indemnity cover is provided;

under which the medical indemnity cover is provided.

             (2)  This section applies:

                     (a)  despite the insurer not receiving any premium or other consideration for providing the medical indemnity cover; and

                     (b)  whether or not the medical indemnity cover was provided by means of the person to whom it was provided accepting an offer from the insurer to provide it.

##### <a id="26F"></a>26F  Federal Court may order insurer to provide run-off cover or MDO to enter into arrangement

             (1)  If the Federal Court of Australia is satisfied that an insurer has engaged in, or is proposing to engage in, conduct that constitutes a contravention of subsection 26A(1) or 26C(1), the Court may grant an injunction requiring the insurer to provide medical indemnity cover in accordance with that subsection.

##### <a id="26G"></a>26G  Pecuniary penalties for offences against this Division

             (1)  To avoid doubt, subsection 4B(3) of the _Crimes Act 1914_ applies to any offence against a provision of this Division committed by a body corporate, as if an offence against that provision could be committed by a natural person.

                             (ii)  recommends that someone enter into or renew a regulated insurance contract; and

                     (c)  either:

                              (i)  the regulated insurance contract breaches, or would breach, the minimum cover rules; or

                             (ii)  the regulated insurance contract is a new regulated insurance contract and the insurer does not make a compulsory new contract offer in relation to the regulated insurance contract.

                    Penalty:  Imprisonment for 12 months.

             (2)  It does not matter whether the intermediary provides the financial service in the intermediary’s own right or as a representative of another person.

             (3)  Subparagraph (1)(b)(ii) does not apply to a recommendation by the intermediary if the intermediary has reasonable grounds to believe that a compulsory new contract offer will be made in relation to the new regulated insurance contract before that contract is entered into or is renewed.

Note:          A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in this subsection (see subsection 13.3(3) of the _Criminal Code_).

             (4)  To avoid doubt, the intermediary commits the offence whether or not the insurer commits, or would commit, an offence against subsection 17(2), 18(3), 19(3) or 22(1).
