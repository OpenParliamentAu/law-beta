### Division 2—Purpose and simplified overview of this Act

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Purpose of this Act

             (1)  The purpose of this Act is to safeguard against unlawful interference with maritime transport or offshore facilities.

             (2)  To achieve this purpose, this Act establishes a regulatory framework centred around the development of security plans for ships, other maritime transport operations and offshore facilities.

             (3)  The implementation of a security plan should make an appropriate contribution to the achievement of the maritime security outcomes.

             (4)  The **_maritime security outcomes_** are as follows:

                     (a)  Australia’s obligations under Chapter XI-2 of the SOLAS Convention and the ISPS Code, including those with regard to the rights, freedoms and welfare of seafarers, are met;

                     (b)  the vulnerability to terrorist attack of Australian ships, ports and other ships within Australia, and offshore facilities is reduced without undue disruption to trade;

                     (c)  the risk that maritime transport or offshore facilities are used to facilitate terrorist or other unlawful activities is reduced;

                     (d)  security information is communicated effectively among maritime industry participants and government agencies with security responsibilities for maritime transport and offshore facilities.

             (5)  It is not the purpose of this Act to prevent lawful advocacy, protest, dissent or industrial action that does not compromise maritime security.

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Simplified overview of this Act

* * *

This Act establishes a scheme to safeguard against unlawful interference with maritime transport or offshore facilities.

Part 2 provides for maritime security levels. The security measures to be implemented when different maritime security levels are in force are set out in maritime security plans, ship security plans and offshore security plans. Part 2 also provides for the Secretary to give security directions in special circumstances.

Part 3 deals with maritime security plans. Maritime industry participants who are required to have plans must comply with their plans.

Part 4 deals with ship security plans and ISSCs (International Ship Security Certificates) for regulated Australian ships. These ships must have both a ship security plan and an ISSC. They must be operated in compliance with their ship security plans and must continue to meet ISSC standards.

Part 5 puts obligations on regulated foreign ships. The Secretary can give control directions to regulated foreign ships to ensure that security standards are maintained.

Part 5A deals with offshore security plans. Offshore industry participants who are required to have plans must comply with their plans.

Part 5B deals with ISSCs for Australian ships regulated as offshore facilities.

Part 5C deals with foreign ships regulated as offshore facilities. The Secretary can give control directions to foreign ships regulated as offshore facilities to ensure that security standards are maintained.

Part 6 provides for the establishment of maritime security zones. Additional security requirements apply in these zones which can be established within ports, on and around ships, and on and around offshore facilities.

Part 7 deals with screening, weapons and prohibited items.

Part 8 sets out the powers of officials under this Act. These officials are maritime security inspectors, duly authorised officers, law enforcement officers, maritime security guards and screening officers.

Part 9 sets out reporting obligations in relation to certain maritime transport or offshore facility security incidents.

Part 10 allows the Secretary to require security compliance information from maritime industry participants.

Part 11 provides a range of enforcement mechanisms. These are infringement notices, enforcement orders, ship enforcement orders, injunctions and a demerit points system.

Part 12 provides for review of certain decisions by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

Part 13 deals with miscellaneous matters.

## Part 2—Maritime security levels and security directions

### Division 1—Simplified overview of Part

##### <a id="20"></a>20  Simplified overview of Part

* * *

Maritime security level 1 is in force for each security regulated port, each maritime industry participant, each regulated Australian ship and each security regulated offshore facility unless the Secretary declares that maritime security level 2 or 3 is in force for the port, participant, ship or facility.

If maritime security level 2 or 3 is in force for a port, that maritime security level is in force for every maritime industry participant, security regulated ship, ship regulated as an offshore facility and security regulated offshore facility within the port.

The Secretary may also declare that maritime security level 2 or 3 is in force for a regulated foreign ship. A regulated foreign ship may also be directed by its flag state to operate at a higher security level.

A foreign ship regulated as an offshore facility may also be directed by its flag state to operate at a higher security level.

If maritime security level 2 or 3 is in force for a security regulated offshore facility, that maritime security level is in force for:

               (a)     every maritime industry participant within the facility; and

               (b)     every security regulated ship in the vicinity of the facility that is engaged in activity in relation to the facility, and for which a lower security level was in force.

Division 3 sets out requirements for notifying maritime security level declarations.

In special circumstances the Secretary is able to give security directions to maritime industry participants, employees of such participants, passengers and persons within the boundaries of a security regulated port or security regulated offshore facility. Security directions may include confidentiality requirements.

## Part 4—Ship security plans and ISSCs for regulated Australian ships

### Division 1—Simplified overview of Part

##### <a id="60"></a>60  Simplified overview of Part

* * *

Ship security plans identify the security measures to be implemented by ships when different maritime security levels are in force.

Regulated Australian ships are required to have, and comply with, ship security plans. This is dealt with in Division 2.

Various other ships and persons are required to comply with ship security plans. This is dealt with in Division 3.

The content and form of ship security plans is dealt with in Division 4.

The approval of ship security plans by the Secretary is dealt with in Division 5\. That Division also deals with the variation and revision of plans, and with the cancellation of the approval of plans.

Regulated Australian ships are also required to have an ISSC (International Ship Security Certificate). Division 6 provides for the Secretary to issue ISSCs and interim ISSCs for those ships.

Division 7 allows the Secretary to delegate his or her powers under this Part to registered security organisations.
