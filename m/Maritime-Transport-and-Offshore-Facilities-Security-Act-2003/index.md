### Division 2—Purpose and simplified overview of this Act

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Purpose of this Act

             (1)  The purpose of this Act is to safeguard against unlawful interference with maritime transport or offshore facilities.

             (2)  To achieve this purpose, this Act establishes a regulatory framework centred around the development of security plans for ships, other maritime transport operations and offshore facilities.

             (3)  The implementation of a security plan should make an appropriate contribution to the achievement of the maritime security outcomes.

             (4)  The **_maritime security outcomes_** are as follows:

                     (a)  Australia’s obligations under Chapter XI-2 of the SOLAS Convention and the ISPS Code, including those with regard to the rights, freedoms and welfare of seafarers, are met;

                     (b)  the vulnerability to terrorist attack of Australian ships, ports and other ships within Australia, and offshore facilities is reduced without undue disruption to trade;

                     (c)  the risk that maritime transport or offshore facilities are used to facilitate terrorist or other unlawful activities is reduced;

                     (d)  security information is communicated effectively among maritime industry participants and government agencies with security responsibilities for maritime transport and offshore facilities.

             (5)  It is not the purpose of this Act to prevent lawful advocacy, protest, dissent or industrial action that does not compromise maritime security.

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Simplified overview of this Act

* * *

This Act establishes a scheme to safeguard against unlawful interference with maritime transport or offshore facilities.

Part 2 provides for maritime security levels. The security measures to be implemented when different maritime security levels are in force are set out in maritime security plans, ship security plans and offshore security plans. Part 2 also provides for the Secretary to give security directions in special circumstances.

Part 3 deals with maritime security plans. Maritime industry participants who are required to have plans must comply with their plans.

Part 4 deals with ship security plans and ISSCs (International Ship Security Certificates) for regulated Australian ships. These ships must have both a ship security plan and an ISSC. They must be operated in compliance with their ship security plans and must continue to meet ISSC standards.

Part 5 puts obligations on regulated foreign ships. The Secretary can give control directions to regulated foreign ships to ensure that security standards are maintained.

Part 5A deals with offshore security plans. Offshore industry participants who are required to have plans must comply with their plans.

Part 5B deals with ISSCs for Australian ships regulated as offshore facilities.

Part 5C deals with foreign ships regulated as offshore facilities. The Secretary can give control directions to foreign ships regulated as offshore facilities to ensure that security standards are maintained.

Part 6 provides for the establishment of maritime security zones. Additional security requirements apply in these zones which can be established within ports, on and around ships, and on and around offshore facilities.

Part 7 deals with screening, weapons and prohibited items.

Part 8 sets out the powers of officials under this Act. These officials are maritime security inspectors, duly authorised officers, law enforcement officers, maritime security guards and screening officers.

Part 9 sets out reporting obligations in relation to certain maritime transport or offshore facility security incidents.

Part 10 allows the Secretary to require security compliance information from maritime industry participants.

Part 11 provides a range of enforcement mechanisms. These are infringement notices, enforcement orders, ship enforcement orders, injunctions and a demerit points system.

Part 12 provides for review of certain decisions by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

Part 13 deals with miscellaneous matters.

## Part 2—Maritime security levels and security directions

### Division 1—Simplified overview of Part

##### <a id="20"></a>20  Simplified overview of Part

* * *

Maritime security level 1 is in force for each security regulated port, each maritime industry participant, each regulated Australian ship and each security regulated offshore facility unless the Secretary declares that maritime security level 2 or 3 is in force for the port, participant, ship or facility.

If maritime security level 2 or 3 is in force for a port, that maritime security level is in force for every maritime industry participant, security regulated ship, ship regulated as an offshore facility and security regulated offshore facility within the port.

The Secretary may also declare that maritime security level 2 or 3 is in force for a regulated foreign ship. A regulated foreign ship may also be directed by its flag state to operate at a higher security level.

A foreign ship regulated as an offshore facility may also be directed by its flag state to operate at a higher security level.

If maritime security level 2 or 3 is in force for a security regulated offshore facility, that maritime security level is in force for:

               (a)     every maritime industry participant within the facility; and

               (b)     every security regulated ship in the vicinity of the facility that is engaged in activity in relation to the facility, and for which a lower security level was in force.

Division 3 sets out requirements for notifying maritime security level declarations.

In special circumstances the Secretary is able to give security directions to maritime industry participants, employees of such participants, passengers and persons within the boundaries of a security regulated port or security regulated offshore facility. Security directions may include confidentiality requirements.

## Part 4—Ship security plans and ISSCs for regulated Australian ships

### Division 1—Simplified overview of Part

##### <a id="60"></a>60  Simplified overview of Part

* * *

Ship security plans identify the security measures to be implemented by ships when different maritime security levels are in force.

Regulated Australian ships are required to have, and comply with, ship security plans. This is dealt with in Division 2.

Various other ships and persons are required to comply with ship security plans. This is dealt with in Division 3.

The content and form of ship security plans is dealt with in Division 4.

The approval of ship security plans by the Secretary is dealt with in Division 5\. That Division also deals with the variation and revision of plans, and with the cancellation of the approval of plans.

Regulated Australian ships are also required to have an ISSC (International Ship Security Certificate). Division 6 provides for the Secretary to issue ISSCs and interim ISSCs for those ships.

Division 7 allows the Secretary to delegate his or her powers under this Part to registered security organisations.

##### <a id="150"></a>150  Simplified overview of Division

* * *

This Division provides police and certain customs officers with special authority to:

               (a)     stop and search people, vehicles and vessels in maritime security zones and to stop and search people on security regulated ships and on ships regulated as offshore facilities;

               (b)     remove people from ships or maritime security zones if they do not leave when requested to do so;

               (c)     remove vehicles and vessels from maritime security zones if an officer is unable to have the vehicles or vessels removed by persons in control of them.

The Division establishes restrictions on this authority, such as requiring an officer to explain why a search is to be made and limiting the amount of force that may be used.

A person who does not leave when requested to do so by a law enforcement officer commits an offence, as does a person who hinders or obstructs an officer exercising powers under this Division.

##### <a id="198"></a>198  Demerit points system

                   The regulations may, in accordance with this Division, establish a system (the **_demerit points system_**) under which the approval of a maritime security plan, a ship security plan or an offshore security plan may be cancelled.

##### <a id="199"></a>199  Demerit points—maritime security plans

             (1)  The demerit points system may provide that the approval of a maritime security plan of a maritime industry participant may be cancelled if the maritime industry participant accrues a prescribed number of demerit points.

Note:          Section 58 deals with the cancellation of the approval of maritime security plans under the demerit points system.

             (2)  Demerit points must only be accrued if the maritime industry participant:

                     (a)  is convicted or found guilty of an offence against this Act; or

                     (b)  under a scheme established under regulations made under section 187, pays a penalty to the Commonwealth as an alternative to prosecution.

##### <a id="200"></a>200  Demerit points—ship security plans

             (1)  The demerit points system may provide that the approval of a ship security plan may be cancelled if the number of demerit points prescribed by the regulations is accumulated in respect of the ship.

Note:          Section 77 deals with the cancellation of the approval of ship security plans under the demerit points system.

             (2)  The demerit points system must only allow demerit points to be accumulated in respect of the ship if a ship operator:

                     (a)  is convicted or found guilty of an offence against section 62 or 63 in respect of the ship; or

                     (b)  under a scheme established under regulations made under section 187, pays a penalty to the Commonwealth as an alternative to prosecution for an offence against section 63 in respect of the ship.

             (3)  Without limiting the scheme that may be established under section 198, the scheme may provide that different provisions apply to different kinds of ships or to different classes of ships within a kind of ship.

##### <a id="200A"></a>200A  Demerit points—offshore security plans

             (1)  The demerit points system may provide that the approval of an offshore security plan of an offshore industry participant may be cancelled if the offshore industry participant accrues a prescribed number of demerit points.

Note:          Section 100R deals with the cancellation of the approval of offshore security plans under the demerit points system.

             (2)  Demerit points must only be accrued if the offshore industry participant:

                     (a)  is convicted or found guilty of an offence against this Act; or

                     (b)  under a scheme established under regulations made under section 187, pays a penalty to the Commonwealth as an alternative to prosecution.

             (3)  Without limiting the scheme that may be established under section 198, the scheme may provide that different provisions apply to different kinds of offshore industry participants or to different classes of participants within a kind of offshore industry participant.
