             (4)  An employee is not entitled, under subsection (3), to pay in respect of any absence that occurs before the day on which the continuous period, or the last continuous period, during which she is, by virtue of subsection (4A), to be taken to be a person to whom this subsection applies first exceeds 12 months.

          (4A)  A person shall be taken to be a person to whom subsection (4) applies by virtue of this subsection:

                     (a)  while she is a person to and in relation to whom this Act applies; or

                     (b)  she shall absent herself from duty during that first‑mentioned period, but, subject to subsection (4D), is not entitled to pay in respect of the period while she is so absent; and

                     (c)  if, upon the expiration of that first‑mentioned period, she remains absent from duty on unauthorized absence, her unauthorized absence before the commencement of that period shall be deemed to be continuous with her unauthorized absence after the expiration of that period.

          (4D)  Subsection (4C) does not affect an employee’s entitlement to pay for any period of long service leave or leave of absence for recreation or on account of illness that is granted to her.

          (4E)  Where a female employee who is granted leave of absence without pay has become pregnant before, or becomes pregnant after, the commencement of that leave, her absence from duty in accordance with the grant during any part of the period of 52 weeks commencing 6 weeks before the expected birth of her child or, if she is confined earlier than 6 weeks before the expected birth of her child, commencing on the date of her confinement, shall be deemed, for the purposes of paragraph (1)(c) and subsection (3), to be absence from duty in accordance with a permission granted under paragraph (1)(a).

           (4F)  Notwithstanding subsection (4E), where a female employee who is granted leave of absence from her employment without pay for a period (in this subsection referred to as **_the relevant period_**), being a period exceeding 6 weeks, has become pregnant before, or becomes pregnant after, the commencement of that leave, unless the Agency Head otherwise determines:

                     (a)  subsection (1) does not authorize a leave officer to grant her permission to absent herself from duty under this Act at any time while she is absent from duty in accordance with that grant; and

                     (b)  she is not entitled to pay under subsection (3) in respect of that employment for any part of the relevant period.

          (4G)  Subsection (4F) applies to and in relation to an employee who has been granted leave of absence without pay for a period whether or not she ceases to be absent from duty on leave without pay before the expiration of that period, but does not apply to such an employee unless she is absent on leave without pay in accordance with the grant for a continuous period exceeding 6 weeks.

             (5)  Where, under subsection (3), an employee is entitled to pay in respect of a period, the pay that the employee is to receive shall be the pay, salary, wage or other payment that the employee would have received if, for that period, she had been granted leave of absence on full pay on account of illness.

             (7)  Where:

                     (a)  an employee has, under paragraph (1)(a) or (1)(c), been granted permission to be absent from duty for a period; and

                     (b)  the employee applies for leave of absence of any kind with pay in respect of the whole or any part of that period, excluding a period in respect of which pay is payable under subsection (3);

that application shall, if the employee is eligible for the leave to which the application relates, be granted.

             (8)  The grant of leave of absence of any kind with pay in respect of a period in respect of which pay is payable under subsection (3) is of no effect.

                     (b)  if she is confined before the date so specified but not more than 6 weeks before the expected date of birth of her child—subparagraph 6(1)(b)(i) has effect as if the period referred to in that subparagraph commenced on the date of her confinement; or

             (7)  Where an applicant is granted, under this section, permission to resume duty before the expiration of a period in respect of which she had been granted permission to absent herself from duty, that period shall be treated as having expired immediately before the date upon which she resumes duty.

##### <a id="7B"></a>7B  Grant of maternity leave not to affect continuity of service

             (1)  Where an employee is, in accordance with section 6, absent from duty for a period:

                     (a)  if she has been paid, whether under subsection 6(3) or otherwise, in respect of the period or of a part of the period—the period, or the part of the period, of absence for which she has been so paid forms part of her period of service or employment for all purposes of this Act, of any other Act and of any Ordinance; and

                     (b)  subject to subsection (2), if she has not been so paid in respect of the period or of a part of the period—the period, or the part of the period, of absence for which she has not been so paid does not form part of her period of service or employment for the purposes of this Act, or of any other Act or of any Ordinance, but shall not be taken to have broken the continuity of her service or employment.

             (2)  Where an employee who is, in accordance with section 6, absent from duty for a period in relation to her expected confinement or her confinement had not, immediately before the commencement of that period, been an employee for a continuous period of 12 months, the period of the absence or the period comprising the first 12 weeks of the period of the absence, whichever is the less, forms part of her period of service or employment for all purposes of this Act, of any other Act and of any Ordinance.
