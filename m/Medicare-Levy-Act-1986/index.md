##### <a id="2"></a>2  Commencement <span style="font-size:9.0pt; font-weight:normal">[_see_ Note 1]</span>

                   This Act shall come into operation on the day on which it receives the Royal Assent.

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Interpretation

             (1)  In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears:

                    <a name="assess-act"></a>**_Assessment Act_** means the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

                    <a name="incom-surcharg-purpos"></a>**_income for surcharge purposes_** has the same meaning as in the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

                    <a name="levi"></a>**_levy_** means Medicare levy referred to in section 5.

                    <a name="phase-limit"></a>**_phase-in limit_** means:

                     (a)  for a person who is entitled to a rebate under section 160AAAA of the Assessment Act—$36,100; or

                     (b)  for a person who is entitled to a rebate under subsection 160AAA(2) of the Assessment Act—$32,584; or

                     (c)  in any other case—$21,750.

                    <a name="singl-surcharg-threshold"></a>**_singles surcharge threshold_** for a person for a year of income has the meaning given by section 3AA.

                    <a name="threshold-amount"></a>**_threshold amount_** means:

                     (a)  for a person who is entitled to a rebate under section 160AAAA of the Assessment Act—$30,685; or

                     (b)  for a person who is entitled to a rebate under subsection 160AAA(2) of the Assessment Act—$27,697; or

                     (c)  in any other case—$18,488.

             (2)  In this Act, a reference to income for surcharge purposes, net income or taxable income is to be read as a reference to that term for the year of income.

          (2A)  In section 8B, 8C, 8D, 8E, 8F or 8G, **_net income_** and **_taxable income_** have the meanings that they would have in that section if subsection 271-105(1) of Schedule 2F to the Assessment Act were ignored.

             (3)  Subject to subsection (3A), for the purposes of this Act:

                     (a)  a person shall be deemed not to be married to another person if they are living separately and apart; and

                     (b)  where the last person to whom another person was married during a year of income died during the year of income, those persons shall be deemed to have been married on the last day of the year of income.

          (3A)  For the purposes of sections 8B, 8C and 8D, if:

                     (a)  the last person to whom another person was married during a year of income died during the year of income; and

                     (b)  the death occurred while they were married; 

the living person is taken to be married to the person who died during the period starting on the day he or she died and ending on 30 June of the year of income.

             (4)  Subject to the preceding provisions of this section, expressions used in this Act that are also used in Part VIIB of the Assessment Act have in this Act, unless the contrary intention appears, the same meanings as those expressions have in that Part of the Assessment Act.

             (5)  For the purposes of this Act, a person is covered by an insurance policy that provides private patient hospital cover if:

                     (a)  the policy is a complying health insurance policy (within the meaning of the _Private Health Insurance Act 2007_) that covers hospital treatment (within the meaning of that Act); and

                     (b)  any excess payable in respect of benefits under the policy is no more than:

                              (i)  $500 in any 12 month period, in relation to a policy under which only one person is insured; and

                             (ii)  $1,000 in any 12 month period, in relation to any other policy.

          (5A)  Paragraph (5)(b) does not apply in relation to an insurance policy under which a person has been insured continuously since the end of 24 May 2000, as long as the amount of any excess payable under the policy has not increased since that time.

             (6)  For the purposes of this Act, a person is also covered by an insurance policy that provides private patient hospital cover if:

                     (a)  the policy is issued by a person to whom subsection 67(3) of the _National Health Act 1953_ applied immediately before the commencement of the _Private Health Insurance Act 2007_; and 

                     (b)  in a case where the person referred to in paragraph (a) had been, immediately before that commencement, a registered organization within the meaning of the _National Health Act 1953_—the policy would have been, immediately before that commencement, an applicable benefits arrangement, within the meaning of section 5A of that Act, to which paragraph 5A(1)(a) of that Act would apply.

             (7)  However, for the purposes of this Act a person is not covered by an insurance policy that provides private patient hospital cover if:

                     (a)  the person is covered by an insurance policy described in subsection (6); and

                     (b)  any excess payable in respect of benefits under the policy is more than:

                              (i)  $500 in any 12 month period, in relation to a policy under which only one person is insured; and

                             (ii)  $1,000 in any 12 month period, in relation to any other policy.

##### <a id="3AA"></a>3AA  Meaning of _singles surcharge threshold_

             (1)  The **_singles surcharge threshold_** for a person for the 2008-09 year of income is $70,000\. This amount is indexed annually.

Indexation of singles surcharge threshold

             (2)  The amount of the singles surcharge threshold is indexed annually by:

                     (a)  multiplying the singles surcharge threshold for the 2008-09 year of income by its indexation factor; and

                     (b)  rounding the result in paragraph (a) down to the nearest multiple of $1,000.

             (3)  The singles surcharge threshold is not indexed if its indexation factor is 1 or less.

             (4)  The **_indexation factor_** is:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00704/Html/MedicareLevy1986_WD02_image002.gif)

             (5)  The indexation factor mentioned in subsection (4) is calculated to 3 decimal places (rounding up if the fourth decimal place is 5 or more).

             (6)  The **_index number_** for a quarter is the estimate of full-time adult average weekly ordinary time earnings for the middle month of the quarter first published by the Australian Statistician for that month.

##### <a id="3A"></a>3A  Meaning of _family surcharge threshold_

             (1)  In sections 8C, 8D, 8F and 8G, the **_family surcharge threshold_** for a year of income is an amount equal to double the singles surcharge threshold for the year of income.

             (2)  However, if the person has 2 or more dependants who are children, the **_family surcharge threshold_** for the person for the year of income is the sum of:

                     (a)  an amount equal to double the singles surcharge threshold for the year of income; and

                     (b)  the result of the following formula:

             (2)  The rate of levy payable by a person in the capacity of a trustee of a trust estate upon a share of the net income of the trust estate to which a beneficiary is presently entitled, being income in respect of which the trustee is liable to be assessed pursuant to section 98 of the Assessment Act, is 1.5%.

             (3)  The rate of levy payable by a person in the capacity of a trustee of a trust estate upon the net income of the trust estate or a part of that net income, being income in respect of which the trustee is liable to be assessed and pay tax pursuant to section 99 or 99A of the Assessment Act, is 1.5%.

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Levy in cases of small incomes

             (1)  Where the taxable income of a person does not exceed the threshold amount, no levy is payable by the person upon that taxable income.

             (2)  Where the taxable income of a person exceeds the threshold amount but does not exceed the phase-in limit, the amount of levy payable by the person upon that taxable income but for sections 8 and 9 shall not exceed 10% of the amount of the excess.

             (3)  Where the net income of a trust estate or a part of that net income, being income in respect of which a person in the capacity of a trustee of a trust estate is liable to be assessed pursuant to section 99 of the Assessment Act, does not exceed $416, no levy is payable by the person upon that net income or part, as the case may be.

_Paid Parental Leave (Consequential Amendments) Act 2010 (No. 105, 2010)_

## Schedule 2

## 1  Employer determination made where expected or actual date of birth is before 1 July 2011

(1)        The _Paid Parental Leave Act 2010_ applies, with the modifications set out in this item, in relation to a person who has made a claim for parental leave pay for a child, if:

                     (a)  for a claim made before the day the child is born—the expected date of birth of the child is before 1 July 2011; or

                     (b)  for a claim made after the child is born—the day the child is born is before 1 July 2011.

_Note:       For a claim made before the day the child is born, see subitem (9) if the expected date of birth of the child is before 1 July 2011, but the child is born on or after that date._

(2)        Section 101 of that Act (and the other provisions of that Act so far as they relate to that section) applies in relation to the person as if subsections (1) and (2) of that section were omitted and the following subsection substituted:

             (1)  The Secretary must make a determination under this section (the **_employer determination_**) that a person’s employer is to pay the person instalments if the Secretary is satisfied, when making the determination, that:

                     (a)  a payability determination that parental leave pay is payable to the person, or an initial eligibility determination for the person, is in force; and

                     (b)  the employer has made an election under section 109 that applies to the person; and

                     (c)  the person has consented in the claim to the employer paying instalments to the person; and

                     (d)  the person is likely to be an Australian-based employee of the employer during whichever of the following periods applies:

                              (i)  if the Secretary has made a payability determination that parental leave pay is payable to the person—the person’s PPL period;

                             (ii)  otherwise—the period of days for which instalments are likely, if the determination is made, to be payable to the person by the employer; and

                     (e)  the employer has an ABN; and

                      (f)  if paragraphs (b) to (e) are satisfied in relation to more than one employer of the person—the person nominated the employer in the claim as the employer who would be required to pay instalments to the person.

(3)        For the purposes of this item, an employer determination made under subsection 101(1), as that subsection applies because of subitem (2) of this item, is a **_transitional employer determination_**.

(4)        The following provisions of that Act do not apply in relation to a transitional employer determination:

                     (a)  section 103 (which deals with responding to a notice of an employer determination);

                     (b)  subsection 107(2) (which deals with when an employer determination comes into force);

                     (c)  subsections 207(3) and 224(1) (which deal with applying for review of employer determination decisions).

(5)        Within 14 days after the date of the notice given under section 102 of that Act in relation to the transitional employer determination, the employer may give the Secretary a written notice (the **_acceptance notice_**) that complies with section 104 of that Act.

(6)        If the employer gives the acceptance notice to the Secretary within that 14 day period, the transitional employer determination comes into force on the day the Secretary receives the acceptance notice.

(7)        If the employer does not give the acceptance notice to the Secretary within that 14 day period, the following paragraphs have effect:

                     (a)  the Secretary must revoke the transitional employer determination;

                     (b)  the revocation comes into force on the day of the revocation;

                     (c)  to avoid doubt, subsection 108(5) of that Act (which deals with giving notice of the revocation) applies in relation to the revocation.

(8)        The Secretary may extend the 14 day period referred to in subitem (5) in relation to an employer. If the Secretary does so, subitems (6) and (7) have effect accordingly.

(9)        Despite paragraph (1)(a) and subitem (2) of this item, if the person’s child is born on or after 1 July 2011, then the following paragraphs have effect:

                     (a)  the Secretary may make an employer determination for the person and the person’s employer under section 101 of the _Paid Parental Leave Act 2010_, as that section applies apart from this item;

                     (b)  if the Secretary does so and has previously made a transitional employer determination for the person and the employer, the Secretary is taken never to have made the transitional employer determination.

(10)      The following provisions of the _Paid Parental Leave Act 2010_, apply in relation to this item as if it were a provision of that Act:

                     (a)  section 275 (which deals with how that Act applies to an adopted child);

                     (b)  section 276 (which deals with how that Act applies to claims made in exceptional circumstances).

## 2  Employer determination made where expected date of birth is on or after 1 July 2011 but child born before that date

(1)        This item applies if:

                     (a)  the Secretary makes an employer determination for an employer and a person under the _Paid Parental Leave Act 2010_; and

                     (b)  the person’s claim is made before the day the child is born; and

                     (c)  the expected date of birth of the child is on or after 1 July 2011; and

                     (d)  the child is born before 1 July 2011; and

                     (e)  the person’s employer has not made an election under section 109 of that Act that applies to the person.

(2)        If, after the employer determination is made, the Secretary makes a payability determination that parental leave pay is payable to the person for the child, the notice given to the employer under section 113 of that Act must:

                     (a)  state the day the child was born; and

                     (b)  be dated as at the date the preparation of the notice was completed; and

                     (c)  contain a statement to the effect that the employer determination will be revoked, unless the employer:

                              (i)  agrees to being required to pay instalments to the person, even though the child was born before 1 July 2011; and

                             (ii)  gives the Secretary a written notice indicating that agreement within 14 days of the date referred to in paragraph (b).

(3)        If the employer does not give the notice referred to in subparagraph (2)(c)(ii) to the Secretary within that 14 day period, the following paragraphs have effect:

                     (a)  the Secretary must revoke the employer determination;

                     (b)  the revocation comes into force on the day of the revocation;

                     (c)  to avoid doubt, subsection 108(5) of that Act (which deals with giving notice of the revocation) applies in relation to the revocation;

                     (d)  section 103 of that Act (which deals with responding to a notice of an employer determination) is taken to have never applied in relation to the employer determination.

(4)        The following provisions of that Act  apply in relation to this item as if it were a provision of that Act:

                     (a)  section 275 (which deals with how that Act applies to an adopted child);

                     (b)  section 276 (which deals with how that Act applies to claims made in exceptional circumstances).
