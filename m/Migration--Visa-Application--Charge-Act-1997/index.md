             (4)  Calculations under subsection (2):

                     (a)  are to be made using only the index numbers published in terms of the most recently published reference base for the Consumer Price Index; and

                     (b)  are to disregard index numbers that are published in substitution for previously published index numbers (except where the substituted numbers are published to take account of changes in the reference base).

             (5)  If an amount worked out under the formula in subsection (2) is not a multiple of $5, the amount is to be rounded as follows:
