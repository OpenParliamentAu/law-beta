3  Interpretation
	(1)	In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears:
authorized person means:
	(a)	a person appointed by the Minister, in writing, to be an authorized person for the purposes of this Act; or
	(b)	a person included in a class of persons appointed by the Minister, in writing, to be authorized persons for the purposes of this Act.
charge has the same meaning as in the Charge Act.
Charge Act means the Meat Export Charge Act 1984.
Export Control Act has the same meaning as in the Charge Act.
export permit has the same meaning as in the Charge Act.
meat and meat product have the same respective meanings as in the Charge Act.
	(2)	Where the completion and lodgement of any document is, by virtue of subsection 3(2) or (3) of the Charge Act, deemed to constitute the making of an application of the kind referred to in paragraph 5(1)(a) or (b) of that Act, the completion and lodgement of that document is also deemed to constitute the making of an application of that kind for the purposes of this Act.
	(3)	A period that is a relevant period in relation to particular meat or meat products by virtue of the operation of regulations made under subsection 3(4) of the Charge Act is a relevant period in relation to that meat or those meat products for the purposes of this Act.
4  Act to bind Crown
		This Act binds the Crown in right of each of the States and of the Northern Territory, but nothing in this Act renders the Crown in right of a State or of the Northern Territory liable to be prosecuted for an offence.
5  By whom charge payable
		Charge on the making of an application of the kind referred to in paragraph 5(1)(a) or (b) of the Charge Act is payable by the person in whose name the application is made.
6  Due date for payment of charge
	(1)	Where an application of the kind referred to in paragraph 5(1)(a) of the Charge Act is made, the person making that application shall indicate, in a manner specified in regulations made for the purposes of this subsection, whether or not an application of the kind referred to in paragraph 5(1)(b) of that Act will be made in relation to the meat or meat products in respect of which the first‑mentioned application is made.
	(2)	Where, in relation to meat or meat products to which an application of the kind referred to in paragraph 5(1)(a) of the Charge Act relates, it is indicated, in a manner specified in regulations made for the purposes of subsection (1), that an application of the kind referred to in paragraph 5(1)(b) of that Act will not be made, charge on the first‑mentioned application is due for payment, subject to subsection (4), at the time at which that application is made.
	(3)	Where, in relation to meat or meat products to which an application of the kind referred to in paragraph 5(1)(a) of the Charge Act (in this subsection referred to as the first application) relates, it is indicated, in a manner specified in regulations made for the purposes of subsection (1), that an application of the kind referred to in paragraph 5(1)(b) of that Act (in this subsection referred to as the second application) will be made in relation to that meat or those meat products, then:
	(a)	if the second application is made before the expiration of the relevant period in relation to that meat or those meat products—charge on the second application is due for payment at the time at which that application is made;
	(b)	if the second application is made before the expiration of that relevant period in relation to part only of that meat or those meat products:
	(i)	charge on the second application, in so far as it relates to that part of that meat or of those meat products, is due for payment at the time at which that application is made; and
	(ii)	charge on the first application in so far as it relates to the balance of that meat or those meat products, shall be deemed to have been due for payment, subject to subsection (4), at the time when the first application was made; or
	(c)	if the second application is not made before the expiration of that relevant period—charge on the first application shall be deemed to have been due for payment, subject to subsection (4), at the time when the first application was made.
	(4)	If, in a case to which subsection (2), subparagraph (3)(b)(ii) or paragraph (3)(c) applies, an application in respect of which charge is payable is, or was, made at a place other than an office of the Department that is prescribed for the purposes of this subsection, the due date for payment of charge on the making of that application is, or shall be deemed to have been, 28 days after the end of the month in which that application is, or was, made.
7  Certificates etc. not to be issued until charge is paid
	(1)	Where, by virtue of the provisions of this Act, charge on an application of the kind referred to in paragraph 5(1)(a) or (b) of the Charge Act is due for payment and, at the time when that charge is due to be paid, an export permit or certificate to which that application relates has not been granted or issued, that export permit or certificate shall not be granted or issued until that amount of charge, and any penalty payable in respect of the late payment of that amount of charge, has been paid in full.
	(2)	Where, by virtue of the provisions of this Act, charge on an application of a kind referred to in paragraph 5(1)(a) or (b) of the Charge Act is due for payment, an export permit or certificate shall not be granted or issued in respect of any other application of either of those kinds made in the name of the person in whose name the first-mentioned application was made until that amount of charge, and any penalty payable in respect of the late payment of that amount of charge, has been paid in full.

9  Penalty for non‑payment
