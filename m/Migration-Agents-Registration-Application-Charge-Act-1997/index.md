3  Definitions
		In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears:
charge limit for a registration application made in a financial year has the meaning given by section 7.

6  Amount of charge

	(2)	The regulations may prescribe different amounts (including nil amounts) for different kinds of individuals making registration applications.
	(3)	The regulations must not prescribe an amount more than the charge limit for the registration application.
7  What is the charge limit?
	(1)	The charge limit for a registration application made in the financial year ending at the end of 30 June 2002 is $1,800.
	(2)	Work out the charge limit for a registration application made in a later financial year by:
	(a)	multiplying the charge limit for the immediately preceding financial year by the greater of:
	(i)	the indexation factor worked out using the formula in subsection (3); and
	(ii)	1.0; and
	(b)	rounding the product to the nearest multiple of $5 (rounding an odd multiple of $2.50 to the next higher multiple of $5).
	(3)	The formula for the indexation factor is:

where:
CPI quarter means a period of 3 months ending on 31 March, 30 June, 30 September or 31 December.
index number means the All Groups Consumer Price Index number (being the weighted average of the 8 capital cities) published by the Australian Statistician.

	(a)	use only the index numbers published in terms of the most recently published reference base for the Consumer Price Index; and
	(b)	disregard index numbers published in substitution for previously published index numbers (except where the substituted numbers are published to take account of changes in the reference base).
8  Regulations

Schedule 1
2  Application—section 7 of the Migration Agents Registration Application Charge Act 1997
Despite the amendment of section 7 of the Migration Agents Registration Application Charge Act 1997 made by this Schedule, that section continues to apply, in relation to registration applications made in:

To avoid doubt, the amount of charge payable for the making of a registration application during the period:

	(b)	ending immediately before the commencement of this item;
must not exceed the amount that would have been the charge limit for the financial year that began on 1 July 2001 if the amendment of section 7 of the Migration Agents Registration Application Charge Act 1997 made by this Schedule had not been made.
