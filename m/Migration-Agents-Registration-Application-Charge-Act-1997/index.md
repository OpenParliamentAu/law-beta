##### <a id="5"></a>5  Who must pay charge?

                   Charge is payable by the individual making the registration application.

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Amount of charge

             (1)  The amount of charge payable on an individual’s making of a registration application is the amount prescribed by the regulations for an individual of that kind.

             (2)  The regulations may prescribe different amounts (including nil amounts) for different kinds of individuals making registration applications.

             (3)  The regulations must not prescribe an amount more than the charge limit for the registration application.

             (1)  The **_charge limit_** for a registration application made in the financial year ending at the end of 30 June 2002 is $1,800.

             (2)  Work out the **_charge limit_** for a registration application made in a later financial year by:

                              (i)  the indexation factor worked out using the formula in subsection (3); and

                             (ii)  1.0; and

                     (b)  rounding the product to the nearest multiple of $5 (rounding an odd multiple of $2.50 to the next higher multiple of $5).

             (5)  When working out the indexation factor:

                     (a)  use only the index numbers published in terms of the most recently published reference base for the Consumer Price Index; and

                     (b)  disregard index numbers published in substitution for previously published index numbers (except where the substituted numbers are published to take account of changes in the reference base).

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Regulations

                   The Governor‑General may make regulations for the purposes of section 6.

                     (a)  on a commercial, or for‑profit, basis; or

                     (b)  as a member of, or a person associated with, an organisation that operates on a commercial, or for‑profit, basis.
