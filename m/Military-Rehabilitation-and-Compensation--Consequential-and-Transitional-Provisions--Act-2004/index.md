Definition of **relates to defence service**for injuries, diseases and deaths

             (1)  For the purposes of this Act, an injury, disease or death **_relates to defence service_** rendered by a person if:

                     (b)  it arose out of, or was attributable to, that service; or

                     (c)  it resulted from an accident that occurred while the person was travelling, while rendering that service but otherwise than in the course of duty, on a journey:

                              (i)  to a place for the purpose of performing duty; or

                             (ii)  away from a place of duty upon having ceased to perform duty; or

                     (d)  in the case of an injury—it resulted from an accident that would not have occurred:

                              (i)  but for the rendering of that service by the person; or

                             (ii)  but for changes in the person’s environment consequent upon his or her having rendered that service; or

                     (e)  in the case of a disease—it would not have occurred:

                              (i)  but for the rendering of that service by the person; or

                             (ii)  but for changes in the person’s environment consequent upon his or her having rendered that service; or

                      (f)  in the case of a death of a person—it was due to an accident that would not have occurred, or to a disease that would not have been contracted:

                              (i)  but for the rendering of that service by the person; or

                             (ii)  but for changes in the person’s environment consequent upon his or her having rendered that service.

Definition of **relates to defence service**for aggravations and material contributions

             (2)  For the purposes of this Act, an aggravation of, or a material contribution to, an injury or disease, or a sign or symptom of an injury or disease, **_relates to defence service_** rendered by a person if:

                     (a)  it resulted from an occurrence that happened while the person was rendering that service; or

                     (b)  it arose out of, or was attributable to, that service; or

                     (c)  it resulted from an accident that occurred while the person was travelling, while rendering that service but otherwise than in the course of duty, on a journey:

                              (i)  to a place for the purpose of performing duty; or

                             (ii)  away from a place of duty upon having ceased to perform duty; or

                     (d)  in the case of an aggravation of, or a material contribution to, an injury, or a sign or symptom of an injury—it resulted from an accident that would not have occurred:

                              (i)  but for the rendering of that service by the person; or

                             (ii)  but for changes in the person’s environment consequent upon his or her having rendered that service; or

                     (e)  in the case of an aggravation of, or a material contribution to, a disease, or a sign or symptom of a disease—it would not have occurred:

                             (ii)  but for changes in the person’s environment consequent upon his or her having rendered that service.

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Defence service relating to duties before the commencement date

                   To avoid doubt, defence service may be rendered on or after the commencement date even if the service relates to the performance of a duty that ended before that date.

Example:    A member finishes duty just before the commencement date and is injured in an accident while travelling home just after the commencement date. The member is covered by the MRCA.

## Part 2—Application of the MRCA to certain injuries, diseases, deaths, losses and damage

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Application of the MRCA to certain injuries, diseases and deaths

             (1)  The MRCA applies to a person’s injury, disease or death if:

                     (a)  the injury is sustained, the disease is contracted, or the death occurs, on or after the commencement date; and

                     (b)  the injury, disease or death either:

                              (i)  relates to defence service rendered by the person on or after that date; or

                             (ii)  relates to defence service rendered by the person before, and on or after, that date.

Note:          After the commencement date, benefits stop being provided under the VEA and the SRCA for such injuries, diseases and deaths (see sections 9A and 70A of the VEA and section 4AA of the SRCA).

             (2)  The MRCA applies to an aggravation of, or a material contribution to, a person’s injury or disease, or a sign or symptom of a person’s injury or disease, if:

                     (a)  the aggravation or material contribution  occurs on or after the commencement date (even if the original injury is sustained, or the original disease is contracted, before that date); and

                     (b)  the aggravation or material contribution either:

                              (i)  relates to defence service rendered by the person on or after that date; or

                             (ii)  relates to defence service rendered by the person before, and on or after, that date.

Note 1:       After the commencement date, benefits stop being provided under the VEA and the SRCA for such aggravations and material contributions (see sections 9A and 70A of the VEA and section 4AA of the SRCA).

Note 2:       The MRCA does not apply to an aggravation or material contribution if a person instead applies under section 15 of the VEA for an increase in a pension because of the aggravation or material contribution (see section 9 of this Act).

             (3)  To avoid doubt, defence service is rendered before, and on or after, the commencement date whether the service spans the commencement date or is rendered during separate periods before and on or after that date.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Application of the MRCA to injuries, diseases and deaths etc. caused by certain treatment

             (1)  The MRCA applies to an injury, disease or death if:

                     (a)  the injury is sustained, the disease is contracted, or the death occurs, on or after the commencement date; and

                     (b)  the injury, disease or death occurs as an unintended consequence of treatment of a kind mentioned in section 29 of the MRCA; and

                     (c)  the treatment is provided either:

                              (i)  on or after the commencement date; or

                             (ii)  before, and on or after, the commencement date.

Note:          After the commencement date, benefits stop being provided under the VEA and the SRCA for such injuries, diseases and deaths (see sections 9A and 70A of the VEA and subsection 6A(2A) of the SRCA).

             (2)  The MRCA applies to an aggravation of, or a material contribution to, an injury or disease, or a sign or symptom of an injury or disease, if:

                     (a)  the aggravation or material contribution occurs on or after the commencement date (even if the original injury is sustained, or the original disease is contracted, before that date); and

                     (b)  the aggravation or material contribution occurs as an unintended consequence of treatment of a kind mentioned in section 29 of the MRCA; and

                     (c)  the treatment is provided either:

                              (i)  on or after the commencement date; or

                             (ii)  before, and on or after, the commencement date.

Note 1:       After the commencement date, benefits stop being provided under the VEA and the SRCA for such aggravations and material contributions (see sections 9A and 70A of the VEA and subsection 6A(2A) of the SRCA).

Note 2:       The MRCA does not apply to an aggravation or material contribution if a person instead applies under section 15 of the VEA for an increase in a pension because of the aggravation or material contribution (see section 9 of this Act).

             (3)  To avoid doubt, treatment is provided before, and on or after, the commencement date whether the treatment spans the commencement date or is provided during separate periods before and on or after that date.

##### <a id="9"></a>9  MRCA does not apply to certain aggravations of, or material contributions to, VEA injuries and diseases

                   The MRCA does not apply to a person’s aggravation or material contribution if:

                     (a)  the person is given a notice under section 12 of this Act; and

                     (b)  after receiving the notice, the person applies under section 15 of the VEA (or continues with an application already made under that section) for an increase in a rate of a pension on the ground that the person’s incapacity has increased because of the aggravation or material contribution.

Note:          Under section 12, a person who has a war-caused or defence-caused injury or disease that is aggravated etc. by defence service after the commencement date can choose whether the MRCA or the VEA will apply to the aggravated injury or disease.

##### <a id="10"></a>10  Subsection 7(4) of the SRCA does not apply

                   Subsection 7(4) of the SRCA does not apply in determining the day on which a disease is contracted, or aggravated or materially contributed to, for the purposes of paragraph 7(1)(a) or (2)(a) or 8(1)(a) or (2)(a).

Note:          The Commission must determine the day on which a disease is contracted, or aggravated or materially contributed to, rather than using the day that is deemed by subsection 7(4) of the SRCA.

##### <a id="11"></a>11  Application of the MRCA to loss or damage to medical aids

                   The MRCA applies to the loss of, or damage to, a member’s medical aid if the loss or damage results from an occurrence that happens on or after the commencement date.

Note:          After the commencement date, benefits stop being provided under the SRCA for such loss and damage (see section 15A of the SRCA).

## Part 3—Persons who have both VEA/SRCA and MRCA injuries and diseases

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Choice between the MRCA and the VEA for an aggravation of a VEA injury or disease

             (1)  This section applies to a person if:

                     (a)  the person is suffering from a war-caused or defence-caused injury or disease (within the meaning of the VEA); and

                     (b)  after the commencement date:

                              (i)  a claim is made under section 319 of the MRCA in respect of an aggravation of, or a material contribution to, the war-caused or defence-caused injury or disease (the **_aggravated injury or disease_**); or

                             (ii)  the person applies under section 15 of the VEA for an increase in a rate of pension on the ground that the incapacity of the person has increased because of an aggravation of, or a material contribution to, the war-caused or defence-caused injury or disease (the **_aggravated injury or disease_**), being an aggravation or material contribution to which subsection 7(2) or 8(2) of this Act applies; and

                     (c)  a notice has not previously been given to the person under this section in respect of the aggravated injury or disease.

             (2)  The Commission must give the person a written notice as soon as practicable advising the person that he or she must choose between:

                     (a)  making a claim under section 319 of the MRCA for acceptance of liability for the aggravated injury or disease; or

                     (b)  applying under section 15 of the VEA for an increase in a rate of pension in respect of the aggravated injury or disease.

Note:          A person makes the choice by making a claim or applying, or continuing with a claim or application, under one of those sections.

##### <a id="13"></a>13  Bringing across impairment points from a VEA or SRCA injury or disease

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a claim is made under section 319 of the MRCA in respect of a person who also has:

                              (i)  a separate war-caused or defence-caused injury or disease (within the meaning of the VEA) (the **_old injury or disease_**); or

                             (ii)  a separate injury or disease (within the meaning of the SRCA) (the **_old injury or disease_**); or

                     (b)  a claim is made under section 319 of the MRCA in respect of an aggravation of, or a material contribution to:

                              (i)  a war-caused or defence-caused injury or disease of a person (within the meaning of the VEA) (the **_old injury or disease_**); or

##### <a id="145"></a>145  Relevant authority

             (1)  This Act applies in relation to an employee by whom or in respect of whom a defence-related claim has been made, and in relation to dependants of the employee, as if the MRCC were the relevant authority in relation to the employee for that claim.

             (2)  However, for defence-related claims, this Act has effect as if references in this Act to a relevant authority, in relation to liability to pay an amount, in relation to a debt being due or in relation to the receipt of an amount, were references to the Commonwealth.

##### <a id="146"></a>146  Rehabilitation authority etc.

             (1)  This Act applies to the employee in relation to a defence-related claim as if the rehabilitation authority in relation to the employee were the rehabilitation authority applicable under subsection 39(3) of the MRCA.

             (2)  Section 40 of the MRCA (rules where rehabilitation authority changes) applies for the purposes of the application of this Act to the employee in relation to a defence-related claim.

             (3)  The duty under section 40 to take steps to provide suitable employment, or to assist in finding suitable employment, for a person who is undertaking, or has completed, a rehabilitation program must be performed by the person’s rehabilitation authority rather than the Commonwealth.

             (1)  For the purposes of applying this Act to defence-related claims and matters arising out of those claims:

                     (a)  Part II applies as if references in that Part to Comcare (except references in section 28 and references covered by paragraph (b)) were references to the MRCC; and

                     (b)  this Act applies as if references in this Act to Comcare, in relation to liability to pay an amount, in relation to a debt being due or in relation to the receipt of an amount, were references to the Commonwealth; and

                     (c)  this Act applies as if another reference in this Act to Comcare (other than in Division 2 of Part III, section 41 or Part VI, VII or VIII) were, unless the contrary intention appears, a reference to the MRCC.

             (2)  In addition, this Act applies to defence-related claims and matters arising out of those claims with the modifications specified in this table:
