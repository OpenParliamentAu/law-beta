#### Guide to Division 115

##### <a id="115‑1"></a>115‑1  What this Division is about

* * *

You pay quarterly instalments of MRRT under this Division if you have mining revenue for a quarter or a positive instalment rate.

Instalments give rise to a credit once an assessment of the MRRT is made.

The amount of a quarterly instalment is the product of your instalment income for the quarter and your applicable instalment rate.

The applicable instalment rate may be a rate chosen by you, a rate given to you by the Commissioner, or a statutory default rate.

General interest charge may be payable if a rate you choose for a quarter is too low, having regard to the amount of MRRT you are liable to pay for the year.

                             (ii)  under section 70‑40 of that Act in your * pre‑mining revenue for a * pre‑mining project interest for the MRRT year.

Note 1:       Special rules affect the calculation of instalment income for project interests that are transferred or split: see Subdivision 115‑G.

Note 2:       If you have chosen to use the alternative valuation method under Division 175 of the _Minerals Resource Rent Tax Act 2012_, your unadjusted revenue amounts under section 175‑30 of that Act will be the same as the amounts worked out under column 2 of the table in subsection 30‑25(2) of that Act.

             (2)  The Commissioner may, by giving you written notice, determine a nil rate for you for an * MRRT year if, in the Commissioner’s opinion, you are unlikely to be liable to pay * MRRT for the MRRT year.

             (3)  The Commissioner may, by legislative instrument, determine a nil rate for a class of entities for an * MRRT year if, in the Commissioner’s opinion, each entity in the class is unlikely to be liable to pay * MRRT for the MRRT year.

             (4)  A determination applies for the * instalment quarter in which the Commissioner makes it, and for later quarters in the * MRRT year.

Note:          The determination does not apply in later MRRT years.

             (5)  However, if the Commissioner later gives you an instalment rate under Subdivision 115‑E, the determination stops applying to you for the instalment quarter in which you are given that later rate, and for later quarters.

Note 1:       This may mean the nil rate determination does not apply to you for any instalment quarter (if the Commissioner makes the determination, then _later_ in the same quarter gives you an instalment rate under Subdivision 115‑E).

Note 2:       For whether the rate the Commissioner gives you under Subdivision 115‑E is your **_applicable instalment rate_** for an instalment quarter, see the table in subsection (1).

##### <a id="115‑55"></a>115‑55  Notifying Commissioner of varied instalment rate

             (1)  If you choose an instalment rate for an * instalment quarter under section 115‑50, you must notify the Commissioner of the rate.

             (2)  You must notify the Commissioner in the * approved form and on or before the day the instalment for the * instalment quarter is due (regardless of whether it is paid).

Note:          The Commissioner may combine this approved form with the approved form for the notice you are required to give under section 115‑15: see subsection 388‑50(2).

#### Variation credits

##### <a id="115‑60"></a>115‑60  Credit on using varied rate in certain cases

             (1)  You are entitled to claim a credit if:

                     (a)  you are liable to pay an instalment for an * instalment quarter (the **_current quarter_**) in an * MRRT year; and

                     (b)  the amount of your instalment for the current quarter is to be worked out using an instalment rate you chose under section 115‑50; and

                     (c)  that rate is lower than your * applicable instalment rate for the previous quarter in the same year; and

                     (d)  the amount worked out using the method statement is greater than nil.

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.   Add up the instalments you are liable to pay for the earlier * instalment quarters in the year (even if you have not yet paid all of them).

Step 2.   Subtract from the step 1 amount each earlier credit that you have claimed under this section or section 115‑100 in respect of the year.

Step 3.   Multiply the total of your * instalment income for those earlier * instalment quarters by your * applicable instalment rate for the current quarter.

Step 4.   Subtract the step 3 amount from the step 2 amount.

Step 5.   If the result is a positive amount, it is the amount of the credit you can claim.

* * *

Example:    In the first instalment quarter in an MRRT year, a miner has instalment income of $100m and an applicable instalment rate of 15%, which has been given by the Commissioner.

                   In the second instalment quarter in the MRRT year, the miner has instalment income of $80m and uses the same rate given by the Commissioner (15%).

                   In the third instalment quarter in the MRRT year, the miner has instalment income of $70m and chooses an instalment rate of 12%.

                   The miner uses the method statement to work out a credit as follows:

                   Step 1: The instalment of $15m for the first instalment quarter ($100m x 15%), plus the instalment of $12m for the second instalment quarter ($80m x 15%) gives a total step 1 amount of $27m.

                   Step 2: No earlier credits have been claimed, so there is no amount to subtract from the step 1 amount—the step 2 amount is $27m.

                   Step 3: The total of the instalment income for the earlier quarters is $180m, multiplied by the rate for the current quarter (12%), equals $21.6m.

                   Step 4: $27m ‑ $21.6m = $5.4m.

                   Step 5: The miner has a credit of $5.4m.

                   The miner also has an instalment liability for the current quarter of $8.4m ($70m x 12%).

                   After applying the $5.4m credit, the miner will be liable to pay an amount of $3m for the quarter.

             (2)  A claim for a credit must be made in the * approved form on or before the day on which the instalment for the current quarter is due.

Note:          How the credit is applied is set out in Division 3 of Part IIB.

             (3)  The credit entitlement does not affect your liability to pay an instalment.

#### General interest charge payable in certain cases if instalments are too low

##### <a id="115‑65"></a>115‑65  Liability to GIC on shortfall in instalments worked out on the basis of varied rate

             (1)  You are liable to pay the * general interest charge under this section if:

                     (a)  an instalment rate (the **_varied rate_**) you choose under section 115‑50 is your * applicable instalment rate for an * instalment quarter (the **_variation quarter_**) in an * MRRT year; and

                     (b)  the varied rate is less than 85% of your * benchmark instalment rate for the MRRT year.

Note:          For the Commissioner’s power to remit general interest charge, see section 8AAG.

             (2)  You are liable to pay the * general interest charge on the amount worked out as follows:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00446/Html/afc50656-2b2e-46b9-98bd-d823b886840d_files/image003.gif)

where:

                    <a name="crite-adjust"></a>**_credit adjustment_** means:

                     (a)  if, as a result of using the varied rate for the variation quarter, you claimed a credit under section 115‑60—the amount worked out as follows:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00446/Html/afc50656-2b2e-46b9-98bd-d823b886840d_files/image004.gif)

                            or the sum of the amounts of the credits, whichever is less; and

                     (b)  otherwise—nil.

                    <a name="rate-discrep"></a>**_rate discrepancy_** means the difference between the varied rate and the lesser of:

                     (a)  the rate that would have been your * applicable instalment rate for the variation quarter if you did not choose an instalment rate for the variation quarter or an earlier * instalment quarter in the * MRRT year; and

                     (b)  your * benchmark instalment rate for that MRRT year.

             (3)  You are liable to pay the charge for each day in the period that:

                     (a)  started at the beginning of the day by which the instalment for the variation quarter was due to be paid; and

                     (b)  finishes at the end of the day on which your * assessed MRRT for the * MRRT year is due to be paid.

             (4)  The Commissioner must give you written notice of the * general interest charge to which you are liable under subsection (2). You must pay the charge within 14 days after the notice is given to you.

             (5)  If any of the * general interest charge to which you are liable under subsection (2) remains unpaid at the end of the 14 days referred to in subsection (4), you are also liable to pay the general interest charge on the unpaid amount for each day in the period that:

                     (a)  starts at the end of those 14 days; and

                     (b)  finishes at the end of the last day on which, at the end of the day, any of the following remains unpaid:

                              (i)  the unpaid amount;

                             (ii)  general interest charge on the unpaid amount.

##### <a id="115‑70"></a>115‑70  Working out your _benchmark instalment rate_

                   Your **_benchmark instalment rate_** for an * MRRT year is the percentage worked out to 2 decimal places (rounding up if the third decimal place is 5 or more) using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00446/Html/afc50656-2b2e-46b9-98bd-d823b886840d_files/image005.gif)

However, your **_benchmark instalment rate_** for the MRRT year is a nil rate if either component of the fraction is nil.

##### <a id="115‑75"></a>115‑75  Commissioner instalment rate for MRRT

             (1)  The Commissioner may give you an instalment rate from time to time, by giving you written notice of:

                     (a)  the instalment rate; and

                     (b)  the modified MRRT liability, as worked out under subsection (2), for the purposes of working out the instalment rate.

Note:          For whether the rate the Commissioner gives you is your **_applicable instalment rate_** for an instalment quarter, see section 115‑45.

             (2)  An instalment rate that the Commissioner gives you must be the percentage worked out to 2 decimal places (rounding up if the third decimal place is 5 or more) using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00446/Html/afc50656-2b2e-46b9-98bd-d823b886840d_files/image006.gif)

where:

                    <a name="modifi-liabil-mrrt"></a>**_modified liability for MRRT_** is the amount of * MRRT you are liable to pay for the * base year, subject to section 115‑80.

Note:          The instalment rate worked out under this subsection could exceed the MRRT rate. One reason for this is that not all amounts of mining revenue are included in instalment income.

(3) The **_base year_** is the most recent * MRRT year for which an assessment of * MRRT has been made for you.

             (4)  However, the instalment rate must be a nil rate if either component of the fraction is nil.

             (5)  Despite subsections (2) to (4), the Commissioner may give you an instalment rate worked out on a different basis if, having regard to the object of this Division and the circumstances, the Commissioner is of the opinion:

                     (a)  that it would be reasonable to work out the rate under this subsection; and

                     (b)  that the rate so worked out is reasonable.

Example:    The following are some examples of circumstances in which a rate may be worked out on a different basis:

(a)    an entity joins or leaves a consolidated group;

(b)    a mining project interest is transferred or split;

(c)    there is no base year for the mining project interest;

(d)    there was a significant amount of one‑off capital expenditure in the base year;

(e)    MRRT allowances applied in a later year are expected to be significantly less than MRRT allowances applied in the base year;

(f)    there is a change in the economic circumstances of the mining industry.

             (6)  To avoid doubt, an instalment rate the Commissioner works out under subsection (5) may be higher, or lower, than the rate worked out under subsection (2) (if a rate can be worked out under that subsection).

##### <a id="115‑80"></a>115‑80  Commissioner may take changes, and proposed changes, to the law into account

                   For the purposes of working out your modified liability for * MRRT for a * base year, the Commissioner may work out an amount:

                     (a)  as if provisions of an Act or regulations, as they may reasonably be expected to apply for the purposes of your assessment for a later * MRRT year, had applied for the purposes of the base year; and

                     (b)  as if provisions of an Act or regulations had applied for the purposes of the base year if:

                              (i)  in the Commissioner’s opinion, the provisions are likely to be enacted or made; and

                             (ii)  the application of the provisions reduces the instalment rate being given to you.

Note:          Taking law changes, and proposed law changes, into account in working out the instalment rate means total instalments for the year are as close as possible to your likely MRRT for the year.

#### Subdivision 115‑F—Default instalment rate

**Table of sections**

115‑85      Default instalment rate

##### <a id="115‑85"></a>115‑85  Default instalment rate

Instalment rate for instalment income relating to iron ore

             (1)  The rate that applies to you for an * instalment quarter in which your * instalment income only includes amounts relating to iron ore is:

                     (a)  if paragraph (b) does not apply—8%; or

                     (b)  if the regulations prescribe a rate for the instalment quarter for the purposes of this subsection—that rate.

Instalment rate for instalment income relating to other taxable resources

             (2)  The rate that applies to you for an * instalment quarter in which your * instalment income only includes amounts relating to * taxable resources other than iron ore, is:

                     (a)  if paragraph (b) does not apply—3%; or

                     (b)  if the regulations prescribe a rate for the instalment quarter for the purposes of this subsection—that rate.

Instalment rate for instalment income relating to iron ore and other taxable resources

             (3)  The rate that applies to you for an * instalment quarter in which your * instalment income includes amounts relating both to iron ore and to other * taxable resources is the sum of the following, worked out to 2 decimal places (rounding up if the third decimal place is 5 or more):

                     (a)  the rate that would apply for the quarter if your instalment income only included amounts relating to iron ore, multiplied by the proportion of your total instalment income for the quarter that relates to iron ore;

                     (b)  the rate that would apply for the quarter if your instalment income only included amounts relating to taxable resources other than iron ore, multiplied by the proportion of your total instalment income for the quarter that relates to taxable resources other than iron ore.

Example:    In an instalment quarter, you have $200m in instalment income from mining project interests that relate to iron ore, and $100m in instalment income from mining project interests that relate to coal.

                   Under subsection (1), the default instalment rate for iron ore is 8%, and under subsection (2) the default instalment rate for coal is 3%.

                   The rate that applies to you for the quarter is 6.33% \[(.08 x 200m/300m) + (.03 x 100m/300m)].

Regulations not to be made in first MRRT year

             (4)  The regulations may prescribe a rate for the purposes of subsection (1) or (2) for an * instalment quarter in the 2013‑2014 * MRRT year or a later year.

             (1)  In working out, under section 115‑40, your * instalment income for an * instalment quarter that ends before a * mining project transfer, * mining project split, * pre‑mining project transfer or * pre‑mining project split happens:

                     (a)  include amounts that:

                              (i)  relate to * mining revenue events that happen during the instalment quarter; and

                             (ii)  would, apart from the application of Division 120, 125, 145 or 150 of the _Minerals Resource Rent Tax Act 2012_ in relation to the transfer or split, be included in your * mining revenue or * pre‑mining revenue as mentioned in section 115‑40; and

                     (b)  do not include amounts that:

                              (i)  relate to mining revenue events that happen during the instalment quarter; and

                             (ii)  are included in your mining revenue or pre‑mining revenue as mentioned in section 115‑40 only because of the application of those Divisions in relation to the transfer or split.

Note 1:       For the original miner or explorer (paragraph (a) case):

(a)    a credit may be available under section 115‑100; and

(b)    the effect of paragraph (a) is modified in some circumstances: see section 115‑105.

Note 2:       For the new miner or explorer (paragraph (b) case), additional “catch up” instalment income may be included in the quarter in which the transfer or split happens: see section 115‑95.

Instalment quarter in which transfer or split happens—instalment income transfers with interest

             (2)  In working out, under section 115‑40, your * instalment income for an * instalment quarter in which a * mining project transfer, * mining project split, * pre‑mining project transfer or * pre‑mining project split happens:

                     (a)  include amounts that:

                              (i)  relate to * mining revenue events that happen during the instalment quarter; and

                             (ii)  because of the application of Division 120, 125, 145 or 150 of the _Minerals Resource Rent Tax Act 2012_ in relation to the transfer or split, are included in your * mining revenue or * pre‑mining revenue as mentioned in section 115‑40; and

                     (b)  do not include amounts that:

                             (ii)  because of the application of those Divisions in relation to the transfer or split, are not included in your mining revenue or pre‑mining revenue as mentioned in section 115‑40.

##### <a id="115‑95"></a>115‑95  Additional instalment income for new miner or new explorer

             (1)  Your **_instalment income_** for an * instalment quarter in an * MRRT year includes an amount worked out under subsection (2) if:

                     (a)  a * mining project transfer, * mining project split, * pre‑mining project transfer or * pre‑mining project split happens in the instalment quarter; and

                     (b)  you have the relevant * mining project interest or * pre‑mining project interest after the transfer or split.

             (2)  The amount is the sum of the amounts worked out under column 2 of the table in subsection 30‑25(2) of the _Minerals Resource Rent Tax Act 2012_ for each * mining revenue event that:

                     (a)  happens before the start of the * instalment quarter in which the transfer or split happens; and

                     (b)  because of the application of Division 120, 125, 145 or 150 of the _Minerals Resource Rent Tax Act 2012_ in relation to the transfer or split, results in an amount (including a nil amount) being included in your * mining revenue or * pre‑mining revenue as mentioned in section 115‑40.

Note 1:       The additional instalment income amount is nil if the transfer or split happens in the first quarter of an MRRT year, and the miner or explorer that has the interest before the transfer or split has the same MRRT year as each miner or explorer that has the interest after the transfer or split.

Note 2:       For the instalment quarter in which the transfer or split happens, instalment income from before the transfer or split is included under subsection 115‑90(2).

##### <a id="115‑100"></a>115‑100  Credit for original miner or original explorer for instalment quarters before transfer or split

             (1)  You are entitled to claim a credit if:

                     (b)  your * instalment income for an earlier instalment quarter in the MRRT year for which you are liable to pay an instalment includes one or more amounts relating to the mining project interest; and

                     (c)  the amount worked out using the method statement is greater than nil.

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.   Add up the instalments you are liable to pay for the earlier * instalment quarters in the year (even if you have not yet paid all of them).

Step 2.   Subtract from the step 1 amount each earlier credit that you have claimed under this section or section 115‑60 in respect of the year.

Step 3.   For each earlier * instalment quarter in the year, work out your * instalment income under section 115‑40 without including amounts that:

               (a)     relate to * mining revenue events that happen during the instalment quarter; and

              (b)     because of the application of Division 120, 125, 145 or 150 of the _Minerals Resource Rent Tax Act 2012_ in relation to a transfer or split, are not included in your * mining revenue or * pre‑mining revenue as mentioned in section 115‑40.

                   Note:             Step 3 effectively recalculates instalment income disregarding paragraph 115‑90(1)(a).

Step 4.   Multiply the step 3 amount by your * applicable instalment rate for that quarter.

Step 5.   Sum the amounts worked out under step 4.

Step 6.   Subtract the step 5 amount from the step 2 amount.

Step 7.   If the result is a positive amount, it is the amount of the credit you can claim.

## 2  Modified time of supply for prepayments before 1 July 2012

## 3  Recoupment or offsetting of mining expenditure

An amount is included under section 30‑40 of the _Minerals Resource Rent Tax Act 2012_ in a miner’s mining revenue for a mining project interest for the MRRT year starting on 1 July 2012 to the extent that:

                     (a)  the amount is received, or becomes receivable, before the start of that MRRT year; and

<h7 class="ActHead7">Part 4—Specialist liability rules</h7>

## 7  Combining mining project interests before commencement

Combining mining project interests

(1)       Two or more mining project interests are taken by Division 115 of the _Minerals Resource Rent Tax Act 2012_ to be the same mining project interest from a particular time before 1 July 2012 if those interests would be taken to be the same mining project interest under that Division from that time if the time was after 1 July 2012.

Downstream integration of mining project interests

(2)       If:

                     (a)  disregarding paragraph 255‑10(d) of the _Minerals Resource Rent Tax Act 2012_(choosing to treat mining project interests as integrated), a mining project interest would have been integrated with another mining project interest at a time during the period:

                             (ii)  ending just before the start of 1 July 2012; and

                     (b)  the miner makes a valid choice under section 255‑20 of that Act on or before the day on which the obligation to give an MRRT return for the first MRRT year falls due;

the requirement in paragraph 255‑10(d) of that Act is taken to be satisfied at all times during the period starting at the time mentioned in paragraph (a) of this subitem and ending when the miner makes that choice.

## 8  Transferring and splitting mining project interests

To avoid doubt, Divisions 120 and 125 of the _Minerals Resource Rent Tax Act 2012_ apply in relation to mining project interests before 1 July 2012 in the same way as those Divisions apply in relation to mining project interests after that day.

## 9  Transferring and splitting pre‑mining project interests

To avoid doubt, Divisions 145 and 150 of the _Minerals Resource Rent Tax Act 2012_ apply in relation to pre‑mining project interests before 1 July 2012 in the same way as those Divisions apply in relation to pre‑mining project interests after that day.

## 10  Substituted accounting periods

Despite section 10‑25 of the _Minerals Resource Rent Tax Act 2012_, if:

                     (a)   a miner has, under section 18 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, accounting periods that are not financial years; and

                     (b)  one of those accounting periods starts before 1 July 2012 and ends after that day;

the period starting on 1 July 2012 and ending at the end of that accounting period is an **_MRRT year_**.

                     (a)  the choice is made on 1 July 2012 or within such further time as the Commissioner allows; and

                     (b)  the day of effect is between 2 May 2010 and the day the choice is made; and

                     (c)  the consolidated group or MEC group existed on the day of effect; and

                     (d)  the company notifies the Commissioner, under subsection 215‑10(3) of that Act, that the choice is to apply from the day of effect.

(2)       However, despite paragraphs 121‑10(4)(b) and (c) in that Schedule, an entity’s obligation to give a notice that arises because of subitem (1) is taken to have been complied with if it is given by the later of the following:

                     (a)  21 July 2012;

                     (b)  21 days after receiving a notice that another entity is obliged to give the entity because of subitem (1).

## 15  Starting base assessments

(1)       Without limiting Division 155 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_, that Division also applies in relation to a starting base asset as if:
