“**24  Agreement with States for provision of public hospital services and other health services from****1 July 1993**

“(1)  The Commonwealth may enter into an Agreement with a State for and in relation to:

                     (a)  the State providing, for the period beginning on 1 July 1993 and ending on 30 June 1998:

                              (i)  public hospital services; and

                             (ii)  other health services; and

                     (b)  the Commonwealth providing financial assistance in the respect of the provision of those services.

           “(2)  The Agreement:

                     (a)  must be in terms that give effect substantially to the Heads of Agreement specified in Schedule 2A; and

                     (b)  may provide for matters other than the Heads of Agreement, including points of understanding between the parties to it.

“**25  Terms and conditions of financial assistance**

           “(1)  Financial assistance is not payable to a State in respect of a period commencing after 1 July 1993 unless an Agreement has been entered into by that State.

           “(2)  The 5 components of the financial assistance payable under an Agreement are as follows:

                     (a)  a base hospital funding grant;

                     (b)  a hospital bonus payment;

                     (c)  a hospital incentive package;

                     (d)  a mental health incentive package;

                     (e)  other health services funding.

           “(3)  The Agreement must provide for the method of calculating the amount of base hospital funding grant payable in respect of a financial year during the grant period.

           “(4)  Financial assistance is payable in the amounts provided for in the Agreement.

           “(5)  The Agreement must provide for the amount of hospital bonus payment payable to a State under the hospital bonus component to be reviewed each time the percentage of the national population who, at 30 June 1993, are covered by a supplementary hospital table falls by at least 2 percentage points or a multiple thereof.

Note 1:       If the percentage of the national population at  30 June 1993 who are covered by a supplementary hospital table is x%, then a review would be triggered under this section if the rate drops to (x-2)%.

Note 2:       Subsequent review during the life of the Agreement would be triggered by additional drops of 2 percentage points over the base established at 30 June 1993\. That is, if the percentage of the national population at 30 June 1993 who are covered by a supplementary hospital table subsequently drops to (x-4)%, this would trigger another review. Similarly, drops to (x-6)%, (x-8)% etc. would trigger further reviews.

“(6)  Financial assistance is to be provided on the conditions set out in the Agreement and in section 26.

           “(7)  In calculating the percentage of the national population who are covered by a supplementary hospital table at any time, regard must be had to the data published by the Private Health Insurance Administration Council.

“**26  Conditions relating to Medicare Principles and Commitments**

           “(1)  It is a condition of the grant of financial assistance by the Commonwealth to a State in respect of the provision by the State of public hospital services that the State, in providing those services, gives effect to the Medicare Principles and undertakes the Commitments listed below:

                     (a)  in the manner required by subsections (3) to (6) and the Agreement; and

                     (b)  within the timetable set out in the Agreement.

“(2)  The Medicare Principles and Commitments are as follows:

**MEDICARE PRINCIPLES**

**The Commonwealth and the States are committed to the following principles in the provision of public hospital services:**

Explanatory Note:        The Principles focus on the provision of public hospital services to eligible persons, but operate in an environment where eligible persons have the right to choose private health care in public and private hospitals supported by private health insurance.

**Choices of services**

**Principle 1:   Eligible persons must be given the choice to receive public hospital services free of charge as public patients**

Explanatory Note 1:     Hospital services include in-patient, out-patient, emergency services (including primary care where appropriate) and day patient services consistent with currently acceptable medical and health service standards. 

Explanatory Note 2:     At the time of admission to a hospital, or as soon as practicable after that, an eligible person will be required to elect or confirm whether he or she wishes to be treated as a public or private patient. 

**Universality of services**

**Principle 2:   Access to public hospital services is to be on the basis of clinical need**

Explanatory Note 1:     None of the following factors are to be a determinant of an eligible person’s priority for receiving hospital services: 

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">          </span>whether or not an eligible person has health insurance; 

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">          </span>an eligible person’s financial status or place of residence;

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">          </span>whether or not an eligible person intends to elect, or elects, to be treated as a public or private patient. 

Explanatory Note 2:     This principle applies equally to waiting times for elective surgery. 

**Equity in service provision**

**Principle 3:   To the maximum practicable extent, a State will ensure the provision of public hospital services equitably to all eligible persons, regardless of their geographical location**

Explanatory Note 1:     This principle does not require a local hospital to be equipped to provide eligible persons with every hospital service they may need. 

Explanatory Note 2:     In rural and remote areas, a State should ensure provision of reasonable public access to a basic range of hospital services which are in accord with clinical practices.

**COMMITMENTS**

**In order to achieve Principles 1 to 3, the Commonwealth and States make the following Commitments regarding public hospital services for eligible persons:**

**Information about service provision**

**Commitment 1:   The Commonwealth and a State must make available information on the public hospital services eligible persons can expect to receive as public patients**

Explanatory Note 1:     The joint Commonwealth/State development of a Public Patients’ Hospital Charter for each State will be a vehicle for the public dissemination of this information. 

Explanatory Note 2:     The Charter will set out the public hospital services available to public patients. 

**Efficiency and quality in service provision**

**Commitment 2:   The Commonwealth and the States are committed to making improvements in the efficiency, effectiveness and quality of hospital service delivery**

Explanatory Note:        This includes a commitment to quality improvement, outcome measurement, management efficiency and effort to integrate the delivery of hospital and other health and community services.

“(3)    To give effect to the Medicare Principles and Commitments, a State must:

     (a)  agree to the development, in consultation with the Commonwealth, of a Public Patients’ Hospital Charter which must set out:

                (i)     how the Medicare Principles are to apply in respect of the provision, in that State of public hospital services; and

               (ii)     the process by which eligible persons, in respect of public hospital services received by them, can lodge complaints and how those complaints are to be heard by an independent body (**‘complaints body’**); and

     (b)  either:

                (i)     adopt the Principles and Commitments; or

               (ii)     if the State cannot adopt the Principles and Commitments—make reasonable efforts to adopt the Principles and Commitments; and

     (c)  once developed, distribute the Charter to the public; and

     (d)  otherwise give effect to the Principles and the Charter and adhere to the Commitments as required by the Agreement.

“(4)    The complaints body, which does not have to be created solely for this purpose, is to be independent of the State’s hospitals and the State’s Department of Health.

“(5)    The complaints body is to be given powers that would enable it to investigate, conciliate and adjudicate upon complaints received by it.

“(6)    The complaints body is to be given a role in recommending improvements in the delivery of hospital services in respect of which the Commonwealth provides financial assistance.

“(7)    An Agreement may define the State efforts that will be taken to be reasonable efforts to adopt the Principles.

“(8)    In this section, **‘adopt’** means to enact legislation that establishes the Principles and Commitments as guidelines that will govern the delivery of public hospital services to eligible persons in a State, but neither the obligation to enact that legislation, nor the State legislation so enacted, operates to create in any person legal rights not in existence before the enactment of the State legislation, unless the State legislation expressly provides otherwise.

**Variation of an Agreement**

“27.    (1)      Subject to section 28, an Agreement may be varied by agreement, in writing, between the parties to it.

“(2)    Without limiting subsection (1), the parties may, by agreement, provide for certain specified variations to the Agreement to be agreed to and made on behalf of the parties by the Commonwealth and the State Ministers for health.

“(3)    A variation must comply with the conditions in this Part and the Heads of Agreement set out in Schedule 2A.

“(4)    In this section:

                    **‘Commonwealth Minister for health’** means the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services or any other Commonwealth Minister who administers matters to which this Part and the Agreement relate and includes any other Commonwealth Minister who may be acting for and on behalf of either of those Ministers.

                    **‘State Minister for health’**means the State Minister for health or any other State Minister who administers, for the State, matters to which this Part and the Agreement relate and includes any other State Minister who may be acting for and on behalf of any of those State Ministers.

**Certain variations of an Agreement to be made by special procedures**

“28.    (1)      An Agreement may be varied in a way that:

     (a)  changes the base hospital funding grant formula so that the amount of base hospital funding grant payable under the Agreement is less than the amount that would be payable if the formula was not changed; or

     (b)  effects a substantial reduction in the amount of non-base hospital funding payable under it; or

     (c)  changes the definition of substantial reduction in the amount of non-base hospital funding that is set out in the Agreement on the day that it is entered into; or

     (d)  terminates the Agreement before 30 June 1998;

only if:

     (e)  the parties to it agree, in writing, that the Agreement:

                (i)  in the case of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c)—be so varied with effect from a specified day; or

               (ii)  in the case of paragraph (d)—be so terminated on a specified day before 30 June 1998; and

      (f)  both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament approve, by resolution, the variation of the Agreement with effect from the specified day.

_Note:    For the meaning of substantial reduction in the amount of non-base hospital funding payable see subsection 23E(1)._

“(2)    In this section, **‘non-base hospital funding’** means the amount of financial assistance payable under an Agreement by reference to the components set out in paragraphs 25(2)(b) to (2)(e).

**Tabling of an Agreement**

“29.    An Agreement must be tabled in each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after it is made.

**Appropriation**

“30.    (1)      Subject to subsection (2), an amount (including an advance) payable under this Part is to be paid out of amounts appropriated by the Parliament from time to time.

“(2)    An amount (including an advance) in respect of an item listed in paragraph 25(2)(a), (b), (c) or (d) is payable out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which is appropriated accordingly.”.
