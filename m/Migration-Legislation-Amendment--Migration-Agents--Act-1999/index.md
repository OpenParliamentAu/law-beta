                     (c)  obtain copies of client documents from inactive agents or from the legal personal representatives of deceased agents; and

                     (d)  give the copies to the clients concerned.

Note:          An agent becomes **_inactive_** as a result of expiry of registration, deregistration, cancellation of registration, suspension of registration, or incapacity (see section 306B).

##### <a id="306B"></a>306B  Inactive agents

                   For the purposes of this Division:

                             (ii)  the person remains an inactive agent until the end of the period of 2 years after the cessation or until the person again becomes a registered agent, whichever happens first; and

                     (b)  if, at a person’s request, the Migration Agents Registration Authority deregisters the person under section 302:

                              (i)  the person becomes an **_inactive agent_** at the time of the deregistration; and

                             (ii)  the person remains an inactive agent until the end of the period of 2 years after the deregistration or until the person again becomes a registered agent, whichever happens first; and

                     (c)  if the Migration Agents Registration Authority cancels a person’s registration under section 303:

                              (i)  the person becomes an **_inactive agent_** at the time of the cancellation; and

                             (ii)  the person remains an inactive agent for 2 years; and

                     (d)  if the Migration Agents Registration Authority suspends a person’s registration under section 303:

                              (i)  the person becomes an **_inactive agent_** at the time of the suspension; and

                             (ii)  the person remains an inactive agent for the period of the suspension; and

                     (e)  if, while a person is a registered agent, the person becomes physically or mentally incapable, for a continuous period of not less than 14 days, of giving immigration assistance:

                              (i)  the person becomes an **_inactive agent_** at the end of that period of 14 days; and

                             (ii)  the person remains an inactive agent until the person ceases to be physically or mentally incapable of giving immigration assistance.

                     (d)  a person sponsoring (or seeking to sponsor) a visa applicant for the purposes of the regulations;

then:
