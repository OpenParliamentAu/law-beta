 Disclosure of Interests
 7.	(1)	Each Trustee shall:
 	(a)	as soon as possible after, but in any case not later than 60 days after, appointment as a Trustee; and
 	(b)	as soon as possible after, but in any case not later than 60 days after, each anniversary of the Trustee's appointment as a Trustee,
 present to a meeting of the Board a statement in writing setting out particulars of those interests, whether pecuniary or otherwise and whether direct or indirect, of the Trustee as at the day of appointment or as at that anniversary, as the case requires, that could reasonably be expected to conflict with the proper performance by the Trustee of the Trustee's duties as a Trustee.
 (2)	A statement presented by a Trustee to a meeting of the Board in pursuance of subclause&#160;(1) shall be incorporated into the minutes of the meeting.
 (3)	Where a Trustee acquires an interest, whether pecuniary or otherwise and whether direct or indirect, that could reasonably be expected to conflict with the proper performance by the Trustee of the Trustee's duties as a Trustee and a statement containing particulars of the interest has not been given to a meeting of the Board in accordance with subclause&#160;(1), the Trustee shall, as soon as possible after acquiring that interest, present to a meeting of the Board a statement in writing setting out particulars of the interest and the statement shall be incorporated in the minutes of the meeting.

 (5)	A disclosure under subclause&#160;(4) shall be recorded in the minutes of the meeting of the Board and the Trustee shall not, unless the Board or the Minister otherwise determines:
 	(a)	be present during any deliberation of the Board with respect to that matter; or

 	(a)	be present during any deliberation of the Board for the purpose of making the determination; or
 	(b)	take part in the making by the Board of the determination.
 (7)	Where a Trustee is obliged by subclause&#160;(4) to disclose the nature of an interest at a meeting of the Board, the fact that the Trustee has presented to a meeting of the Board a statement under subclause&#160;(1) or (3) that includes particulars of that interest does not relieve the Trustee of the Trustee's obligation under subclause&#160;(4).
 Meetings of the Board of Trustees
 8.	(1)	The Board shall hold such meetings as are necessary for the conduct of its affairs.
 (2)	The Chairperson may at any time convene a meeting of the Board and shall, when so requested in writing by another Trustee, convene a meeting of the Board within 30 days of receiving such notice.

 (3)	The Fund shall be used by the Board to pay benefits to or in respect of members, to make payments to the Commonwealth in respect of members' benefits as provided for in the Act and to pay the costs and expenses of the management and investment of the Fund.
 Investment of the Fund
 10.	(1)	For the purposes of this clause:
 	(a)	"invest" means expend moneys with a view to obtaining a present or future financial return (whether by way of income, profit or otherwise); and
 	(b)	"profit" includes capital profit.
 (2)	Moneys standing to the credit of the Fund which the Board, after consultation with its investment manager, is of the opinion are moneys that are not for the time being required for the purpose of making payments out of the Fund under the Act and the Deed shall, so far as is practicable, be invested by the Board in accordance with the Act and the Deed, but the Board shall so manage the Fund that moneys that are from time to time required to pay benefits that are payable out of the Fund are available for that purpose.
 (3)	Moneys that, by virtue of subclause&#160;(2), are required to be invested by the Board may be invested in any manner and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, may be invested by the Board jointly with another person or other persons.

In determining and reviewing its investment strategy and policy, the Board shall consult with such persons or bodies as it thinks fit.
 (5)	The Board shall invest moneys standing to the credit of the Fund that are available for investment only through an investment manager or managers who undertake to invest, and manage the investment of, those funds on behalf of the Board.
 (6)	The Board shall ensure that any investment manager:
 	(a)	operates within the investment powers of the Board and the investment strategy and policy as determined for the time being by the Board; and
 	(b)	reports to the Board on the state of the Board's investments and the investment market at such times and in such manner as the Board determines.
 Requests by Minister for Information
 11.	The Board shall furnish to the Minister such information relating to the general administration and operation of the Superannuation Scheme and the Fund as the Minister may from time to time require.
 Delegation by the Board
 12.	The Board may by an instrument under its seal delegate all or any of its powers under the Deed to any person, including the Commissioner for Superannuation or a Trustee, other than its powers under Part&#160;9 of the Rules and this power of delegation.

 Increases in pensions and certain unfunded preserved benefits
 56.	(1)	Subject to this Part, if the all groups consumer price index number for the weighted average of the 8 capital cities published by the Statistician in respect of the March quarter of the year immediately preceding a prescribed year exceeds the highest all groups consumer price index number for the weighted average of the 8 capital cities published by the Statistician in respect of the March quarter of any earlier year, not being a year earlier than the year that commenced on 1&#160;July 1989, then:
 	(a)	a person (in this section called the "pensioner") who was in receipt of a pension immediately before the commencement of that prescribed year is entitled to an increase in the rate at which the pension was payable immediately before the commencement of that prescribed year; and

 (2)	The increase provided for by subrule (1) in the rate at which a pension was payable to a person, or in the amount of the unfunded preserved benefit in relation to a person, immediately before the commencement of a prescribed year (in this rule called the "relevant prescribed year"), is the percentage of that rate or amount that represents A - B expressed as a percentage of B, where:

 Application of increase to suspended pension
 57.	Where a pension would, but for its suspension under rule 25, be payable to a person immediately before the commencement of a prescribed year, that pension is, for the purposes of this Part, taken to have been payable to that person immediately before the commencement of that prescribed year but any increase in the rate of that pension by virtue of this Part does not take effect until the day on which the pension again becomes payable. 
 Proportionate increase for part of a year
 58.	(1)	This rule applies to a pension where:
 	(a)	the person to whom the pension is payable would, but for this rule, be entitled to an increase, in accordance with rule 56, in the rate at which the pension was payable to him or her immediately before the commencement of the prescribed year; and

 	(i)	a retirement pensioner and the pension became payable to him or her during the preceding year; or

 	(iii)	the spouse of, or eligible child in relation to, a deceased person who was a retirement pensioner immediately before his or her death and the deceased person's pension became payable to the deceased person during the preceding year.
 (2)	If:
 	(a)	the pension; or
 	(b)	where subparagraph&#160;(1) (b) (iii) applies&#151;the pension that was payable to the deceased person in relation to whom the person was a spouse or eligible child;
 became payable after 16&#160;June in the preceding year, the person is not entitled to the increase.
 (3)	If:
 	(a)	the pension; or
 	(b)	where subparagraph&#160;(1) (b) (iii) applies&#151;the pension that was payable to the deceased person in relation to whom the person was a spouse or eligible child;
 became payable on or before 16&#160;June in the preceding year, the amount of the increase is an amount calculated in accordance with the formula:

<center><sub> ![A graphic exists here.](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004C00068/Html/921D67726F15FEF7CA256F71004CD21D/$FILE/1205.gif)</sub></center>

where:
 "Full increase" means the amount of the increase that would have been applicable but for this subrule.
 "Number of months in period" means the number of months in the period that began on the day on which the pension referred to in paragraph&#160;(a) or (b) became payable and ended on 30&#160;June in the preceding year.
 (4)	If the period referred to in subrule (3) is less than 1 month, that period is treated as 1 month.
 (5)	If the period referred to in subrule (3) consists of a number of whole months and a part of a month:
 	(a)	where the number of days in that part of that month is less than one-half of the number of days in that month&#151;that part is disregarded; and
 	(b)	where the number of days in that part of that month is more than one-half of the number of days in that month&#151;that part is treated as a whole month.
 (6)	Where a preserved benefit:
 	(a)	became applicable to a person; or
 	(b)	became payable or was converted into a pension;
 during the most recent prescribed year, that part of the preserved benefit that is an unfunded employer benefit is increased to the extent determined by the Board, consistent with the principle of subrule 56 (2).
 (7)	In this rule:
 "preceding year", in relation to a pension to which this rule applies, means the year immediately preceding the prescribed year. 
 Adjustment in connection with invalidity reclassification
 59.	(1)	Where:
 	(a)	a person to whom an invalidity pension is payable is reclassified from Class A to Class B or vice versa under rule 23 during a prescribed year; and
 	(b)	the person became entitled at the beginning of that year to an increase under this Part in the rate at which that invalidity pension was payable to him or her immediately before the beginning of that year;
 the rate at which the pension is payable to him or her on and after the date from which the reclassification has effect is the rate at which the pension would have been payable to him or her at the beginning of the year if his or her classification, on and after the date on which he or she became entitled to the pension, had been in accordance with the reclassification.
 (2)	Where:
 	(a)	a person to whom an invalidity pension was payable ceased to be entitled to an invalidity pension because of his or her reclassification under rule 23; and
 	(b)	in consequence of a further reclassification under that rule during a prescribed year he or she again becomes entitled to an invalidity pension;
 the rate at which the pension is payable to him or her on and after the date from which the latter reclassification has effect is the rate at which the pension would have been payable to him or her if:
 	(c)	he or she had not ceased to be entitled to an invalidity pension in consequence of the first mentioned reclassification; and
 	(d)	his or her classification, on and after the date on which he or she first became entitled to an invalidity pension, had been in accordance with the further reclassification.
 (3)	Where:
 	(a)	a person to whom an invalidity pension was payable ceased to be entitled to an invalidity pension because of his or her reclassification under rule 23; and
 	(b)	in consequence of a further reclassification under that rule after his or 
<center>Back to Top</center>
 her death he or she would, had he or she not died, have again become entitled to an invalidity pension;
 then, for the purpose of calculating benefits for any surviving spouse or eligible child of the invalidity pensioner, the invalidity pensioner is to be taken to have been, immediately before his or her death, in receipt of an invalidity pension at the rate at which that pension would have been payable to him or her if:
 	(c)	he or she had not ceased to be entitled to invalidity pension in consequence of the first-mentioned reclassification; and
 	(d)	his or her classification, on and after the date on which he or she first became entitled to an invalidity pension, had been in accordance with the further reclassification.
 (4)	Upon a preserved benefit becoming applicable to a person under subrule 29 (1), the unfunded employer benefit included in that preserved benefit is increased as if:
 	(a)	that preserved benefit had become applicable to the person on the person's retirement; and
 	(b)	this Part had applied, since that retirement, to the unfunded employer benefit included in the preserved benefit. 
 Date of effect of increase

 (2)	An increase by virtue of this Part in the amount of an unfunded preserved benefit applies with effect from:
 	(a)	in the case of an increase under subrule 58 (6)&#151;the date on which the preserved benefit became payable; or
 	(b)	in any other case&#151;1&#160;July of the prescribed year.

(1)	Subject to subrule (2), if at any time, whether before or after the commencement of these Rules, the Statistician has published or publishes in respect of a particular March quarter an all groups consumer price index number for the weighted average of the 8 capital cities in substitution for an index number previously published by him or her in respect of that quarter, the publication of the later index number is disregarded for the purposes of this Part.
 (2)	If at any time, whether before or after the commencement of these Rules, the Statistician has changed or changes the reference base for the Consumer Price Index, then, for the purposes of the application of this Part after the change took place or takes place, regard is to be had only to index numbers published in terms of the new reference base.
 (3)	If the percentage for the purposes of rule 56 is or includes a fraction of one tenth of 1 per centum:
 	(a)	where that fraction is less than one half of one tenth&#151;that fraction is disregarded; and
 	(b)	where that fraction is not less than one half of one tenth&#151;that fraction is treated as one tenth.

_Defence Legislation Amendment (Enhancement of the Reserves and Modernisation) Act 2001_ (No.&#160;10, 2001)

**Schedule&#160;2**

**94  Saving&#151;old regulations**

(1)	Regulations that were in effect under any Act immediately before the commencement of this item continue to have effect after that time as if members of an arm of the Defence Force who were members of a particular part or component of that arm immediately before the commencement of this item were still members of that part or component after that time, even if that part or component no longer exists.

Example:	Assume that, immediately before the commencement of this item, regulations imposed training obligations on members of the Air Force Specialist Reserve. Those obligations would continue to apply to former members of that Reserve after commencement, even though the Air Force Specialist Reserve itself is no longer mentioned in the _Air Force Act 1923_ and the members have now become members of the Air Force Reserve.

(2)	However, regulations that continue in effect under this item do so only to the extent that they are not amended or revoked by later regulations.

**95  Regulations about transitional matters**

(1)	The regulations may make provision in relation to other saving and transitional matters in connection with the amendments made by this Schedule.
 (2)	In particular, such regulations may deal with the status, after the commencement of the amendments, of persons who were members of the Defence Force immediately before that time.
 (3)	Subitem&#160;(2) does not limit the scope of subitem&#160;(1).
