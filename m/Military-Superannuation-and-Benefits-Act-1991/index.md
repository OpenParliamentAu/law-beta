Part 5—Payment of benefits
  
11  Interpretation
		In this Part, a reference, in relation to a person who has ceased to be a member, to a member benefit, or to the part of a member benefit, that is totally funded is a reference to a member benefit, or to that part of a member benefit that consists only of:
	(a)	contributions that have been paid by the person to the Board on or after the day on which the person became, or last became, a member; and
	(b)	the interest on those contributions.
12  Member benefits
		Where a member benefit becomes payable under the Rules to a person who has ceased to be a member:
	(a)	if the member benefit is totally funded—the member benefit is payable to the person by the Board; or
	(b)	if paragraph (a) does not apply:
	(i)	an amount equal to the part of the member benefit that is totally funded is payable by the Board to the Commonwealth; and
	(ii)	the member benefit is payable to the person by the Commonwealth.
13  Employer benefits
		Where an employer benefit becomes payable under the Rules to a person who has ceased to be a member:
	(a)	an amount equal to the funded employer benefit in relation to the person is payable by the Board to the Commonwealth; and

	(a)	a preserved benefit, or part of a preserved benefit, applicable to a person who has ceased to be a member becomes payable; and
	(b)	the preserved benefit, or the part of the preserved benefit, consists only of an amount of member benefit;
then:
	(c)	if the preserved benefit consists only of an amount of member benefit that is totally funded—the preserved benefit, or the part of the preserved benefit, is payable to, or in respect of, the person by the Board; or
	(d)	if paragraph (c) does not apply:
	(i)	an amount equal to:
	(A)	if the total amount of preserved benefit is payable—the part of the member benefit that is totally funded; or
	(B)	if a part of a preserved benefit is payable—a corresponding part of the part of the member benefit that is totally funded;
		is payable by the Board to the Commonwealth; and
	(ii)	the preserved benefit, or the part of the preserved benefit, is payable to, or in respect of, the person by the Commonwealth.
	(2)	Where:
	(a)	a preserved benefit applicable to a person who has ceased to be a member becomes payable; and
	(b)	the preserved benefit includes both an amount of member benefit and an amount of employer benefit;
then:
	(c)	an amount equal to the sum of:
	(i)	the part of the member benefit included in the preserved benefit that is totally funded; and
	(ii)	so much of the funded employer benefit in relation to the person as is included in the preserved benefit;
		is payable by the Board to the Commonwealth; and
	(d)	the preserved benefit is payable to, or in respect of, the person by the Commonwealth.
15  Payment by or to the Commonwealth on reclassification of invalidity pensioner
	(1)	Where a person who is an invalidity pensioner classified as Class A or Class B is reclassified as Class C, the Commonwealth must pay to the Board an amount equal to the amount of the funded employer benefit in relation to the person at the time when the person was retired on the ground of invalidity.
	(2)	Where:
	(a)	a person who was an invalidity pensioner classified as Class A or Class B was reclassified as Class C; and
	(b)	the person is subsequently reclassified as Class A or Class B;
the Board must pay to the Commonwealth an amount equal to the funded employer benefit in relation to the person.
16  Payment by Commonwealth where an invalidity pensioner again becomes a member
		Where a person who is an invalidity pensioner again becomes a member, the Commonwealth must pay to the Board an amount equal to the amount of the funded employer benefit in relation to the person at the time when the person was retired on the ground of invalidity.
17  Appropriation
		Any payment by the Commonwealth under this Part is to be made out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which is appropriated accordingly.

(2)	The Minister may appoint a person to act as a Trustee:
(a)	during a vacancy in the office of a Trustee; or
(b)	during any period, or during all periods, when a Trustee is acting as Chairperson, is absent from Australia or is, for any reason, unable to perform the duties of that office.
(3)	The Minister shall only appoint a person to act as a Trustee who meets the same criteria, as set out in subclauses 4 (1) (a) or (b), as the Trustee in whose place the Trustee is to act.
(4)	An appointment under subclause (1) or (2) may be expressed to have effect only in such circumstances as are specified in the instrument of appointment.
(5)	While a person is acting as Chairperson or as a Trustee, the person has and may exercise all the powers, and shall perform all the duties, of the Chairperson or the Trustee as the case may be.

(b)	terminate such an appointment at any time.
(7)	A person appointed to act in an office under subclause (1) or (2) may resign the appointment by writing signed by the person and delivered to the Minister.
Disclosure of Interests
7.	(1)	Each Trustee shall:
(a)	as soon as possible after, but in any case not later than 60 days after, appointment as a Trustee; and
(b)	as soon as possible after, but in any case not later than 60 days after, each anniversary of the Trustee’s appointment as a Trustee,
present to a meeting of the Board a statement in writing setting out particulars of those interests, whether pecuniary or otherwise and whether direct or indirect, of the Trustee as at the day of appointment or as at that anniversary, as the case requires, that could reasonably be expected to conflict with the proper performance by the Trustee of the Trustee’s duties as a Trustee.
(2)	A statement presented by a Trustee to a meeting of the Board in pursuance of subclause (1) shall be incorporated into the minutes of the meeting.
(3)	Where a Trustee acquires an interest, whether pecuniary or otherwise and whether direct or indirect, that could reasonably be expected to conflict with the proper performance by the Trustee of the Trustee’s duties as a Trustee and a statement containing particulars of the interest has not been given to a meeting of the Board in accordance with subclause (1), the Trustee shall, as soon as possible after acquiring that interest, present to a meeting of the Board a statement in writing setting out particulars of the interest and the statement shall be incorporated in the minutes of the meeting.

(b)	take part in the making by the Board of the determination.
(7)	Where a Trustee is obliged by subclause (4) to disclose the nature of an interest at a meeting of the Board, the fact that the Trustee has presented to a meeting of the Board a statement under subclause (1) or (3) that includes particulars of that interest does not relieve the Trustee of the Trustee’s obligation under subclause (4).

8.	(1)	The Board shall hold such meetings as are necessary for the conduct of its affairs.
(2)	The Chairperson may at any time convene a meeting of the Board and shall, when so requested in writing by another Trustee, convene a meeting of the Board within 30 days of receiving such notice.

Part 2—Contributions
  
Contributions by members
3.	(1)	A member is required to pay a contribution each fortnight in accordance with this Division.
(2)	Where contributions by a member fall due during a period when he or she is on leave without pay, the member, or a person acting on his or her behalf, is to pay those contributions:
	(a)	each fortnight; or
	(b)	in such instalments and at such times as the Board approves; or
	(c)	with the approval of the Board, in a lump sum.
Amount of contributions
4.	(1)	Subject to subrule (2), the amount of the contribution payable by a member in a fortnight is an amount equal to the relevant percentage of the amount of the salary paid to the member in that fortnight.
(2)	Where a member elects under subrule (10) to vary the amount of the contribution payable by him or her, that election has effect in relation to the first salary fortnight in relation to which it can be applied in the ordinary course of business.
(3)	Where a member makes an election under subrule (10), the member is not entitled to make a further election until the expiration of a period of three months after the day on which the earlier election was made.
(4)	For the purposes of subrule (1), salary is taken not to be paid to a member in respect of a day included in a period that, in accordance with Schedule 2, is a prescribed period.
(5)	Where:
	(a)	the salary and allowances of a member in respect of a period are forfeited, in whole or in part, under regulations made under the Defence Act 1903; and
	(b)	the period does not exceed 21 consecutive days;
the amounts of the contributions payable by the member in respect of that period are to be calculated as if the member were on full pay.
(6)	Subject to subrule (7), where a member who is granted:
	(a)	long service leave on half pay; or
	(b)	leave without pay for a period not exceeding 21 days;
the amounts of the contributions payable by the member in respect of that period are to be calculated as if the member were on full pay.
(7)	In a case to which paragraph (6) (b) applies, the member’s salary for the purpose of calculating the contribution payable by the member is taken not to include higher duties allowance unless:
	(a)	higher duties allowance was payable to the member on the day immediately preceding the commencement of the period; and
	(b)	an appropriate authority of the Defence Force has notified the Board that, but for the member’s absence on leave without pay, higher duties allowance would have been payable to the member in respect of the whole of the period of his or her absence on that leave.
(8)	In calculating the amount of a contribution payable by a member, the calculation is to be made as if no deductions were made from the member’s salary.
(9)	Where the amount of a contribution payable by a member includes a fraction of a cent:
	(a)	if the fraction is less than one‑half of a cent—the contribution is taken to be reduced by the amount of the fraction; or
	(b)	if the fraction is one‑half of a cent or more—the contribution is taken to be increased by treating the fraction as one cent.
(10)	In this rule:
“relevant percentage”, in relation to a member, means:
	(a)	the percentage, being a whole number that is not less than 5 and not more than 10, elected by the member; or
	(b)	if the member has not made an election—5 per centum.
Cessation of contributions on reaching maximum benefit limit
5.	(1)	A member is not entitled to pay contributions after he or she has been notified that his or her total benefit equals or exceeds his or her pension maximum benefit limit.
(2)	At any time after a member is notified that his or her total benefit equals or exceeds his or her lump sum maximum benefit limit, he or she may elect to cease paying contributions.
(3)	This rule applies in spite of anything in this Part.
Contributions while on leave without pay in connection with birth of child etc.
6.	A member who is on leave without pay for a period exceeding 21 days which was granted to him or her in connection with:
	(a)	the birth of a child of the member; or
	(b)	other termination of the pregnancy of the member; or
	(c)	the adoption of a child by the member;
may elect to pay contributions, calculated as if the member were on full pay, in respect of so much of that period, not exceeding 9 months, as is specified in the election.
Contributions while on other leave without pay
7.	(1)	This rule does not apply to a period of leave without pay to which rule 6 applies.
(2)	Where a member who is on leave without pay for a period exceeding 21 days which was granted to him or her:
	(a)	for the purpose of the member:
	(i)	engaging, with the approval of the appropriate authority of the Defence Force, in full time employment; or
	(ii)	undertaking further education; or
	(iii)	undergoing training; or
	(iv)	engaging in some other activity;
and, in the case of subparagraph (ii), (iii) or (iv), an appropriate authority of the Defence Force has notified the Board that the education, training or other activity is relevant to the requirements of the Defence Force; or
	(b)	because the member was for the time being physically or mentally incapable of performing his or her duties;
the member may, with the approval of the Board, elect to pay contributions, calculated as if the member were on full pay, in respect of so much of the period as is specified in the election.
(3)	Where:
	(a)	leave without pay is granted to a member (in this subrule called the “inactive member”) whose spouse (in this subrule called the “active member”):
	(i)	is also a member; or
	(ii)	is an eligible member of the Defence Force within the meaning of the 1973 Act; and
	(b)	the active member is posted to a locality to which the inactive member is unable to obtain a posting; and
	(c)	the inactive member is granted the leave without pay in order not to be separated from the active member;
the inactive member may elect to pay contributions, calculated as if the member were on full pay, in respect of so much of that period, not exceeding 2 years, as is specified in the election.
(4)	In this rule:
“spouse”, in relation to a member, means a person who is legally married to the member and includes a person who, although not legally married to the member, ordinarily lives with the member as his or her husband or wife, as the case may be, on a permanent and bona fide domestic basis and is not of the same sex as the member.
General conditions applicable to contributions under rules 6 and 7
8.	(1)	The provisions of rule 4 apply to an election made under rule 6 or 7 as if:
	(a)	the reference in that rule to the amount of salary paid to the member in a fortnight were a reference to the amount of salary that would have been paid to the member in that fortnight if the member had been on full pay; and
	(b)	the salary so assumed to be paid did not include higher duties allowance unless:
	(a)	higher duties allowance was payable to the member on the day immediately before the commencement of the period; and
	(b)	an appropriate authority of the Defence Force has notified the Board that, but for the member’s absence on leave without pay, higher duties allowance would have been payable to the member in respect of the whole of the period of his or her absence on that leave.
(2)	A member who has made an election under rule 6 or 7 may revoke the election at any time after the expiration of a period of 3 months after the election was made.

Liability of Department to pay employer contributions
10.	(1)	The Department must, on each salary pay‑day on which a member pays contributions, pay to the Board an employer contribution in relation to the member.
(2)	In spite of a member paying contributions during a period of leave without pay to which rule 7 applies, subrule (1) does not apply:
	(a)	in the case of a period of leave without pay referred to in subrule 7 (2) which exceeds 12 months—to any part of the excess period in respect of which no amount is paid under a prescribed arrangement; or
	(b)	in the case of a period of leave without pay referred to in subrule 7 (3).
(3)	The amount of an employer contribution payable by the Department in relation to a member is an amount that is 3 per centum of the amount of the salary payable to the member in respect of the relevant fortnight.
(4)	In this rule:
“member’s employer”, in relation to a member who is engaged in employment referred to in subparagraph 7 (2) (a) (i), means the person who is the employer of the member in respect of that employment.
“prescribed arrangement”, in relation to a member who is engaged in employment referred to in subparagraph 7 (2) (a) (i), means an arrangement between the Commonwealth and the member’s employer under which the employer agrees to pay to the Commonwealth an employer contribution, in relation to the member:
	(a)	in respect of each salary fortnight in the period of that employment; or
	(b)	in respect of each salary fortnight in a specified part of that period;
as the case may be, in respect of which the member pays a contribution under this Part.

Reclassification in respect of incapacity
23.

	(b)	the Board or the Committee is satisfied that special circumstances exist that justify an earlier date being so specified.
(6)	Where a person who was retired otherwise than on the ground of invalidity is, by virtue of rule 30, treated as if he or she had been retired on the ground of invalidity, the Board or the Committee may, despite subrule (5), on the same day on which it classifies him or her under rule 22, reclassify him or her under this rule with effect from a date after the date of his or her retirement but before the date on which the Board or the Committee makes the reclassification.
(7)	The death of a person after he or she has been classified under rule 22 or reclassified under this rule does not prevent the reclassifying of the person under subrule (1).

Division 1—Increases in Maximum Benefit Limits
Increases in maximum benefit limits
55.	(1)	This rule is to have effect, on 1 July 1991 and each subsequent 1 July, as if there were substituted for:
	(a)	each amount referred to in the definition of “lump sum maximum benefit multiple” in Schedule 3; and
	(b)	each amount referred to in the definition of “pension maximum benefit multiple” in Schedule 3;
or for the amount last substituted for that amount under this rule (in this rule called the “base amount”) a new amount calculated by:
	(c)	multiplying the base amount by the index number for the March quarter immediately preceding that 1 July; and
	(d)	dividing the product by the index number for the previous March quarter.
(2)	Subject to subrule (3), if at any time, whether before or after the commencement of these Rules, the Statistician publishes an index number in respect of a particular March quarter in substitution for an index number previously published, that later index number is disregarded for the purposes of this rule.
(3)	If at any time the Statistician changes the reference base for the index numbers, regard is to be had, for the purposes of the operation of this rule after the change took place, only to index numbers published in terms of the new reference base.
(4)	Where an amount to be substituted under this rule is not a multiple of $10, it is increased to the nearest multiple of $10.
(5)	In this rule:

Increases in pensions and certain unfunded preserved benefits
56.	(1)	Subject to this Part, if the all groups consumer price index number for the weighted average of the 8 capital cities published by the Statistician in respect of the March quarter of the year immediately preceding a prescribed year exceeds the highest all groups consumer price index number for the weighted average of the 8 capital cities published by the Statistician in respect of the March quarter of any earlier year, not being a year earlier than the year that commenced on 1 July 1989, then:
	(a)	a person (in this section called the “pensioner”) who was in receipt of a pension immediately before the commencement of that prescribed year is entitled to an increase in the rate at which the pension was payable immediately before the commencement of that prescribed year; and
	(b)	where, immediately before the commencement of that prescribed year, a preserved benefit is applicable to a person, or has become payable in respect of a deceased person but has not been paid, the amount of the unfunded employer benefit included in the preserved benefit in relation to that person immediately before the commencement of that year is increased.
(2)	The increase provided for by subrule (1) in the rate at which a pension was payable to a person, or in the amount of the unfunded preserved benefit in relation to a person, immediately before the commencement of a prescribed year (in this rule called the “relevant prescribed year”), is the percentage of that rate or amount that represents A – B expressed as a percentage of B, where:
A is the all groups consumer price index number for the weighted average of the 8 capital cities published by the Statistician in respect of the March quarter of the year immediately preceding the prescribed year; and
B is the highest all groups consumer price index number for the weighted average of the 8 capital cities published by the Statistician in respect of the March quarter of any year earlier than the year that commenced on 1 July 1990.
(3)	Where, by reason of the death on 30 June in the year immediately preceding a prescribed year of a person in receipt of a pension, a pension becomes payable on the following day to another person, that other person is entitled to such an increase in the rate of that pension as he or she would have been entitled to had the pension become payable to him or her on that 30 June.
Application of increase to suspended pension
57.	Where a pension would, but for its suspension under rule 25, be payable to a person immediately before the commencement of a prescribed year, that pension is, for the purposes of this Part, taken to have been payable to that person immediately before the commencement of that prescribed year but any increase in the rate of that pension by virtue of this Part does not take effect until the day on which the pension again becomes payable.
Proportionate increase for part of a year
58.	(1)	This rule applies to a pension where:
	(a)	the person to whom the pension is payable would, but for this rule, be entitled to an increase, in accordance with rule 56, in the rate at which the pension was payable to him or her immediately before the commencement of the prescribed year; and
	(b)	the person is:
	(i)	a retirement pensioner and the pension became payable to him or her during the preceding year; or
	(ii)	the spouse of, or eligible child in relation to, a deceased person who was a member immediately before his or her death and the pension became payable to the spouse or child, as the case may be, during the preceding year; or
	(iii)	the spouse of, or eligible child in relation to, a deceased person who was a retirement pensioner immediately before his or her death and the deceased person’s pension became payable to the deceased person during the preceding year.

	(a)	the pension; or
	(b)	where subparagraph (1) (b) (iii) applies—the pension that was payable to the deceased person in relation to whom the person was a spouse or eligible child;
became payable after 16 June in the preceding year, the person is not entitled to the increase.
(3)	If:
	(a)	the pension; or
	(b)	where subparagraph (1) (b) (iii) applies—the pension that was payable to the deceased person in relation to whom the person was a spouse or eligible child;
became payable on or before 16 June in the preceding year, the amount of the increase is an amount calculated in accordance with the formula:

where:
“Full increase” means the amount of the increase that would have been applicable but for this subrule.
“Number of months in period” means the number of months in the period that began on the day on which the pension referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) became payable and ended on 30 June in the preceding year.
(4)	If the period referred to in subrule (3) is less than 1 month, that period is treated as 1 month.
(5)	If the period referred to in subrule (3) consists of a number of whole months and a part of a month:
	(a)	where the number of days in that part of that month is less than one‑half of the number of days in that month—that part is disregarded; and
	(b)	where the number of days in that part of that month is more than one‑half of the number of days in that month—that part is treated as a whole month.
(6)	Where a preserved benefit:
	(a)	became applicable to a person; or
	(b)	became payable or was converted into a pension;
during the most recent prescribed year, that part of the preserved benefit that is an unfunded employer benefit is increased to the extent determined by the Board, consistent with the principle of subrule 56 (2).
(7)	In this rule:
“preceding year”, in relation to a pension to which this rule applies, means the year immediately preceding the prescribed year.
Adjustment in connection with invalidity reclassification
59.	(1)	Where:
	(a)	a person to whom an invalidity pension is payable is reclassified from Class A to Class B or vice versa under rule 23 during a prescribed year; and
	(b)	the person became entitled at the beginning of that year to an increase under this Part in the rate at which that invalidity pension was payable to him or her immediately before the beginning of that year;
the rate at which the pension is payable to him or her on and after the date from which the reclassification has effect is the rate at which the pension would have been payable to him or her at the beginning of the year if his or her classification, on and after the date on which he or she became entitled to the pension, had been in accordance with the reclassification.
(2)	Where:
	(a)	a person to whom an invalidity pension was payable ceased to be entitled to an invalidity pension because of his or her reclassification under rule 23; and
	(b)	in consequence of a further reclassification under that rule during a prescribed year he or she again becomes entitled to an invalidity pension;
the rate at which the pension is payable to him or her on and after the date from which the latter reclassification has effect is the rate at which the pension would have been payable to him or her if:
	(c)	he or she had not ceased to be entitled to an invalidity pension in consequence of the first mentioned reclassification; and
	(d)	his or her classification, on and after the date on which he or she first became entitled to an invalidity pension, had been in accordance with the further reclassification.
(3)	Where:
	(a)	a person to whom an invalidity pension was payable ceased to be entitled to an invalidity pension because of his or her reclassification under rule 23; and
	(b)	in consequence of a further reclassification under that rule after his or her death he or she would, had he or she not died, have again become entitled to an invalidity pension;
then, for the purpose of calculating benefits for any surviving spouse or eligible child of the invalidity pensioner, the invalidity pensioner is to be taken to have been, immediately before his or her death, in receipt of an invalidity pension at the rate at which that pension would have been payable to him or her if:
	(c)	he or she had not ceased to be entitled to invalidity pension in consequence of the first‑mentioned reclassification; and
	(d)	his or her classification, on and after the date on which he or she first became entitled to an invalidity pension, had been in accordance with the further reclassification.
(4)	Upon a preserved benefit becoming applicable to a person under subrule 29 (1), the unfunded employer benefit included in that preserved benefit is increased as if:
	(a)	that preserved benefit had become applicable to the person on the person’s retirement; and
	(b)	this Part had applied, since that retirement, to the unfunded employer benefit included in the preserved benefit.
Date of effect of increase
60.	(1)	An increase by virtue of this Part in the rate of a pension that:
	(a)	was payable; or
	(b)	under subrule 56 (3) is treated as having been payable;
to a person on 30 June in a year applies in relation to the instalment of pension falling due on the first pension pay‑day occurring after that day and in relation to all subsequent instalments.
(2)	An increase by virtue of this Part in the amount of an unfunded preserved benefit applies with effect from:
	(a)	in the case of an increase under subrule 58 (6)—the date on which the preserved benefit became payable; or
	(b)	in any other case—1 July of the prescribed year.
Interpretation
61.	(1)	Subject to subrule (2), if at any time, whether before or after the commencement of these Rules, the Statistician has published or publishes in respect of a particular March quarter an all groups consumer price index number for the weighted average of the 8 capital cities in substitution for an index number previously published by him or her in respect of that quarter, the publication of the later index number is disregarded for the purposes of this Part.
(2)	If at any time, whether before or after the commencement of these Rules, the Statistician has changed or changes the reference base for the Consumer Price Index, then, for the purposes of the application of this Part after the change took place or takes place, regard is to be had only to index numbers published in terms of the new reference base.
(3)	If the percentage for the purposes of rule 56 is or includes a fraction of one tenth of 1 per centum:
	(a)	where that fraction is less than one half of one tenth—that fraction is disregarded; and
	(b)	where that fraction is not less than one half of one tenth—that fraction is treated as one tenth.

	(b)	an amount, purporting to be an instalment of primary pension payable to the pensioner in respect of a period in respect of which spouse’s pension is payable in accordance with that subrule, is paid into an account with a bank, credit union or building society (in this rule called the “financial institution”); and
	(c)	the financial institution pays, out of that account, to the spouse of the deceased pensioner an amount not exceeding the amount so paid into the account;

(3)	A pension is not to be increased under subrule (2) if the Board is of the opinion that the amount of the increase would not be significant.

attributable to an eligible child or eligible children, or any portion of that part, should, by reason of the child or children not being in the custody, care and control of the spouse, or for any other reason which the Board thinks proper, be paid to a person other than the spouse, the Board may authorise payment of that part, or a portion of the part, to the other person and if the Board does so payment is to be made to the other person accordingly.
(2)	For the purposes of subrule (1), the part of a spouse’s lump sum payment attributable to that eligible child or those eligible children is taken to be the amount obtained by multiplying the spouse’s lump sum payment by the percentage applicable in respect of an eligible child or children under rule 43 in relation to a pension.
(3)	Where, in the opinion of the Board:
	(a)	an instalment, or part of an instalment, of a pension; or
	(b)	an amount of any other benefit;
should:
	(c)	by reason of the person who, but for this rule, would be entitled to the payment being a child, or being a person who is of unsound mind or undergoing imprisonment or otherwise being under a disability; or
	(d)	for any other reason which the Board thinks proper;
be paid to a person other than the person who would be so entitled to the payment, the Board may authorise payment to the other person and if the Board does so payment is to be made to the other person accordingly.
(4)	It is the intention of this rule that:
	(a)	the part, or a portion of the part, of an instalment of spouse’s pension attributable to an eligible child that, by virtue of subrule (1), is paid to a person other than the child to which that part or portion is attributable; or
	(b)	an instalment of pension payable to a child that, by virtue of subrule (3), is paid to a person other than the child;
be applied for the maintenance, education or other benefit of the child.
Withholding payment of benefit where required information not provided
71.	The Board may withhold payment of the whole, or a part, of a benefit in relation to a person where that person does not provide, or arrange to be provided, to the Board information required by the Board in connection with the determination of the person’s entitlement to benefits under these Rules or the determination of the amount of those benefits.

Schedule 5—Calculation of rate of pension by conversion of employer benefit
  
Rule 65
1.	For the purpose of converting an employer benefit into a pension, the annual rate of that pension is calculated by dividing the amount of the benefit that is to be so converted by:
	(a)	if the person’s age, in years, on the day on which he or she becomes entitled to the benefit is 65 years—a factor of 10; or
	(b)	in any other case where the person’s age is an exact number of years—a factor of 10 increased by 0.2 in respect of each year by which the person’s age, in years, on the day on which he or she becomes entitled to the benefit is less than 65 years; or
	(c)	in any case where the person’s age is not an exact number of years—the factor that would be applicable if paragraph (b) applied to the person’s age in years, reduced by a number in respect of the number of days in the person’s age in excess of the person’s age in years (in this paragraph called “excess days”), being a number which bears to 0.2 the same proportion as the number of excess days bears to the number of days in a year.
2.	In the application of paragraph 1 in relation to a person who is entitled to invalidity benefits and is classified as Class A, the references in that paragraph to the person’s age on the day on which he or she becomes entitled to a benefit are read as references to:
	(a)	his or her retiring age immediately before his or her retirement; or
	(b)	the age of 55 years;
whichever is the greater.
Schedule 6—Calculation of eligible service
  
Schedule 1 (Definition of “eligible service”)
1.	The eligible service of a member is the sum of:
	(a)	subject to paragraph 2, service by the person as a member; and
	(b)	in the case of a person entitled to an invalidity pension who is classified as Class A—a period equal to the period commencing on the day immediately following the last day of the person’s service and concluding on the day on which the person would have retired if he or she had not been retired on the ground of invalidity but had served until attaining:
	(i)	the age that was the age for the compulsory retirement of the member immediately before his or her retirement; or
	(ii)	the age of 55 years;
		whichever is the greater; and
	(c)	in the case of a transferred person—a period specified in the following table in relation to that person:

Person
Period included
1.	A person who, immediately before he or she transferred from the 1973 Scheme, was rendering continuous full‑time service and who, before he or she began to render that service, was not a 1973 Scheme retirement pensioner.
Any period that, before the transfer of the person, was a period of effective service in relation to the person for the purposes of the 1973 Act.
2.	A person who, immediately before he or she transferred from the 1973 Scheme, was rendering continuous full‑time service and who, immediately before he or she began to render that service, was a 1973 Scheme retirement pensioner

2.	Service referred to in subparagraph 1 (a) does not include service during a period:
	(a)	prescribed in Schedule 2 in respect of which, under subrule 4 (4), salary is taken not to be paid to the member; or

	(d)	(except in the case of a person entitled to an invalidity benefit) that occurred after the member’s total benefit reached his or her pension maximum benefit limit; or
	(e)	in respect of which the person accrued an employer benefit:
	(i)	which was paid to a preservation fund, or used to purchase a deferred annuity, in pursuance of subrule 15 (2) or paid to the person as a lump sum in pursuance of subrule 15 (3); or
	(ii)	which was otherwise paid to the person as a lump sum, converted into a pension or became applicable to the person as a preserved benefit.
Schedule 7—Calculation of final average salary
  
Schedule 1 (Definition of “final average salary”)
1.	The final average salary in relation to a person who is or was a member is an amount equal to:
	(a)	in the case of a person with less than 3 years’ eligible service—an amount calculated in accordance with the formula:

where:
“Salary”, in relation to the person, means the amount of salary received by the person during his or her service; and
“Number of days of eligible service”, in relation to the person, means the number of days of eligible service of the person; or
	(b)	in any other case—one‑third of the amount of salary payable to the person in his or her last 3 years of eligible service.
2.	In paragraph 1, any reference to eligible service includes, in the case of a person whose total benefit reached his or her lump sum maximum benefit limit, any period in respect of which the person, in pursuance of rule 5 and by reason only of that rule, did not pay contributions to the Fund.
3.	For the purpose of ascertaining the amount of salary payable to a member in his or her last 3 years of service in a case where that service included a period in respect of which the member:
	(a)	was in receipt of half‑pay; or
	(b)	was not entitled to be paid salary; or
	(c)	forfeited his or her salary;
the member is taken to have been in receipt of salary in respect of that period at the fortnightly rate that was applicable to the member immediately before that period.
