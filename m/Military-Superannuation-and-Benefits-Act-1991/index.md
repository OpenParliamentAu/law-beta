                    <a name="superannu-interest"></a>**_superannuation interest_** has the same meaning as in Part VIIIB of the _Family Law Act 1975_.

## Part 3—Members of Superannuation Scheme

## Part 5—Payment of benefits

##### <a id="11"></a>11  Interpretation

                   In this Part, a reference, in relation to a person who has ceased to be a member, to a member benefit, or to the part of a member benefit, that is totally funded is a reference to a member benefit, or to that part of a member benefit that consists only of:

                     (a)  contributions that have been paid by the person to CSC on or after the day on which the person became, or last became, a member; and

                     (b)  the interest on those contributions.

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Member benefits

                   Where a member benefit becomes payable under the Rules to a person who has ceased to be a member:

                     (b)  any benefit to which the person is entitled is payable to the person by the Commonwealth.

##### <a id="14"></a>14  Preserved benefits

             (1)  Where:

                     (a)  a preserved benefit, or part of a preserved benefit, applicable to a person who has ceased to be a member becomes payable; and

                     (b)  the preserved benefit, or the part of the preserved benefit, consists only of an amount of member benefit;

then:

                     (c)  if the preserved benefit consists only of an amount of member benefit that is totally funded—the preserved benefit, or the part of the preserved benefit, is payable to, or in respect of, the person by CSC; or

                     (d)  if paragraph (c) does not apply:

                              (i)  an amount equal to:

                                        (A)  if the total amount of preserved benefit is payable—the part of the member benefit that is totally funded; or

                                        (B)  if a part of a preserved benefit is payable—a corresponding part of the part of the member benefit that is totally funded;

then:

                     (c)  an amount equal to the sum of:

                              (i)  the part of the member benefit included in the preserved benefit that is totally funded; and

                             (ii)  so much of the funded employer benefit in relation to the person as is included in the preserved benefit;

                            is payable by CSC to the Commonwealth; and

                     (d)  the preserved benefit is payable to, or in respect of, the person by the Commonwealth.

##### <a id="15"></a>15  Payment by or to the Commonwealth on reclassification of invalidity pensioner

             (1)  Where a person who is an invalidity pensioner classified as Class A or Class B is reclassified as Class C, the Commonwealth must pay to CSC an amount equal to the amount of the funded employer benefit in relation to the person at the time when the person was retired on the ground of invalidity.

             (2)  CSC is also responsible for the general administration of this Act.

## Part 9—Miscellaneous

##### <a id="42"></a>42  Cost of administration of Act etc.

                   The costs of the administration of this Act and of the Trust Deed, excluding the costs of and incidental to the management of the Fund by CSC and the investment of its money, are to be paid out of money appropriated from time to time by Parliament for the purpose.

##### <a id="42A"></a>42A  CSC liable to pay surcharge under the _Superannuation Contributions Tax (Assessment and Collection) Act 1997_

             (1)  To remove any doubt, it is stated that:

                     (a)  for the purposes of the _Superannuation Contributions Tax (Assessment and Collection) Act 1997_, CSC in its capacity as a superannuation provider is an entity distinct from the Commonwealth; and

                     (b)  consequently, section 33 of that Act does not affect the liability of CSC under that Act to pay surcharge on the surchargeable contributions of members.

             (2)  Amounts payable by CSC under subsection 16(6) of the _Superannuation Contributions Tax (Assessment and Collection) Act 1997_ are to be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which is appropriated accordingly.

##### <a id="43"></a>43  Recovery of unpaid contributions etc.

             (1)  Any amount (including an amount of contributions) that is payable to CSC under this Act or the Rules may be recovered by CSC in a court of competent jurisdiction as a debt.

             (2)  Any contribution payable by a person to CSC under the Rules that remains unpaid when the person ceases to be a member may be deducted from any payment or payments of benefit payable under the Rules to, or in respect of, the person.

             (3)  Where for any reason (including the making of, or cancellation of, an election under the Rules), CSC had paid an amount of benefit that is, or has become, not payable:

                     (a)  the amount so paid may be recovered by CSC in a court of competent jurisdiction as a debt; or

                     (b)  where the person to whom that amount was paid is receiving, or is entitled to receive, a benefit under the Rules, the amount so paid, or such part of that amount as CSC determines, may, if CSC in its discretion so directs, be recovered by deduction from that benefit.

##### <a id="44"></a>44  Payment of fees

             (1)  Such fees as are prescribed are payable to the Commonwealth by a person who, under the Rules, requests CSC to reconsider one of its decisions.

             (2)  The regulations may make provision for and in relation to the refund of any fees paid under subsection (1).

##### <a id="45"></a>45  Assignment of benefits

                   No pension or other benefit payable under the Rules is capable of being assigned.

##### <a id="46"></a>46  Member etc. bound by Rules

             (1)  A person who is, or has ceased to be, a member is subject to the Rules to the extent that they are applicable in relation to the person.

          (1A)  A person who is, or has ceased to be, an associate is subject to the Rules to the extent that they are applicable in relation to the person. For this purpose, **_associate_** means a person to whom an associate benefit is payable.

             (2)  The Commonwealth is subject to the Rules to the extent that they are applicable in relation to the Commonwealth.

##### <a id="47"></a>47  Indemnification

             (1)  Any matter or thing done, or omitted to be done, in good faith by:

                     (d)  a member of an Incapacity Classification Committee established under the Rules; or

                     (e)  a member of a Reconsideration Advisory Committee established under the Rules;

does not subject him or her personally to any action, liability, claim or demand.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not preclude CSC from being subject to any action, liability, claim or demand.

##### <a id="48"></a>48  Bank not liable in respect of certain payments out of account of deceased pensioner

             (1)  In this section:

                    <a name="bank"></a>**_bank_** includes, but is not limited to, a body corporate that is an ADI (authorised deposit‑taking institution) for the purposes of the _Banking Act 1959_.

                    <a name="primari-pension"></a>**_primary pension_** means a pension payable to a pensioner.

             (2)  Where:

                     (a)  after the death of a retirement pensioner, an amount purporting to be an instalment of primary pension payable to the pensioner on a pension pay day not later than the 7th pension pay day after his or her death is paid into an account of the pensioner with a bank; and

                     (b)  the bank pays, out of that account, to the spouse of the deceased pensioner an amount not exceeding the amount so paid into the account;

then, in spite of any other law, the bank is not liable to the Commonwealth, the personal representative of the deceased pensioner or anyone else for any loss incurred because of the payment of that amount to the spouse of the pensioner.

##### <a id="49"></a>49  Amendments to Trust Deed disallowable under the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_

                   Despite section 44 of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_, section 42 of that Act applies to an instrument amending the Trust Deed.

##### <a id="51"></a>51  Delegation by Minister

                   The Minister may, by signed instrument, delegate all or any of his or her powers under this Act or the regulations to:

                     (a)  CSC; or

                    (aa)  a director (within the meaning of the _Governance of Australian Government Superannuation Schemes Act 2011_); or

                     (b)  an officer of the Department; or

                     (c)  the CEO of ComSuper or a member of the staff of ComSuper in the performance of the CEO’s functions in relation to this Act; or

                     (d)  an officer of the Defence Force.

                     (a)  the member benefit has been paid to the person; and

the person is liable to repay the amount of the excess.

Recovery of repayment

             (4)  If a person is liable to repay an amount under subsection (3):

                     (a)  the amount may be recovered as a debt due to the Board or the Commonwealth, as the case may be; and

_Section 4_

THIS DEED is made on                                                                       1991

In the case of an inconsistency between the provisions of the Deed and the Rules, the provisions of the Deed shall prevail.

**(2)**   In this Deed, where the context requires or admits, words and expressions defined in the Act or the Rules have the same meanings when used in the Deed. The headings in this Deed and in the Rules are for the convenience of reference only and shall not affect their interpretation.

**(3)**   In this Deed **“Minister”** means:

**Establishment of the Superannuation Scheme and the Fund**

**2.  (1)**   There is hereby established an occupational superannuation scheme to be known as the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme (in this Deed called **“the Superannuation Scheme”**) to come into force on 1 October 1991 for the benefit of:

      (i)  members of the Permanent Forces; and

**(5)**   A Trustee shall hold office on such terms and conditions as are determined by the Minister.

**(6)**   The performance of the functions, or the exercise of the powers, of CSC shall not be affected by reason of there being a vacancy in the membership of CSC.

**(8)**   The Minister may grant leave of absence to a Trustee on such terms and conditions as to remuneration or otherwise as the Minister determines.

**(9)**   A Trustee may resign office by writing signed by the Trustee and delivered to the Minister.

**Termination of Appointment**

**5.  (1)**   The Minister may terminate the appointment of a Trustee for:

     (a)  misbehaviour or physical or mental incapacity; or

     (b)  inefficiency or incompetence.

**(2)**   If a Trustee:

     (a)  becomes bankrupt, applies to take the benefit of any law for the relief of bankrupt or insolvent debtors, compounds with the Trustee’s creditors or makes an assignment of the Trustee’s remuneration for their benefit; or

     (b)  fails, without reasonable excuse, to comply with the Trustee’s obligations under clause 7; or

     (c)  is absent, except on leave granted by the Minister, from 3 consecutive meetings of CSC of which the Trustee has had notice;

the Minister may terminate the appointment of the Trustee.

**Acting Appointments**

**6.  (1)**   The Minister may appoint a person to act as Chairperson after consultation with the Minister for Finance in relation to the appointment:

     (a)  during a vacancy in the office of Chairperson; or

     (b)  during any period, or during all periods, when the Chairperson is absent from duty or from Australia or is, for any reason, unable to perform the duties of the office of Chairperson.

**(2)**   The Minister may appoint a person to act as a Trustee:

     (a)  during a vacancy in the office of a Trustee; or

     (b)  during any period, or during all periods, when a Trustee is acting as Chairperson, is absent from Australia or is, for any reason, unable to perform the duties of that office.

**(3)**   The Minister shall only appoint a person to act as a Trustee who meets the same criteria, as set out in subclauses 4 (1) (a) or (b), as the Trustee in whose place the Trustee is to act.

**(4)**   An appointment under subclause (1) or (2) may be expressed to have effect only in such circumstances as are specified in the instrument of appointment.

**(5)**   While a person is acting as Chairperson or as a Trustee, the person has and may exercise all the powers, and shall perform all the duties, of the Chairperson or the Trustee as the case may be.

**(6)**   The Minister may:

     (a)  determine the terms and conditions of appointment, including remuneration and allowances of a person appointed to act in an office under subclause (1) or (2); and

     (b)  terminate such an appointment at any time.

**(7)**   A person appointed to act in an office under subclause (1) or (2) may resign the appointment by writing signed by the person and delivered to the Minister.

**Disclosure of Interests**

**7.  (1)**   Each Trustee shall:

     (a)  as soon as possible after, but in any case not later than 60 days after, appointment as a Trustee; and

     (b)  as soon as possible after, but in any case not later than 60 days after, each anniversary of the Trustee’s appointment as a Trustee,

present to a meeting of CSC a statement in writing setting out particulars of those interests, whether pecuniary or otherwise and whether direct or indirect, of the Trustee as at the day of appointment or as at that anniversary, as the case requires, that could reasonably be expected to conflict with the proper performance by the Trustee of the Trustee’s duties as a Trustee.

**(2)**   A statement presented by a Trustee to a meeting of CSC in pursuance of subclause (1) shall be incorporated into the minutes of the meeting.

**(3)**   Where a Trustee acquires an interest, whether pecuniary or otherwise and whether direct or indirect, that could reasonably be expected to conflict with the proper performance by the Trustee of the Trustee’s duties as a Trustee and a statement containing particulars of the interest has not been given to a meeting of CSC in accordance with subclause (1), the Trustee shall, as soon as possible after acquiring that interest, present to a meeting of CSC a statement in writing setting out particulars of the interest and the statement shall be incorporated in the minutes of the meeting.

**(4)**A Trustee who has a direct or indirect pecuniary interest in a matter being considered by CSC shall, as soon as possible after the relevant facts have come to the Trustee’s knowledge, disclose the nature of the Trustee’s interest at a meeting of CSC.

**(5)**A disclosure under subclause (4) shall be recorded in the minutes of the meeting of CSC and the Trustee shall not, unless CSC or the Minister otherwise determines:

     (a)  be present during any deliberation of CSC with respect to that matter; or

     (b)  take part in any decision of CSC with respect to that matter.

**(6)**   For the purpose of the making of a determination by CSC under subclause (5) in relation to a Trustee who has made a disclosure under subclause (4), a Trustee who has a direct or indirect pecuniary interest in the matter to which the disclosure relates shall not:

     (a)  be present during any deliberation of CSC for the purpose of making the determination; or

     (b)  take part in the making by CSC of the determination.

**(7)**   Where a Trustee is obliged by subclause (4) to disclose the nature of an interest at a meeting of CSC, the fact that the Trustee has presented to a meeting of CSC a statement under subclause (1) or (3) that includes particulars of that interest does not relieve the Trustee of the Trustee’s obligation under subclause (4).

**Meetings of the CSC of Trustees**

**8.  (1)**CSC shall hold such meetings as are necessary for the conduct of its affairs.

**(2)**   The Chairperson may at any time convene a meeting of CSC and shall, when so requested in writing by another Trustee, convene a meeting of CSC within 30 days of receiving such notice.

**(3)**   The Chairperson shall preside at all meetings of CSC at which the Chairperson is present. If the Chairperson is not present at a meeting of CSC, the Chairperson may nominate one of the Trustees to be Chairperson for the meeting. In the absence of such nomination, the Trustees shall elect one of the Trustees present at the meeting as a Chairperson for the meeting.

**(4)**   At a meeting of CSC 4 Trustees, or acting Trustees, shall constitute a quorum and all decisions of CSC shall require a majority of 4 votes of the Trustees, or acting Trustees, present in person and voting.

**(5)**   CSC shall keep accurate records of all meetings held by CSC.

**Operation of the Fund**

**9.  (1)**   All contributions and other moneys paid to CSC, or as directed by CSC, shall be held in trust by CSC in the Fund. The Fund shall be managed and invested by CSC in accordance with the Act and the Deed.

**(2)**The Fund shall comprise:

     (a)  contributions made by members;

     (b)  contributions made by the Commonwealth pursuant to the Act and the Deed;

     (c)  any other moneys paid or transferred to CSC pursuant to the Act and the Deed or which become subject to the trusts of the Deed;

     (d)  the income arising from investments; and

     (e)  any accretions to or profits on realisation of investments.

**(3)**   The Fund shall be used by CSC to pay benefits to or in respect of members, to make payments to the Commonwealth in respect of members’ benefits as provided for in the Act and to pay the costs and expenses of the management and investment of the Fund.

**Investment of the Fund**

**10.  (1)**   For the purposes of this clause:

     (a)  **“invest”** means expend moneys with a view to obtaining a present or future financial return (whether by way of income, profit or otherwise); and

     (b)  **“profit”** includes capital profit.

**(2)**Moneys standing to the credit of the Fund which CSC, after consultation with its investment manager, is of the opinion are moneys that are not for the time being required for the purpose of making payments out of the Fund under the Act and the Deed shall, so far as is practicable, be invested by CSC in accordance with the Act and the Deed, but CSC shall so manage the Fund that moneys that are from time to time required to pay benefits that are payable out of the Fund are available for that purpose.

**(3)**   Moneys that, by virtue of subclause (2), are required to be invested by CSC may be invested in any manner and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, may be invested by CSC jointly with another person or other persons.

**(4)**   CSC must determine an investment strategy and policy as soon as possible after 1 October 1991 and thereafter regularly review such a strategy and policy, and, where it considers necessary or desirable, change its existing investment strategy or policy. In determining and reviewing its investment strategy and policy, CSC shall consult with such persons or bodies as it thinks fit.

**(5)**   CSC shall invest moneys standing to the credit of the Fund that are available for investment only through an investment manager or managers who undertake to invest, and manage the investment of, those funds on behalf of CSC.

**(6)**   CSC shall ensure that any investment manager:

     (a)  operates within the investment powers of CSC and the investment strategy and policy as determined for the time being by CSC; and

     (b)  reports to CSC on the state of the Board’s investments and the investment market at such times and in such manner as CSC determines.

**Requests by Minister for Information**

**11.**  CSC shall furnish to the Minister such information relating to the general administration and operation of the Superannuation Scheme and the Fund as the Minister may from time to time require.

**Delegation by the CSC**

**12.**  CSC may by an instrument under its seal delegate all or any of its powers under the Deed to any person, including the Commissioner for Superannuation or a Trustee, other than its powers under Part 9 of the Rules and this power of delegation.

## Part 2—Contributions

##### Contributions by members

**3.**    **(1)**   A member is required to pay a contribution each fortnight in accordance with this Division.

**(2)**   Where contributions by a member fall due during a period when he or she is on leave without pay, the member, or a person acting on his or her behalf, is to pay those contributions:

     (a)  each fortnight; or

     (b)  in such instalments and at such times as CSC approves; or

     (c)  with the approval of CSC, in a lump sum.

##### Amount of contributions

**4.    (1)**   Subject to subrule (2), the amount of the contribution payable by a member in a fortnight is an amount equal to the relevant percentage of the amount of the salary paid to the member in that fortnight.

**(2)**Where a member elects under subrule (10) to vary the amount of the contribution payable by him or her, that election has effect in relation to the first salary fortnight in relation to which it can be applied in the ordinary course of business.

**(3)**   Where a member makes an election under subrule (10), the member is not entitled to make a further election until the expiration of a period of three months after the day on which the earlier election was made.

**(4)**For the purposes of subrule (1), salary is taken not to be paid to a member in respect of a day included in a period that, in accordance with Schedule 2, is a prescribed period.

**(5)**   Where:

     (a)  the salary and allowances of a member in respect of a period are forfeited, in whole or in part, under regulations made under the _Defence Act 1903_; and

     (b)  the period does not exceed 21 consecutive days;

the amounts of the contributions payable by the member in respect of that period are to be calculated as if the member were on full pay.

**(6)**   Subject to subrule (7), where a member who is granted:

     (a)  long service leave on half pay; or

     (b)  leave without pay for a period not exceeding 21 days;

the amounts of the contributions payable by the member in respect of that period are to be calculated as if the member were on full pay.

**(7)**In a case to which paragraph (6) (b) applies, the member’s salary for the purpose of calculating the contribution payable by the member is taken not to include higher duties allowance unless:

     (a)  higher duties allowance was payable to the member on the day immediately preceding the commencement of the period; and

     (b)  an appropriate authority of the Defence Force has notified CSC that, but for the member’s absence on leave without pay, higher duties allowance would have been payable to the member in respect of the whole of the period of his or her absence on that leave.

**(8)**   In calculating the amount of a contribution payable by a member, the calculation is to be made as if no deductions were made from the member’s salary.

**(9)**Where the amount of a contribution payable by a member includes a fraction of a cent:

     (a)  if the fraction is less than one‑half of a cent—the contribution is taken to be reduced by the amount of the fraction; or

     (b)  if the fraction is one‑half of a cent or more—the contribution is taken to be increased by treating the fraction as one cent.

**(10)**   In this rule:

**“relevant percentage”**, in relation to a member, means:

     (a)  the percentage, being a whole number that is not less than 5 and not more than 10, elected by the member; or

     (b)  if the member has not made an election—5 per centum.

##### Cessation of contributions on reaching maximum benefit limit

**5.    (1)**   A member is not entitled to pay contributions after he or she has been notified that his or her total benefit equals or exceeds his or her pension maximum benefit limit.

**(2)**   At any time after a member is notified that his or her total benefit equals or exceeds his or her lump sum maximum benefit limit, he or she may elect to cease paying contributions.

**(3)**   This rule applies in spite of anything in this Part.

##### Contributions while on leave without pay in connection with birth of child etc.

**6.**A member who is on leave without pay for a period exceeding 21 days which was granted to him or her in connection with:

     (a)  the birth of a child of the member; or

     (b)  other termination of the pregnancy of the member; or

     (c)  the adoption of a child by the member;

may elect to pay contributions, calculated as if the member were on full pay, in respect of so much of that period, not exceeding 9 months, as is specified in the election.

##### Contributions while on other leave without pay

**7.    (1)**   This rule does not apply to a period of leave without pay to which rule 6 applies.

**(2)**   Where a member who is on leave without pay for a period exceeding 21 days which was granted to him or her:

     (a)  for the purpose of the member:

                  (i)   engaging, with the approval of the appropriate authority of the Defence Force, in full time employment; or

                 (ii)   undertaking further education; or

                (iii)   undergoing training; or

                (iv)   engaging in some other activity;

and, in the case of subparagraph (ii), (iii) or (iv), an appropriate authority of the Defence Force has notified CSC that the education, training or other activity is relevant to the requirements of the Defence Force; or

     (b)  because the member was for the time being physically or mentally incapable of performing his or her duties;

the member may, with the approval of CSC, elect to pay contributions, calculated as if the member were on full pay, in respect of so much of the period as is specified in the election.

**(3)**   Where:

     (a)  leave without pay is granted to a member (in this subrule called the **“inactive member”**) whose spouse (in this subrule called the **“active member”**):

                  (i)   is also a member; or

                 (ii)   is an eligible member of the Defence Force within the meaning of the 1973 Act; and

     (b)  the active member is posted to a locality to which the inactive member is unable to obtain a posting; and

     (c)  the inactive member is granted the leave without pay in order not to be separated from the active member;

the inactive member may elect to pay contributions, calculated as if the member were on full pay, in respect of so much of that period, not exceeding 2 years, as is specified in the election.

**(4)**In this rule:

**“spouse”**, in relation to a member, means a person who is legally married to the member and includes a person who, although not legally married to the member, ordinarily lives with the member as his or her husband or wife, as the case may be, on a permanent and bona fide domestic basis and is not of the same sex as the member.

##### General conditions applicable to contributions under rules 6 and 7

**8.    (1)**   The provisions of rule 4 apply to an election made under rule 6 or 7 as if:

     (a)  the reference in that rule to the amount of salary paid to the member in a fortnight were a reference to the amount of salary that would have been paid to the member in that fortnight if the member had been on full pay; and

     (b)  the salary so assumed to be paid did not include higher duties allowance unless:

                 (a)   higher duties allowance was payable to the member on the day immediately before the commencement of the period; and

                 (b)   an appropriate authority of the Defence Force has notified CSC that, but for the member’s absence on leave without pay, higher duties allowance would have been payable to the member in respect of the whole of the period of his or her absence on that leave.

**(2)**   A member who has made an election under rule 6 or 7 may revoke the election at any time after the expiration of a period of 3 months after the election was made.

##### Member contributions to be paid to CSC

**9.**Contributions payable by a member are to be paid to CSC by or on behalf of the member.

##### Liability of Department to pay employer contributions

**10.  (1)**     The Department must, on each salary pay‑day on which a member pays contributions, pay to CSC an employer contribution in relation to the member.

**(2)**   In spite of a member paying contributions during a period of leave without pay to which rule 7 applies, subrule (1) does not apply:

     (a)  in the case of a period of leave without pay referred to in subrule 7 (2) which exceeds 12 months—to any part of the excess period in respect of which no amount is paid under a prescribed arrangement; or

     (b)  in the case of a period of leave without pay referred to in subrule 7 (3).

**(3)**   The amount of an employer contribution payable by the Department in relation to a member is an amount that is 3 per centum of the amount of the salary payable to the member in respect of the relevant fortnight.

**(4)**In this rule:

**“member’s employer”**, in relation to a member who is engaged in employment referred to in subparagraph 7 (2) (a) (i), means the person who is the employer of the member in respect of that employment.

**“prescribed arrangement”**, in relation to a member who is engaged in employment referred to in subparagraph 7 (2) (a) (i), means an arrangement between the Commonwealth and the member’s employer under which the employer agrees to pay to the Commonwealth an employer contribution, in relation to the member:

     (a)  in respect of each salary fortnight in the period of that employment; or

     (b)  in respect of each salary fortnight in a specified part of that period;

as the case may be, in respect of which the member pays a contribution under this Part.

##### Payment of contributions into Fund

**11.**CSC must pay all member and employer contributions received by it into the Fund.

## Part 3—Members’ Benefits

### Division 1—Benefits other than Invalidity Benefits

##### Benefits on retirement before reaching 55 years of age or earlier retiring age, otherwise than for redundancy or retrenchment etc.

**12.  (1)**   This rule applies to a member who retires:

     (a)  in the case of a member whose retiring age is less than 55 years—before reaching his or her retiring age; or

     (b)  in any other case—before reaching the age of 55 years;

not being a member who is:

     (c)  retired on the ground of redundancy or retrenchment; or

     (d)  entitled to an invalidity pension.

     (b)  there is applicable to him or her a preserved benefit of the amount of his or her employer benefit.

**(3)**   Subject to rule 15, a person who is entitled to be paid a member benefit under paragraph (2) (a) may elect that, instead of that benefit being paid to him or her, there be applicable to him or her a preserved benefit of the amount of the member benefit and if he or she so elects:

     (a)  the member benefit is not payable to him or her as a lump sum; and

     (b)  there is applicable to him or her a preserved benefit of that amount.

##### Benefits on retirement for redundancy or retrenchment or on attaining retiring age of less than 55 years

**13.  (1)**   Where a member is retired on the ground of redundancy or retrenchment and he or she is not entitled to an invalidity pension:

**(2)**Where a member retires and, on that retirement:

     (a)  he or she has reached his or her retiring age;

     (b)  that retiring age is less than 55 years; and

     (c)  he or she is not entitled to an invalidity pension;

then:

     (d)  his or her member benefit is payable to him or her as a lump sum; and

     (e)  there is applicable to him or her a preserved benefit of the amount of his or her employer benefit.

**(3)**A person who is entitled to be paid a member benefit under paragraph (1) (a) or (2) (d) may elect that, instead of that benefit being paid to him or her, there be applicable to him or her a preserved benefit of the amount of the member benefit and if he or she so elects:

     (a)  on or after attaining the age of 55 years; and

**15.  (1)**   This rule applies to a person to whom rule 12 applies who has less than 12 months’ eligible service and whose employer benefit consists wholly of funded employer benefit.

**(2)**Where the person’s employer benefit is an amount to which the preservation standards set out in the Occupational Superannuation Standards Regulations apply, he or she may elect that, instead of his or her employer benefit being preserved in the Fund, it is paid to a preservation fund, or used to purchase a deferred annuity, of his or her choice, and if he or she does so:

     (b)  he or she is not entitled to elect under subrule 12 (3) to have applicable to him or her a preserved benefit of his or her member benefit.

**(4)**   In spite of anything in this rule or in rule 12, where a person to whom this rule applies does not elect that there be applicable to him or her a preserved benefit of the amount of his or her member benefit, there is not applicable to him or her a preserved benefit of his or her employer benefit, but instead:

     (a)  if the employer benefit is an amount referred to in subrule (2), it is payable to a preservation fund, or used to purchase a deferred annuity, of his or her choice; or

     (b)  in any other case, it is payable to him or her as a lump sum.

**(5)**   In this rule:

**“preservation fund”** means a fund that is required, in accordance with the standards set out in the Occupational Superannuation Standards Regulations, to preserve benefits transferred to the fund from a superannuation fund in accordance with those regulations.

**16.  (1)**   Where a person who transferred from the 1973 Scheme before 1 October 1992 retires before completing 731 days of contributory service after 30 September 1991 otherwise than:

     (a)  on reaching his or her retiring age; or

     (b)  on the ground of invalidity, redundancy or retrenchment;

the amount of member benefit which he or she would, but for this rule, be entitled to be paid is reduced by substituting for the amount of interest applicable in relation to him or her under the relevant provisions an amount calculated in accordance with the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00561/Html/a0fac077-1da2-4781-a1b2-400b750df7c4_files/image002.gif)

where:

**“Notional interest”** means the amount of interest applicable in relation to the person under the relevant provisions; and

**“Number of days of contributory service”** means the number of days of contributory service by the person after 30 September 1991.

**(2)**   A reference in this rule to a person who retires on the ground of invalidity is taken not to include a reference to a person who, by reason of rule 31, 32 or 33, is not entitled to invalidity benefits.

**(3)**   In this rule:

**“contributory service”**, in relation to a person, means service by the person in respect of which the person paid contributions under Part 2 or contributions under section 17 of the 1973 Act;

**“relevant provisions”** means subparagraph (e) (ii) of Schedule 9 and paragraph 1(b) of Schedule 10.

### Division 2—Invalidity Benefits

### Subdivision A—Incapacity Classification

##### Establishment of Incapacity Classification Committee

**17.**CSC must establish an Incapacity Classification Committee.

##### Membership of Committee

**18.  (1)**   The Committee comprises such number of persons as CSC determines.

**(2)**   The qualifications of each member of the Committee are such as CSC determines.

##### Functions of Committee

**19.  (1)**   The functions of the Committee are to exercise, at the request of CSC and subject to any directions given by CSC, the powers and functions under rules 22 and 23.

**(2)**   When determining the classification of, or reclassifying, an invalidity retiree, the Committee:

     (a)  must take into account any evidence relating to that retiree that is made available or submitted to it; and

     (b)  may take steps to obtain any other evidence that it considers necessary to properly determine the classification.

**(3)**   CSC must make available to the Committee any medical or other evidence that it has concerning the invalidity retiree whose classification or reclassification is being considered and that is relevant to his or her classification.

##### Proceedings of Committee

**20.**Subject to any directions given by CSC, the Committee may regulate its proceedings as the Committee thinks fit.

##### Decisions by Committee

**21.**The Committee must notify CSC of its decision as to the classification or reclassification of an invalidity retiree, giving reasons for its decision.

##### Classification in respect of incapacity

**22.  (1)**Where a member is retired on the ground of invalidity, CSC or the Committee must determine the percentage of incapacity in relation to civil employment of the invalidity retiree and must classify the retiree according to the percentage of incapacity as follows:

<table>
<colgroup>
  <col width="79%">
  <col width="21%">
</colgroup>

<tr>
  <td>
    <div>Percentage of Incapacity</div>
  </td>
  <td>
    <div>Class</div>
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>
    <div>60% or more</div>
  </td>
  <td>
    <div>A</div>
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>
    <div>30% or more but less than 60%</div>
  </td>
  <td>
    <div>B</div>
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>
    <div>Less than 30%</div>
  </td>
  <td>
    <div>C</div>
  </td>
</tr></table>

**(2)**   In determining, for the purposes of subrule (1), the percentage of incapacity in relation to civil employment of an invalidity retiree, CSC or the Committee must have regard to the following matters only:

     (a)  the vocational, trade and professional skills, qualifications and experience of the retiree;

     (b)  the kinds of civil employment which a person with the skills, qualifications and experience referred to in paragraph (a) might reasonably undertake;

     (c)  the degree to which the physical or mental impairment of the retiree that is the cause of the invalidity by reason of which he or she has been retired has diminished his or her capacity to undertake the kinds of civil employment referred to in paragraph (b).

**(3)**The death of a person after he or she has been retired on the ground of invalidity does not prevent the classifying of the person under subrule (1).

**(4)**This rule does not apply to a person who, by reason of rule 31, 32 or 33, is not entitled to invalidity benefits.

##### Reclassification in respect of incapacity

**23.  (1)**Where CSC or the Committee, at any time, is satisfied that there has been such a change in the percentage of incapacity in relation to civil employment of an invalidity pensioner that his or her classification should be altered, CSC or the Committee may reclassify him or her in the appropriate classification set out in rule 22 according to the percentage of his or her incapacity in relation to civil employment.

**(2)**   Where an invalidity pensioner has attained the age of 55 years and the invalidity pensioner is classified:

     (a)  as Class A—subrule (1) does not apply to him or her; or

     (b)  as Class B—subrule (1) is taken not to empower CSC to reclassify him or her as Class C.

**(3)**   In determining, for the purposes of subrule (1), the percentage of incapacity in relation to civil employment of an invalidity pensioner, CSC or the Committee must have regard to the following matters only:

     (a)  the vocational, trade and professional skills, qualifications and experience of the pensioner;

     (b)  the kinds of civil employment which a person with skills, qualifications and experience referred to in paragraph (a) might reasonably undertake;

     (c)  the degree to which any physical or mental impairment of the pensioner, being a prescribed physical or mental impairment, has diminished his or her capacity to undertake the kinds of civil employment referred to in paragraph (b).

**(4)**   Where CSC or the Committee reclassifies a person under this rule, CSC or the Committee must specify the date from which the reclassification has effect and, on and after that date, the person is, for the purposes of these Rules, taken to be classified under rule 22 accordingly.

**(5)**Where CSC or the Committee reclassifies a person under this rule, the date specified by CSC or the Committee as the date from which the reclassification has effect is not to be a date earlier than the date on which CSC or the Committee reclassifies the member unless:

     (a)  the person is reclassified as Class A or, having been classified as Class C, is reclassified as Class B; and

     (b)  CSC or the Committee is satisfied that special circumstances exist that justify an earlier date being so specified.

**(6)**Where a person who was retired otherwise than on the ground of invalidity is, by virtue of rule 30, treated as if he or she had been retired on the ground of invalidity, CSC or the Committee may, despite subrule (5), on the same day on which it classifies him or her under rule 22, reclassify him or her under this rule with effect from a date after the date of his or her retirement but before the date on which CSC or the Committee makes the reclassification.

**(7)**   The death of a person after he or she has been classified under rule 22 or reclassified under this rule does not prevent the reclassifying of the person under subrule (1).

**(8)**   For the purposes of this rule, a person who:

     (a)     is classified as Class C; and

     (b)     immediately before being so classified was an invalidity pensioner;

is taken to be an invalidity pensioner.

**(9)**   This rule does not apply to a person who has attained the age of 65 years.

**(10)**   In this rule:

**“prescribed physical or mental impairment”**, in relation to an invalidity pensioner, means:

     (d)  the person intends to leave Australia permanently and CSC is satisfied that that intention will be carried out—on the date on which CSC became so satisfied;

               (ii)     the balance of the preserved benefit is payable to him or her as a lump sum.

##### Compulsory payment of preserved benefit to person on attaining 65 years of age

**53.**Where a person in relation to whom a preserved benefit is applicable does not make an election under paragraph 52 (b) or (c) on or before attaining the age of 65 years, the preserved benefit is payable to the person as a lump sum.

##### Payment of deceased former member’s preserved benefit

**54.**  **(1)**   Upon the death of a person who had been a member but at the time of his or her death was not a member or a retirement pensioner (in this rule called the **“deceased former member”**), his or her preserved benefit or a pension is payable in accordance with this rule.

**(2)**   A deceased former member’s preserved benefit or a pension is payable as follows:

     (a)  if the deceased former member is survived by a spouse, the preserved benefit is payable to the spouse as a lump sum;

     (b)  if the deceased former member is not survived by a spouse but is survived by an eligible child or children, a pension is payable to, or for the benefit of, the child or children at an annual rate equal to the relevant percentage in Table 2 in Schedule 4 of the deceased former member’s notional pension;

     (c)  if the deceased former member is not survived by a spouse or an eligible child and he or she had notified CSC in writing that:

                (i)     he or she had a person or persons dependent on him or her who would not be eligible to receive benefits as a spouse or eligible child; and

               (ii)     he or she had made provision for that person or those persons in his or her will;

            the preserved benefit is payable to, or for the benefit of, the person as a lump sum;

     (d)  in any other case, the preserved benefit is payable to the deceased member’s personal representatives as a lump sum.

**(3)**   Where a pension becomes payable under paragraph (2) (b), the member benefit (if any) included in the preserved benefit is payable, as a lump sum, to, or for the benefit of, the eligible child or children.

**(4)**   A spouse who is entitled to be paid an employer benefit under paragraph (2) (a) may elect that:

     (a)  instead of that employer benefit being paid to him or her, it be converted into a pension payable to him or her at an annual rate equal to the relevant percentage in Table 1 in Schedule 4 of the deceased member’s notional pension and if he or she so elects the benefit is so converted; or

     (b)  instead of that employer benefit being paid in full to him or her, a specified part of that benefit, being not less than one‑half of the benefit, be converted into a pension payable to him or her at an annual rate equal to the relevant percentage in Table 1 in Schedule 4 of the deceased member’s reduced notional pension and if he or she so elects:

                (i)     that part of the employer benefit is so converted; and

               (ii)     the balance of the preserved benefit is payable to him or her as a lump sum.

**(5)**   In this rule:

**“notional pension”**, in relation to a deceased former member, means the pension that would have been payable to the deceased former member if, on the date of his or her death, he or she had become entitled, under Division 1 of Part 3, to elect to have his or her employer benefit converted into a pension and had elected to do so;

**“reduced notional pension”**, in relation to a deceased former member, means the pension that would have been payable to the deceased former member if, on the date of his or her death, he or she:

     (b)  had elected to convert into a pension the same amount of his or her employer benefit as his or her spouse elected under paragraph (4) (b) to convert into a pension.

## Part 6—Increases in Maximum Benefit Limits, Pensions and Certain Unfunded Preserved Benefits

### Division 1—Increases in Maximum Benefit Limits

##### Increases in maximum benefit limits

**55.  (1)**   This rule is to have effect, on 1 July 1991 and each subsequent 1 July, as if there were substituted for:

     (a)  each amount referred to in the definition of “lump sum maximum benefit multiple” in Schedule 3; and

     (b)  each amount referred to in the definition of “pension maximum benefit multiple” in Schedule 3;

or for the amount last substituted for that amount under this rule (in this rule called the **“base amount”**) a new amount calculated by:

     (c)  multiplying the base amount by the index number for the March quarter immediately preceding that 1 July; and

     (d)  dividing the product by the index number for the previous March quarter.

**(2)**   Subject to subrule (3), if at any time, whether before or after the commencement of these Rules, the Statistician publishes an index number in respect of a particular March quarter in substitution for an index number previously published, that later index number is disregarded for the purposes of this rule.

**(3)**   If at any time the Statistician changes the reference base for the index numbers, regard is to be had, for the purposes of the operation of this rule after the change took place, only to index numbers published in terms of the new reference base.

**(4)**   Where an amount to be substituted under this rule is not a multiple of $10, it is increased to the nearest multiple of $10.

**(5)**   In this rule:

**“index number”**, in relation to a quarter, means the amount of the full‑time adult average weekly ordinary time earnings first published by the Statistician for the middle month of that quarter.

### Division 2—Increases in Pensions and Certain Unfunded Preserved Benefits

##### Increases in pensions and certain unfunded preserved benefits

**56.  (1)**   Subject to this Part, if the all groups consumer price index number for the weighted average of the 8 capital cities published by the Statistician in respect of the March quarter of the year immediately preceding a prescribed year exceeds the highest all groups consumer price index number for the weighted average of the 8 capital cities published by the Statistician in respect of the March quarter of any earlier year, not being a year earlier than the year that commenced on 1 July 1989, then:

     (a)  a person (in this section called the **“pensioner”**) who was in receipt of a pension immediately before the commencement of that prescribed year is entitled to an increase in the rate at which the pension was payable immediately before the commencement of that prescribed year; and

     (b)  where, immediately before the commencement of that prescribed year, a preserved benefit is applicable to a person, or has become payable in respect of a deceased person but has not been paid, the amount of the unfunded employer benefit included in the preserved benefit in relation to that person immediately before the commencement of that year is increased.

**(2)**   The increase provided for by subrule (1) in the rate at which a pension was payable to a person, or in the amount of the unfunded preserved benefit in relation to a person, immediately before the commencement of a prescribed year (in this rule called the **“relevant prescribed year”**), is the percentage of that rate or amount that represents **A – B**expressed as a percentage of **B**, where:

**A** is the all groups consumer price index number for the weighted average of the 8 capital cities published by the Statistician in respect of the March quarter of the year immediately preceding the prescribed year; and

**B** is the highest all groups consumer price index number for the weighted average of the 8 capital cities published by the Statistician in respect of the March quarter of any year earlier than the year that commenced on 1 July 1990.

**(3)**   Where, by reason of the death on 30 June in the year immediately preceding a prescribed year of a person in receipt of a pension, a pension becomes payable on the following day to another person, that other person is entitled to such an increase in the rate of that pension as he or she would have been entitled to had the pension become payable to him or her on that 30 June.

##### Application of increase to suspended pension

**57.**  Where a pension would, but for its suspension under rule 25, be payable to a person immediately before the commencement of a prescribed year, that pension is, for the purposes of this Part, taken to have been payable to that person immediately before the commencement of that prescribed year but any increase in the rate of that pension by virtue of this Part does not take effect until the day on which the pension again becomes payable.

##### Proportionate increase for part of a year

**58.  (1)**   This rule applies to a pension where:

     (a)  the person to whom the pension is payable would, but for this rule, be entitled to an increase, in accordance with rule 56, in the rate at which the pension was payable to him or her immediately before the commencement of the prescribed year; and

     (b)  the person is:

                (i)     a retirement pensioner and the pension became payable to him or her during the preceding year; or

               (ii)     the spouse of, or eligible child in relation to, a deceased person who was a member immediately before his or her death and the pension became payable to the spouse or child, as the case may be, during the preceding year; or

              (iii)     the spouse of, or eligible child in relation to, a deceased person who was a retirement pensioner immediately before his or her death and the deceased person’s pension became payable to the deceased person during the preceding year.

**(2)**   If:

     (a)  the pension; or

     (b)  where subparagraph (1) (b) (iii) applies—the pension that was payable to the deceased person in relation to whom the person was a spouse or eligible child;

became payable after 16 June in the preceding year, the person is not entitled to the increase.

**(3)**   If:

     (a)  the pension; or

     (b)  where subparagraph (1) (b) (iii) applies—the pension that was payable to the deceased person in relation to whom the person was a spouse or eligible child;

became payable on or before 16 June in the preceding year, the amount of the increase is an amount calculated in accordance with the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00561/Html/a0fac077-1da2-4781-a1b2-400b750df7c4_files/image003.gif)

where:

**“Full increase”** means the amount of the increase that would have been applicable but for this subrule.

**“Number of months in period”** means the number of months in the period that began on the day on which the pension referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) became payable and ended on 30 June in the preceding year.

**(4)**   If the period referred to in subrule (3) is less than 1 month, that period is treated as 1 month.

**(5)**   If the period referred to in subrule (3) consists of a number of whole months and a part of a month:

     (a)  where the number of days in that part of that month is less than one‑half of the number of days in that month—that part is disregarded; and

     (b)  where the number of days in that part of that month is more than one‑half of the number of days in that month—that part is treated as a whole month.

**(6)**Where a preserved benefit:

     (a)  became applicable to a person; or

     (b)  became payable or was converted into a pension;

during the most recent prescribed year, that part of the preserved benefit that is an unfunded employer benefit is increased to the extent determined by CSC, consistent with the principle of subrule 56 (2).

**(7)**   In this rule:

**“preceding year”**, in relation to a pension to which this rule applies, means the year immediately preceding the prescribed year.

##### Adjustment in connection with invalidity reclassification

**59.  (1)**   Where:

     (a)  a person to whom an invalidity pension is payable is reclassified from Class A to Class B or vice versa under rule 23 during a prescribed year; and

     (b)  the person became entitled at the beginning of that year to an increase under this Part in the rate at which that invalidity pension was payable to him or her immediately before the beginning of that year;

the rate at which the pension is payable to him or her on and after the date from which the reclassification has effect is the rate at which the pension would have been payable to him or her at the beginning of the year if his or her classification, on and after the date on which he or she became entitled to the pension, had been in accordance with the reclassification.

**(2)**   Where:

     (a)  a person to whom an invalidity pension was payable ceased to be entitled to an invalidity pension because of his or her reclassification under rule 23; and

     (b)  in consequence of a further reclassification under that rule during a prescribed year he or she again becomes entitled to an invalidity pension;

the rate at which the pension is payable to him or her on and after the date from which the latter reclassification has effect is the rate at which the pension would have been payable to him or her if:

     (c)  he or she had not ceased to be entitled to an invalidity pension in consequence of the first mentioned reclassification; and

     (d)  his or her classification, on and after the date on which he or she first became entitled to an invalidity pension, had been in accordance with the further reclassification.

**(3)**   Where:

     (a)  a person to whom an invalidity pension was payable ceased to be entitled to an invalidity pension because of his or her reclassification under rule 23; and

     (b)  in consequence of a further reclassification under that rule after his or her death he or she would, had he or she not died, have again become entitled to an invalidity pension;

then, for the purpose of calculating benefits for any surviving spouse or eligible child of the invalidity pensioner, the invalidity pensioner is to be taken to have been, immediately before his or her death, in receipt of an invalidity pension at the rate at which that pension would have been payable to him or her if:

     (c)  he or she had not ceased to be entitled to invalidity pension in consequence of the first‑mentioned reclassification; and

     (d)  his or her classification, on and after the date on which he or she first became entitled to an invalidity pension, had been in accordance with the further reclassification.

**(4)**   Upon a preserved benefit becoming applicable to a person under subrule 29 (1), the unfunded employer benefit included in that preserved benefit is increased as if:

     (a)  that preserved benefit had become applicable to the person on the person’s retirement; and

     (b)  this Part had applied, since that retirement, to the unfunded employer benefit included in the preserved benefit.

##### Date of effect of increase

**60.  (1)**   An increase by virtue of this Part in the rate of a pension that:

     (a)  was payable; or

     (b)  under subrule 56 (3) is treated as having been payable;

to a person on 30 June in a year applies in relation to the instalment of pension falling due on the first pension pay‑day occurring after that day and in relation to all subsequent instalments.

**(2)**   An increase by virtue of this Part in the amount of an unfunded preserved benefit applies with effect from:

     (a)  in the case of an increase under subrule 58 (6)—the date on which the preserved benefit became payable; or

     (b)  in any other case—1 July of the prescribed year.

##### Interpretation

**61.  (1)**   Subject to subrule (2), if at any time, whether before or after the commencement of these Rules, the Statistician has published or publishes in respect of a particular March quarter an all groups consumer price index number for the weighted average of the 8 capital cities in substitution for an index number previously published by him or her in respect of that quarter, the publication of the later index number is disregarded for the purposes of this Part.

**(2)**   If at any time, whether before or after the commencement of these Rules, the Statistician has changed or changes the reference base for the Consumer Price Index, then, for the purposes of the application of this Part after the change took place or takes place, regard is to be had only to index numbers published in terms of the new reference base.

**(3)**If the percentage for the purposes of rule 56 is or includes a fraction of one tenth of 1 per centum:

     (a)  where that fraction is less than one half of one tenth—that fraction is disregarded; and

     (b)  where that fraction is not less than one half of one tenth—that fraction is treated as one tenth.

## Part 7—Candidates at Parliamentary Elections

##### Re‑instated member

**62.  (1)**   Where a person who resigned to contest an election:

     (a)  again becomes a member; and

     (b)  is a person referred to in a relevant provision of the Parliamentary Candidates Act; and

     (c)  repays to CSC, before the expiration of 60 days after the day on which he or she again became a member, the amount of any benefit paid to him or her under these Rules upon him or her resigning to contest the election;

the person is taken for the purposes of these Rules:

     (d)  to have been a member; and

     (e)  despite the operation of the relevant provision, not to have been absent on leave without pay;

during the relevant period.

**(2)**   Where subrule (1) applies to a person:

     (a)  any benefit that became payable to him or her under these Rules upon him or her ceasing to be a member is taken not to have been payable; and

     (b)  the fortnightly contributions that the person is required to make in respect of the relevant period are in accordance with the election by him or her that was in force immediately before the beginning of that period.

##### Death or physical or mental incapacity of person

**63.**  When a person who resigned to contest an election:

     (a)     dies; or

     (b)     in the opinion of CSC, becomes physically or mentally incapacitated to the extent that he or she would have been retired on the ground of invalidity if he or she had remained a member;

he or she is, where considered appropriate by CSC, taken not to have ceased to be a member but to have died or retired on the ground of invalidity while a member at a time determined by CSC.

## Part 8—General Provisions Applicable to Contributions and Benefits

##### Provisions applicable to elections under the Rules

**64.  (1)**   An election under these Rules is to be in writing.

**(2)**   Where a person is about to become, or has become, entitled:

     (a)  to benefits under Part 3 or Part 5; and

     (b)  to make an election in relation to the nature of those benefits;

he or she may make that election not earlier than 3 months before he or she is due to become entitled to the benefits and not later than 3 months after becoming entitled to the benefits.

**(3)**   Where an election under these Rules is made by a person after the expiration of the period allowed for the making of the election and CSC is satisfied that, in all the circumstances of the case, it is desirable that the election be recognised, CSC may direct that the election be allowed and if it does so these Rules have effect as if the election had been made within the period allowed.

**(4)**   Where a person who is entitled to make an election under these Rules is, by reason of physical or mental incapacity, unable to make that election, CSC may allow such other person as it thinks appropriate to make the election within such period as CSC allows and if it does so and the other person so makes the election these Rules have effect as if the election had been made by the first‑mentioned person within the period allowed.

**(5)**   Where:

     (a)  an election under Part 3, 4 or 5 is made by the person entitled to make the election or, in accordance with subrule (3), by another person on behalf of the first‑mentioned person; and

     (b)  the person who made the election makes an application to CSC, not later than 3 months after the day on which the election is made or within such further period as CSC in special circumstances allows, requesting that CSC cancel the election; and

     (c)  CSC, having regard to such matters as it considers relevant, is satisfied that the election should be cancelled;

CSC may direct that the election is cancelled and if it does so these Rules have effect as if the election had not been made.

**(6)**   Where a person who is, or has been, a member is entitled to make an election under Part 3 or 5 and dies without making such an election:

     (a)  if the person is survived by a spouse—the spouse may make the election within 3 months after the person’s death; or

     (b)  if the person is not survived by a spouse, or is survived by a spouse but the spouse dies without making such an election, but the person is survived by an eligible child—the election may be made within that period by such person as CSC permits;

and if the spouse, or the person permitted by CSC, does so, these Rules have effect as if the election had been made by the first‑mentioned person.

##### Rate of pension where lump sum converted into pension

**65.  (1)**   Where a person is entitled under these Rules to have an amount of his or her employer benefit converted into a pension, the annual rate of that pension is calculated in accordance with Schedule 5.

##### Benefits in unusual or exceptional circumstances

**66.**  Where, in a particular case, CSC is of the opinion that:

     (a)  the operation of these Rules, other than this rule, with regard to a point at issue produces a result in relation to a person that is not in the spirit of the Rules; and

     (b)  the relevant circumstances of the case are unusual or exceptional;

CSC may, in relation to that case, having regard to the circumstances of the case, the principles in these Rules and the need to maintain equity between members, determine the point at issue in favour of that person.

##### Instalments of pensions

**67.  (1)**   Pensions are to be paid in fortnightly instalments on pension pay‑days.

**(2)**   The amount of a fortnightly instalment of pension is an amount ascertained by dividing the amount per annum of the pension by 26.

**(3)**   Where the amount of a fortnightly instalment of pension includes a fraction of a cent:

     (a)  if the fraction is less than one‑half of a cent—the amount of the instalment is taken to be reduced by the amount of the fraction; or

     (b)  if the fraction is one‑half of a cent or more—the amount of the instalment is taken to be increased by treating the fraction as 1 cent.

**(4)**   The amount of pension payable in respect of a day is one‑fourteenth of the amount of a fortnightly instalment of the pension.

##### Set off against pension in certain cases

**68.**  Where:

     (a)  the spouse of a deceased pensioner to whom retirement pension or invalidity pension (in this rule called the **“primary pension”**) was payable is entitled to spouse’s pension in accordance with subrule 42 (2); and

     (b)  an amount, purporting to be an instalment of primary pension payable to the pensioner in respect of a period in respect of which spouse’s pension is payable in accordance with that subrule, is paid into an account with a bank, credit union or building society (in this rule called the**“financial institution”**); and

     (c)  the financial institution pays, out of that account, to the spouse of the deceased pensioner an amount not exceeding the amount so paid into the account;

CSC may make arrangements under which the amount so paid to the spouse may be offset against any amount of pension payable to the spouse in accordance with subrule 42 (2).

##### Interest payable where payment of benefit delayed

**69.  (1)**   Where a benefit is payable as a lump sum to a person and the payment of the benefit is delayed, CSC may, in accordance with this rule, approve an increase, by an amount of interest, in the amount of the benefit payable to the person.

**(2)**   Where a pension is payable to, or for the benefit of a person and the commencement of the payment of that pension is delayed, CSC may, in accordance with this rule, approve an increase, by an amount of interest, in the rate of the pension payable to the person for such period as CSC determines.

**(3)**   A pension is not to be increased under subrule (2) if CSC is of the opinion that the amount of the increase would not be significant.

**(4)**   Interest applicable under this rule is calculated in such manner as CSC determines:

     (a)  in the case of a lump sum payment—in respect of the period of the delay; and

     (b)  in the case of a pension—in respect of:

                (i)     each instalment of the pension delayed; and

               (ii)     the period of delay of that instalment.

**(5)**   In this rule:

**“benefit”** means employer benefit or member benefit.

##### Payment of benefit otherwise than to person entitled

**70.  (1)**   Where, in the opinion of CSC, the part of:

     (a)  an instalment of spouse’s pension; or

     (b)  a spouse’s lump sum payment;

attributable to an eligible child or eligible children, or any portion of that part, should, by reason of the child or children not being in the custody, care and control of the spouse, or for any other reason which CSC thinks proper, be paid to a person other than the spouse, CSC may authorise payment of that part, or a portion of the part, to the other person and if CSC does so payment is to be made to the other person accordingly.

**(2)**   For the purposes of subrule (1), the part of a spouse’s lump sum payment attributable to that eligible child or those eligible children is taken to be the amount obtained by multiplying the spouse’s lump sum payment by the percentage applicable in respect of an eligible child or children under rule 43 in relation to a pension.

**(3)**   Where, in the opinion of CSC:

     (a)  an instalment, or part of an instalment, of a pension; or

     (b)  an amount of any other benefit;

should:

     (c)  by reason of the person who, but for this rule, would be entitled to the payment being a child, or being a person who is of unsound mind or undergoing imprisonment or otherwise being under a disability; or

     (d)  for any other reason which CSC thinks proper;

be paid to a person other than the person who would be so entitled to the payment, CSC may authorise payment to the other person and if CSC does so payment is to be made to the other person accordingly.

**(4)**   It is the intention of this rule that:

     (a)  the part, or a portion of the part, of an instalment of spouse’s pension attributable to an eligible child that, by virtue of subrule (1), is paid to a person other than the child to which that part or portion is attributable; or

     (b)  an instalment of pension payable to a child that, by virtue of subrule (3), is paid to a person other than the child;

be applied for the maintenance, education or other benefit of the child.

##### Withholding payment of benefit where required information not provided

**71.**  CSC may withhold payment of the whole, or a part, of a benefit in relation to a person where that person does not provide, or arrange to be provided, to CSC information required by CSC in connection with the determination of the person’s entitlement to benefits under these Rules or the determination of the amount of those benefits.

_Rule 65_

1.    For the purpose of converting an employer benefit into a pension, the annual rate of that pension is calculated by dividing the amount of the benefit that is to be so converted by:

     (a)  if the person’s age, in years, on the day on which he or she becomes entitled to the benefit is 65 years—a factor of 10; or

     (b)  in any other case where the person’s age is an exact number of years—a factor of 10 increased by 0.2 in respect of each year by which the person’s age, in years, on the day on which he or she becomes entitled to the benefit is less than 65 years; or

     (c)  in any case where the person’s age is not an exact number of years—the factor that would be applicable if paragraph (b) applied to the person’s age in years, reduced by a number in respect of the number of days in the person’s age in excess of the person’s age in years (in this paragraph called **“excess days”**), being a number which bears to 0.2 the same proportion as the number of excess days bears to the number of days in a year.

2.    In the application of paragraph 1 in relation to a person who is entitled to invalidity benefits and is classified as Class A, the references in that paragraph to the person’s age on the day on which he or she becomes entitled to a benefit are read as references to:

     (a)  his or her retiring age immediately before his or her retirement; or

     (b)  the age of 55 years;

whichever is the greater.

### Schedule 6—Calculation of eligible service

_Schedule 1 (Definition of “eligible service”)_

1.    The eligible service of a member is the sum of:

     (a)  subject to paragraph 2, service by the person as a member; and

     (b)  in the case of a person entitled to an invalidity pension who is classified as Class A—a period equal to the period commencing on the day immediately following the last day of the person’s service and concluding on the day on which the person would have retired if he or she had not been retired on the ground of invalidity but had served until attaining:

                (i)     the age that was the age for the compulsory retirement of the member immediately before his or her retirement; or

               (ii)     the age of 55 years;

            whichever is the greater; and

     (c)  in the case of a transferred person—a period specified in the following table in relation to that person:

2.    Service referred to in subparagraph 1 (a) does not include service during a period:

     (a)  prescribed in Schedule 2 in respect of which, under subrule 4 (4), salary is taken not to be paid to the member; or

     (b)  that was a period of leave of absence without pay granted to the member in respect of which the Department did not pay contributions to the Fund in relation to the member; or

     (c)  (except in the case of a person entitled to an invalidity benefit) that occurred after the member’s total benefit reached his or her lump sum maximum benefit limit and in respect of which the member, in pursuance of rule 5, did not pay contributions to the Fund; or

     (d)  (except in the case of a person entitled to an invalidity benefit) that occurred after the member’s total benefit reached his or her pension maximum benefit limit; or

                    **“Number of days of eligible service”**, in relation to the person, means the number of days of eligible service of the person; or

     (b)  in any other case—one‑third of the amount of salary payable to the person in his or her last 3 years of eligible service.

2.    In paragraph 1, any reference to eligible service includes, in the case of a person whose total benefit reached his or her lump sum maximum benefit limit, any period in respect of which the person, in pursuance of rule 5 and by reason only of that rule, did not pay contributions to the Fund.

3.    For the purpose of ascertaining the amount of salary payable to a member in his or her last 3 years of service in a case where that service included a period in respect of which the member:

     (a)  was in receipt of half‑pay; or

     (b)  was not entitled to be paid salary; or

(1)       Regulations that were in effect under any Act immediately before the commencement of this item continue to have effect after that time as if members of an arm of the Defence Force who were members of a particular part or component of that arm immediately before the commencement of this item were still members of that part or component after that time, even if that part or component no longer exists.

_Example: Assume that, immediately before the commencement of this item, regulations imposed training obligations on members of the Air Force Specialist Reserve. Those obligations would continue to apply to former members of that Reserve after commencement, even though the Air Force Specialist Reserve itself is no longer mentioned in the Air Force Act 1923 and the members have now become members of the Air Force Reserve._

(2)       However, regulations that continue in effect under this item do so only to the extent that they are not amended or revoked by later regulations.

## 95  Regulations about transitional matters

(1)       The regulations may make provision in relation to other saving and transitional matters in connection with the amendments made by this Schedule.

(2)       In particular, such regulations may deal with the status, after the commencement of the amendments, of persons who were members of the Defence Force immediately before that time.
