             (3)  Notwithstanding the last preceding subsection or anything contained in any other law of Australia, the period in respect of which a person is, under this section, deemed to have been absent on leave without pay shall be treated as a period of service in calculating the entitlement of that person to long service leave or furlough.

## Table A

### Application, saving or transitional provisions

_Defence Legislation Amendment (Enhancement of the Reserves and Modernisation) Act 2001 (No. 10, 2001)_

## Schedule 2

## 94  Saving—old regulations

(1)        Regulations that were in effect under any Act immediately before the commencement of this item continue to have effect after that time as if members of an arm of the Defence Force who were members of a particular part or component of that arm immediately before the commencement of this item were still members of that part or component after that time, even if that part or component no longer exists.

_Example: Assume that, immediately before the commencement of this item, regulations imposed training obligations on members of the Air Force Specialist Reserve. Those obligations would continue to apply to former members of that Reserve after commencement, even though the Air Force Specialist Reserve itself is no longer mentioned in the Air Force Act 1923 and the members have now become members of the Air Force Reserve._

(2)        However, regulations that continue in effect under this item do so only to the extent that they are not amended or revoked by later regulations.

## 95  Regulations about transitional matters

(1)        The regulations may make provision in relation to other saving and transitional matters in connection with the amendments made by this Schedule.

(2)        In particular, such regulations may deal with the status, after the commencement of the amendments, of persons who were members of the Defence Force immediately before that time.

(3)        Subitem (2) does not limit the scope of subitem (1).
