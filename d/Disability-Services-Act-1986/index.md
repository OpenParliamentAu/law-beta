             (2)  A person affected by a reviewable decision who is dissatisfied with the decision may, by notice in writing given to the Secretary within 30 days after the day on which the decision first comes to the notice of the person, or within such further period as the Secretary allows, request the Secretary to reconsider the decision.

             (3)  There shall be set out in the request the reasons for making the request.

             (4)  Upon receipt of the request, the Secretary shall reconsider the decision and may affirm or revoke the decision or vary the decision in such manner as the Secretary thinks fit.

Note:          Section 27A of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ requires a decision‑maker to notify persons whose interests are affected by the decision of the making of the decision and their right to have the decision reviewed. In so notifying, the decision‑maker must have regard to the Code of Practice determined under section 27B of that Act.

             (6)  Applications may be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of reviewable decisions that have been affirmed or varied under subsection (4).

##### <a id="27"></a>27  Power to obtain information etc.

             (4)  A person is not excused from furnishing information, producing a document or giving evidence pursuant to a notice under subsection (1) on the ground that the information or evidence, or the production of the document, may tend to incriminate the person, but any information furnished, document produced or evidence given pursuant to a notice under subsection (1), and any information or thing (including any document) obtained as a direct or indirect consequence of the furnishing of the information, production of the document or giving of the evidence, as the case may be, is not admissible in evidence against the person in any criminal proceedings, other than proceedings for an offence against subsection (3).
