             (2)  An appeal does not lie to the Tribunal against a prescribed acquittal if, in the proceedings before the court martial or the Defence Force magistrate that resulted in the prescribed acquittal, evidence of the unsoundness of mind of the prescribed acquitted person was adduced by the defence.

             (1)  An appeal, or an application for leave to appeal, to the Tribunal under this Act:

                     (b)  the last day of the period of 30 days after the conviction or prescribed acquittal;

### Division 2—Determination of appeals

##### <a id="23"></a>23  Quashing of conviction etc.

             (1)  Subject to subsection (5), where in an appeal it appears to the Tribunal:

                     (a)  that the conviction or the prescribed acquittal is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence;

                     (b)  that, as a result of a wrong decision on a question of law, or of mixed law and fact, the conviction or the prescribed acquittal was wrong in law and that a substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred;

                     (c)  that there was a material irregularity in the course of the proceedings before the court martial or the Defence Force magistrate and that a substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred; or

                     (d)  that, in all the circumstances of the case, the conviction or the prescribed acquittal is unsafe or unsatisfactory;

it shall allow the appeal and quash the conviction or the prescribed acquittal.

             (2)  Subject to subsection (5), where in an appeal it appears to the Tribunal that there is evidence that:

                     (a)  was not reasonably available during the proceedings before the court martial or the Defence Force magistrate;

                     (b)  is likely to be credible; and

                     (c)  would have been admissible in the proceedings before the court martial or the Defence Force magistrate;

it shall receive and consider that evidence and, if it appears to the Tribunal that the conviction or the prescribed acquittal cannot be supported having regard to that evidence, it shall allow the appeal and quash the conviction or the prescribed acquittal.

             (3)  Subject to subsection (5), where in an appeal against a conviction it appears to the Tribunal that, at the time of the act or omission the subject of the charge, the appellant was suffering from such unsoundness of mind as not to be responsible, in accordance with law, for that act or omission, the Tribunal shall:

                     (a)  allow the appeal and quash the conviction;

                     (b)  substitute for the conviction so quashed an acquittal on the ground of unsoundness of mind; and

                     (c)  direct that the person be kept in strict custody until the pleasure of the Governor-General is known.

             (4)  Where in an appeal it appears to the Tribunal that the court martial or the Defence Force magistrate should have found that the appellant, by reason of unsoundness of mind, was not able to understand the proceedings against him or her and accordingly was unfit to stand trial, the Tribunal shall allow the appeal, quash the conviction or prescribed acquittal and direct that the appellant be kept in strict custody until the pleasure of the Governor-General is known.

             (5)  The Tribunal shall not quash a conviction under subsection (3) or (4) if there are grounds for quashing the conviction under subsection (1) or (2).

             (6)  Section 194 of the _Defence Force Discipline Act 1982_ applies to a direction under subsection (3) or (4) of this section as if that direction were a direction to which that section applied.

##### <a id="24"></a>24  New trial

##### <a id="25"></a>25  Custody of person pending new trial

                   Where the Tribunal under section 24 makes an order for the new trial of a person, the Tribunal may make such further orders for the custody of the person pending the new trial as the Tribunal thinks appropriate.

##### <a id="26"></a>26  Substitution of conviction for alternative offence

             (1)  Where the Tribunal quashes the conviction of a person of a service offence (in this section referred to as **_the original offence_**) but considers:

                     (a)  that the court martial or the Defence Force magistrate could in the proceedings have found the person guilty of another service offence, being:

                              (i)  a service offence that is an alternative offence, within the meaning of section 142 of the _Defence Force Discipline Act 1982_, in relation to the original offence; or

                             (ii)  a service offence with which the person was charged in the alternative and in respect of which the court martial or the Defence Force magistrate did not record a finding; and

                     (b)  that the court martial or the Defence Force magistrate, by reason of its or his or her finding that the person was guilty of the original offence, must have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of facts that prove that the person was guilty of the other service offence;

the Tribunal may substitute for the conviction of the original offence a conviction of the other service offence.

             (2)  Where under subsection (1) the Tribunal substitutes for the conviction of the original offence a conviction of another service offence, the Tribunal may take such action in relation to the convicted person as could have been taken under Part IV of the _Defence Force Discipline Act 1982_ by court martial or the Defence Force magistrate that convicted the convicted person of the original offence if the court martial or Defence Force magistrate had convicted him or her of that other service offence, but the Tribunal:

                     (a)  shall not impose a punishment for that other service offence or make a reparation order with respect to that other service offence unless a punishment was imposed for the original offence or a reparation order was made with respect to the original offence, as the case may be; and

                     (b)  shall not impose a punishment for that other service offence that is more severe than the punishment that was imposed for the original offence and shall not make a reparation order with respect to that other service offence that is for an amount that exceeds the amount of the reparation order that was made with respect to the original offence.

             (3)  Where, under subsection (2), the Tribunal imposes a punishment of imprisonment or detention, that punishment shall, unless the Tribunal otherwise directs, be deemed to have commenced from the time from which it would have commenced if it had been imposed in the proceedings from which the appeal was brought.
