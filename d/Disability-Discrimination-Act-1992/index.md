             (1)  For the purposes of this Act, a person (the **_discriminator_**) **_discriminates_** against another person (the **_aggrieved person_**) on the ground of a disability of the aggrieved person if, because of the disability, the discriminator treats, or proposes to treat, the aggrieved person less favourably than the discriminator would treat a person without the disability in circumstances that are not materially different.

             (2)  For the purposes of this Act, a person (the **_discriminator_**) also **_discriminates_** against another person (the **_aggrieved person_**) on the ground of a disability of the aggrieved person if:

                     (a)  the discriminator does not make, or proposes not to make, reasonable adjustments for the person; and

                     (b)  the failure to make the reasonable adjustments has, or would have, the effect that the aggrieved person is, because of the disability, treated less favourably than a person without the disability would be treated in circumstances that are not materially different.

             (3)  For the purposes of this section, circumstances are not **_materially different_** because of the fact that, because of the disability, the aggrieved person requires adjustments.

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Indirect disability discrimination

             (1)  For the purposes of this Act, a person (the **_discriminator_**) **_discriminates_** against another person (the **_aggrieved person_**) on the ground of a disability of the aggrieved person if:

                     (a)  the discriminator requires, or proposes to require, the aggrieved person to comply with a requirement or condition; and

                     (b)  because of the disability, the aggrieved person does not or would not comply, or is not able or would not be able to comply, with the requirement or condition; and

                     (c)  the requirement or condition has, or is likely to have, the effect of disadvantaging persons with the disability.

             (2)  For the purposes of this Act, a person (the **_discriminator_**) also **_discriminates_** against another person (the **_aggrieved person_**) on the ground of a disability of the aggrieved person if:

                     (a)  the discriminator requires, or proposes to require, the aggrieved person to comply with a requirement or condition; and

                     (b)  because of the disability, the aggrieved person would comply, or would be able to comply, with the requirement or condition only if the discriminator made reasonable adjustments for the person, but the discriminator does not do so or proposes not to do so; and

                     (c)  the failure to make reasonable adjustments has, or is likely to have, the effect of disadvantaging persons with the disability.

             (3)  Subsection (1) or (2) does not apply if the requirement or condition is reasonable, having regard to the circumstances of the case.

             (4)  For the purposes of subsection (3), the burden of proving that the requirement or condition is reasonable, having regard to the circumstances of the case, lies on the person who requires, or proposes to require, the person with the disability to comply with the requirement or condition.

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Discrimination in relation to associates

             (1)  This Act applies in relation to a person who has an associate with a disability in the same way as it applies in relation to a person with the disability.

Example:    It is unlawful, under section 15, for an employer to discriminate against an employee on the ground of a disability of any of the employee’s associates.

             (2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), but without limiting that subsection, this Act has effect in relation to a person who has an associate with a disability as if:

                     (a)  each reference to something being done or needed because of a disability were a reference to the thing being done or needed because of the fact that the person has an associate with the disability; and
