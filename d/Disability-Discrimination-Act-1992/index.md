_

The following amendments commence on <st1:date style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x" year="2005" day="1" month="9">1 September 2005</st1:date> unless proclaimed earlier:

## Schedule 1

## 1  Subsection 4(1)

Insert:

                     (a)  an educational authority; or

                     (b)  an educational institution; or

                     (c)  an organisation whose purpose is to develop or accredit curricula or training courses used by other education providers referred to in paragraph (a) or (b).

## 2  After subsection 22(2)

Insert:

          (2A)  It is unlawful for an education provider to discriminate against a person on the ground of the person’s disability or a disability of any of the person’s associates:

                     (a)  by developing curricula or training courses having a content that will either exclude the person from participation, or subject the person to any other detriment; or

## 3  Subsection 22(4)

Repeal the subsection, substitute:

## 4  After subsection 31(1)

          (1C)  For the avoidance of doubt, unjustifiable hardship does not excuse an education provider from complying with a requirement made by disability standards under subsection (1B). This does not affect (by implication) the operation of section 32 in relation to other contraventions of disability standards.
