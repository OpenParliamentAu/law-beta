known commitments of an Entitled Person will be taken into consideration in determining the capacity of an Entitled Person to meet the repayments; and

(b)   the Bank shall notify the Commonwealth at least thirty (30) days prior to affecting any such alteration to the Lending Criteria;

provided always that the Bank will treat Entitled Persons no less favourably than its other Housing Loan customers and that nothing in this Sub-clause shall affect the Bank's obligations under Sub-clause 5.9.

(d)   the fact that the Entitled Person has dealt, or is currently dealing, with another bank, building society or any other financial institution;

(e)   the sex, marital status, race, colour or religious beliefs of the Entitled Person; and

Where the Bank has rejected an application by an Entitled Person for a Subsidised Loan and the Entitled Person requests reasons for the rejection, the bank shall within seven (7) days provide reason in  writing for the rejection specifying why it considers the Lending Criteria have not been met.

5.11   Non-discrimination

The Bank agrees that it will not before, during or after repayment of a Subsidised Loan discriminate against or differentiate, other than as provided for in this Agreement, between persons who apply for Entitlement Certificates, Entitled Persons, Joint Borrowers and Subsidised Borrowers, and the Bank's other Housing Loan customers.

5.12   Security

(a)   the maximum rate of interest to be applied by the Bank to a Subsidised Loan shall be the Benchmark Rate;

(b)   the term of the Subsidised Loan shall be twenty five (25) years unless the Entitled Person or Subsidised Borrower  seeks a different term and the Bank agrees to such different term;

(c)   the amount of the Subsidised Loan shall be a sum within the range prescribed by the Act;

(d)   the loan shall be a credit foncier loan repayable by monthly instalments which instalments shall cover both principal and interest less the payments of Subsidy made to the Bank by the Commonwealth; and

(e)   payments of instalments are due on Rest Days.

5.13.2   The Commonwealth acknowledges that it shall be a term of a Subsidised Loan made by the Bank to an Entitled Person pursuant to Sub-clause 5.4 that if:

(a)   the Commonwealth declines to pay Subsidy in respect of the Subsidised Loan;

(b)   the Commonwealth at any time cancels pursuant to the Act Subsidy in respect of the Subsidised Loan for any reason; or

(c)   Subsidy stops being payable pursuant to the Act,

the loan shall thereafter not be a Subsidised Loan and the Bank shall thereafter not be bound by the Act or this Agreement in respect of the loan and may deal with the borrower as the Bank deals with its other Housing Loan customers. In particular, the Bank shall be entitled to charge the interest rate applicable to similar loans provided by the Bank to its other Housing Loan customers from the date Subsidy is declined or terminated.

5.13.3   Sub-clause 5.13.2 shall not apply for the reason only that Subsidy has been suspended under the Act.

5.14   Entitled Person to include **_spouse_** in certain cases.

(x)        “Securities” means the securities set out in Item 6 of the Schedule, and any other securities which may be held by the Bank hereafter in respect of all or any of the Applicant's liabilities to the Bank.

(xii)      Words herein used importing the singular shall include the plural and vice versa, and words importing the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders.

2.    Subject to Clause 3 hereof, interest shall accrue to the Bank for so long as the balance of the loan remains unpaid and shall be calculated at the Scheme rate applicable from time to time on the daily balance of the loan. Such interest shall be debited to the loan account on each interest day.

3.    (i)         The Applicant agrees that, during such period/s as the Bank is not in receipt of subsidy, interest accruing to the Bank pursuant to Clause 2 hereof shall be calculated at the current interest rate and the Bank may review the instalments payable pursuant to Clause 4 hereof in the manner provided for in sub-clauses 6 (ii) or 6 (iii) hereof.

(ii)        Paragraph (i) hereof shall not apply during such periods as the Bank is not in receipt of subsidy by reason only that subsidy has been suspended pursuant to the Scheme.

4.    The Applicant shall pay to the Bank the instalments set out in Item 3 of the Schedule or the instalments as varied pursuant Clause 6 hereof on the dates set out in Item 3 of the Schedule until the loan shall have been repaid and all interest and other money owing to the Bank hereunder shall have been paid, provided however, that the instalments payable by the Applicant pursuant to this clause shall be reduced by such amount as in necessary to reflect the amount of subsidy, if any, paid in respect of the loan.

6.    (i)         The following provision shall apply during such period/s as the Bank is in receipt of subsidy:—

                   Upon the anniversary of the final drawdown of the loan in   each year, or upon the fixing of a new Scheme rate, the Bank may review the instalments payable pursuant to Clause 4 hereof and the amount of each instalment payable thereafter may be varied by the Bank to ensure that the balance of the loan is repaid by instalments of equal amounts within the term of the loan set out in Item 2 of the Schedule or within such other period as may be agreed between the Bank and the Applicant. In the event that the Bank should so vary the amount of instalments, the Bank shall give one months notice to the Applicant of such variation.

(ii)        If no reference rate is set out in Item 3 of the Schedule, and the Bank is not in receipt of subsidy, then the following provision applies:—

Upon the fixing of a new current interest rate by the Bank, or debiting an annual insurance premium as set out in Item 7 of the Schedule, the amount of each instalment payable thereafter may be varied by the Bank notwithstanding that such variation may increase or decrease the term of the loan set out in Item 2 of the Schedule. In the event that the Bank should so vary the amount of instalments, the Bank shall give one months notice to the Applicant of such variation.

(iii)       If a reference rate is set out in Item 3 of the Schedule, and the Bank is not in receipt of subsidy, then the following provision applies:—

            Once during each year until the loan is repaid in full, the Bank will review the instalments payable pursuant to Clause 4 hereof. If the current interest rate at the date of the review exceeds the reference rate then fixed by the Bank such instalment will be increased by a rate equal to the difference between the current interest rate and such reference rate. The instalments may also be increased to provide for the debiting to the loan account of annual premium/s for insurance/s set out in Item 7 of the Schedule. The Bank shall give the Applicant one months notice of any variation to the instalment.

7.    The Applicant shall have the right, at any time, to repay the whole or any part of the balance of the loan, provided however, that any such repayment shall not reduce the amount of each instalment payable thereafter except by prior agreement with the Bank.

8.    (i)         The Applicant shall pay to the Bank on demand an application fee as set out in Item 5 of the Schedule.

(ii)        The Applicant shall pay a service fee calculated in accordance with the Bank’s scale current from time to time. Such service fee shall be debited to the loan account on the days adopted for this purpose from time to time by the Bank. The initial service fee is set out in Item 5 of the Schedule provided that the service fee may be varied by the Bank without notice to the Applicant.

(iii)       If the loan is not drawn before the expiration of three months from the date of approval of the application by the Bank, the Applicant shall pay a commitment fee as set out in Item 5 of the Schedule, being a percentage per annum of the amount of the loan undrawn, calculated on a daily basis from the date of approval until the loan is drawn, or in the case of a progressive loan, the first drawdown of the loan, provided that the Bank at its discretion may require the Applicant to pay the commitment fee on the undrawn instalments of such progressive loan until the loan is fully drawn. The commitment fee shall be paid upon drawdown of the loan or upon the final drawdown of the loan in case of a progressive loan.

9.    Notwithstanding Clause 8 (iii) hereof or the fact that a commitment fee may have been charged by the Bank if the Applicant does not avail of the loan or any part thereof within twelve months of the date of issue of the entitlement certificate (or, if no Entitlement Certificate is issued, within twelve (12) months of the date of approval of the loan) the Bank may thereafter at any time elect that it shall no longer be under any obligation to make the loan hereby applied for provided that the Bank shall give to the Applicant not less than one months notice of its intention to exercise such election and the Applicant shall have the right to draw the loan (subject to the terms and conditions) prior to the expiration of the period mentioned in such notice; provided always that if the Bank does elect not to make the loan it shall not affect the Applicant's right to apply for further loans under the Scheme or otherwise.

The Bank may debit all such costs, charges and expenses to the loan account so that the amounts thereof shall be included in the balance of the loan from time to time or may debit the same to the account nominated on the Home-Loan Application for debiting of instalments.

11.   Sub-clause 6.1 and sub-clause 6.2 of the agreement made between the Bank and the Commonwealth on 5th November 1990, a copy of which is set out in Schedule 1 of the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act 1990, are incorporated by reference herein for the purposes of Clause 8 and Clause 10 hereof.

12.   The balance of the loan together with interest and all fees and other moneys owing by the Applicant to the Bank shall be secured by the securities. The Applicant shall not be entitled to drawdown the loan or any part thereof until the Bank is satisfied that each security is properly executed and, where appropriate, is capable of registration.

13.   The Applicant shall set forth such information in a Home-Loan Application as the Bank may require.

14.   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary expressed or implied herein or in any other document whatsoever whether connected with the loan or with any other transaction and whether executed heretofore or hereafter the Applicant agrees with the Bank to pay the balance of the loan together with interest and all fees and other moneys owing by the Applicant to the Bank on the date upon which demand therefor in writing is made on the Applicant by the Bank after the occurrence of any one or more of the following events:—

(a)   default is made in the payment of any moneys on the  day upon which they become due and payable pursuant to the provisions hereof,

(e)   any mortgagee or encumbrancer of the land comprised in the security exercises or attempts to exercise any power by virtue of any default under the mortgage or encumbrance,

(f)    the Applicant without the written consent of the Bank (which may attach such terms or conditions to the giving of consent as it thinks fit) further mortgages, charges or otherwise further encumbers the land subject to the securities, or does or suffers to be done anything whereby any charge or liability becomes or might become imposed upon the land subject to the securities of any part or parts thereof, whether in priority to the securities or not or attempts so to do,

(g)   the Applicant without the written consent of the Bank (which may attach such terms or conditions to the giving of consent as it thinks fit) transfers, sells or leases or attempts to transfer, sell, lease or in any way parts with possession of the land subject to the securities or any part or parts thereof or attempts so to do, or alters, demolishes or removes any building thereon,

(h)   the Applicant without the written consent of the Bank (which may attach such terms or conditions to the giving of consent as it thinks fit) subdivides the land subject to the securities or any part or parts thereof or attempts so to do, or calls for an apportionment of the loan pursuant to the provisions of any statute, rule of law or equity,

(i)    any guarantor of the loan becomes bankrupt or assigns his estate for the benefit of his creditors or enters into a composition or arrangement with his creditors or in the case of a company goes into liquidation either voluntarily or compulsorily,

(j)    the Applicant becomes bankrupt or assigns his estate for the benefit of his creditors or enters into a composition or arrangement with his creditors or in the case of a company goes into liquidation either voluntarily or compulsorily,

(k)   any of the information supplied by the Applicant appearing in the Home-Loan Application is found to be false or, in the opinion of the Bank, is misleading, or

(l)    any of the information supplied by the Applicant in support of any application to the Commonwealth under the Scheme (including, but not limited to, information supplied in an application for an entitlement certificate or application for payment of subsidy) is found to be false.

15.   The Applicant agrees and acknowledges that during such period as the Bank is in receipt of subsidy in respect of the loan the Bank shall be bound to act in accordance with the Scheme and in particular the Applicant acknowledges and agrees that:

(a)   (i)  where an amount is incorrectly paid to the Bank by    the Commonwealth by way of subsidy, the Bank will, in accordance with the Scheme, pay to the Commonwealth an amount equal to the amount incorrectly paid (together with any interest thereon due under the Scheme) and any such payment will be debited to the loan account so that the amount thereof shall be included in the balance of the loan from time to time and shall be secured by the securities;

(ii)   where the Bank pays an amount to the Commonwealth under  sub-paragraph (i) hereof and such amount (or any part thereof) is reimbursed or refunded to the Bank by the Commonwealth pursuant to the Scheme, the Applicant will be indebted to the Commonwealth for such amount; and

(iii)   if the Applicant is indebted to the Commonwealth under the Scheme for any amount incorrectly paid to the Bank by the Commonwealth by way of subsidy and the Bank realises any securities over the property specified in Item 6 of the Schedule, then the Bank will from the proceeds of such realisation pay to the Commonwealth such amount as the Bank is required to pay under the Scheme in respect of the Applicant's indebtedness;

(b)   the Bank will provide the Commonwealth with copies of any documents or any other information in the possession or under the control of the Bank relating to the loan or application for loan or to the Scheme as may from time to time be requested by the Commonwealth pursuant to the Scheme or which the Bank is otherwise required to provide to the Commonwealth pursuant to the Scheme;

(c)   the Bank shall not be liable or responsible to the Applicant for any loss, damage or cost suffered or incurred by the Applicant (whether directly or indirectly) as a result of, or arising from, the operation of the Scheme except where such loss, damage or cost is attributable to failure by the Bank to act in accordance with the Scheme;

(d)   the Bank will not allow:

(i)    the name of the Applicant appearing on the loan account or on the securities to be changed from that appearing in the entitlement certificate; or

(ii)   a person to be joined to or separated from the loan account or securities,

unless the Bank agrees to such change and the Applicant obtains approval from the Commonwealth for such change;

(e) the Bank will not allow a property specified in Item 6 of the Schedule to be held on, or converted to, a tenancy in common.

16.   The Applicant acknowledges that the Commonwealth has sole responsibility for considering and approving any applications which the Applicant is required to make to the Commonwealth pursuant to the Scheme (including, but not limited to, applications for entitlement certificate and payment of subsidy) and for determining whether subsidy is payable or whether subsidy shall be cancelled or suspended.

17.   The Bank agrees to be bound by and act in accordance with the Scheme. The generality of this clause shall not be affected by any other provisions herein.

## Table A

### Application, saving or transitional provisions

_Defence Legislation amendment Act (No. 1) 1996 (No. 56, 1996)_

## Schedule 1

## 44  Application

(1)        The amendments made by items 5 to 13, 15, 16, 17 and 41 do not apply to a person who is a subsidised borrower on the day this item commences.

(2)        The amendments made by items 29 to 40 only apply in relation to the statutory training obligation of a person, who is a subsidised borrower on the day this item commences, that is commenced after that day.

* * *

_Defence Legislation Amendment (Enhancement of the Reserves and Modernisation) Act 2001 (No. 10, 2001)_

## Schedule 2

## 94  Saving—old regulations

(1)        Regulations that were in effect under any Act immediately before the commencement of this item continue to have effect after that time as if members of an arm of the Defence Force who were members of a particular part or component of that arm immediately before the commencement of this item were still members of that part or component after that time, even if that part or component no longer exists.

_Example: Assume that, immediately before the commencement of this item, regulations imposed training obligations on members of the Air Force Specialist Reserve. Those obligations would continue to apply to former members of that Reserve after commencement, even though the Air Force Specialist Reserve itself is no longer mentioned in the Air Force Act 1923 and the members have now become members of the Air Force Reserve._

(2)        However, regulations that continue in effect under this item do so only to the extent that they are not amended or revoked by later regulations.

## 95  Regulations about transitional matters

(1)        The regulations may make provision in relation to other saving and transitional matters in connection with the amendments made by this Schedule.

(2)        In particular, such regulations may deal with the status, after the commencement of the amendments, of persons who were members of the Defence Force immediately before that time.

(3)        Subitem (2) does not limit the scope of subitem (1).
