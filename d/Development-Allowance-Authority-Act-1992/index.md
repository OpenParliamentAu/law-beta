Do not delete : Division placeholder
3  Object
The object of this Chapter and the development allowance provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 is to provide tax incentives for investment in large Australian projects which cost $50 million or more and meet certain other criteria.
4  Simplified outline of scheme of Act
The following is a simplified outline of the scheme of this Chapter:
	(a)	an entity may apply for registration of plant expenditure incurred, or proposed to be incurred, by the entity in carrying out a project in Australia;
	(b)	the Development Allowance Authority (DAA) will register the expenditure if certain criteria are satisfied;
	(c)	if the expenditure is in respect of the acquisition or construction of plant—the DAA will issue a certificate pre-qualifying the expenditure for the tax incentive known as development allowance if:
	(i)	the expenditure has been registered; and
	(ii)	a substantial commitment to the completion of the project has occurred before 1 July 1996; and
	(iii)	certain other criteria are satisfied.
	(d)	if the expenditure is in respect of the lease of plant—the DAA will issue a certificate pre-qualifying the lessor’s expenditure for the tax incentive known as development allowance if:
	(i)	the lessee’s expenditure has been registered; and
	(ii)	a substantial commitment to the completion of the project has occurred before 1 July 1996; and
	(iii)	certain other criteria are satisfied.
5  Example of how this Chapter will work
[Typical example—new factory]
	(1)	This section sets out an example of how this Chapter will work in a typical case involving the establishment of a new factory.
NEW FACTORY

item of plant “A”

item of plant “B”

item of plant “C”

ancillary items of plant

[Step 1—proposal to establish a new factory]
	(2)	During the 3rd quarter of 1992, a manufacturing company develops a serious, commercially viable proposal to carry out a project consisting of the establishment of a new factory in Australia.  The project involves the company incurring expenditure in acquiring new plant for use in the factory.  The elements of the plant expenditure are:
major items of plant “A”, “B” and “C”, which are the main components of the production line; and
ancillary items of plant (such as light fittings, ventilation equipment and pollution control devices).
The factory will be used by the company to produce goods for sale. The company will derive assessable income from the sale of the manufactured goods.  Both the effective and nominal rates of industry assistance are less than 10%.  The total capital cost of the project (including the plant expenditure and the cost of constructing the factory building) is $65 million. The projected timetable for the project is as follows:
regulatory approvals obtained—March 1993
first contracts entered into—April/May 1993 
construction of factory commences—June 1993
plant installed in factory—May 1994
factory in operation—June 1994.
[Step 2—application for registration of plant expenditure]
	(3)	On 20 November 1992, the company applies to the DAA for registration of the plant expenditure proposed to be incurred by the company in carrying out the project.
[Step 3—grant of registration of plant expenditure]
	(4)	The DAA grants registration.  The registration is subject to a condition requiring the company to give to the DAA, before 1 July 1995, certified copies of the relevant regulatory approvals.
[Step 4—application for pre-qualifying certificate relating to plant expenditure]
	(5)	By October 1993, a substantial commitment to the completion of the project has occurred and the company has complied with the condition of the registration relating to the giving of certified copies of relevant regulatory approvals.  It is reasonably likely that the competitiveness test set out in Division 4 of Part 2 will be passed.  On 28 October 1993, the company applies to the DAA for a pre-qualifying certificate in relation to the registered plant expenditure.
[Step 5—grant of pre-qualifying certificate relating to plant expenditure]
	(6)	The DAA grants a pre-qualifying certificate relating to the plant expenditure.
[Step 6—tax effects of certificate]
	(7)	The pre-qualifying certificate pre-qualifies the plant expenditure for the tax incentive known as development allowance.

	(a)	in any case—the total expenditure of a capital nature incurred by the entity in respect of carrying out the project; and
	(b)	if:
	(i)	the entity has incurred other expenditure of a capital nature which is related directly or indirectly to the carrying out of the project; and
	(ii)	the DAA is satisfied that, because of special circumstances, it would be unreasonable not to treat the whole or a part of that other expenditure as gross capital expenditure incurred by the entity in respect of carrying out the project;
 		the whole, or the part, as the case may be, of that other expenditure.
[Leased plant—lessor’s capital expenditure attributed to lessee]
	(1A)	If:
	(a)	an entity incurs plant expenditure in carrying out a project; and
	(b)	the expenditure is incurred in respect of the lease of a new unit of plant under a long-term lease agreement where the lessor is a leasing company;
the expenditure of a capital nature incurred by the lessor in respect of the acquisition or construction by the lessor of the unit of plant is taken, for the purposes of subsection (1), to be expenditure of a capital nature incurred by the entity in respect of carrying out the project.
[Other leased property—lessor’s capital expenditure attributed to lessee]

	(a)	an entity incurs expenditure as a lessee in respect of the lease of property (other than plant) under a long-term lease agreement where the lessor is a leasing company; and
	(b)	assuming that the expenditure had been incurred by the entity in respect of the acquisition of the property instead of in respect of the lease of the property, the expenditure would have been expenditure of a capital nature incurred by the entity in respect of carrying out a project;
the expenditure of a capital nature incurred by the lessor in respect of the acquisition or construction by the lessor of the property is taken, for the purposes of subsection (1), to be expenditure of a capital nature incurred by the entity in respect of carrying out the project.
[Expenditure does not count if it fails the basic eligibility test]
	(2)	Subsection (1) does not apply to expenditure to the extent to which the expenditure fails the basic eligibility test.  Subsections (1A) and (1B) do not apply to expenditure incurred by the lessor to the extent to which the expenditure would have failed the basic eligibility test if it had been incurred by the entity in carrying out the project.
[Recouped expenditure does not count]
	(3)	Subsection (1) does not apply to expenditure if the entity is recouped, or becomes entitled to be recouped, in respect of the expenditure.  Subsections (1A) and (1B) do not apply to expenditure if the lessor is recouped, or becomes entitled to be recouped, in respect of the expenditure.
[Dissection of recoupment]
	(4)	If an entity receives, or becomes entitled to receive, an amount that constitutes to an unspecified extent a recoupment of expenditure, the DAA may, for the purposes of subsection (3), determine the extent to which that amount constitutes a recoupment of that expenditure.

	(5)	If the DAA is satisfied that:
	(a)	an entity has incurred expenditure in connection with a transaction where the parties to the transaction are not dealing with each other at arm’s length in relation to the transaction; and
	      (b)	the amount of the expenditure is greater or less than is reasonable;
the amount of the expenditure is taken, for the purposes of this section, to be the amount that would have been reasonable if the parties were dealing with each other at arm’s length.
Division 6—Substantial commitment to completion of a project
20  Substantial commitment to completion of a project—relevant factors
In determining whether a substantial commitment to the completion of a project has occurred, or is reasonably likely to occur, before a particular date, the DAA must have regard to:

Division 8—Prospective deduction test
22  Prospective deduction test
For the purposes of the application of this Chapter to expenditure incurred, or proposed to be incurred, by an entity in carrying out a project, the expenditure passes the prospective deduction test if the DAA is satisfied that, assuming that:
	(a)	the entity were to incur the expenditure and complete the carrying out of the project; and
	(b)	the DAA were to issue a certificate in the name of the entity in relation to the expenditure; and
	(c)	sections 82AC and 82AD of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and section 26-55 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 had not been enacted;
it is reasonably arguable that:
	(d)	to the extent that the expenditure is incurred in respect of the acquisition or construction of a new unit of plant—a deduction will be allowable to the entity under section 82AB of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 in respect of the expenditure; and
	(e)	to the extent that the expenditure is incurred in respect of the lease of a new unit of plant under a long-term lease agreement where the lessor is a leasing company—a deduction will be allowable to the leasing company under section 82AB of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 in respect of the expenditure of a capital nature incurred by the leasing company in respect of the acquisition or construction by the leasing company of the unit of plant.
23  Application of Tax Act to prospective deduction test
In applying the prospective deduction test, the DAA may make such assumptions as appear to the DAA to be reasonable about:
	(a)	the exercise by the Commissioner of Taxation of any power conferred by:
	(i)	Part IVA of the Tax Act (which deals with tax avoidance schemes); and

[When expenditure incurred in carrying out a project]
	(2)	For the purposes of this Chapter, in testing whether the expenditure is incurred, or proposed to be incurred, in carrying out a project, it is to be assumed that the entity had incurred, or proposed to incur, the expenditure in respect of the acquisition of the unit of plant instead of in respect of the lease of the unit of plant.
[Periodic lease payments deemed to be incurred when earliest payment incurred]
	(3)	For the purposes of this Chapter, if, apart from this subsection, the expenditure is incurred on a periodic basis, all of the expenditure is taken to have been incurred at the earliest time at which any of the expenditure was incurred.
Division 12—Proposal to incur plant expenditure in carrying out a project counts even if no decision made about whether to acquire, construct or lease the plant
25B  Proposal to incur plant expenditure in carrying out a project counts even if no decision made about whether to acquire, construct or lease the plant
	(1)	For the purposes of this Chapter, a proposal to incur plant expenditure in carrying out a project counts even if the entity concerned has not decided whether to acquire, construct or lease the unit or units of plant.
	(2)	The expression “as the case may be” may be used in a document under this Act to denote such a state of indecision.  For example, “expenditure proposed to be incurred in respect of the acquisition, construction or lease, as the case may be, of the new units of plant described in Part A of the Schedule to this [document]”.

Chapter 3—Infrastructure Borrowings
Part 1—Preliminary
Do not delete : Division placeholder
93A  Object
The object of this Chapter and the infrastructure borrowings provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 is to provide tax incentives for genuine private sector investment in publicly accessible infrastructure facilities and related facilities. However, the incentives have been terminated for new cases by the Taxation Laws Amendment (Infrastructure Borrowings) Act 1997.
93B  Simplified outline of scheme of Chapter
The following is a simplified outline of the scheme of this Chapter:
	(a)	a person may apply to the Development Allowance Authority (the DAA) for the issue of a certificate in relation to a proposed borrowing that the person considers to be an infrastructure borrowing;
Note:	As a result of amendments made by the Taxation Laws Amendment (Infrastructure Borrowings) Act 1997, no new applications can be made.
	(b)	the DAA will issue the certificate if it is satisfied that the borrowing is an infrastructure borrowing and that certain other criteria are met;
	(c)	it is a condition of the issue of the certificate that the holder must use the money borrowed in the way proposed in the person’s application and must comply with certain other requirements;
	(d)	if the certificate holder wishes to transfer to another person all of its interests and liabilities in relation to the borrowing or any facilities acquired or constructed with the money borrowed and certain criteria are met, the DAA must agree to transfer the certificate;
	(e)	the DAA may cancel the certificate if the conditions applying to it are contravened, or if the holder fails to comply with certain other requirements of the Chapter. In such a case, the holder will be liable to pay an amount that recoups some or all of the tax benefits of the certificate.
93C  Example of how this Chapter works
[Typical example—borrowing to finance a tollway]
	(1)	This section sets out an example of how this Chapter works in a typical case involving a borrowing to construct a tollway.
[Step 1—proposal]
	(2)	By December 1994, a non-exempt public company has developed a proposal to construct a tollway in Australia that it intends to operate for at least 25 years after it becomes income-producing. The estimated cost of the tollway is $600 million, of which the company intends to borrow $400 million by a public bond issue at 8% per annum over 10 years. The company intends to build the tollway in 2 stages:
stage 1, commencing in November 1995 and continuing until November 1998, involving the major earthworks 
stage 2, commencing in February 1999 and ending at the end of 2001, involving construction of bridges, road pavement, stabilisation of embankments and construction of related facilities for toll collection and other staff.
[Step 2—application to DAA]
	(3)	 In January 1995, the company applies to the DAA for the issue of a certificate in relation to the borrowing. The application sets out details of the proposed borrowing and expenditure and other relevant matters.
[Step 3—action by DAA]
	(4)	The DAA considers the application and determines that the criteria in the Chapter for the issue of a certificate are met. (The criteria relate to such things as the nature of the borrower and the facility, and the proposed public use and charging regime.)
[Step 4—issue of certificate]
	(5)	In March 1995, the applicant gives the DAA an undertaking that it will comply with its obligations if the certificate is issued, and the DAA issues the certificate.
[Step 5—the bond issue]
	(6)	The bond issue takes place in May 1995. Interest paid to bond holders is exempt from income tax or rebatable. The interest is not an allowable deduction for the company.
[Completion and operation of tollway]
	(7)	The borrowing, construction and use of the tollway all go ahead as planned.
