\[Step 1proposal to establish a new factory]
<dt>(2)</dt><dd>During the 3rd quarter of 1992, a manufacturing company develops a

serious, commercially viable proposal to carry out a project consisting of the

establishment of a new factory in Australia.  The project involves the company

incurring expenditure in acquiring new plant for use in the factory.  The

elements of the plant expenditure are:</dd> *	major items of plant "A", "B" and "C", which are the main components of the production line; and *	ancillary items of plant (such as light fittings, ventilation equipment and pollution control devices).  
*	regulatory approvals obtained&#151;March 1993 *	first contracts entered into&#151;April/May 1993  *	construction of factory commences&#151;June 1993 *	plant installed in factory&#151;May 1994 *	factory in operation&#151;June 1994\.

\[Step 2application for registration of plant expenditure]
<dt>(3)</dt><dd>On 20 November 1992, the company applies to the DAA for registration of

the plant expenditure proposed to be incurred by the company in carrying out

the project.

</dd> 
\[Step 3grant of registration of plant expenditure]
<dt>(4)</dt><dd>The DAA grants registration.  The registration is subject to a condition

requiring the company to give to the DAA, before 1 July 1995, certified copies

of the relevant regulatory approvals.

</dd> 
\[Step 4application for pre-qualifying certificate relating to plant expenditure]
<dt>(5)</dt><dd>By October 1993, a substantial commitment to the completion of the project

has occurred and the company has complied with the condition of the

registration relating to the giving of certified copies of relevant regulatory

approvals.  It is reasonably likely that the competitiveness test set out in

Division 4 of Part 2 will be passed.  On 28 October 1993, the company applies

to the DAA for a pre-qualifying certificate in relation to the registered plant

expenditure.

</dd> 
\[Step 5grant of pre-qualifying certificate relating to plant expenditure]
<dt>(6)</dt><dd>The DAA grants a pre-qualifying certificate relating to the plant

expenditure.

</dd> 
\[Step 6tax effects of certificate]
<dt>(7)</dt><dd>The pre-qualifying certificate pre-qualifies the plant expenditure for the

tax incentive known as development allowance.

###  DEVELOPMENT ALLOWANCE AUTHORITY ACT 1992- SECT 93A  Object 
**

 <dl compact="">

		The object of this Chapter and the infrastructure borrowings provisions of

the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ is to provide tax incentives for

genuine private sector investment in publicly accessible infrastructure

facilities and related facilities. However, the incentives have been terminated

for new cases by the _Taxation Laws Amendment (Infrastructure Borrowings) Act 1997_.

 </dl>

**

###  DEVELOPMENT ALLOWANCE AUTHORITY ACT 1992- SECT 93B  Simplified outline of scheme of Chapter 
**

 <dl compact="">

		The following is a simplified outline of the scheme of this Chapter:

 </dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>a person may apply to the Development Allowance Authority (the

_DAA_) for the issue of a certificate in relation to a proposed

borrowing that the person considers to be an infrastructure borrowing;

Note:	As a result of amendments made by the _Taxation Laws Amendment (Infrastructure Borrowings) Act 1997_, no new applications can be made.

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>the DAA will issue the certificate if it is satisfied that the borrowing

is an infrastructure borrowing and that certain other criteria are met;</dd>

the money borrowed in the way proposed in the person's application and must

comply with certain other requirements;</dd>

<dt>(d)</dt><dd>if the certificate holder wishes to transfer to another person all of its

interests and liabilities in relation to the borrowing or any facilities

acquired or constructed with the money borrowed and certain criteria are met,

the DAA must agree to transfer the certificate;</dd>

<dt>(e)</dt><dd>the DAA may cancel the certificate if the conditions applying to it are

contravened, or if the holder fails to comply with certain other requirements

of the Chapter. In such a case, the holder will be liable to pay an amount that

recoups some or all of the tax benefits of the certificate.

###  DEVELOPMENT ALLOWANCE AUTHORITY ACT 1992- SECT 93C  Example of how this Chapter works 
**

 _\[Typical exampleborrowing to finance a tollway]_

<dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>This section sets out an example of how this Chapter works in a typical

case involving a borrowing to construct a tollway.

</dd> </dl>

_\[Step 1proposal]_

<dl compact="">

<dt>(2)</dt><dd>By December 1994, a non-exempt public company has developed a proposal to

construct a tollway in Australia that it intends to operate for at least 25

years after it becomes income-producing. The estimated cost of the tollway is

$600 million, of which the company intends to borrow $400 million by a public

bond issue at 8% per annum over 10 years. The company intends to build the

tollway in 2 stages:</dd> *	stage 1, commencing in November 1995 and continuing until November 1998, involving the major earthworks  *	stage 2, commencing in February 1999 and ending at the end of 2001, involving construction of bridges, road pavement, stabilisation of embankments and construction of related facilities for toll collection and other staff.  </dl>

_\[Step 2application to DAA]_

<dl compact="">

<dt>(3)</dt><dd>In January 1995, the company applies to the DAA for the issue of a

certificate in relation to the borrowing. The application sets out details of

the proposed borrowing and expenditure and other relevant matters.

</dd> </dl>

_\[Step 3action by DAA]_

<dl compact="">

<dt>(4)</dt><dd>The DAA considers the application and determines that the criteria in the

Chapter for the issue of a certificate are met. (The criteria relate to such

things as the nature of the borrower and the facility, and the proposed public

use and charging regime.)

</dd> </dl>

_\[Step 4issue of certificate]_

<dl compact="">

<dt>(5)</dt><dd>In March 1995, the applicant gives the DAA an undertaking that it will

comply with its obligations if the certificate is issued, and the DAA issues

the certificate.

</dd> </dl>

_\[Step 5the bond issue]_

<dl compact="">

<dt>(6)</dt><dd>The bond issue takes place in May 1995\. Interest paid to bond holders is

exempt from income tax or rebatable. The interest is not an allowable deduction

for the company.

</dd> </dl>

_\[Completion and operation of tollway]_

<dl compact="">

<dt>(7)</dt><dd>The borrowing, construction and use of the tollway all go ahead as planned.
