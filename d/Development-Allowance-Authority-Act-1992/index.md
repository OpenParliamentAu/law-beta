# Chapter 3—Infrastructure borrowings

## Part 1—Preliminary

##### <a id="93A"></a>93A  Object

                   The object of this Chapter and the infrastructure borrowings provisions of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ is to provide tax incentives for genuine private sector investment in publicly accessible infrastructure facilities and related facilities. However, the incentives have been terminated for new cases by the _Taxation Laws Amendment (Infrastructure Borrowings) Act 1997_.

##### <a id="93B"></a>93B  Simplified outline of scheme of Chapter

                   The following is a simplified outline of the scheme of this Chapter:

                     (a)  a person may apply to the Development Allowance Authority (the **_DAA_**) for the issue of a certificate in relation to a proposed borrowing that the person considers to be an infrastructure borrowing;

Note:       As a result of amendments made by the _Taxation Laws Amendment (Infrastructure Borrowings) Act 1997_, no new applications can be made.

                     (b)  the DAA will issue the certificate if it is satisfied that the borrowing is an infrastructure borrowing and that certain other criteria are met;

                     (c)  it is a condition of the issue of the certificate that the holder must use the money borrowed in the way proposed in the person’s application and must comply with certain other requirements;

                     (d)  if the certificate holder wishes to transfer to another person all of its interests and liabilities in relation to the borrowing or any facilities acquired or constructed with the money borrowed and certain criteria are met, the DAA must agree to transfer the certificate;

                     (e)  the DAA may cancel the certificate if the conditions applying to it are contravened, or if the holder fails to comply with certain other requirements of the Chapter. In such a case, the holder will be liable to pay an amount that recoups some or all of the tax benefits of the certificate.

##### <a id="93C"></a>93C  Example of how this Chapter works

\[Typical example—borrowing to finance a tollway]

             (1)  This section sets out an example of how this Chapter works in a typical case involving a borrowing to construct a tollway.

\[Step 1—proposal]

             (2)  By December 1994, a non-exempt public company has developed a proposal to construct a tollway in Australia that it intends to operate for at least 25 years after it becomes income-producing. The estimated cost of the tollway is $600 million, of which the company intends to borrow $400 million by a public bond issue at 8% per annum over 10 years. The company intends to build the tollway in 2 stages:

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">         </span>stage 1, commencing in November 1995 and continuing until November 1998, involving the major earthworks 

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">         </span>stage 2, commencing in February 1999 and ending at the end of 2001, involving construction of bridges, road pavement, stabilisation of embankments and construction of related facilities for toll collection and other staff.

\[Step 2—application to DAA]

             (3)   In January 1995, the company applies to the DAA for the issue of a certificate in relation to the borrowing. The application sets out details of the proposed borrowing and expenditure and other relevant matters.

\[Step 3—action by DAA]

             (4)  The DAA considers the application and determines that the criteria in the Chapter for the issue of a certificate are met. (The criteria relate to such things as the nature of the borrower and the facility, and the proposed public use and charging regime.)

\[Step 4—issue of certificate]

             (5)  In March 1995, the applicant gives the DAA an undertaking that it will comply with its obligations if the certificate is issued, and the DAA issues the certificate.

\[Step 5—the bond issue]

             (6)  The bond issue takes place in May 1995\. Interest paid to bond holders is exempt from income tax or rebatable. The interest is not an allowable deduction for the company.

\[Completion and operation of tollway]

             (7)  The borrowing, construction and use of the tollway all go ahead as planned.

                     (a)  the direct infrastructure borrowing or the indirect infrastructure borrowing, as the case may be; or

                     (b)  another refinancing infrastructure borrowing that, under a previous application of this subsection, relates to the direct infrastructure borrowing or the indirect infrastructure borrowing, as the case may be.

##### <a id="93I"></a>93I  Infrastructure borrowings—borrower requirements

\[Borrower requirements]

             (1)  For a borrowing to be an infrastructure borrowing, the requirements of this section must be met.

\[Basic requirements]

             (2)  The borrower must:

                     (a)  be:

                              (i)  in any case—an incorporated body (not in the capacity of trustee) at the time of the borrowing or a corporate limited partnership (not in the capacity of trustee) in relation to the year of income in which the borrowing takes place; or

                             (ii)  in the case of a direct infrastructure borrowing or a refinancing infrastructure borrowing that relates to a direct infrastructure borrowing—a corporate unit trust (within the meaning of section 102J of the Tax Act), or a public trading trust (within the meaning of section 102R of the Tax Act), in relation to the year of income in which the borrowing takes place; and

                     (b)  where the borrower is an incorporated body or a corporate limited partnership and the borrowing is a direct infrastructure borrowing or a refinancing infrastructure borrowing that relates to such a direct infrastructure borrowing—at the time of the borrowing, intend to be an incorporated body (not in the capacity of trustee) throughout the borrower requirement period, or a corporate limited partnership (not in the capacity of trustee) throughout each year of income in which any part of the borrower requirement period occurs; and

                     (c)  where the borrower is a trust to which subparagraph (a)(ii) applies—at the time of the borrowing, intend to be such a trust in relation to each year of income in which any part of the borrower requirement period occurs; and

Nature of determination

             (2)  After receiving the request, the Commissioner must determine whether or not, if the conditions are varied in accordance with the application, there is likely to be, as a result of the variation, a reduction in the sum of the present values (worked out when the Commissioner makes the determination) of all amounts of tax that have or may become payable, under Acts of which the Commissioner of Taxation has the general administration, by the persons whose liability to tax may be affected by the variation.

Commissioner to advise of determination

             (2)  After receiving the request, the Commissioner must advise the DAA and the person who applied for the variation, in writing, of the determination that the Commissioner would have made under subsection 93TA(2) (assuming that section 93TA had been in force at the time) if the DAA had requested the Commissioner to make a determination in relation to the variation of the conditions immediately before they were varied. 

Application of subsections 93TA(3) and (6) etc.

             (3)  Subsections 93TA(3) and (6), and Part IVC of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_, apply in the same way to the Commissioner’s advice as they do to a determination under subsection 93TA(2).

Effect of advice

             (4)  If the Commissioner advises that he or she would have determined that there was likely to be a reduction of the kind mentioned in subsection 93TA(2), the variation of the conditions has no effect, and is taken never to have had any effect.

Except as mentioned in items 2 and 3, the repeals and amendments made by Schedules 1 and 2 apply:

                     (a)  so far as they affect assessments—to assessments for the 2006-07 income year and all later income years; and

                     (b)  otherwise—to acts done or omitted to be done, or states of affairs existing, after the commencement of the repeals and amendments.

## 6  Object

The object of this Part is to ensure that, despite the repeals and amendments made by this Act, the full legal and administrative consequences of:

                     (a)  any act done or omitted to be done; or

                     (b)  any state of affairs existing; or

                     (c)  any period ending;

before such a repeal or amendment applies, can continue to arise and be carried out, directly or indirectly through an indefinite number of steps, even if some or all of those steps are taken after the repeal or amendment applies.

## 7  Making and amending assessments, and doing other things, in relation to past matters

Even though an Act is repealed or amended by this Act, the repeal or amendment is disregarded for the purpose of doing any of the following under any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_):

                     (a)  making or amending an assessment (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

                     (b)  exercising any right or power, performing any obligation or duty or doing any other thing (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

Example 1: On 31 July 1999, Greg Ltd lodged its annual return under former section 160ARE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The return stated that the company had a credit on its franking account and that no franking deficit tax was payable for the 1998-99 franking year. Under former section 160ARH of that Act, the Commissioner was taken to have made an assessment consistent with the return.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of Part IIIAA of that Act, the Commissioner concludes that Greg Ltd fraudulently overfranked dividends it paid during the 1998-99 franking year, and had a franking account deficit for that franking year. As a result, the Commissioner considers that franking deficit tax and a penalty by way of additional tax are payable.

                   The Commissioner can amend the assessment under former section 160ARN of that Act, because item 7 of this Schedule disregards the repeal of that section for the purposes of making an assessment in relation to the 1998-99 franking year. Item 7 will also disregard the repeal of Division 11 of former Part IIIAA to the extent necessary for the Commissioner to assess Greg Ltd’s liability to a penalty by way of additional tax.

                   Despite the repeal of sections 160ARU and 160ARV, item 9 will ensure that the general interest charge will accrue on the unpaid franking deficit tax and penalty until they are paid.

                   Item 7 will also preserve Greg Ltd’s right, under former section 160ART of that Act, to object against the Commissioner’s amended assessment (including the penalty), since the objection is the exercise of a right in relation to a franking year that ended before the repeal of Part IIIAA.

Example 2: During the 1997-98 income year, Duffy Property Ltd withheld amounts from its employees’ wages as required by former Divisions 1AAA and 2 of Part VI of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The company failed to notify the Commissioner of those amounts, and failed to remit them to the Commissioner.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of those Divisions, the Commissioner discovers that the withheld amounts have not been remitted. The company’s records are incomplete and the Commissioner is unable to completely ascertain the extent of its liability for the withheld amounts. Under section 222AGA of that Act, the Commissioner makes an estimate of the liability.

                   Item 7 will disregard the repeal of section 220AAZA of that Act (which empowered the Commissioner to recover the amount of the estimate). Even though the estimate is made after the repeal, it relates to amounts withheld before the repeal.

## 8  Saving of provisions about effect of assessments

If a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act deals with the effect of an assessment, the repeal or amendment is disregarded in relation to assessments made, before or after the repeal or amendment applies, in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

## 9  Saving of provisions about general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty

If:

                     (a)  a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act provides for the payment of:

                              (i)  general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty (all within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_); or

                             (ii)  interest under the _Taxation (Interest on Overpayments and Early Payments) Act 1983_; and

                     (b)  in a particular case, the period in respect of which the charge, penalty or interest is payable (whether under the provision or under the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_) has not begun, or has begun but not ended, when the provision is repealed or amended;

then, despite the repeal or amendment, the provision or part continues to apply in the particular case until the end of the period.

## 10  Repeals disregarded for the purposes of dependent provisions

If the operation of a provision (the **_subject provision_**) of any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_) made under any Act depends to any extent on an Act, or a provision of an Act, that is repealed by this Act, the repeal is disregarded so far as it affects the operation of the subject provision.

## 11  Schedule does not limit operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_

This Schedule does not limit the operation of section 8 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.
