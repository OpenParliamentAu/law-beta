                     (a)  an intention to permanently deprive the person so entitled of the property or proceeds; and

                     (b)  an appropriation of the property or proceeds without the consent of the person entitled to restoration.

             (3)  For the purposes of this section, a **_fundamental mistake_** is:

                     (a)  a mistake about the identity of the person getting the property; or

                     (b)  a mistake as to the essential nature of the property; or

                     (c)  a mistake about the amount of any money if the person getting the money is aware of the mistake at the time of getting the money.

the person has the intention of permanently depriving the other of it.

             (2)  For the purposes of this section, a borrowing or lending of a thing amounts to treating the thing as the borrower’s or lender’s own to dispose of regardless of another’s rights if, and only if, the borrowing or lending is for a period and in circumstances making it equivalent to an outright taking or disposal.

             (3)  For the purposes of this section, if:

             (4)  Nothing in this section shall be taken to affect the operation of section 95A or 178A.

##### <a id="101Q"></a>101Q  Medical examinations

             (1)  An investigating officer may arrange for a medical practitioner to examine a person in lawful custody in respect of a service offence for the purpose of securing evidence of, or relating to, the service offence if, and only if, the investigating officer believes on reasonable grounds that the examination is likely to provide such evidence and:

                     (a)  the person has given his or her consent in writing; or

                     (b)  an authorized officer has, under subsection (4), approved the examination.

             (2)  An investigating officer may arrange for a medical practitioner to take a specimen from a person in lawful custody in respect of a service offence for the purpose of having the specimen analysed or otherwise examined if, and only if, the investigating officer believes on reasonable grounds that analysis or other examination of the specimen is likely to provide evidence of, or relating to, the service offence and:

                     (a)  the person has given his or her consent in writing; or

                     (b)  an authorized officer has, under subsection (4), approved the taking of the specimen.

          (4A)  The authority conferred by subsection (4) on an authorised officer only extends to the giving of approval in respect of a medical examination of a kind, or the taking of a specimen, that is reasonably necessary for the purpose of obtaining evidence relating to the presence or absence of a narcotic substance in the blood or urine of a person.

          (4B)  In subsection (4A), **_narcotic substance_** has the same meaning as in the _Customs Act 1901_.

             (6)  Before arranging for a medical practitioner to examine a person in lawful custody or to take a specimen from such a person, an investigating officer shall inquire whether the person wishes to have a medical practitioner of the person’s choice present during the examination or the taking of the specimen, as the case may be, and, if the person states that the person does so wish, shall:

                     (a)  provide reasonable facilities to enable the person to arrange for a medical practitioner of the person’s choice to be so present; and

                     (b)  unless it would be impracticable to do so—arrange for the examination to be made or the specimen to be taken, as the case may be, at a time when the medical practitioner chosen by the person can be present.

             (7)  Subsection (6) does not apply in relation to a person in custody in respect of a service offence where an investigating officer believes on reasonable grounds that, if the examination of the person or the taking of a specimen from the person, as the case requires, is delayed until a time when a medical practitioner chosen by the person can be present, evidence of, or relating to, the service offence may be lost or destroyed or may otherwise disappear.

             (8)  An investigating officer may use such reasonable force as is necessary to take a person to a medical practitioner for the purpose of an examination of the person in accordance with subsection (1) or the taking of a specimen from the person in accordance with subsection (2), as the case requires.

                              (i)  within a period of 12 months after the examination is made or the specimen is taken, as the case may be; or

                             (ii)  if that period is extended under subsection (10)—within that period as from time to time so extended; or

                     (b)  proceedings in respect of the service offence, or a related service offence, are instituted within that period, but a service tribunal acquits the person of a charge of the service offence, or a related service offence, or dismisses such a charge;

the person having the custody of the report of the examination or the report of the analysis or other examination of the specimen, as the case may be, and any investigating officer having the custody of a copy of such a report, shall cause it to be destroyed.

           (10)  An authorized officer may, upon application by a person having the custody of the report of an examination by a medical practitioner of a person in lawful custody in respect of a service offence, or of the report of an analysis or other examination of a specimen taken from such a person, or by an investigating officer having the custody of a copy of such a report, and upon being satisfied, by information on oath or affirmation, that there are special reasons for doing so, extend, in respect of the examination or the analysis or other examination of the specimen, as the case may be, the period referred to in subparagraph (9)(a)(i), or that period as previously extended under this subsection.

           (11)  Where a person in lawful custody in respect of a service offence is examined by a medical practitioner in accordance with subsection (1), or a specimen is taken from such a person in accordance with subsection (2), an investigating officer concerned in the investigation of the service offence, shall, upon application by the person, cause the person to be provided with a copy of the report of the medical practitioner in respect of the examination or the report of the analysis or other examination of the specimen, as the case may be.

           (12)  Where a medical practitioner makes an examination of a person, or takes a specimen from a person, in pursuance of arrangements duly made, or purporting to be duly made, by an investigating officer under this section, proceedings do not lie against the medical practitioner, or against any other person acting under his or her direction or otherwise assisting him or her, in respect of anything reasonably done in good faith by the medical practitioner or by the other person for the purpose of making the examination or taking the specimen, as the case may be.

           (13)  Nothing in this section:

                     (a)  prevents a medical practitioner from examining, or taking a specimen from, a person at the request of the person or for the purpose of treating the person for illness or an injury; or

                     (b)  affects the power of a service tribunal or, in the case of a court martial, the judge advocate of the court martial, to exclude evidence obtained through unreasonable force or inhuman treatment.

           (14)  In this section, **_specimen_**, in relation to a person, includes a sample of, or taken from, the body of the person.

           (15)  In the application of this section to a person who is in custody at a place outside Australia, a reference to a medical practitioner includes a reference to a person who is registered or licensed as a medical practitioner under:

                     (a)  a law of that place; or

                     (b)  a law of a prescribed place;

being a law that provides for the registration or licensing of medical practitioners.

##### <a id="101ZB"></a>101ZB  Exclusion of evidence illegally obtained

             (1)  Where, in proceedings before a service tribunal in respect of a service offence, upon objection being taken to the admission of evidence on the ground that the evidence was obtained in contravention of, or in consequence of a contravention of, a provision of this Part, the service tribunal or, in the case of a court martial, the judge advocate of the court martial, is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities but having regard to any provision of this Act or the regulations relating to proof of particular matters, that the evidence was so obtained, the service tribunal or judge advocate must not admit the evidence unless the service tribunal or judge advocate is of the opinion that:

                     (a)  admission of the evidence would substantially benefit the public interest in the administration of justice; and

                     (b)  this benefit would outweigh any prejudice to the rights and freedoms of any person, including the accused person, that has occurred, or is likely to occur, as a result of the contravention or the admission of the evidence.

             (2)  The matters that the service tribunal or judge advocate may have regard to in deciding whether to admit the evidence include:

                     (b)  the nature and seriousness of the contravention;

                     (d)  the effect (if any) of the contravention on the cogency of the evidence so obtained; and

                     (e)  the extent to which the evidence might have been obtainable lawfully.

             (3)  This section is in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other law or rule under which a service tribunal or, in the case of a court martial, the judge advocate of the court martial, may refuse to admit evidence.

             (4)  Subsection (3) shall not be taken to authorize a service tribunal or judge advocate, in proceedings in respect of a service offence, to refuse to admit a statement in evidence on the ground that an investigating officer contravened the rules known as the Judge’s Rules.

                     (a)  as biased; or

in relation to the trial of an accused person merely because the summary authority is the commanding officer of the accused person.

                              (i)  a service offence that is an alternative offence, within the meaning of section 142, in relation to the original offence; or

                             (ii)  a service offence with which the person was charged in the alternative and in respect of which the service tribunal did not record a finding; and

                     (b)  that the service tribunal, by reason of the finding of the service tribunal finding that the person was guilty of the original offence, must have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of facts that prove that the person was guilty of the other offence;

the reviewing authority may substitute for the conviction of the original offence a conviction of the other offence.

             (2)  Where under subsection (1) a reviewing authority substitutes for the conviction of the original offence a conviction of another service offence, the reviewing authority may take such action in relation to the convicted person as could have been taken under Part IV by the service tribunal that convicted the convicted person of the original offence if that service tribunal had convicted him or her of that other service offence, but the reviewing authority:

                     (a)  shall not impose a punishment for that other service offence or make a reparation order with respect to that other service offence unless a punishment was imposed for the original offence or a reparation order was made with respect to the original offence, as the case may be; and

             (7)  Section 72 applies in relation to the fixing of a non-parole period under subsection (6) as if the reviewing authority were the service tribunal concerned.

             (8)  Where in a review it appears to the reviewing authority that a service tribunal that has imposed a punishment of detention on a convicted person should have made an order under subsection 78(1) suspending that punishment, the reviewing authority may, if he or she thinks fit, make an order suspending that punishment or such part of that punishment as has not been served.

             (9)  Where a reviewing authority makes an order suspending a punishment of detention or such part of a punishment of detention as has not been served, the punishment, or that part of the punishment, does not begin, and shall not be put into execution, while the suspension is in force.
