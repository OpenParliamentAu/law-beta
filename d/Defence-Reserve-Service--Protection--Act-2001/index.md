## An Act to protect members of the Reserves in their employment and education, to facilitate their return to civilian life, and for related purposes

## Part 1—Introduction

##### <a id="1"></a>1  Short title [_see_ Note 1]

                   This Act may be cited as the _Defence Reserve Service (Protection) Act 2001_.

##### <a id="2"></a>2  Commencement [_see_ Note 1]

                   This Act commences on the 28th day after the day on which it receives the Royal Assent.

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Overview of the Act

             (1)  The following is a simplified overview of the Act.

             (2)  This Act sets out entitlements and prohibitions that apply in relation to people who are rendering, or have rendered, defence service as members of the Reserves. In some cases, the entitlements extend to their dependants.

             (3)  The kind of defence service rendered by a particular member determines the scope of the prohibitions and entitlements available in relation to him or her: see Part 3.

             (4)  Part 4 contains prohibitions against conduct that discriminates against members in their employment or other work. This Part applies to all types of defence service.

             (5)  Part 5 sets out the consequences for a member’s employment if he or she was employed when he or she started to render defence service. This Part applies to all kinds of defence service (except for certain kinds of voluntary continuous full time service).

             (6)  Part 6 protects members from having their partnerships dissolved while the members are absent on defence service. This Part applies to all kinds of defence service (except for certain kinds of voluntary continuous full time service).

             (7)  Part 7 allows a member to re-enrol in, and resume, a course that the member had to interrupt in order to undertake continuous full time defence service (except for certain kinds of voluntary continuous full time service).

             (8)  Part 8 postpones debts that a member (or his or her dependant) is liable to pay and that would otherwise fall due after the member starts rendering defence service as a result of being called out. Interest accrues on the postponed debts. Part 8 also stays proceedings in respect of the postponed debts.

             (9)  Part 9 protects a member or his or her dependant from bankruptcy proceedings. It applies only if the member has rendered defence service after being called out.

           (10)  Part 10 allows for a member who has rendered defence service after being called out to get access to loans and guarantees to enable him or her to resume civilian life after returning from that service.

           (11)  Part 11 deals with enforcement and remedies. Part 12 deals with minor miscellaneous matters.

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Act binds the Crown

             (1)  This Act binds the Crown in each of its capacities.

             (2)  In particular, obligations that this Act imposes on employers or other persons (however described) are imposed on the Crown just as they are imposed on everyone else.

             (3)  However, this Act does not make the Crown liable to be prosecuted for an offence.

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Application of _Criminal Code_

                   The _Criminal Code_ applies to all offences against this Act.

Note:          Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Defence service following voluntary undertaking

             (1)  Parts 5, 6 and 7 do not apply in relation to continuous full time service that a member voluntarily undertook to render under subsection 32A(3) of the _Naval Defence Act 1910_, subsection 50(3) of the _Defence Act 1903_ or subsection 4J(3) of the _Air Force Act 1923_ unless:

                     (a)  a service chief requested the member to give the undertaking on the basis that those Parts would apply to the service; and

                     (b)  the member gave the undertaking on that basis.

             (2)  In deciding whether to request a member to give an undertaking on that basis, a service chief must have regard to:

                     (a)  the nature of the service to be rendered; and

                     (b)  the member’s military and civil skills and capabilities; and

                     (c)  the current need of the Defence Force for the member’s skills and capabilities; and

                     (d)  the effect that rendering the service might have on the member’s employment and education (including the effect that it might have on third parties such as employers); and

                     (e)  any other relevant matter.

##### <a id="13"></a>13  Continuous full time service following a call out

                   Parts 8, 9 and 10 apply only in relation to continuous full time service that a member is rendering, or has rendered, as a result of an order under section 50D, 51A, 51AA, 51AB, 51B, 51C or 51CA of the _Defence Act 1903_.

## Part 4—Protection against discrimination because of defence service

### Division 1—Overview of Part

##### <a id="14"></a>14  Overview of Part

             (1)  This Part applies in relation to all kinds of defence service (see Part 3).

             (2)  Essentially, the Part makes it unlawful to refuse to give work to a person on the ground that the person is rendering, has rendered, or might in the future render, defence service.

             (3)  A breach of the Part may be a criminal offence. Breaches can also be redressed by civil means: see Part 11.

## Part 5—Employment protection

### Division 1—Overview of Part

##### <a id="24"></a>24  Overview of Part

             (1)  This Part applies in relation to all kinds of defence service except for certain kinds of voluntary continuous full time service (see Part 3).

             (2)  Essentially, the Part protects the status and entitlements, such as accrued leave, of members who render the defence service while subject to employment obligations.

### Division 2—Leave during defence service

##### <a id="25"></a>25  No requirement to take leave during defence service

             (1)  This section applies if a member is employed by a person under a contract of employment, or other arrangement, that allows the member any type of paid or unpaid leave.

             (2)  The employer must not require the member to take the leave concurrently with all or part of his or her absence on defence service.

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not apply to the extent that the member agrees to take the leave concurrently with all or part of that absence.

### Division 3—Effect of defence service on contract of employment

##### <a id="26"></a>26  Contract suspended (rather than terminated)

             (1)  If a member was employed before starting to render defence service, the contract of employment is not terminated (or taken to be terminated) because of the member’s failure to perform his or her duties under the contract while absent on defence service.

             (2)  Instead, the contract is suspended while the member is absent on defence service, unless terminated earlier in accordance with law.

             (3)  A period during which a contract of employment is suspended is taken not to be a period of employment under the contract unless this Part provides otherwise.

             (4)  Subsection (1) does not prevent the termination of the contract if the member does not apply to resume employment under the contract within 30 days after ceasing to render defence service.

##### <a id="27"></a>27  Applying to resume employment after defence service

             (1)  A member whose contract of employment is suspended under section 26 may apply to the employer to resume work under the contract. An application must be in writing (unless the employer waives that requirement).

             (2)  If the contract of employment was terminated in accordance with law while the member was absent on defence service but another employer (the **_new employer_**) is carrying on:

                     (a)  the business or undertaking in which the member was employed under the contract; or

                     (b)  another business or undertaking which includes that business or undertaking;

the member may apply in writing to the new employer for reinstatement.

             (3)  The member must apply to the employer or new employer within 30 days after ceasing to render defence service.

             (4)  If an employee is reinstated in employment with a new employer, the contract of employment under which the member was previously employed is novated to the new employer.

##### <a id="28"></a>28  Employer must re-employ member

             (1)  As soon as reasonably practicable after receiving an application under section 27, the employer must:

                     (a)  allow the member to resume work, or reinstate the member in employment, in the same capacity in which the member was employed immediately before he or she started to render defence service; and

                     (b)  ensure that the member’s terms and conditions of employment (including remuneration) are at least as favourable as those that would have applied to him or her in that capacity but for the service.

Exceptions

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply if:

                     (a)  the employer agreed to the resumption or reinstatement, but the member:

                              (i)  did not make himself or herself available for work as agreed between them; and

                             (ii)  did not have a reasonable excuse for not doing so; or

                     (b)  because of changed circumstances since the member was employed (except employing someone else to replace the member):

                              (i)  it was not within the employer’s power to allow the resumption or reinstatement; or

                             (ii)  the employer offered to employ the member in a capacity, and under terms and conditions, that were the most favourable that it was reasonable or practicable to offer him or her.

### Division 4—Effect of defence service on particular entitlements of members

##### <a id="29"></a>29  Which entitlements this Division applies to

                   This Division deals with determining the entitlements of a member, or of someone else arising because of the entitlements of a member, under a contract of employment or otherwise in relation to the following:

                     (a)  annual leave and leave loadings;

                     (b)  personal or carer’s leave, including sick leave, family leave, bereavement leave, compassionate leave, cultural leave and other like forms of leave;

                     (c)  parental leave, including maternity and adoption leave;

                     (d)  long service leave or an amount in place of long service leave;

                     (e)  a prescribed matter.

##### <a id="30"></a>30  Continuous full-time defence service

             (1)  This section applies if a member resumes work, or is reinstated in employment, under this Part after rendering continuous full time defence service to which this Part applies.

Note:          Part 3 sets out which kinds of defence service this Part applies to.

             (2)  The entitlements in relation to the member’s employment in respect of the period of the service must be no less beneficial than they would have been if the member had been absent on leave without pay from the employment during that period.

             (3)  In particular, the continuity of the member’s employment is taken not to have been broken by his or her absence on defence service.

##### <a id="31"></a>31  Other defence service

             (1)  This section applies if a member resumes work, or is reinstated in employment, under this Part after rendering defence service other than continuous full time defence service.

Resumption of employment

             (2)  If the member resumes work for the old employer (see subsection 27(1)):

                     (a)  the period of the absence is taken to have been paid service in the employment; and

                     (b)  the continuity of the member’s employment is taken not to have been broken by his or her absence on defence service.

Reinstatement in employment

             (3)  If the member is reinstated in employment with a new employer (see subsection 27(2)):

                     (a)  the period of employment under the suspended contract of employment is taken to have been served under the contract of employment entered into on the reinstatement; and

                     (b)  the period of the absence is taken to have been paid service in the new employment; and

                     (c)  the continuity of the period of employment under the suspended contract of employment with the period of employment that commenced on the reinstatement is taken not to have been broken by the member’s absence on defence service.

### Division 5—Termination of employment after resumption of employment etc.

##### <a id="32"></a>32  Termination after resuming employment etc.

             (1)  This section applies if an employer has (in accordance with this Part) permitted a member to resume work or reinstated a member in employment.

             (2)  During the period that begins immediately after the member resumes work, or is reinstated in employment, and that is equal to the length of the member’s absence on defence service, the employer must not:

                     (a)  terminate the member’s employment; or

                     (b)  vary the member’s employment by employing the member in a capacity, or under terms and conditions, less favourable to the member than the capacity in which, or the terms and conditions under which, the member was employed on resuming work or being reinstated in employment.

Exception—changed circumstances

             (3)  Paragraph (2)(a) does not apply if, because of changed circumstances since the member resumed work or was reinstated (except employing someone else to replace the member), it was not within the employer’s power to retain the member in employment.

Exception—employee misconduct

             (4)  Subsection (2) does not apply if the termination or variation of the member’s employment was because of misconduct by the member that was serious enough to justify the termination or variation.

             (5)  To avoid doubt, the member’s absence on defence service is not **_misconduct_** for the purposes of subsection (4).

### Division 6—No additional obligations on employers

##### <a id="33"></a>33  No additional obligations on employers

             (1)  To avoid doubt, this Act does not oblige an employer of a member who is, or has been, absent on defence service to do any of the following in respect of the period of the absence:

                     (a)  to pay the member’s remuneration in respect of the employment; or

                     (b)  to grant the member’s entitlements in respect of the employment (except as provided under this Part); or

                     (c)  to meet the employer’s obligations under a workers’ compensation law to pay premiums, contributions or similar payments in relation to the member; or

                     (d)  to meet the employer’s obligations under the _Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992_ in relation to the member.

             (2)  Paragraphs (1)(a) and (b) do not apply to the extent that the member would have been entitled to the benefit of the things mentioned in those paragraphs anyway if the member’s absence had been for a purpose other than the purpose of rendering defence service.

Example:    An employer would still have to pay the wages of a member who rendered defence service while on paid annual leave, since the member’s absence on paid annual leave would not relieve the employer from having to pay wages. But once the member ran out of paid annual leave, the employer would not have to pay the member any longer until the member returned from rendering defence service.

             (3)  In this section:

                    <a name="worker-compens-law"></a>**_workers’ compensation law_** means a law that provides for compensation or other benefits for work-related trauma suffered by employees without requiring proof of any breach by employers or by their associates.

## Part 6—Partnership protection

##### <a id="34"></a>34  Overview of Part

             (1)  This Part applies in relation to all kinds of defence service except for certain kinds of voluntary continuous full time service (see Part 3).

             (2)  Essentially, the Part protects members from having their partnerships dissolved while the members are absent on defence service.

##### <a id="35"></a>35  Dissolving partnerships etc. involving a serving member

             (1)  A person must not take or continue proceedings or other action against a member who is a partner in a partnership to:

                     (a)  dissolve the partnership; or

                     (b)  expel the member from the partnership; or

                     (c)  require the member to forfeit his or her share in the partnership; or

                     (d)  subject the member to any other detriment concerning the partnership;

while the member is rendering defence service.

             (2)  It does not matter whether the proceedings are taken or continued under a partnership agreement or otherwise.

             (3)  Subsection (1) does not apply if all the partners consented to taking or continuing the proceedings or other action.

##### <a id="36"></a>36  Dissolving partnerships etc. involving former member

             (1)  A person must not take or continue proceedings or other action against a partner in a partnership who has rendered defence service to:

                     (a)  dissolve the partnership; or

                     (b)  expel the partner from the partnership; or

                     (c)  require the partner to forfeit his or her share in the partnership; or

                     (d)  subject the partner to any other detriment concerning the partnership;

before the end of the partner’s protected period.

             (2)  It does not matter whether the proceedings are taken or continued under a partnership agreement or otherwise.

             (3)  Subsection (1) does not apply if all the partners consented to taking or continuing the proceedings or other action.

## Part 7—Education protection

##### <a id="37"></a>37  Overview of Part

             (1)  This Part applies in relation to all kinds of continuous full time defence service except for certain kinds of voluntary continuous full time service (see Part 3).

             (2)  Essentially, the Part allows a member to re-enrol in, and resume, a course that was interrupted because the member was required to render defence service or voluntarily undertook defence service.

##### <a id="38"></a>38  Member enrolled in course while rendering defence service

                   This Part applies to a member who:

                     (a)  is enrolled in a course at an Australian education institution during all or part of the period he or she is rendering defence service; and

                     (b)  does not complete the course before ceasing to render the service; and

                     (c)  applies to re-enrol (if necessary) and to resume the course within 30 days after ceasing to render the service.

##### <a id="39"></a>39  Obligations of body administering education institution

             (1)  The body administering the Australian education institution must not exclude the member from the course, or subject the member to any other disadvantage, because he or she did not complete a requirement of the course or any assessment for the course:

                     (a)  while rendering the defence service; or

                     (b)  otherwise because of having rendered the defence service.

             (2)  The body administering the Australian education institution must:

                     (a)  allow the member to re-enrol (if necessary) in the course; and

                     (b)  allow the member to resume the course at a point that the body considers appropriate; and

                     (c)  ensure that the conditions (if any) on the re-enrolment and resumption are the same as those that would have applied to a person who is not a member.

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not apply if, because of a change in the nature of courses offered by the institution since the member was previously enrolled:

                     (a)  it was not reasonable or practicable to allow the member to re-enrol or resume the course in which he or she was previously enrolled; and

                     (b)  the body administering the institution offered to enrol the member in another course that most closely corresponded to the course in which he or she was previously enrolled; and

                     (c)  the conditions on the re-enrolment and resumption were the most favourable that it was reasonable or practicable to offer the member.

## Part 8—Financial liability protection

### Division 1—Overview

##### <a id="40"></a>40  Overview of part

             (1)  This Part applies to continuous full time service rendered as a result of a call out (see Part 3).

             (2)  Essentially, many liabilities of a member or dependant that would otherwise fall due after the member starts rendering defence service are postponed. A liability may, for example, relate to principal or interest under a loan or the purchase price of something that the member or dependant has agreed to buy. Generally, the liability must have arisen before the member’s call out day.

             (3)  The liabilities are postponed for the shorter of the following:

                     (a)  the period that begins immediately after the member ceased to render defence service and that is equal to the length of that service;

                     (b)  the period of 12 months beginning immediately after he or she ceased to render that service.

             (4)  Interest accrues on the postponed liabilities. This is so regardless of whether the member or dependant had to pay interest in respect of the original liability.

             (5)  This Part also stays proceedings in respect of the postponed liabilities.

### Division 2—Which financial liabilities this Part applies to

##### <a id="41"></a>41  Financial liabilities that arise before call out day

                     (b)  a hire purchase agreement;

                     (c)  an agreement to buy something (including land);

                     (d)  an agreement to lease something (including land);

                     (e)  a guarantee.

In this Part, they are called **_agreements_**.

             (2)  However, this section is subject to the exceptions in sections 44, 45 and 46.

##### <a id="42"></a>42  Option exercised on or after call out day

             (1)  This Part also applies to a liability of a member or of his or her dependant to make a payment under an agreement if:

                     (a)  the member or dependant had an option to buy or lease something (including land) that was granted before the member’s call out day; and

                     (b)  on exercising the option under the agreement on or after that day, the member or dependant became liable to make the payment.

             (2)  However, this section is subject to the exceptions in sections 44, 45 and 46.

##### <a id="43"></a>43  Rates etc. on land

             (1)  This Part also applies to the liability of a member or of his or her dependant to pay rates, or other taxes imposed in respect of land, if:

                     (a)  the liability arose before the member’s call out day; or

                     (b)  in a case covered by section 42—the liability arises on or after the day on which the option to buy or lease the land was exercised.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply to the goods and services tax.

             (3)  This section is subject to section 46.

##### <a id="44"></a>44  Part does not apply to security holder already exercising remedies

                   This Part does not apply to a liability of a member or his or her dependant to make a payment under an agreement if, before the member’s call out day, a court orders that a party to the agreement may exercise all or any of its remedies to enforce any security under the agreement (including enter land if the security is land).

##### <a id="45"></a>45  Part does not apply to bankruptcy or insolvency of member or dependant

             (1)  This Part does not apply to a liability of a member or his or her dependant to make a payment under an agreement if, while liable to make the payment, the member or dependant:

                     (a)  becomes bankrupt; or

                     (b)  applies to take the benefit of any law for the relief of bankrupt or insolvent debtors; or

                     (c)  compounds with his or her creditors; or

                     (d)  makes an assignment of his or her remuneration for the benefit of his or her creditors; or

                     (e)  dies and his or her estate is being administered in bankruptcy or insolvency.

             (2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), it does not matter whether the bankruptcy, insolvency, assignment or death happened before or after the commencement of this Act.

##### <a id="46"></a>46  Part does not apply to trustees or representatives

Member’s liability

             (1)  This Part does not apply in relation to a liability of a member to make a payment as a trustee or in a representative capacity except to the extent that, in incurring the liability, the member is acting for the benefit of, or on behalf of, persons who are, or who include, the member or one or more dependants of the member.

Dependant’s liability

             (2)  This Part does not apply in relation to a liability of a member’s dependant to make a payment as a trustee or in a representative capacity except to the extent that, in incurring the liability, the dependant is acting for the benefit of, or on behalf of, persons who are, or who include, the member, the dependant, or one or more other dependants of the member.

##### <a id="47"></a>47  Liability exists even if payment not yet due

                   For the purposes of this Part, a person is **_liable to make a payment_** if he or she is obliged to make it, even if the due date for payment has not arrived.

                   To avoid doubt, a liability to which this Part applies may arise before or after the commencement of this Act.

                     (a)  the payments are to be made by the member or dependant by instalment; and

                     (b)  the first instalment falls due before the end of the member’s protected period;

                     (d)  the time for paying each later instalment is postponed for a period of the same length as the member’s protected period.

Single payment

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  only a single payment is to be made by the member or dependant; and

                     (b)  the payment falls due before the end of the member’s protected period;

the time for making the payment is postponed so that it falls due at the end of the member’s protected period.

Exception in section 51

             (3)  This section is subject to section 51.

##### <a id="51"></a>51  Rescheduling if member or dependant dies

##### <a id="52"></a>52  Higher rate of interest not payable

             (1)  If an agreement to which this Part applies allows interest to be paid or accepted at a reduced or lower rate if it is paid on or before the due date, interest remains payable at the reduced or lower rate even if (because of this Division) it is not so paid.

                     (a)  the rate or rates specified in the agreement concerned before the interest falls due; or

                     (b)  if no rate of interest is specified in the agreement—the rate worked out in accordance with the regulations as in force at the start of the member’s call out day.

             (4)  The interest is payable after the start of the postponement:

                     (a)  at the times specified in the agreement for paying interest; or

#### Subdivision B—Proceedings stayed

##### <a id="55"></a>55  Proceedings stayed but rights not otherwise prejudiced

             (1)  While one or more payments are postponed, all proceedings against the member or dependant concerned that were instituted before the commencement of this Act:

                     (a)  to enforce the payments; or

                     (b)  in respect of, or because of, non-payment;

are stayed.

             (2)  It does not matter how or in what forum the proceedings were instituted.

             (3)  Also, while one or more payments are postponed, all remedies against the member or dependant to recover the payments are stayed.

                     (a)  prejudice or affect any stayed proceeding or remedy; or

                     (b)  affect the rights or obligations of anyone;

except so far as is necessary to give effect to this Division.

             (2)  In considering an application for an order, the court may make any interlocutory or final order (including as to costs) that the court considers just, having regard to:

                     (a)  if the liability arose under an agreement—the terms and conditions of the agreement; and

                     (b)  the circumstances of the member or dependant; and

                     (c)  the circumstances of the other person.

### Division 4—General matters

##### <a id="57"></a>57  Powers of security holder not affected

                   This Part does not affect the power of a security holder under an agreement to which this Part applies to enforce the holder’s rights against the member or dependant if:

                     (a)  the security holder was, or is, in possession of the security at the member’s call out day; or

                     (b)  if the security is land—the security holder has appointed or appoints a receiver who, at the member’s call out day, was, or is:

                              (i)  in possession of the land; or

                             (ii)  receiving the rents and profits of the land.

##### <a id="58"></a>58  Instruments made on or after member’s call out day not affected

                   This Part does not prevent or alter the effect of:

                     (b)  any thing done under the instrument.

##### <a id="59"></a>59  Joint liability

             (1)  If a member or his or her dependant is liable jointly with one or more others to make a payment under an agreement, this Part applies to the member’s or dependant’s liability in the same way as it would apply if the member or dependant were solely liable.

             (2)  However, this Part does not apply to the liability of the other parties who are jointly liable (but who are not members or dependants to whose defence service this Part applies in their own right).

##### <a id="60"></a>60  Postponement etc. not to be taken into account for purposes of statutes of limitations etc.

                   In working out the deadline imposed by a statute of limitations or other Commonwealth, State or Territory law for bringing actions or pursuing other remedies in respect of a liability to which this Part applies, the following periods are not to be taken into account:

                     (a)  the period while the time for making payments is postponed under this Part;

                     (b)  the period while proceedings, or proposed proceedings, are stayed under this Part.

##### <a id="61"></a>61  Certain rights of member or dependant preserved

             (1)  The right of a member or of his or her dependant to commence a proceeding, or to enforce a right, exercise a power or pursue a remedy, in relation to a liability to which this Part applies, is not barred during the preservation period:

                     (a)  by the end of a period of limitation fixed by a Commonwealth, State or Territory law; or

                     (b)  by an instrument with respect to the right.

             (2)  The proceeding may be commenced, and the right enforced, power exercised or remedy pursued, at any time before the end of the preservation period.

             (3)  It does not matter whether the right arose or arises before or after the commencement of this Act.

             (4)  This section also applies in relation to a person who became or becomes a member or dependant of a member after the right arose.

             (5)  In this section:

                    <a name="preserv-period"></a>**_preservation period_** means the combined consecutive periods of the member’s absence on defence service and the member’s protected period.

## Part 9—Bankruptcy protection

##### <a id="62"></a>62  Overview of Part

             (1)  This Part applies to continuous full time service rendered as a result of a call out (see Part 3).

             (2)  Essentially, the Part protects members from bankruptcy proceedings while the member is rendering defence service following a call out.

##### <a id="63"></a>63  Bankruptcy proceedings against member or dependant not allowed

             (1)  During a member’s protected period, a bankruptcy notice must not be issued, and a creditor’s petition must not be presented, in relation to the member or a dependant of the member if the notice or petition relates to a debt that arose before the member’s call out day for the relevant defence service.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply to a person who has leave of a court with jurisdiction in bankruptcy or insolvency to issue the notice or present the petition.

             (3)  The court must not grant leave unless the court is satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances of the case (including the conduct and financial position of the member or dependant, and of the applicant), it would be inequitable to refuse to grant leave.

##### <a id="64"></a>64  Orders court may make relating to bankruptcy of member or dependant

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a creditor presents a bankruptcy petition to a court against a member or his or her dependant; and

                     (b)  the member or dependant satisfies the court that he or she was unable to pay the relevant debts because of circumstances directly or indirectly attributable to the member’s defence service;

the court may stay the proceedings under the petition for such time and subject to such conditions as the court thinks fit.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  a court has, on the petition of a creditor, made a sequestration order against a person who is a member or a dependant of a member; and

                     (b)  on application, the court is satisfied that, if the sequestration order is annulled:

                              (i)  the business (if any) of that person will continue to be carried on by the person or on his or her behalf; and

                             (ii)  there will be a reasonable prospect of that business being carried on successfully;

the court may make an order annulling the sequestration order.

             (3)  An order under subsection (2) annulling a sequestration order has the same effect as an annulment of the sequestration order under the _Bankruptcy Act 1966_.

             (4)  An order under subsection (2) may be made on such conditions (including the reimbursement of the costs incurred by the petitioning creditor in the bankruptcy proceedings) as the court thinks fit.

## Part 10—Loans and guarantees to returned members

##### <a id="65"></a>65  Overview of Part

             (1)  This Part applies to continuous full time service rendered as a result of a call out (see Part 3).

##### <a id="71"></a>71  Review by Administrative Appeals Tribunal

                   Application may be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for the review of a decision to refuse to make a loan or give a guarantee.

##### <a id="72"></a>72  Agreements between prescribed authorities and States etc.

             (1)  A prescribed authority may enter into an agreement with a State, a Territory, a State or Territory authority or an ADI (the **_delegate_**) for the delegate to perform those functions of the prescribed authority under this Part that are specified in the agreement.

             (2)  If, under an agreement, the delegate makes or guarantees a loan to a member, the delegate may take any security for the loan or guarantee in its own name.

             (3)  For the purposes of this Part, a prescribed authority may make loans, or give guarantees, to a State or Territory authority or an ADI that is itself making loans or giving guarantees under an agreement.

                     (a)  to enter into an agreement mentioned in subsection (1); and

This is so even if the other person did not commit an offence (if the contravention is also an offence).

             (2)  An action mentioned in subsection (1) may be brought by a prescribed person on behalf of the person who suffers the loss or damage.

             (3)  An action under subsection (1) may only be begun within 3 years after the day on which the cause of action arose.

### Division 2—Orders that courts may make

##### <a id="74"></a>74  Orders for compensation after offence

                     (b)  whether or not the person has previously engaged in conduct of that kind.

Mandatory injunctions

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  a person has refused or failed, or is refusing or failing, or is proposing to refuse or fail to do an act; and

                     (b)  the refusal or failure did, does or would constitute an offence or other contravention of this Act;

the court may grant an injunction requiring the person to do the act. The court may grant the injunction:

                     (c)  whether or not it appears to the court that the person intends to refuse or fail again, or to continue to refuse or fail, to do the act; and

                     (d)  whether or not the person has previously refused or failed to do the act.

Interim injunctions

             (4)  Before deciding an application for an injunction under this section, the court may grant an interim injunction:

             (2)  However, this Act does not confer any criminal jurisdiction on the Federal Court of Australia.

##### <a id="78"></a>78  Unincorporated bodies

                     (a)  if the body is a partnership—each partner; or

             (1)  Without limiting its effect apart from this section, this Act also has effect as provided by this section.

                     (a)  between Australia and places outside Australia; or

                     (b)  among the States; or

                     (c)  within a Territory, between a State and a Territory or between 2 Territories.

             (4)  This Act also has the effect that it would have if its operation were expressly confined to acts or omissions taking place in a Territory.

             (1)  The Governor-General may make regulations prescribing matters:

                     (a)  required or permitted by this Act to be prescribed; or
