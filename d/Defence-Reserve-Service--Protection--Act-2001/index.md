An Act to protect members of the Reserves in their employment and education, to facilitate their return to civilian life, and for related purposes
Part 1—Introduction
  
1  Short title [see Note 1]
		This Act may be cited as the Defence Reserve Service (Protection) Act 2001.
2  Commencement [see Note 1]
		This Act commences on the 28th day after the day on which it receives the Royal Assent.
3  Overview of the Act
	(1)	The following is a simplified overview of the Act.
	(2)	This Act sets out entitlements and prohibitions that apply in relation to people who are rendering, or have rendered, defence service as members of the Reserves. In some cases, the entitlements extend to their dependants.
	(3)	The kind of defence service rendered by a particular member determines the scope of the prohibitions and entitlements available in relation to him or her: see Part 3.
	(4)	Part 4 contains prohibitions against conduct that discriminates against members in their employment or other work. This Part applies to all types of defence service.
	(5)	Part 5 sets out the consequences for a member’s employment if he or she was employed when he or she started to render defence service. This Part applies to all kinds of defence service (except for certain kinds of voluntary continuous full time service).
	(6)	Part 6 protects members from having their partnerships dissolved while the members are absent on defence service. This Part applies to all kinds of defence service (except for certain kinds of voluntary continuous full time service).
	(7)	Part 7 allows a member to re‑enrol in, and resume, a course that the member had to interrupt in order to undertake continuous full time defence service (except for certain kinds of voluntary continuous full time service).
	(8)	Part 8 postpones debts that a member (or his or her dependant) is liable to pay and that would otherwise fall due after the member starts rendering defence service as a result of being called out. Interest accrues on the postponed debts. Part 8 also stays proceedings in respect of the postponed debts.
	(9)	Part 9 protects a member or his or her dependant from bankruptcy proceedings. It applies only if the member has rendered defence service after being called out.
	(10)	Part 10 allows for a member who has rendered defence service after being called out to get access to loans and guarantees to enable him or her to resume civilian life after returning from that service.
	(11)	Part 11 deals with enforcement and remedies. Part 12 deals with minor miscellaneous matters.
4  Act binds the Crown
	(1)	This Act binds the Crown in each of its capacities.
	(2)	In particular, obligations that this Act imposes on employers or other persons (however described) are imposed on the Crown just as they are imposed on everyone else.
	(3)	However, this Act does not make the Crown liable to be prosecuted for an offence.
5  Application of Criminal Code
		The Criminal Code applies to all offences against this Act.
Note:	Chapter 2 of the Criminal Code sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.
6  Act extends to the external Territories

Division 1—Overview of Part
24  Overview of Part
	(1)	This Part applies in relation to all kinds of defence service except for certain kinds of voluntary continuous full time service (see Part 3).
	(2)	Essentially, the Part protects the status and entitlements, such as accrued leave, of members who render the defence service while subject to employment obligations.

Division 2—Leave during defence service
25  No requirement to take leave during defence service
	(1)	This section applies if a member is employed by a person under a contract of employment, or other arrangement, that allows the member any type of paid or unpaid leave.
	(2)	The employer must not require the member to take the leave concurrently with all or part of his or her absence on defence service.
	(3)	Subsection (2) does not apply to the extent that the member agrees to take the leave concurrently with all or part of that absence.

Division 3—Effect of defence service on contract of employment
26  Contract suspended (rather than terminated)
	(1)	If a member was employed before starting to render defence service, the contract of employment is not terminated (or taken to be terminated) because of the member’s failure to perform his or her duties under the contract while absent on defence service.
	(2)	Instead, the contract is suspended while the member is absent on defence service, unless terminated earlier in accordance with law.
	(3)	A period during which a contract of employment is suspended is taken not to be a period of employment under the contract unless this Part provides otherwise.
	(4)	Subsection (1) does not prevent the termination of the contract if the member does not apply to resume employment under the contract within 30 days after ceasing to render defence service.
27  Applying to resume employment after defence service
	(1)	A member whose contract of employment is suspended under section 26 may apply to the employer to resume work under the contract. An application must be in writing (unless the employer waives that requirement).
	(2)	If the contract of employment was terminated in accordance with law while the member was absent on defence service but another employer (the new employer) is carrying on:
	(a)	the business or undertaking in which the member was employed under the contract; or
	(b)	another business or undertaking which includes that business or undertaking;
the member may apply in writing to the new employer for reinstatement.
	(3)	The member must apply to the employer or new employer within 30 days after ceasing to render defence service.
	(4)	If an employee is reinstated in employment with a new employer, the contract of employment under which the member was previously employed is novated to the new employer.
28  Employer must re‑employ member
	(1)	As soon as reasonably practicable after receiving an application under section 27, the employer must:
	(a)	allow the member to resume work, or reinstate the member in employment, in the same capacity in which the member was employed immediately before he or she started to render defence service; and
	(b)	ensure that the member’s terms and conditions of employment (including remuneration) are at least as favourable as those that would have applied to him or her in that capacity but for the service.
Exceptions
	(2)	Subsection (1) does not apply if:
	(a)	the employer agreed to the resumption or reinstatement, but the member:
	(i)	did not make himself or herself available for work as agreed between them; and
	(ii)	did not have a reasonable excuse for not doing so; or
	(b)	because of changed circumstances since the member was employed (except employing someone else to replace the member):
	(i)	it was not within the employer’s power to allow the resumption or reinstatement; or
	(ii)	the employer offered to employ the member in a capacity, and under terms and conditions, that were the most favourable that it was reasonable or practicable to offer him or her.

	(2)	The entitlements in relation to the member’s employment in respect of the period of the service must be no less beneficial than they would have been if the member had been absent on leave without pay from the employment during that period.
	(3)	In particular, the continuity of the member’s employment is taken not to have been broken by his or her absence on defence service.
31  Other defence service
	(1)	This section applies if a member resumes work, or is reinstated in employment, under this Part after rendering defence service other than continuous full time defence service.
Resumption of employment
	(2)	If the member resumes work for the old employer (see subsection 27(1)):
	(a)	the period of the absence is taken to have been paid service in the employment; and
	(b)	the continuity of the member’s employment is taken not to have been broken by his or her absence on defence service.
Reinstatement in employment
	(3)	If the member is reinstated in employment with a new employer (see subsection 27(2)):
	(a)	the period of employment under the suspended contract of employment is taken to have been served under the contract of employment entered into on the reinstatement; and
	(b)	the period of the absence is taken to have been paid service in the new employment; and
	(c)	the continuity of the period of employment under the suspended contract of employment with the period of employment that commenced on the reinstatement is taken not to have been broken by the member’s absence on defence service.

Division 5—Termination of employment after resumption of employment etc.
32  Termination after resuming employment etc.
	(1)	This section applies if an employer has (in accordance with this Part) permitted a member to resume work or reinstated a member in employment.
	(2)	During the period that begins immediately after the member resumes work, or is reinstated in employment, and that is equal to the length of the member’s absence on defence service, the employer must not:
	(a)	terminate the member’s employment; or
	(b)	vary the member’s employment by employing the member in a capacity, or under terms and conditions, less favourable to the member than the capacity in which, or the terms and conditions under which, the member was employed on resuming work or being reinstated in employment.
Exception—changed circumstances
	(3)	Paragraph (2)(a) does not apply if, because of changed circumstances since the member resumed work or was reinstated (except employing someone else to replace the member), it was not within the employer’s power to retain the member in employment.
Exception—employee misconduct
	(4)	Subsection (2) does not apply if the termination or variation of the member’s employment was because of misconduct by the member that was serious enough to justify the termination or variation.
	(5)	To avoid doubt, the member’s absence on defence service is not misconduct for the purposes of subsection (4).

Division 6—No additional obligations on employers
33  No additional obligations on employers
	(1)	To avoid doubt, this Act does not oblige an employer of a member who is, or has been, absent on defence service to do any of the following in respect of the period of the absence:
	(a)	to pay the member’s remuneration in respect of the employment; or
	(b)	to grant the member’s entitlements in respect of the employment (except as provided under this Part); or
	(c)	to meet the employer’s obligations under a workers’ compensation law to pay premiums, contributions or similar payments in relation to the member; or
	(d)	to meet the employer’s obligations under the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 in relation to the member.
	(2)	Paragraphs (1)(a) and (b) do not apply to the extent that the member would have been entitled to the benefit of the things mentioned in those paragraphs anyway if the member’s absence had been for a purpose other than the purpose of rendering defence service.
Example:	An employer would still have to pay the wages of a member who rendered defence service while on paid annual leave, since the member’s absence on paid annual leave would not relieve the employer from having to pay wages. But once the member ran out of paid annual leave, the employer would not have to pay the member any longer until the member returned from rendering defence service.
	(3)	In this section:
workers’ compensation law means a law that provides for compensation or other benefits for work‑related trauma suffered by employees without requiring proof of any breach by employers or by their associates.

34  Overview of Part
	(1)	This Part applies in relation to all kinds of defence service except for certain kinds of voluntary continuous full time service (see Part 3).

	(1)	A person must not take or continue proceedings or other action against a member who is a partner in a partnership to:
	(a)	dissolve the partnership; or

	(c)	require the member to forfeit his or her share in the partnership; or
	(d)	subject the member to any other detriment concerning the partnership;
while the member is rendering defence service.
	(2)	It does not matter whether the proceedings are taken or continued under a partnership agreement or otherwise.
	(3)	Subsection (1) does not apply if all the partners consented to taking or continuing the proceedings or other action.
36  Dissolving partnerships etc. involving former member
	(1)	A person must not take or continue proceedings or other action against a partner in a partnership who has rendered defence service to:
	(a)	dissolve the partnership; or

	(c)	require the partner to forfeit his or her share in the partnership; or
	(d)	subject the partner to any other detriment concerning the partnership;
before the end of the partner’s protected period.
	(2)	It does not matter whether the proceedings are taken or continued under a partnership agreement or otherwise.
	(3)	Subsection (1) does not apply if all the partners consented to taking or continuing the proceedings or other action.

37  Overview of Part
	(1)	This Part applies in relation to all kinds of continuous full time defence service except for certain kinds of voluntary continuous full time service (see Part 3).

	(b)	otherwise because of having rendered the defence service.
	(2)	The body administering the Australian education institution must:
	(a)	allow the member to re‑enrol (if necessary) in the course; and
	(b)	allow the member to resume the course at a point that the body considers appropriate; and
	(c)	ensure that the conditions (if any) on the re‑enrolment and resumption are the same as those that would have applied to a person who is not a member.
	(3)	Subsection (2) does not apply if, because of a change in the nature of courses offered by the institution since the member was previously enrolled:
	(a)	it was not reasonable or practicable to allow the member to re‑enrol or resume the course in which he or she was previously enrolled; and
	(b)	the body administering the institution offered to enrol the member in another course that most closely corresponded to the course in which he or she was previously enrolled; and
	(c)	the conditions on the re‑enrolment and resumption were the most favourable that it was reasonable or practicable to offer the member.

Part 8—Financial liability protection
Division 1—Overview
40  Overview of part
	(1)	This Part applies to continuous full time service rendered as a result of a call out (see Part 3).
	(2)	Essentially, many liabilities of a member or dependant that would otherwise fall due after the member starts rendering defence service are postponed. A liability may, for example, relate to principal or interest under a loan or the purchase price of something that the member or dependant has agreed to buy. Generally, the liability must have arisen before the member’s call out day.
	(3)	The liabilities are postponed for the shorter of the following:
	(a)	the period that begins immediately after the member ceased to render defence service and that is equal to the length of that service;
	(b)	the period of 12 months beginning immediately after he or she ceased to render that service.
	(4)	Interest accrues on the postponed liabilities. This is so regardless of whether the member or dependant had to pay interest in respect of the original liability.

	(2)	Subsection (1) does not apply to the goods and services tax.
	(3)	This section is subject to section 46.
44  Part does not apply to security holder already exercising remedies

45  Part does not apply to bankruptcy or insolvency of member or dependant
	(1)	This Part does not apply to a liability of a member or his or her dependant to make a payment under an agreement if, while liable to make the payment, the member or dependant:
	(a)	becomes bankrupt; or
	(b)	applies to take the benefit of any law for the relief of bankrupt or insolvent debtors; or
	(c)	compounds with his or her creditors; or
	(d)	makes an assignment of his or her remuneration for the benefit of his or her creditors; or
	(e)	dies and his or her estate is being administered in bankruptcy or insolvency.
	(2)	For the purposes of subsection (1), it does not matter whether the bankruptcy, insolvency, assignment or death happened before or after the commencement of this Act.
46  Part does not apply to trustees or representatives
Member’s liability
	(1)	This Part does not apply in relation to a liability of a member to make a payment as a trustee or in a representative capacity except to the extent that, in incurring the liability, the member is acting for the benefit of, or on behalf of, persons who are, or who include, the member or one or more dependants of the member.
Dependant’s liability
	(2)	This Part does not apply in relation to a liability of a member’s dependant to make a payment as a trustee or in a representative capacity except to the extent that, in incurring the liability, the dependant is acting for the benefit of, or on behalf of, persons who are, or who include, the member, the dependant, or one or more other dependants of the member.
47  Liability exists even if payment not yet due
		For the purposes of this Part, a person is liable to make a payment if he or she is obliged to make it, even if the due date for payment has not arrived.
48  Liability may have arisen before commencement of this Act
		To avoid doubt, a liability to which this Part applies may arise before or after the commencement of this Act.

	(b)	any thing done under the instrument.
59  Joint liability
	(1)	If a member or his or her dependant is liable jointly with one or more others to make a payment under an agreement, this Part applies to the member’s or dependant’s liability in the same way as it would apply if the member or dependant were solely liable.
	(2)	However, this Part does not apply to the liability of the other parties who are jointly liable (but who are not members or dependants to whose defence service this Part applies in their own right).
60  Postponement etc. not to be taken into account for purposes of statutes of limitations etc.
		In working out the deadline imposed by a statute of limitations or other Commonwealth, State or Territory law for bringing actions or pursuing other remedies in respect of a liability to which this Part applies, the following periods are not to be taken into account:

63  Bankruptcy proceedings against member or dependant not allowed
	(1)	During a member’s protected period, a bankruptcy notice must not be issued, and a creditor’s petition must not be presented, in relation to the member or a dependant of the member if the notice or petition relates to a debt that arose before the member’s call out day for the relevant defence service.
	(2)	Subsection (1) does not apply to a person who has leave of a court with jurisdiction in bankruptcy or insolvency to issue the notice or present the petition.
	(3)	The court must not grant leave unless the court is satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances of the case (including the conduct and financial position of the member or dependant, and of the applicant), it would be inequitable to refuse to grant leave.
64  Orders court may make relating to bankruptcy of member or dependant
	(1)	If:
	(a)	a creditor presents a bankruptcy petition to a court against a member or his or her dependant; and
	(b)	the member or dependant satisfies the court that he or she was unable to pay the relevant debts because of circumstances directly or indirectly attributable to the member’s defence service;
the court may stay the proceedings under the petition for such time and subject to such conditions as the court thinks fit.

	(a)	a court has, on the petition of a creditor, made a sequestration order against a person who is a member or a dependant of a member; and
	(b)	on application, the court is satisfied that, if the sequestration order is annulled:
	(i)	the business (if any) of that person will continue to be carried on by the person or on his or her behalf; and
	(ii)	there will be a reasonable prospect of that business being carried on successfully;
the court may make an order annulling the sequestration order.
	(3)	An order under subsection (2) annulling a sequestration order has the same effect as an annulment of the sequestration order under the Bankruptcy Act 1966.
	(4)	An order under subsection (2) may be made on such conditions (including the reimbursement of the costs incurred by the petitioning creditor in the bankruptcy proceedings) as the court thinks fit.

	(4)	The prescribed authority must be satisfied that the applicant is likely to be able to repay the amount of the loan made or guaranteed within a reasonable period.
	(5)	In determining whether to make a loan or give a guarantee, the prescribed authority must take into account the effect of the applicant’s defence service on his or her capacity and opportunities to establish or re‑establish himself or herself in civilian life without assistance under this Part.
71  Review by Administrative Appeals Tribunal
		Application may be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for the review of a decision to refuse to make a loan or give a guarantee.
72  Agreements between prescribed authorities and States etc.
