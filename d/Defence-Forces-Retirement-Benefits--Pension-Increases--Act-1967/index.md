##### <a id="1"></a>1  Short title [_see_ Note 1]

                   This Act may be cited as the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits (Pension Increases) Act 1967_.

##### <a id="2"></a>2  Commencement [_see_ Note 1]

                   This Act shall come into operation on the day on which it receives the Royal Assent

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Interpretation

             (1)  In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears:

                    <a name="actual-pension-entitl"></a>**_actual pension entitlement_**, in relation to an eligible pensioner, means the rate at which pension was payable to him immediately before the commencing date, or, if section 69 of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948_ applied in relation to him at that time, he had commuted a portion of his pension before that time or he had made an election under section 61A or section 61B of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1963-1965_, the rate at which pension would have been payable to him at that time if that section had not so applied in relation to him, he had not commuted a portion of his pension or he had not made that election, as the case may be.

                    <a name="basic-pension-entitl"></a>**_basic pension entitlement_**, in relation to an eligible pensioner, means:

                     (a)  in the case of a pensioner who retired before the commencement of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits (Pension Increases) Act 1961_:

                              (i)  the rate at which pension was payable to him immediately before the commencement of that Act; or

                             (ii)  if section 69 of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948_ applied in relation to him at that time, he had commuted a portion of his pension before that time or (if pension is payable to him under section 52 of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948_) his classification for the purposes of that section was, at that time, different from his classification on the commencing date—the rate at which pension would have been payable to him at that time if section 69 of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948_ had not so applied in relation to him, he had not commuted a portion of his pension or his classification at that time had been the same as his classification on the commencing date, as the case may be; and

                     (b)  in the case of a pensioner who retired after the commencement of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits (Pension Increases) Act 1961_ but before the commencement of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1963_:

                              (i)  the rate at which pension was payable to him immediately before the commencement of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1963_; or

                             (ii)  if section 69 of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948_ applied in relation to him at that time, he had commuted a portion of his pension before that time or (if pension is payable to him under section 52 of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948_) his classification for the purposes of that section was, at that time, different from his classification on the commencing date—the rate at which pension would have been payable to him at that time if section 69 of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948_ had not so applied in relation to him, he had not commuted a portion of his pension or his classification at that time had been the same as his classification on the commencing date, as the case may be; and

                     (c)  in any other case—his actual pension entitlement.

                    <a name="elig-pension"></a>**_eligible pensioner_** means a person to whom, immediately before the commencing date, a pension was payable by virtue of that person having been a contributor or by virtue of section 73 of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948_, being a pension that commenced to be payable before the thirtieth day of June, One thousand nine hundred and sixty-seven.

                    <a name="notion-rate-annual-pai"></a>**_notional rate of annual pay_**, in relation to an eligible pensioner or a pensioner included in a class of eligible pensioners, means such rate of annual pay payable to members on the thirtieth day of June, One thousand nine hundred and sixty-seven, as the Treasurer determines to be the rate that corresponds with the maximum rate of annual pay that was applicable to the pensioner or to that class of pensioners, as the case may be, immediately before the retirement of the pensioner.

                    <a name="pension-current-rate"></a>**_pension at current rate_**, in relation to an eligible pensioner, means:

                     (a)  except in the case of a pensioner to whom paragraph (b) of this definition applies—the rate at which pension would have been payable to him immediately before the commencing date if the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948-1966_ had been in force immediately before his retirement and he were, subject to the next succeeding subsection, entitled to pension in accordance with the provisions of that Act; and

                     (b)  in the case of a pensioner who was not an officer immediately before his retirement and in relation to whose pension section 45 of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948_ applies—such rate of pension as is ascertained by multiplying the rate of Ninety-one dollars per annum by a number the same as the category number applicable under section 4A of the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948-1966 to a rate of annual pay the same as the notional rate of annual pay of the pensioner.

the commencing date means the date of commencement of this Act. 

             (2)  In the application of the provisions of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948-1966_ in relation to an eligible pensioner for the purposes of paragraph (a) of the definition of **_pension at current rate_** in the last preceding subsection:

                     (a)  the category of the member at his retirement shall be deemed to be the category applicable under section 4A of that Act to a rate of annual pay the same as the notional rate of annual pay of the pensioner;

                     (b)  section 69 of that Act, and any commutation of a portion of his pension by the eligible pensioner, shall be disregarded;

                     (c)  if the eligible pensioner retired before the commencement of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1959_, paragraph (b) of subsection (4) of section 39 of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948-1966_ shall be disregarded;

                     (d)  if the eligible pensioner was an officer immediately before his retirement and retired:

                              (i)  before the commencement of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1959_;

                             (ii)  after attaining the retiring age for the rank held by him immediately before his retirement; and

                            (iii)  before attaining the age of sixty years, his age on retirement shall be deemed to be the retiring age for the rank held by him immediately before his retirement; and

                     (e)  if the eligible pensioner was not an officer immediately before his retirement and retired:

                              (i)  before the commencement of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1959_;

                             (ii)  after attaining the retiring age for the rank held by him immediately before his retirement;

                            (iii)  before attaining the age of sixty years; and

                            (iv)  after completing twenty years' service for pension;

                            the number of years of service for pension completed by him immediately before his retirement shall be deemed to be twenty years or such number of years of service for pension as had been completed by him immediately before he attained the retiring age for the rank held by him immediately before his retirement, whichever is the greater. 

             (3)  A reference in this Act to the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948_ shall be read as a reference to that Act as amended and in force from time to time. 

             (4)  Expressions used in this Act that are also used in the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948-1966_ have, in this Act, unless the contrary intention appears, the same respective meanings as they have in the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948-1966_. 

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Increases in pensions of certain eligible pensioners

                   Where the pension at current rate applicable to an eligible pensioner (other than an eligible pensioner to whom section 7 of this Act applies) exceeds his actual pension entitlement, he is, subject to this Act, entitled to an increase in the rate of his pension equal to five-sevenths of the difference between the pension at current rate applicable to him and his basic pension entitlement.

             (1)  Where an eligible pensioner who has commuted a portion of his pension under section 74 of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948_ or has made an election under section 61A or section 61B of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1963-1965_ is entitled to an increase in the rate of his pension under the preceding provisions of this Act, he is, subject to this Act, in lieu of the increase to which, but for this section, he would have been entitled in accordance with those provisions, entitled to an increase that bears to the increase to which he would have been so entitled the same proportion as the rate at which pension was payable to him immediately before the commencing date bears to the rate at which pension would have been payable to him immediately before that date if he had not commuted a portion of his pension or had not made that election, as the case may be. 

             (2)  The operation of section 69 of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948_ shall be disregarded for the purposes of the last preceding subsection. 

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Adjustment in relation to previous increase

                   Where an eligible pensioner was granted an increase in the rate of his pension under the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits (Pension Increases) Act 1961_ or Part III of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1963_, any increase in the rate of his pension to which he is entitled under the preceding provisions of this Act shall be reduced by the amount of that first-mentioned increase. 

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Increased rates of pensions payable to certain eligible pensioners

             (1)  This section applies to an eligible pensioner:

                     (a)  the rate of whose pension has been reduced under section 58 or section 79A, or under an agreement entered into in pursuance of section 78 or section 79, of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1959_ or of that Act as amended;
