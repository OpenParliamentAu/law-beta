             (3)  For matching payments, the total limit on the appropriation is the sum of:

                     (a)  the total amount of new dairy levy amounts; and

                     (b)  the total amount of old dairy levy amounts.

Matching payments—retention limit

             (4)  The matching payments made to the eligible body during a particular financial year are subject to the condition that, if:

                     (a)  before the end of 31 October next following the financial year, the Minister determines the amount of the gross value of whole milk produced in Australia in the financial year; and

                     (b)  as at the end of 31 October next following the financial year, the sum of the matching payments that were paid to the eligible body during the financial year exceeds the lesser of:

                              (i)  0.5% of the amount of the gross value of whole milk produced in Australia in the financial year as determined by the Minister; and

                             (ii)  50% of the amount spent by the eligible body in the financial year on activities that qualify, under the funding contract, as research and development activities;

the eligible body will pay to the Commonwealth an amount equal to the excess.

Note:          This ensures that the sum of the matching payments that are retained by the eligible body in relation to the financial year does not exceed the lesser of the amounts calculated under subparagraphs (b)(i) and (b)(ii).

          (4A)  If:

                     (a)  before the end of 31 October next following a financial year, the Minister has not determined under subsection (4) the amount of the gross value of whole milk produced in Australia in the financial year; and

                     (b)  the Minister has determined under subsection (4) the amount of the gross value of whole milk produced in Australia in the previous financial year;

the Minister is taken to have made, immediately before the end of that 31 October, a determination under subsection (4) that the amount of the gross value of whole milk produced in Australia in the financial year is equal to the amount of the gross value of whole milk produced in Australia determined under subsection (4) for the previous financial year.

          (4B)  An amount payable under subsection (4) by the eligible body:

                     (a)  is a debt due to the Commonwealth; and

                     (b)  may be recovered by the Minister, on behalf of the Commonwealth, by action in a court of competent jurisdiction.

          (4C)  A determination made under subsection (4) is not a legislative instrument.

             (5)  For the purposes of subsection (4), the regulations may prescribe the manner in which the Minister is to determine the gross value of whole milk produced in Australia in a financial year.

Matching payments—unmatched R&amp;D excess

             (6)  If there is an unmatched R&amp;D excess for a financial year, the amount spent by the eligible body in the following financial year on activities that qualify, under the funding contract, as research and development activities is taken, for the purposes of this section (including for the purposes of this subsection and subsection (7)), to be increased by the amount of the unmatched R&amp;D excess.

Note:          This means that research and development expenditure that is not “50% matched” in one financial year because of the condition in subparagraph (4)(b)(i) can be carried forward into later years.

             (7)  For the purposes of subsection (6), there is an **_unmatched R&amp;D excess_** for a financial year if:

                     (a)  the eligible body spends a particular amount (the **_R&amp;D spend amount_**) in the financial year on activities that qualify, under the funding contract, as research and development activities; and

                     (b)  because of the operation of subparagraph (4)(b)(i), the net matching payments for the financial year are less than 50% of the R&amp;D spend amount;

and the amount of the unmatched R&amp;D excess is:

Set off

             (8)  If:

                     (a)  an amount (the **_first amount_**) is payable by the eligible body under subsection (4); and

                     (b)  another amount (the **_second amount_**) is payable by the Commonwealth to the eligible body under the funding contract;

the Minister may, on behalf of the Commonwealth, set off the whole or a part of the first amount against the whole or a part of the second amount.

Net matching payments

             (9)  For the purposes of this section, **_net matching payments_** for a financial year means the total of the matching payments made to the eligible body during the financial year, less the amount payable by the eligible body under subsection (4) as a condition of those matching payments.

                   Within 14 days after the commencement of this Schedule, the Minister must, by writing, formulate a scheme (the **_DSAP scheme_**) for:

                     (a)  the grant of payment rights to entities who:

                              (i)  held an eligible interest in a dairy farm enterprise at 6.30 pm on 28 September 1999; and

                             (ii)  satisfy such other conditions as are set out in the scheme; and

##### <a id="11"></a>11  General policy objectives for the DSAP scheme

                   The DSAP scheme must be directed towards ensuring the achievement of the policy objectives set out in clauses 12 to 23.

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Types of payment rights

             (1)  This clause sets out a policy objective for the DSAP scheme.

             (2)  The objective is that there are to be 3 types of payment rights, as follows:

                     (a)  the first type of payment rights are to be known as **_standard payment rights_**;

                     (b)  the second type of payment rights are to be known as **_exceptional events supplementary payment rights_**;

                     (c)  the third type of payment rights are to be known as **_anomalous circumstances payment rights_**.

##### <a id="13"></a>13  Standard payment right

             (1)  This clause sets out policy objectives for the DSAP scheme.

Basic eligibility criteria

             (2)  The first objective is that an entity is not eligible to be granted a standard payment right unless:

                     (a)  the entity held an eligible interest in a dairy farm enterprise at 6.30 pm on 28 September 1999; and

                     (b)  either or both of the following conditions are satisfied:

                              (i)  during the 1998‑1999 financial year, the dairy farm enterprise delivered market milk;

                             (ii)  during the 1998‑1999 financial year, the dairy farm enterprise delivered manufacturing milk.

Calculation of face value

             (3)  The second objective is that the calculation of the face value of an entity’s standard payment right must be consistent with the following examples:

                     (a)  if the entity is the only entity who had an eligible interest in the dairy farm enterprise at 6.30 pm on 28 September 1999—the face value of the entity’s standard payment right equals the overall enterprise amount;

                     (b)  if:

                              (i)  there are 2 or more entities who had an eligible interest in the dairy farm enterprise at 6.30 pm on  28 September 1999; and

                             (ii)  under the scheme, the enterprise is not taken to be subject to an eligible dairy sharefarming arrangement or an eligible dairy leasing arrangement;

                            the face value of the first‑mentioned entity’s standard payment right is that entity’s share of the overall enterprise amount, worked out on a basis that corresponds to the basis on which milk revenues were shared between the entities as at 6.30 pm on 28 September 1999;

                     (c)  if:

                              (i)  there are 2 entities who had an eligible interest in the dairy farm enterprise at 6.30 pm on 28 September 1999; and

                             (ii)  under the scheme, the enterprise is taken to be subject to an eligible dairy sharefarming arrangement and those entities are taken to be parties to that arrangement; and

                            (iii)  the first‑mentioned entity is an entity who, under the scheme, is taken to have provided the essential capital contribution required to achieve access to the market milk premium;

                            the face value of the first‑mentioned entity’s standard payment right is the sum of:

                            (iv)  the premium component of the overall enterprise amount; and

                             (v)  that entity’s share of the non‑premium component of the overall enterprise amount, worked out on a basis that corresponds to the basis on which milk revenues were shared between the entities as at 6.30 pm on 28 September 1999;

                     (d)  if:

                              (i)  there are 2 entities who had an eligible interest in the dairy farm enterprise at 6.30 pm on 28 September 1999; and

                             (ii)  under the scheme, the enterprise is taken to be subject to an eligible dairy sharefarming arrangement and those entities are taken to be parties to that arrangement; and

                            (iii)  the first‑mentioned entity is not an entity who, under the scheme, is taken to have provided the essential capital contribution required to achieve access to the market milk premium;

                            the face value of the first‑mentioned entity’s standard payment right is that entity’s share of the non‑premium component of the overall enterprise amount, worked out on a basis that corresponds to the basis on which milk revenues were shared between the entities as at 6.30 pm on 28 September 1999;

                     (e)  if:

                              (i)  there are 2 entities who had an eligible interest in the dairy farm enterprise at 6.30 pm on 28 September 1999; and

                             (ii)  under the scheme, the enterprise is taken to be subject to an eligible dairy leasing arrangement and those entities are taken to be parties to that arrangement; and

                            (iii)  the first‑mentioned entity is an entity who, under the scheme, is taken to have provided the essential capital contribution required to achieve access to the market milk premium;

                            the face value of the first‑mentioned entity’s standard payment right is the premium component of the overall enterprise amount;

                      (f)  if:

                              (i)  there are 2 entities who had an eligible interest in the dairy farm enterprise at 6.30 pm on 28 September 1999; and

                             (ii)  under the scheme, the enterprise is taken to be subject to an eligible dairy leasing arrangement and those entities are taken to be parties to that arrangement; and

                            (iii)  the first‑mentioned entity is not an entity who, under the scheme, is taken to have provided the essential capital contribution required to achieve access to the market milk premium;

                            the face value of the first‑mentioned entity’s standard payment right is the non‑premium component of the overall enterprise amount.

             (4)  Paragraphs (3)(c), (d), (e) and (f) deal with common types of arrangements that involve 2 parties. Those paragraphs do not, by implication, limit the capacity of the DSAP scheme to deal with less common types of arrangements that involve 3 or more parties—see clause 34.

Essential capital contribution

             (5)  In formulating a provision of the DSAP scheme under which an entity is taken to have provided the essential capital contribution required to achieve access to the market milk premium, the Minister must not have regard to any matters other than the following:

                     (a)  whether the entity is the owner of a quota relating to the delivery of market milk;

                     (b)  whether the entity is the owner of the land on which the eligible dairy farm enterprise is carried on;

                     (c)  whether the entity is the owner of a significant proportion of the livestock used in, or for purposes incidental to, the carrying on of the eligible dairy farm enterprise.

             (6)  For the purposes of paragraph (5)(c), the proportion of livestock owned by a partner in a partnership is taken to be the same as the proportion of the livestock owned by the partnership.

             (7)  For the purposes of paragraph (5)(c), a proportion of less than 25% is taken not to be a significant proportion.

##### <a id="14"></a>14  Exceptional events supplementary payment right

             (1)  This clause sets out policy objectives for the DSAP scheme.

Basic eligibility criteria

             (2)  The first objective is that an exceptional events supplementary payment right must not be granted to an entity in respect of a particular dairy farm enterprise unless:

                     (a)  the entity has already been granted a standard payment right in respect of the enterprise; and

##### <a id="37DA"></a>37DA  Basic market milk payment rights—eligibility etc.

Basic eligibility criteria

             (1)  It is a policy objective that an entity is not eligible to be granted a basic market milk payment right unless:

                     (a)  the entity has been granted a payment right under the DSAP scheme in respect of a dairy farm enterprise (the **_qualifying enterprise_**); and

                     (b)  the entity held an interest (of a kind referred to in the SDA scheme) in that enterprise, or in any other dairy farm enterprise, at a time referred to in the SDA scheme; and

Note:       See also subclause (4) for how those delivery numbers are worked out.

Calculation of face value

             (2)  It is a policy objective that the face value of an entity’s basic market milk payment right is to be a share (worked out in accordance with the SDA scheme) of the overall market milk amount for the qualifying enterprise.

Interpretation

             (3)  For the purposes of this clause, the **_overall market milk amount_** for the qualifying enterprise is:

                     (a)  if the market milk number is at least 25.1 and less than 30.1—$10,000; or

                     (b)  if the market milk number is at least 30.1—$15,000.

             (4)  A reference in this clause to the total number of litres of market milk, or the total number of litres of manufacturing milk, delivered by the qualifying enterprise in the 1998‑1999 financial year is a reference to that number as determined by the DAA to have taken to have been delivered by that enterprise in that year.

             (5)  This clause is subject to clause 37V (about the effect of death on eligibility etc. for the grant of payment rights).

                     (c)  the number (the **_market milk number_**) worked out in accordance with the following formula is at least 35.1 (rounding to 1 decimal place and rounding up if the second decimal place is 5 or more):

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00561/Html/3c4bbd55-2661-4254-a761-caed35a35409_files/image003.gif)

Note:       See also subclause (5) for how those delivery numbers are worked out.

Calculation of face value

             (2)  It is a policy objective that the face value of an entity’s additional market milk payment right is to be a share (worked out in accordance with the SDA scheme) of the overall market milk amount for the qualifying enterprise.

Interpretation

             (3)  For the purposes of this clause, the **_overall market milk amount_** for the qualifying enterprise is the amount worked out in accordance with the following formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00561/Html/3c4bbd55-2661-4254-a761-caed35a35409_files/image004.gif)

where:

                    <a name="relev-cent"></a>**_relevant cents_** means:

                     (a)  if the market milk number is at least 45—12 cents; or

                     (b)  if the market milk number is at least 35.1 and less than 45—the number of cents worked out in accordance with the following formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00561/Html/3c4bbd55-2661-4254-a761-caed35a35409_files/image005.gif)

             (4)  However, if the amount calculated under subclause (3) is more than $60,000, then the **_overall market milk amount_** for the qualifying enterprise is taken to be $60,000.

             (5)  A reference in this clause to the total number of litres of market milk, or the total number of litres of manufacturing milk, delivered by the qualifying enterprise in the 1998‑1999 financial year is a reference to that number as determined by the DAA to have taken to have been delivered by that enterprise in that year.

                     (b)  the conditions in paragraphs 51(1)(a), (b) and (c) of this Schedule are satisfied (about the DAA having made an error); and

                     (c)  the DAA has been unable to cancel a number of units (the **_protected units_**) in the DSAP payment right because of the operation of subclause 51(2).

             (2)  It is a policy objective that the amount of the reduction is to be equal to the total face value of the protected units.

             (3)  If the amount of the reduction would exceed the face value of the entity’s basic market milk payment right or additional market milk payment right, then it is a policy objective that the face value of that payment right is to be reduced to zero.

##### <a id="37G"></a>37G  Discretionary payment rights—eligibility

             (1)  It is a policy objective that an entity is not eligible to be granted a discretionary payment right unless the entity satisfies clause 37H or 37J.

                             (ii)  the information relates to that enterprise;

                     (e)  the recording or disclosure is in connection with the administration of:

### Division 4—Recovery of scheme debts

##### <a id="44"></a>44  Scheme debt

                   For the purposes of this Division, a **_scheme debt_** is so much of an amount paid, or purportedly paid, to an entity by way of a DSAP payment or an SDA payment as represents an overpayment.

##### <a id="45"></a>45  Scheme debts are debts due to the industry services body

                   A scheme debt is a debt due to the industry services body.

##### <a id="46"></a>46  Recovery by legal proceedings

             (2)  An action under subclause (1) may be instituted by the DAA in its official name.

##### <a id="47"></a>47  Recovery by set‑off

                   If an entity is liable to pay a scheme debt, the scheme debt may be deducted from one or more DSAP payments or SDA payments that are payable to the entity, and if the scheme debt is so deducted, the DSAP payment or SDA payment (as the case may be) is taken to have been paid in full to the entity.

##### <a id="48"></a>48  Industry services body may collect money from a person who owes money to an entity

What this clause does

             (1)  This clause allows for the collection of money from a person who owes money to an entity that has a scheme debt.

The DAA may give direction

             (2)  The DAA may direct a person (the **_third party_**) who owes, or may later owe, money (the **_available money_**) to the entity to pay some or all of the available money to the industry services body in accordance with the direction. The DAA must give a copy of the direction to the entity.

Limit on directions

             (3)  The direction cannot require an amount to be paid to the industry services body at a time before it becomes owing by the third party to the entity.

Third party to comply

             (4)  The third party must comply with the direction.

                    Penalty:  20 penalty units.

Note:          Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.

             (5)  The third party is not guilty of an offence against subclause (4) if the third party complies with the direction so far as the third party is able to do so.

Note:          A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in subclause (5). See subsection 13.3(3) of the _Criminal Code_.

Court orders

             (6)  If a person is convicted of an offence in relation to a refusal or failure of the third party to comply with subclause (4), the court may (in addition to imposing a penalty on the convicted person) order the convicted person to pay to the industry services body an amount up to the amount involved in the refusal or failure of the third party.

Indemnity

             (7)  Any payment made by the third party under this clause is taken to have been made with the authority of the entity and of all other persons concerned, and the third party is indemnified for the payment.

Notice

             (8)  If the whole of the scheme debt of the entity is discharged before any payment is made by the third party, the DAA must immediately give notice to the third party of that fact.

             (9)  If a part of the scheme debt of the entity is discharged before any payment is made by the third party, the DAA must:

                     (a)  immediately give notice to the third party of that fact; and

                     (b)  make an appropriate variation to the direction; and

                     (c)  give a copy of the varied direction to the entity.

When third party is taken to owe money

           (10)  The third party is taken to owe money to the entity if:

                     (a)  money is due or accruing by the third party to the entity; or

                     (b)  the third party holds money for or on account of the entity; or

                     (c)  the third party holds money on account of some other person for payment to the entity; or

                     (d)  the third party has authority from some other person to pay money to the entity;

whether or not the payment of the money to the entity is dependent on a pre‑condition that has not been fulfilled.

##### <a id="49"></a>49  Penalty for unpaid scheme debts

             (1)  If an amount of a scheme debt that is payable by an entity remains unpaid after the day by which it must be paid, the entity is liable to a penalty at the rate of 16% per year on the unpaid amount.

             (2)  The penalty is calculated from the day on which the amount becomes due to be paid.

             (3)  The fact that a judgment is entered or given in a court for the payment of an amount of a scheme debt, or of a composite amount that includes an amount of a scheme debt, does not of itself cause the amount of a scheme debt to stop being unpaid for the purposes of this clause.

             (4)  If the judgment debt bears interest, the penalty payable under this clause is reduced (but not beyond nil) by the following amount:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00561/Html/3c4bbd55-2661-4254-a761-caed35a35409_files/image006.gif)

where:

                    <a name="scheme-debt-compon"></a>**_scheme debt component_** means so much of the judgment debt as consists of a scheme debt.

             (5)  For the purposes of this clause, the day on which a scheme debt is due to be paid is the day on which the DSAP payment or SDA payment concerned was paid.

             (6)  This clause does not apply to a scheme debt that is attributable (in whole or in part) to an error made by the DAA or the industry services body, where the DSAP payment or SDA payment concerned was received in good faith.

             (7)  The DSAP scheme or the SDA scheme (as the case may be) must empower the DAA to remit the whole or a part of an amount of penalty payable under this clause.

             (8)  A penalty payable under this clause may be recovered by the Commonwealth as a debt to the Commonwealth.

             (9)  This clause has no effect to the extent (if any) to which it imposes taxation (within the meaning of section 55 of the Constitution).

### Division 5—Cancellation of units

##### <a id="50"></a>50  Cancellation of units because of the making of a false statement

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  before a payment right was granted, an entity made a false statement to a person who was exercising powers, or performing functions, under or in connection with this Part, the DSAP scheme or the SDA scheme; and

                     (b)  either:

                              (i)  the payment right was granted because of the making of the false statement; or

                             (ii)  as a result of the making of the false statement, the face value of the payment right exceeds the proper amount of the face value;

the DSAP scheme or the SDA scheme (as the case may be) must authorise the DAA to:

                     (c)  if subparagraph (b)(i) applies—cancel all of the units in the payment right; or

                     (d)  if subparagraph (b)(ii) applies—cancel the number of units in the payment right worked out by:

                              (i)  dividing the number of whole dollars in the amount of the excess by 32; and

                             (ii)  if the result of the division is not a whole number—rounding down the result to the nearest whole number (treating zero as a whole number).

             (2)  If a unit is cancelled as authorised under this clause, this Schedule and the DSAP scheme or the SDA scheme (as the case may be) have, and are taken always to have had, effect as if the unit was never in existence.

Note:          This may result in an overpayment. For recovery of overpayments, see Division 4.

             (3)  In this clause:

                    <a name="fals-statem"></a>**_false statement_** means a statement (whether made orally, in a document or in any other way) that:

                     (a)  is false or misleading in a material particular; or

                     (b)  omits any matter or thing without which the statement is misleading in a material particular.

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  the DAA made an error in relation to the grant of a payment right; and

                     (b)  clause 50 does not apply; and

                     (c)  either:

                              (i)  the payment right would not have been granted if the DAA had not made that error; or

                             (ii)  the face value of the payment right exceeds the amount that would have been the amount of the face value if the DAA had not made that error;

the DSAP scheme or the SDA scheme (as the case may be) must authorise the DAA to:

                     (d)  if subparagraph (c)(i) applies—cancel all of the units in the payment right; or

                     (e)  if subparagraph (c)(ii) applies—cancel the number of units in the payment right worked out by:

                              (i)  dividing the number of whole dollars in the amount of the excess by 32; and

                             (ii)  if the result of the division is not a whole number—rounding down the result to the nearest whole number (treating zero as a whole number).

             (2)  The DSAP scheme or the SDA scheme (as the case may be) may provide that the DAA is not to cancel a unit as authorised under this clause if the DAA is satisfied that the entity, or each of the entities, who received a DSAP payment or an SDA payment in respect of the unit acted in good faith.

             (3)  If a unit is cancelled as authorised under this clause, this Schedule and the DSAP scheme or the SDA scheme (as the case may be) have, and are taken always to have had, effect as if the unit was never in existence.

Note:          This may result in an overpayment. For recovery of overpayments, see Division 4.

DSAP scheme

             (1)  If:

                     (b)  the first entity breaches the undertaking; and

                     (c)  the DAA gives the first entity a written notice directing the first entity to comply with the undertaking before the end of the period of 60 days beginning when the direction is given; and

                     (d)  the first entity contravenes the direction;

the DSAP scheme must authorise the DAA to cancel the unit.

          (1A)  For the purposes of subclause (1), **_eligible entity_** has the same meaning as in clause 21.

SDA scheme

          (1B)  If:

                     (a)  an entity (the **_first entity_**) has given the DAA an undertaking to assign a unit in a payment right under the SDA scheme to an eligible entity as mentioned in paragraph 37N(3)(b); and

                     (b)  the first entity breaches the undertaking; and

                     (c)  the DAA gives the first entity a written notice directing the first entity to comply with the undertaking before the end of the period of 60 days beginning when the direction is given; and

                     (d)  the first entity contravenes the direction;

the SDA scheme must authorise the DAA to cancel the unit.

          (1C)  For the purposes of subclause (1B), **_eligible entity_** has the same meaning as in clause 37N.

When cancellation takes effect

             (2)  The cancellation of a unit as authorised under this clause takes effect at the end of that 60‑day period.

                             (ii)  a decision is made under the farm help re‑establishment grant scheme (within the meaning of the _Farm Household Support Act 1992_) that the entity is qualified for a dairy‑type grant; and

                     (c)  immediately before the decision is made, the entity is the registered owner of one or more unencumbered units in the payment right;

the DSAP scheme or the SDA scheme (as the case may be) must authorise the DAA to cancel those units.

             (2)  The cancellation of a unit as authorised under this clause takes effect from the time when the decision mentioned in the relevant subparagraph of paragraph (1)(b) is made.

             (3)  A reference in this clause to an **_unencumbered unit_** is a reference to a unit in respect of which no charge is registered.
