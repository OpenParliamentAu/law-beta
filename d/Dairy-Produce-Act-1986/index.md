to the manufacturer of that dairy produce.
	(2)	The Corporation may, in any case where money is due and payable by a manufacturer of dairy produce to the Corporation, set off that amount against any market support payment that would otherwise be payable to the manufacturer under this section.
94A  Import offset payments
	(1)	In this section:
relevant year means the financial year that began on 1 July 1991 or any later financial year ending before the WTO Agreement year starts.
	(2)	If:

	(b)	at a time (the relevant time) during that year the manufacturer or a body corporate that was related to the manufacturer imported into Australia a number of units of dairy produce of the same kind as, or of a similar kind to, the first‑mentioned dairy produce;
the market support payments that would otherwise be payable to the manufacturer under section 94 are, despite any other provision of this Division, reduced by an amount equal to the amount of the market support payment that would have been payable to the manufacturer if at the relevant time the manufacturer had exported from Australia in accordance with paragraph 94(1)(b) the same number of units of the first‑mentioned dairy produce.
	(3)	The Corporation is to determine whether the market support payments that would otherwise be payable to a manufacturer of dairy produce under section 94 are reduced under subsection (2) of this section and, if so, the amount of the reduction.
	(4)	The Corporation must give written notice to the manufacturer of its determination.
	(5)	For the purposes of this section:
	(a)	the question whether a particular kind of dairy produce is of a similar kind to dairy produce of another kind is to be determined by the Corporation; and

	(a)	listing the kinds of dairy produce in respect of which market support payments are payable; and
	(b)	setting out, in relation to each kind of dairy produce so listed, any kind or kinds of dairy produce that it has determined to be of a similar kind to the first‑mentioned kind of dairy produce.
95  Rate of market support payments in relation to prescribed dairy produce
	(1)	The Corporation may declare in writing dairy produce of a particular kind to be prescribed dairy produce for the purposes of this section.
	(2)	Where the Corporation makes such a declaration, it shall also determine in writing the rate at which market support payments are payable in respect of dairy produce of that kind.
	(3)	The rate of market support payments mentioned in subsection (2) is an amount per unit of that dairy produce ascertained in accordance with the formula  where:
A is the relevant percentage in force at the time when that dairy produce is so exported in relation to dairy produce of that kind; and
B is the estimated average export price in force at the time when that dairy produce is so exported in relation to each unit of dairy produce of that kind.
	(4)	For the purposes of subsection (3), the relevant percentage in force at a particular time in relation to dairy produce of a particular kind that is declared under subsection (1) to be prescribed dairy produce is:
	(a)	if no determination under subsection (6) is in force in relation to dairy produce of that kind at that time—the percentage that under subsection (4A) is the percentage applicable in relation to prescribed dairy produce exported at that time; or
	(b)	if a determination under subsection (6) is in force in relation to dairy produce of that kind at that time—the percentage that is specified in that determination to be the relevant percentage in relation to dairy produce of that kind.
	(4A)	For the purposes of paragraph (4)(a), the percentage applicable in relation to prescribed dairy produce exported at any time during the financial year specified in Column 2 of an item in the following Table is the percentage specified in Column 3 of that item.

	(4B)	The inclusion in the Table in subsection (4A) of a financial year that is the WTO Agreement year or a later financial year does not displace the rule in section 94 that for market support to be payable the export must occur before the start of the WTO Agreement year.
	(5)	For the purposes of subsection (3), the estimated average export price in force at a particular time in relation to a unit of dairy produce of a particular kind that is declared under subsection (1) to be prescribed dairy product is the price that is, in a determination in force under subsection (9) at that time, specified as the estimated average export price in relation to a unit of dairy produce of that kind.
	(6)	Subject to subsections (7) and (8), the Corporation may, at any time, for such reasons as it considers appropriate, determine, in writing, with effect from a day specified in the determination, the relevant percentage in relation to dairy produce of a particular kind to be a specified percentage (being a percentage that is less than the percentage that, apart from the determination, would be the relevant percentage in force at that time in relation to that dairy produce) and, where the Corporation makes such a determination, the determination shall have effect, according to its tenor, from that day until it is revoked or until a later determination comes into effect under this subsection in respect of dairy produce of that kind.
	(7)	Without otherwise limiting, by implication, the generality of subsection (6), the Corporation shall exercise its power under that subsection to determine the relevant percentage in relation to dairy produce of a particular kind with effect from a particular day in any case where the Corporation is satisfied that the sum of the amount likely to be standing to the credit of the Market Support Fund on that particular day and the amounts likely to be paid into the Market Support Fund during the period of 12 months after that day is less than the total amount that would, but for the making of the determination, be likely to be required to be paid out of the Market Support Fund by way of market support payments in respect of all dairy produce that is exported during that period.
	(8)	The Corporation shall not, in the making of a determination in the exercise of its powers under subsection (6), take into account any reason other than a reason of the kind referred to in subsection (7) unless it has informed the executive, in writing, of that reason and the executive has agreed that that reason should be taken into account in the making of the determination.
	(9)	The Corporation may, at any time, determine, in writing, with effect from a day specified in the determination, a price to be the estimated average export price in relation to a unit of dairy produce of a particular kind, and, where the Corporation makes such a determination, the determination shall have effect, according to its tenor, from that day:
	(a)	unless paragraph (b) applies—for a period of 12 months; or
	(b)	if it is revoked, or a later determination comes into effect under this subsection, within that period of 12 months—until that revocation or until that later determination comes into effect.
	(10)	Without otherwise limiting, by implication, the generality of subsection (9), the Corporation shall, in exercising its powers under that subsection in relation to dairy produce of a particular kind:
	(a)	if that dairy produce is declared under subsection (1) to be prescribed dairy produce with effect from 1 July 1986—make its first determination in respect of dairy produce of that kind with effect from that day; and
	(b)	if that dairy produce is declared under subsection (1) to be prescribed dairy produce with effect from a later day—make its first determination in respect of dairy produce of that kind with effect from that later day;
and shall make subsequent determinations, in relation to that dairy produce, to take effect at intervals of not more than 12 months after the day with effect from which the preceding determination took effect.
96  Rate of market support payments in relation to dairy produce other than prescribed dairy produce
	(1)	Where dairy produce that is exported from Australia is not, at the time when it is so exported, dairy produce of a kind that is declared under subsection 95(1) to be prescribed dairy produce, the rate at which market support payments are payable in respect of that dairy produce is the amount per unit of that dairy produce that is, in a determination in force under subsection (2) at that time, specified to be the appropriate amount per unit of that dairy produce.
	(2)	The Corporation may, at any time, after having regard to the rates of market support payments that are applicable to dairy produce of kinds that are declared under subsection 95(1) to be prescribed dairy produce and to such other matters as it considers to be relevant, determine, in writing, with effect from a day specified in the determination, an amount per unit of dairy produce of a particular kind that is not declared under subsection 95(1) to be prescribed dairy produce to be the rate to which market support payments are to be paid in respect of each unit of dairy produce of that kind and, where the Corporation makes such a determination, the determination shall have effect, according to its tenor, from that day until it is revoked or until a later determination comes into effect under this subsection.
	(3)	Without otherwise limiting, by implication, the generality of subsection (2), the Corporation shall, in exercising its powers under that subsection in relation to dairy produce of a particular kind, being dairy produce that is not declared under subsection 95(1) to be prescribed dairy produce:
	(a)	if dairy produce of that kind is dairy produce on 1 July 1986—make its first determination in respect of dairy produce of that kind with effect from that day; and
	(b)	if dairy produce of that kind becomes dairy produce on a later day—make its first determination in respect of dairy produce of that kind with effect from that later day.

	(b)	a foreign country is prescribed for the purposes of this section;
the Corporation may, by determination in writing, specify a special rate at which market support payment is payable, in lieu of the rate at which market support payment would be payable by virtue of section 95 or 96, in respect of each unit of dairy produce, or of dairy produce of that kind, as the case may be, that is exported to that country while those restrictions are in force or specify that no market support payment is so payable and may, from time to time, by determination in writing, vary any determination so made.
	(2)	The Corporation may, by determination in writing, in relation to dairy produce that is:
	(a)	produced in Australia during the year commencing on 1 July 1986; and

	(3)	A determination made under subsection (2) may specify a rate of market support payment that is payable in respect of dairy produce exported pursuant to an agreement specified in the determination or pursuant to an agreement included within a class of agreements specified in the determination.
	(4)	The Corporation may, in a case where dairy produce of a particular kind has been manufactured from ingredients that include imported dairy produce, by determination in writing, specify a special rate at which market support payment is payable in respect of each unit of dairy produce of that kind, in lieu of the rate of market support payment that would be payable, by virtue of section 95 or 96, or subsection (1) of this section, in respect of each such unit of that dairy produce and the Corporation may, from time to time, by determination in writing, vary any determination so made.
99  Corporation may guarantee rate of market support payments
	(1)	A person may make application to the Corporation, in writing, in a form approved by the Corporation for the purposes of this section, requesting the Corporation to determine that the rate of market support payment that is in force at the time of the making of that application in respect of units of dairy produce of a particular kind will be paid in respect of dairy produce of that kind that is exported from Australia by that person during a period, or under a contract of sale (whether or not that contract has been entered into at the time of the application), that is specified by that person in that application.
	(2)	Upon receipt of an application by a person under subsection (1), the Corporation may, in its discretion, determine in writing that the rate of market support payment that was in force on the day when the application was made in respect of the dairy produce to which the application relates shall be paid:
	(a)	in respect of all of that dairy produce that is exported by that person during the period that is the subject of that application or during such part of that period as the Corporation specifies or in respect of such part of that dairy produce as the Corporation specifies; or
	(b)	in respect of all of that dairy produce that is exported by that person under that contract for sale that is the subject of the application or in respect of such part of that dairy produce as the Corporation specifies;
and, where the Corporation makes such a determination, market support payments shall be paid at that rate in respect of the dairy produce to which the determination relates, notwithstanding any other provision of this Act.

Note:	See section 125A.
Part 1—Introduction
  
1  Simplified outline
		The following is a simplified outline of this Schedule and Part 9C of the Farm Household Support Act 1992:
•	This Schedule and Part 9C of the Farm Household Support Act 1992 provide a framework for the implementation of the Dairy Industry Adjustment Program.
•	The main object of the Dairy Industry Adjustment Program is to help the dairy industry or dairy communities adjust to deregulation by providing for 4 types of grants, as follows:
	(a)	DSAP payments (made under this Schedule);
	(b)	SDA payments (made under this Schedule);
	(c)	dairy exit payments (made under Part 9C of the Farm Household Support Act 1992);
	(d)	payments under the Dairy Regional Assistance Programme (see clause 86).
•	Generally, DSAP payments are calculated by reference to 1998‑1999 milk deliveries at a rate of 46.23 cents per litre for market milk and a national average rate of 8.96 cents per litre for manufacturing milk.
•	There are 3 types of SDA payment rights: basic market milk payment rights, additional market milk payment rights and discretionary payment rights.
•	Dairy exit payments are available for farmers who choose to leave agriculture.
•	The Dairy Adjustment Authority will administer DSAP and SDA payment rights.
•	The Dairy Industry Adjustment Program will be funded by a dairy adjustment levy on milk products.
•	The levy will be paid into a Dairy Structural Adjustment Fund, and DSAP payments, SDA payments, dairy exit payments and payments under the Dairy Regional Assistance Programme will be paid out of that Fund.

Part 2—DSAP payments and SDA payments
Division 1—DSAP scheme
9  Simplified outline
		The following is a simplified outline of this Division:
•	This Division provides a framework for the making of DSAP payments.
•	The Minister is required to formulate a scheme (the DSAP scheme) for the grant of payment rights to entities who held an eligible interest in a dairy farm enterprise on 28 September 1999.
•	The DSAP scheme will provide for 3 types of payment rights, as follows:
	(a)	standard payment rights; 
	(b)	exceptional events supplementary payment rights.
	(c)	anomalous circumstances payment rights.
•	Standard payment rights will be based on milk deliveries in 1998‑1999, and will be worked out by reference to a rate of 46.23 cents per litre for market milk and a national average rate of 8.96 cents per litre for manufacturing milk.
•	Exceptional events supplementary payment rights may be granted in cases where, because of exceptional events, the volume of milk deliveries in 1998‑1999 is less than 70% of the average milk deliveries in the 3 previous financial years.
•	Anomalous circumstances payment rights may be granted to entities who have been affected by anomalous circumstances.
•	Entities who wish to obtain a payment right under the DSAP scheme must undertake a farm business assessment.
•	The total value of the payment rights granted to an entity must not exceed $350,000 unless more than 70% of the entity’s total gross income consists of dairy income.
•	Payment rights will be divided into units, where each unit has a face value of $32.
•	A registered owner of a unit will be entitled to a quarterly payment of $1 for each of the 32 quarters in the 8‑year period beginning on 1 July 2000.
10  DSAP scheme
		Within 14 days after the commencement of this Schedule, the Minister must, by writing, formulate a scheme (the DSAP scheme) for:
	(a)	the grant of payment rights to entities who:
	(i)	held an eligible interest in a dairy farm enterprise at 6.30 pm on 28 September 1999; and
	(ii)	satisfy such other conditions as are set out in the scheme; and
	(b)	the division of payment rights into units; and
	(c)	the registration of units; and
	(d)	the making of payments by the Corporation to registered owners of units.
11  General policy objectives for the DSAP scheme
		The DSAP scheme must be directed towards ensuring the achievement of the policy objectives set out in clauses 12 to 23.
12  Types of payment rights
	(1)	This clause sets out a policy objective for the DSAP scheme.
	(2)	The objective is that there are to be 3 types of payment rights, as follows:
	(a)	the first type of payment rights are to be known as standard payment rights;
	(b)	the second type of payment rights are to be known as exceptional events supplementary payment rights;
	(c)	the third type of payment rights are to be known as anomalous circumstances payment rights.
13  Standard payment right
	(1)	This clause sets out policy objectives for the DSAP scheme.
Basic eligibility criteria
	(2)	The first objective is that an entity is not eligible to be granted a standard payment right unless:
	(a)	the entity held an eligible interest in a dairy farm enterprise at 6.30 pm on 28 September 1999; and
	(b)	either or both of the following conditions are satisfied:
	(i)	during the 1998‑1999 financial year, the dairy farm enterprise delivered market milk;
	(ii)	during the 1998‑1999 financial year, the dairy farm enterprise delivered manufacturing milk.
Calculation of face value
	(3)	The second objective is that the calculation of the face value of an entity’s standard payment right must be consistent with the following examples:
	(a)	if the entity is the only entity who had an eligible interest in the dairy farm enterprise at 6.30 pm on 28 September 1999—the face value of the entity’s standard payment right equals the overall enterprise amount;
	(b)	if:
	(i)	there are 2 or more entities who had an eligible interest in the dairy farm enterprise at 6.30 pm on 28 September 1999; and
	(ii)	under the scheme, the enterprise is not taken to be subject to an eligible dairy sharefarming arrangement or an eligible dairy leasing arrangement;
		the face value of the first‑mentioned entity’s standard payment right is that entity’s share of the overall enterprise amount, worked out on a basis that corresponds to the basis on which milk revenues were shared between the entities as at 6.30 pm on 28 September 1999;
	(c)	if:
	(i)	there are 2 entities who had an eligible interest in the dairy farm enterprise at 6.30 pm on 28 September 1999; and
	(ii)	under the scheme, the enterprise is taken to be subject to an eligible dairy sharefarming arrangement and those entities are taken to be parties to that arrangement; and
	(iii)	the first‑mentioned entity is an entity who, under the scheme, is taken to have provided the essential capital contribution required to achieve access to the market milk premium;
		the face value of the first‑mentioned entity’s standard payment right is the sum of:
	(iv)	the premium component of the overall enterprise amount; and
	(v)	that entity’s share of the non‑premium component of the overall enterprise amount, worked out on a basis that corresponds to the basis on which milk revenues were shared between the entities as at 6.30 pm on 28 September 1999;
	(d)	if:
	(i)	there are 2 entities who had an eligible interest in the dairy farm enterprise at 6.30 pm on 28 September 1999; and
	(ii)	under the scheme, the enterprise is taken to be subject to an eligible dairy sharefarming arrangement and those entities are taken to be parties to that arrangement; and
	(iii)	the first‑mentioned entity is not an entity who, under the scheme, is taken to have provided the essential capital contribution required to achieve access to the market milk premium;
		the face value of the first‑mentioned entity’s standard payment right is that entity’s share of the non‑premium component of the overall enterprise amount, worked out on a basis that corresponds to the basis on which milk revenues were shared between the entities as at 6.30 pm on 28 September 1999;
	(e)	if:
	(i)	there are 2 entities who had an eligible interest in the dairy farm enterprise at 6.30 pm on 28 September 1999; and
	(ii)	under the scheme, the enterprise is taken to be subject to an eligible dairy leasing arrangement and those entities are taken to be parties to that arrangement; and
	(iii)	the first‑mentioned entity is an entity who, under the scheme, is taken to have provided the essential capital contribution required to achieve access to the market milk premium;
		the face value of the first‑mentioned entity’s standard payment right is the premium component of the overall enterprise amount;
	(f)	if:
	(i)	there are 2 entities who had an eligible interest in the dairy farm enterprise at 6.30 pm on 28 September 1999; and
	(ii)	under the scheme, the enterprise is taken to be subject to an eligible dairy leasing arrangement and those entities are taken to be parties to that arrangement; and
	(iii)	the first‑mentioned entity is not an entity who, under the scheme, is taken to have provided the essential capital contribution required to achieve access to the market milk premium;
		the face value of the first‑mentioned entity’s standard payment right is the non‑premium component of the overall enterprise amount.
	(4)	Paragraphs (3)(c), (d), (e) and (f) deal with common types of arrangements that involve 2 parties. Those paragraphs do not, by implication, limit the capacity of the DSAP scheme to deal with less common types of arrangements that involve 3 or more parties—see clause 34.
Essential capital contribution
	(5)	In formulating a provision of the DSAP scheme under which an entity is taken to have provided the essential capital contribution required to achieve access to the market milk premium, the Minister must not have regard to any matters other than the following:

	(b)	whether the entity is the owner of the land on which the eligible dairy farm enterprise is carried on;
	(c)	whether the entity is the owner of a significant proportion of the livestock used in, or for purposes incidental to, the carrying on of the eligible dairy farm enterprise.
	(6)	For the purposes of paragraph (5)(c), the proportion of livestock owned by a partner in a partnership is taken to be the same as the proportion of the livestock owned by the partnership.
	(7)	For the purposes of paragraph (5)(c), a proportion of less than 25% is taken not to be a significant proportion.

Division 1A—Supplementary Dairy Assistance (SDA) scheme
37A  Simplified outline
		The following is a simplified outline of this Division:
•	This Division provides a framework for the making of SDA payments.
•	The Minister is required to formulate a scheme (the SDA scheme) for the grant of the following types of payment rights to entities:
	(aa)	basic market milk payment rights;
	(a)	additional market milk payment rights;
	(b)	discretionary payment rights.
•	Additional market milk payment rights will be based on market milk deliveries in 1998‑1999, and will range from 0.12 cents per litre to 12 cents per litre depending on the percentage of market milk deliveries in that year.
•	Discretionary payment rights may be granted to entities in the circumstances set out in clause 37G.
•	Payment rights will be divided into units, where each unit has a face value of $32.
•	Payments will be made to registered owners of units in accordance with the SDA scheme.
37B  Formulation of scheme
		The Minister must, by writing, formulate a scheme (the SDA scheme) for:
	(a)	the grant of payment rights to entities who satisfy the conditions set out in the scheme; and
	(b)	the division of payment rights into units; and
	(c)	the registration of units; and
	(d)	the making of payments by the Corporation to registered owners of units.
37C  General policy objectives for the SDA scheme
		The SDA scheme must be directed towards ensuring the achievement of the policy objectives set out in clauses 37D to 37P.
37D  Types of payment rights
	(1)	It is a policy objective that there are to be 3 types of payment rights, as follows:
	(aa)	a type called basic market milk payment rights;
	(a)	a type called additional market milk payment rights;
	(b)	a type called discretionary payment rights.
	(2)	It is a policy objective that, if an entity is eligible to be granted a basic market milk payment right and an additional market milk payment right, the entity is eligible to be granted the payment right with the higher face value and is not eligible to be granted the other payment right.
37DA  Basic market milk payment rights—eligibility etc.
Basic eligibility criteria
	(1)	It is a policy objective that an entity is not eligible to be granted a basic market milk payment right unless:
	(a)	the entity has been granted a payment right under the DSAP scheme in respect of a dairy farm enterprise (the qualifying enterprise); and
	(b)	the entity held an interest (of a kind referred to in the SDA scheme) in that enterprise, or in any other dairy farm enterprise, at a time referred to in the SDA scheme; and
	(c)	the number (the market milk number) worked out in accordance with the following formula is at least 25.1 (rounding to 1 decimal place and rounding up if the second decimal place is 5 or more):

Note:	See also subclause (4) for how those delivery numbers are worked out.
Calculation of face value
	(2)	It is a policy objective that the face value of an entity’s basic market milk payment right is to be a share (worked out in accordance with the SDA scheme) of the overall market milk amount for the qualifying enterprise.
Interpretation
	(3)	For the purposes of this clause, the overall market milk amount for the qualifying enterprise is:
	(a)	if the market milk number is at least 25.1 and less than 30.1—$10,000; or
	(b)	if the market milk number is at least 30.1—$15,000.
	(4)	A reference in this clause to the total number of litres of market milk, or the total number of litres of manufacturing milk, delivered by the qualifying enterprise in the 1998‑1999 financial year is a reference to that number as determined by the DAA to have taken to have been delivered by that enterprise in that year.
	(5)	This clause is subject to clause 37V (about the effect of death on eligibility etc. for the grant of payment rights).
37E  Additional market milk payment rights—eligibility etc.
Basic eligibility criteria
	(1)	It is a policy objective that an entity is not eligible to be granted an additional market milk payment right unless:

	(b)	the entity held an interest (of a kind referred to in the SDA scheme) in that enterprise, or in any other dairy farm enterprise, at a time referred to in the SDA scheme; and
	(c)	the number (the market milk number) worked out in accordance with the following formula is at least 35.1 (rounding to 1 decimal place and rounding up if the second decimal place is 5 or more):

Note:	See also subclause (5) for how those delivery numbers are worked out.
Calculation of face value
	(2)	It is a policy objective that the face value of an entity’s additional market milk payment right is to be a share (worked out in accordance with the SDA scheme) of the overall market milk amount for the qualifying enterprise.
Interpretation
	(3)	For the purposes of this clause, the overall market milk amount for the qualifying enterprise is the amount worked out in accordance with the following formula:

where:
relevant cents means:
	(a)	if the market milk number is at least 45—12 cents; or
	(b)	if the market milk number is at least 35.1 and less than 45—the number of cents worked out in accordance with the following formula:

	(4)	However, if the amount calculated under subclause (3) is more than $60,000, then the overall market milk amount for the qualifying enterprise is taken to be $60,000.
	(5)	A reference in this clause to the total number of litres of market milk, or the total number of litres of manufacturing milk, delivered by the qualifying enterprise in the 1998‑1999 financial year is a reference to that number as determined by the DAA to have taken to have been delivered by that enterprise in that year.
	(6)	This clause is subject to clause 37V (about the effect of death on eligibility etc. for the grant of payment rights).

	(c)	the DAA has been unable to cancel a number of units (the protected units) in the DSAP payment right because of the operation of subclause 51(2).
	(2)	It is a policy objective that the amount of the reduction is to be equal to the total face value of the protected units.
	(3)	If the amount of the reduction would exceed the face value of the entity’s basic market milk payment right or additional market milk payment right, then it is a policy objective that the face value of that payment right is to be reduced to zero.
37G  Discretionary payment rights—eligibility
	(1)	It is a policy objective that an entity is not eligible to be granted a discretionary payment right unless the entity satisfies clause 37H or 37J.

	(2)	An action under subclause (1) may be instituted by the DAA in its official name.
47  Recovery by set‑off
		If an entity is liable to pay a scheme debt, the scheme debt may be deducted from one or more DSAP payments or SDA payments that are payable to the entity, and if the scheme debt is so deducted, the DSAP payment or SDA payment (as the case may be) is taken to have been paid in full to the entity.
48  Corporation may collect money from a person who owes money to an entity
What this clause does
	(1)	This clause allows the Corporation to collect money from a person who owes money to an entity that has a scheme debt.
The DAA may give direction
	(2)	The DAA may direct a person (the third party) who owes, or may later owe, money (the available money) to the entity to pay some or all of the available money to the Corporation in accordance with the direction. The DAA must give a copy of the direction to the entity.

Note:	A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in subclause (5). See subsection 13.3(3) of the Criminal Code.
Court orders
	(6)	If a person is convicted of an offence in relation to a refusal or failure of the third party to comply with subclause (4), the court may (in addition to imposing a penalty on the convicted person) order the convicted person to pay to the Corporation an amount up to the amount involved in the refusal or failure of the third party.
Indemnity
	(7)	Any payment made by the third party under this clause is taken to have been made with the authority of the entity and of all other persons concerned, and the third party is indemnified for the payment.
Notice
	(8)	If the whole of the scheme debt of the entity is discharged before any payment is made by the third party, the DAA must immediately give notice to the third party of that fact.
	(9)	If a part of the scheme debt of the entity is discharged before any payment is made by the third party, the DAA must:
	(a)	immediately give notice to the third party of that fact; and
	(b)	make an appropriate variation to the direction; and
	(c)	give a copy of the varied direction to the entity.
When third party is taken to owe money

	(c)	the third party holds money on account of some other person for payment to the entity; or

	(2)	The penalty is calculated from the day on which the amount becomes due to be paid.
	(3)	The fact that a judgment is entered or given in a court for the payment of an amount of a scheme debt, or of a composite amount that includes an amount of a scheme debt, does not of itself cause the amount of a scheme debt to stop being unpaid for the purposes of this clause.
	(4)	If the judgment debt bears interest, the penalty payable under this clause is reduced (but not beyond nil) by the following amount:

where:
scheme debt component means so much of the judgment debt as consists of a scheme debt.
	(5)	For the purposes of this clause, the day on which a scheme debt is due to be paid is the day on which the DSAP payment or SDA payment concerned was paid.
	(6)	This clause does not apply to a scheme debt that is attributable (in whole or in part) to an error made by the DAA or the Corporation, where the DSAP payment or SDA payment concerned was received in good faith.
	(7)	The DSAP scheme or the SDA scheme (as the case may be) must empower the DAA to remit the whole or a part of an amount of penalty payable under this clause.
	(8)	A penalty payable under this clause may be recovered by the Commonwealth as a debt to the Commonwealth.

Part II—Provision of services to the dairy industry
Division 1—Funding contract
5  Funding contract
	(1)	The Minister may, on behalf of the Commonwealth, enter into a contract with an eligible body that provides for the Commonwealth to make payments of the following kinds to the body:
	(a)	payments referred to as dairy service payments;
	(b)	payments made in respect of particular financial years, referred to as matching payments.
Note:	After a contract has been entered into, the eligible body can be declared as the industry services body under section 7.
	(2)	Before entering into the contract, the Minister must be satisfied that the terms of the contract make adequate provision to ensure that:
	(a)	dairy service payments are spent by the body on marketing, promotion, strategic policy development, research and development activities or other activities, for the benefit of the Australian dairy industry; and
	(b)	matching payments are spent by the body on research and development activities for the benefit of the Australian dairy industry and the Australian community generally.
	(3)	The contract does not have to oblige the Commonwealth to pay the full amounts that could be paid out of the money appropriated under section 6.
Note:	For example, the contract may provide for payments less than the limits specified in section 6 to take account of the costs of collecting new dairy levy amounts or old dairy levy amounts and to take account of refunds and payments made in error.
	(4)	The contract may include provisions relating to assets and liabilities that are transferred to the body under the Dairy Industry Service Reform Act 2003. This subsection does not impliedly limit the matters that may be included in the contract.
	(5)	This section does not impliedly limit the executive power of the Commonwealth to enter into agreements.
	(6)	The Minister must cause a copy of the contract to be tabled in each House of the Parliament within 14 sitting days of that House after the day on which the contract was entered into.
	(7)	If the contract is varied, the Minister must cause a copy of the contract as varied to be tabled in each House of the Parliament within 14 sitting days of that House after the variation occurred.
6  Appropriation for payments under funding contract
	(1)	The Consolidated Revenue Fund is appropriated for the purposes of payments by the Commonwealth under section 5.
Overall limit for dairy service payments
	(2)	For dairy service payments, the total limit on the appropriation is the sum of:
	(a)	the total amount of new dairy levy amounts; and
	(b)	the total amount of old dairy levy amounts.
Overall limit for matching payments
	(3)	For matching payments, the total limit on the appropriation is the sum of:
	(a)	the total amount of new dairy levy amounts; and
	(b)	the total amount of old dairy levy amounts.
Matching payments—annual limit
	(4)	For matching payments in respect of a particular financial year, the limit on the appropriation is the lesser of:
	(a)	0.5% of the amount determined by the Minister to be the gross value of whole milk produced in Australia in that financial year; and
	(b)	50% of the amount spent by the eligible body in that financial year on activities that qualify, under the funding contract, as research and development activities.
	(5)	For the purposes of subsection (4), the regulations may prescribe the manner in which the Minister is to determine the gross value of whole milk produced in Australia in a financial year.
Matching payments—unmatched R&D excess
	(6)	If there is an unmatched R&D excess for a financial year, the amount spent by the eligible body in the following financial year on activities that qualify, under the funding contract, as research and development activities is taken, for the purposes of this section (including for the purposes of this subsection and subsection (7)), to be increased by the amount of the unmatched R&D excess.
