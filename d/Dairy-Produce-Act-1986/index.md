1  Simplified outline
		The following is a simplified outline of this Schedule and Part 9C of the Farm Household Support Act 1992:
•	This Schedule and Part 9C of the Farm Household Support Act 1992 provide a framework for the implementation of the Dairy Industry Adjustment Program.
•	The main object of the Dairy Industry Adjustment Program is to help the dairy industry or dairy communities adjust to deregulation by providing for 4 types of grants, as follows:
	(a)	DSAP payments (made under this Schedule);
	(b)	SDA payments (made under this Schedule);
	(c)	dairy exit payments (made under Part 9C of the Farm Household Support Act 1992);
	(d)	payments under the Dairy Regional Assistance Programme (see clause 86).
•	Generally, DSAP payments are calculated by reference to 1998‑1999 milk deliveries at a rate of 46.23 cents per litre for market milk and a national average rate of 8.96 cents per litre for manufacturing milk.
•	There are 3 types of SDA payment rights: basic market milk payment rights, additional market milk payment rights and discretionary payment rights.
•	Dairy exit payments are available for farmers who choose to leave agriculture.
•	The Dairy Adjustment Authority will administer DSAP and SDA payment rights.
•	The Dairy Industry Adjustment Program will be funded by a dairy adjustment levy on milk products.
•	The levy will be paid into a Dairy Structural Adjustment Fund, and DSAP payments, SDA payments, dairy exit payments and payments under the Dairy Regional Assistance Programme will be paid out of that Fund.

Part 2—DSAP payments and SDA payments
Division 1—DSAP scheme
9  Simplified outline
		The following is a simplified outline of this Division:
•	This Division provides a framework for the making of DSAP payments.
•	The Minister is required to formulate a scheme (the DSAP scheme) for the grant of payment rights to entities who held an eligible interest in a dairy farm enterprise on 28 September 1999.
•	The DSAP scheme will provide for 3 types of payment rights, as follows:
	(a)	standard payment rights; 
	(b)	exceptional events supplementary payment rights.
	(c)	anomalous circumstances payment rights.
•	Standard payment rights will be based on milk deliveries in 1998‑1999, and will be worked out by reference to a rate of 46.23 cents per litre for market milk and a national average rate of 8.96 cents per litre for manufacturing milk.
•	Exceptional events supplementary payment rights may be granted in cases where, because of exceptional events, the volume of milk deliveries in 1998‑1999 is less than 70% of the average milk deliveries in the 3 previous financial years.
•	Anomalous circumstances payment rights may be granted to entities who have been affected by anomalous circumstances.
•	Entities who wish to obtain a payment right under the DSAP scheme must undertake a farm business assessment.
•	The total value of the payment rights granted to an entity must not exceed $350,000 unless more than 70% of the entity’s total gross income consists of dairy income.
•	Payment rights will be divided into units, where each unit has a face value of $32.
•	A registered owner of a unit will be entitled to a quarterly payment of $1 for each of the 32 quarters in the 8‑year period beginning on 1 July 2000.
10  DSAP scheme
		Within 14 days after the commencement of this Schedule, the Minister must, by writing, formulate a scheme (the DSAP scheme) for:
	(a)	the grant of payment rights to entities who:
	(i)	held an eligible interest in a dairy farm enterprise at 6.30 pm on 28 September 1999; and
	(ii)	satisfy such other conditions as are set out in the scheme; and
	(b)	the division of payment rights into units; and
	(c)	the registration of units; and
	(d)	the making of payments out of the Dairy Structural Adjustment Fund to registered owners of units.
11  General policy objectives for the DSAP scheme
		The DSAP scheme must be directed towards ensuring the achievement of the policy objectives set out in clauses 12 to 23.
12  Types of payment rights
	(1)	This clause sets out a policy objective for the DSAP scheme.
	(2)	The objective is that there are to be 3 types of payment rights, as follows:
	(a)	the first type of payment rights are to be known as standard payment rights;
	(b)	the second type of payment rights are to be known as exceptional events supplementary payment rights;
	(c)	the third type of payment rights are to be known as anomalous circumstances payment rights.
13  Standard payment right
	(1)	This clause sets out policy objectives for the DSAP scheme.
Basic eligibility criteria
	(2)	The first objective is that an entity is not eligible to be granted a standard payment right unless:
	(a)	the entity held an eligible interest in a dairy farm enterprise at 6.30 pm on 28 September 1999; and
	(b)	either or both of the following conditions are satisfied:
	(i)	during the 1998‑1999 financial year, the dairy farm enterprise delivered market milk;
	(ii)	during the 1998‑1999 financial year, the dairy farm enterprise delivered manufacturing milk.
Calculation of face value
	(3)	The second objective is that the calculation of the face value of an entity’s standard payment right must be consistent with the following examples:
	(a)	if the entity is the only entity who had an eligible interest in the dairy farm enterprise at 6.30 pm on 28 September 1999—the face value of the entity’s standard payment right equals the overall enterprise amount;
	(b)	if:
	(i)	there are 2 or more entities who had an eligible interest in the dairy farm enterprise at 6.30 pm on 28 September 1999; and
	(ii)	under the scheme, the enterprise is not taken to be subject to an eligible dairy sharefarming arrangement or an eligible dairy leasing arrangement;
		the face value of the first‑mentioned entity’s standard payment right is that entity’s share of the overall enterprise amount, worked out on a basis that corresponds to the basis on which milk revenues were shared between the entities as at 6.30 pm on 28 September 1999;
	(c)	if:
	(i)	there are 2 entities who had an eligible interest in the dairy farm enterprise at 6.30 pm on 28 September 1999; and
	(ii)	under the scheme, the enterprise is taken to be subject to an eligible dairy sharefarming arrangement and those entities are taken to be parties to that arrangement; and
	(iii)	the first‑mentioned entity is an entity who, under the scheme, is taken to have provided the essential capital contribution required to achieve access to the market milk premium;
		the face value of the first‑mentioned entity’s standard payment right is the sum of:
	(iv)	the premium component of the overall enterprise amount; and
	(v)	that entity’s share of the non‑premium component of the overall enterprise amount, worked out on a basis that corresponds to the basis on which milk revenues were shared between the entities as at 6.30 pm on 28 September 1999;
	(d)	if:
	(i)	there are 2 entities who had an eligible interest in the dairy farm enterprise at 6.30 pm on 28 September 1999; and
	(ii)	under the scheme, the enterprise is taken to be subject to an eligible dairy sharefarming arrangement and those entities are taken to be parties to that arrangement; and
	(iii)	the first‑mentioned entity is not an entity who, under the scheme, is taken to have provided the essential capital contribution required to achieve access to the market milk premium;

	(b)	the division of payment rights into units; and
	(c)	the registration of units; and
	(d)	the making of payments out of the Dairy Structural Adjustment Fund to registered owners of units.
37C  General policy objectives for the SDA scheme
		The SDA scheme must be directed towards ensuring the achievement of the policy objectives set out in clauses 37D to 37P.
37D  Types of payment rights
	(1)	It is a policy objective that there are to be 3 types of payment rights, as follows:
	(aa)	a type called basic market milk payment rights;
	(a)	a type called additional market milk payment rights;
	(b)	a type called discretionary payment rights.
	(2)	It is a policy objective that, if an entity is eligible to be granted a basic market milk payment right and an additional market milk payment right, the entity is eligible to be granted the payment right with the higher face value and is not eligible to be granted the other payment right.
37DA  Basic market milk payment rights—eligibility etc.
Basic eligibility criteria
	(1)	It is a policy objective that an entity is not eligible to be granted a basic market milk payment right unless:
	(a)	the entity has been granted a payment right under the DSAP scheme in respect of a dairy farm enterprise (the qualifying enterprise); and
	(b)	the entity held an interest (of a kind referred to in the SDA scheme) in that enterprise, or in any other dairy farm enterprise, at a time referred to in the SDA scheme; and
	(c)	the number (the market milk number) worked out in accordance with the following formula is at least 25.1 (rounding to 1 decimal place and rounding up if the second decimal place is 5 or more):

Note:	See also subclause (4) for how those delivery numbers are worked out.
Calculation of face value
	(2)	It is a policy objective that the face value of an entity’s basic market milk payment right is to be a share (worked out in accordance with the SDA scheme) of the overall market milk amount for the qualifying enterprise.
Interpretation
	(3)	For the purposes of this clause, the overall market milk amount for the qualifying enterprise is:
	(a)	if the market milk number is at least 25.1 and less than 30.1—$10,000; or
	(b)	if the market milk number is at least 30.1—$15,000.
	(4)	A reference in this clause to the total number of litres of market milk, or the total number of litres of manufacturing milk, delivered by the qualifying enterprise in the 1998‑1999 financial year is a reference to that number as determined by the DAA to have taken to have been delivered by that enterprise in that year.
	(5)	This clause is subject to clause 37V (about the effect of death on eligibility etc. for the grant of payment rights).
37E  Additional market milk payment rights—eligibility etc.
Basic eligibility criteria

	(b)	the entity held an interest (of a kind referred to in the SDA scheme) in that enterprise, or in any other dairy farm enterprise, at a time referred to in the SDA scheme; and
	(c)	the number (the market milk number) worked out in accordance with the following formula is at least 35.1 (rounding to 1 decimal place and rounding up if the second decimal place is 5 or more):

Note:	See also subclause (5) for how those delivery numbers are worked out.
Calculation of face value
	(2)	It is a policy objective that the face value of an entity’s additional market milk payment right is to be a share (worked out in accordance with the SDA scheme) of the overall market milk amount for the qualifying enterprise.
Interpretation
	(3)	For the purposes of this clause, the overall market milk amount for the qualifying enterprise is the amount worked out in accordance with the following formula:

where:
relevant cents means:
	(a)	if the market milk number is at least 45—12 cents; or
	(b)	if the market milk number is at least 35.1 and less than 45—the number of cents worked out in accordance with the following formula:

	(4)	However, if the amount calculated under subclause (3) is more than $60,000, then the overall market milk amount for the qualifying enterprise is taken to be $60,000.
	(5)	A reference in this clause to the total number of litres of market milk, or the total number of litres of manufacturing milk, delivered by the qualifying enterprise in the 1998‑1999 financial year is a reference to that number as determined by the DAA to have taken to have been delivered by that enterprise in that year.
	(6)	This clause is subject to clause 37V (about the effect of death on eligibility etc. for the grant of payment rights).

	(a)	the entity has been granted a payment right (the DSAP payment right) under the DSAP scheme; and
	(b)	the conditions in paragraphs 51(1)(a), (b) and (c) of this Schedule are satisfied (about the DAA having made an error); and
	(c)	the DAA has been unable to cancel a number of units (the protected units) in the DSAP payment right because of the operation of subclause 51(2).
	(2)	It is a policy objective that the amount of the reduction is to be equal to the total face value of the protected units.
	(3)	If the amount of the reduction would exceed the face value of the entity’s basic market milk payment right or additional market milk payment right, then it is a policy objective that the face value of that payment right is to be reduced to zero.
37G  Discretionary payment rights—eligibility
	(1)	It is a policy objective that an entity is not eligible to be granted a discretionary payment right unless the entity satisfies clause 37H or 37J.
	(2)	This clause is subject to clause 37V (about the effect of death on eligibility etc. for the grant of payment rights).

	(a)	generally accepted accounting principles; or
	(b)	if, under the SDA scheme, the generally accepted accounting principles are taken to be modified for the purposes of the scheme—those principles as so modified.
	(6)	For the purposes of this clause, eligible lease income has the same meaning as in the SDA scheme.

	(a)	divide the number of dollars in the face value of the payment right by 32;
	(b)	if the result of the division is a whole number—that number is the number of units in the payment right;
	(c)	if the result of the division is less than 1—there is 1 unit in the payment right;
	(d)	if the result of the division is greater than 1, but is not a whole number:

Notice
	(8)	If the whole of the scheme debt of the entity is discharged before any payment is made by the third party, the DAA must immediately give notice to the third party of that fact.
	(9)	If a part of the scheme debt of the entity is discharged before any payment is made by the third party, the DAA must:

	(3)	The fact that a judgment is entered or given in a court for the payment of an amount of a scheme debt, or of a composite amount that includes an amount of a scheme debt, does not of itself cause the amount of a scheme debt to stop being unpaid for the purposes of this clause.
	(4)	If the judgment debt bears interest, the penalty payable under this clause is reduced (but not beyond nil) by the following amount:

where:
scheme debt component means so much of the judgment debt as consists of a scheme debt.
