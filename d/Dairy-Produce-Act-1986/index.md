Part&#160;1&#151;Introduction   1  Simplified outline
 <dl compact=""><dl compact=""> 		The following is a simplified outline of this Schedule and Part&#160;9C of the _Farm Household Support Act 1992_: 

</dl></dl> 
<center>Back to Top</center>

*	This Schedule and Part&#160;9C of the _Farm Household Support Act 1992_ provide a framework for the implementation of the Dairy Industry Adjustment Program.

*	The main object of the Dairy Industry Adjustment Program is to help the dairy industry or dairy communities adjust to deregulation by providing for 4 types of grants, as follows:

	(a)	DSAP payments (made under this Schedule);
 	(b)	SDA payments (made under this Schedule);
 	(c)	dairy exit payments (made under Part&#160;9C of the _Farm Household Support Act 1992_);
 	(d)	payments under the Dairy Regional Assistance Programme (see clause&#160;86).

*	Generally, DSAP payments are calculated by reference to 1998-1999 milk deliveries at a rate of 46.23 cents per litre for market milk and a national average rate of 8.96 cents per litre for manufacturing milk.

*	There are 3 types of SDA payment rights: basic market milk payment rights, additional market milk payment rights and discretionary payment rights.

*	Dairy exit payments are available for farmers who choose to leave agriculture.

*	The Dairy Adjustment Authority will administer DSAP and SDA payment rights.

*	The Dairy Industry Adjustment Program will be funded by a dairy adjustment levy on milk products.

*	The levy will be paid into a Dairy Structural Adjustment Fund, and DSAP payments, SDA payments, dairy exit payments and payments under the Dairy Regional Assistance Programme will be paid out of that Fund.

Part&#160;2&#151;DSAP payments and SDA payments 

Division&#160;1&#151;DSAP scheme

9  Simplified outline

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

		The following is a simplified outline of this Division:

 </dl></dl>

*	This Division provides a framework for the making of DSAP payments.

*	The Minister is required to formulate a scheme (the _DSAP scheme_) for the grant of payment rights to entities who held an eligible interest in a dairy farm enterprise on 28&#160;September 1999.

*	The DSAP scheme will provide for 3 types of payment rights, as follows:

	(a)	standard payment rights; 
 	(b)	exceptional events supplementary payment rights.
 	(c)	anomalous circumstances payment rights.

*	Standard payment rights will be based on milk deliveries in 1998-1999, and will be worked out by reference to a rate of 46.23 cents per litre for market milk and a national average rate of 8.96 cents per litre for manufacturing milk.

*	Exceptional events supplementary payment rights may be granted in cases where, because of exceptional events, the volume of milk deliveries in 1998-1999 is less than 70% of the average milk deliveries in the 3 previous financial years.

*	Anomalous circumstances payment rights may be granted to entities who have been affected by anomalous circumstances.

*	Entities who wish to obtain a payment right under the DSAP scheme must undertake a farm business assessment.

*	The total value of the payment rights granted to an entity must not exceed $350,000 unless more than 70% of the entity's total gross income consists of dairy income.

*	Payment rights will be divided into units, where each unit has a face value of $32.

*	A registered owner of a unit will be entitled to a quarterly payment of $1 for each of the 32 quarters in the 8-year period beginning on 1&#160;July 2000\.
