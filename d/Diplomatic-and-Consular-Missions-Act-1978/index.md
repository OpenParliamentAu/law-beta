<lf>   (2) The conduct that is, in relation to a diplomatic or consular mission of a country established in Australia with the consent of the Commonwealth, conduct to which subsection (1) applies is:<lf>   (a) conduct by way of displaying, or causing or permitting to be displayed, either within, on or outside premises (other than premises at which an office of that mission or the residence of a member of that mission is located) any sign, flag or insignia that states, implies or is reasonably capable of being taken to imply that there is located at the premises an office of a mission, or the residence of a member of a mission, that represents, in a diplomatic or consular capacity, that country or a part of that country, the people of that country or of a part of that country or a government of that country or of a part of that country;
