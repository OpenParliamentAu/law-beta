                     (a)  conduct by way of displaying, or causing or permitting to be displayed, either within, on or outside premises (other than premises at which an office of that mission or the residence of a member of that mission is located) any sign, flag or insignia that states, implies or is reasonably capable of being taken to imply that there is located at the premises an office of a mission, or the residence of a member of a mission, that represents, in a diplomatic or consular capacity, that country or a part of that country, the people of that country or of a part of that country or a government of that country or of a part of that country; or

                     (b)  conduct by way of making or publishing, or causing or permitting to be made or published, any representation that states, implies or is reasonably capable of being taken to imply that there is located in Australia a mission (other than the diplomatic or consular mission of that country) or that a person in Australia occupies a position in a mission (other than the diplomatic or consular mission of that country), that represents, in a diplomatic or consular capacity, that country or a part of that country, the people of that country or of a part of that country or a government of that country or of a part of that country;

                     (d)  conduct engaged in at the request or direction of a member of the staff (including the head) of a designated overseas mission, where the conduct would have been covered by paragraph (c) if it had been engaged in by that staff member.

                     (b)  if, in the opinion of the Court, it is desirable to do so—grant an interim injunction under subsection (3) restraining the person from engaging in conduct of that kind;

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Removal of signs etc.

             (1)  Where, in a proceeding under section 4 for an injunction (including an interim injunction), the Court has found that conduct by way of displaying a sign or flag, or insignia, either within, on or outside premises, or by way of causing or permitting a sign or flag, or insignia, to be so displayed, constitutes conduct that is, in relation to a diplomatic or consular mission or a designated overseas mission, conduct to which subsection 4(1) applies, the Court may, upon application made by the Attorney‑General, issue a warrant authorizing the Sheriff, or a Deputy Sheriff, of the Court, with such assistance as the Sheriff or Deputy Sheriff deems necessary, to remove the sign, flag or insignia from the premises, or to obliterate the sign, flag or insignia on the premises, as the case requires, and, at any time and from time to time while the warrant is in force, to remove or to obliterate, as the case requires, any similar or substantially similar sign, flag or insignia that may subsequently be displayed, within, on or outside the premises.

             (2)  An application for the issue of a warrant under subsection (1) may be included in an application to the Court under section 4 for an injunction (including an interim injunction) or may be made to the Court as a separate application.
