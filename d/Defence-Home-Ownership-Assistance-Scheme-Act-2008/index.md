##### <a id="5"></a>5  When a person is a member of the Reserves

Membership of the Reserves

             (1)  For the purposes of this Act, a person who has been engaged (by enlistment or appointment) as a member of the Reserves  at a particular time (the **_engagement time_**) is to be treated as a member of the Reserves until:

                     (a)  the engagement ends; or

                     (b)  during a service year:

                              (i)  the engagement does not end; but

                             (ii)  the person does not perform effective service as a member of the Reserves.

Effect of failure to perform effective service

             (2)  If a person’s membership of the Reserves ends under paragraph (1)(b) in relation to a service year, this Act applies to the person, and is taken to have applied to the person, as if he or she had:

                     (a)  in the case of a person who was a member of the Reserves at the end of the previous service year—stopped being a member of the Reserves immediately after the end of the previous service year; or

                     (b)  in any other case—not been engaged as a member of the Reserves at the engagement time.

Note:          This section may have the following effects:

(a)           the time at which a person is taken to stop being a member of the Reserves (or of the Defence Force) may be affected;

(b)           there may be a retrospective loss of entitlements in relation to subsidy certificates, the payment of subsidy, service credits and accrued subsidy periods and loan limits;

(c)           in particular, an authorisation of the payment of subsidy on the basis of a person’s membership of the Reserves may be revoked retrospectively (see section 44);

(d)           if a subsidised borrower who is taken not to have been a member of the Reserves because of the operation of subsection (2) would have been otherwise entitled to subsidy, the authorisation of the payment of subsidy to the person may be varied retrospectively (see section 45).

Example:    A person is engaged as a member of the Reserves. The person is given a subsidy certificate under Part 3 on the basis of eligibility as a serving member of the Reserves. The person starts to receive amounts of monthly subsidy accordingly.

However, at the end of the service year, the person has not performed effective service as a member of the Reserves.

Because of subsection (2), this Act applies as if the person was not entitled to be given the subsidy certificate (because he or she was not eligible as a member of the Reserves).

As a result, the original authorisation of the payment of subsidy may be revoked or varied (see sections 44 and 45). Amounts of subsidy to which the person is not entitled (because of the revocation or variation) are recoverable as overpayments under Division 6 of Part 4.

##### <a id="6"></a>6  External Territories

                   This Act extends to every external Territory.

## Part 2—Eligibility

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Eligibility—who is _eligible_?

                     (b)  an incapacitated member (see section 9);

                     (c)  a rejoining incapacitated member (see section 10);

                     (d)  a rejoining member (see section 11);

                     (e)  a separated member (see section 12);

                      (f)  an old scheme member (see section 13).

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Eligibility—serving members

             (1)  A person is eligible as a serving member at a particular time (the **_eligibility time_**) if, at that time, the person:

                     (a)  is a member of the Defence Force; and

                     (b)  has completed (whether before, on or after the commencing day) the relevant qualifying service period under subsection (2).

                             (ii)  for a case in which section 18 (surviving partners) applies—the applicant has a service credit, or would, if the subsidy certificate were in force, have a service credit (because of the operation of section 63).

Note:          As soon as a subsidy certificate given under section 18 (surviving partners) comes into force, the surviving partner has the service credit the deceased partner would have had, if he or she had not died (see sections 63 and 64).

             (3)  The Secretary:

Note:          A subsidy lump sum is only payable to a member of the Defence Force, and is only payable in relation to the first residential property bought while the person is a member of the Defence Force (see section 34).

##### <a id="27"></a>27  Entitlement—authorisation by Secretary

Authorisation of initial payment

             (1)  The Secretary must authorise the payment of subsidy to a person if subsidy becomes payable to the person under subsection 28(1).

Note:          An authorisation under this subsection may be revoked under section 44\. In certain circumstances related to membership of the Reserves, the authorisation may be varied under section 45.

             (2)  The Secretary:

                     (a)  must refuse to authorise the payment of subsidy to a person under subsection (1) if subsidy has not become payable to the person under subsection 28(1); and

                     (b)  despite subsection (1), may refuse to authorise the payment of subsidy to a person under that subsection if, in relation to a previous entitlement period:

                              (i)  the person failed to comply with section 42 (which deals with the disclosure of changes of circumstances); or

                             (ii)  the Secretary has revoked an authorisation of the payment of subsidy to the person under section 44.

Note:          Part 5 provides for the administrative review of a decision to refuse to authorise the payment of subsidy.

Authorisation of continuing monthly payments

             (3)  The Secretary must (on a monthly basis) authorise the continued payment of monthly subsidy to a person while subsidy continues to be payable to the person under subsection 28(3).

Note:          Monthly subsidy is paid to the subsidised borrower’s loan provider on a monthly basis (by a payment into the borrower’s subsidised loan account for the borrower’s benefit) under Division 4.

             (4)  The Secretary must refuse to authorise the continued payment of monthly subsidy to a person if subsidy stops being payable to the person under section 36.

Note:          Part 5 provides for the administrative review of a decision to refuse to authorise the continued payment of monthly subsidy.

##### <a id="28"></a>28  Entitlement—criteria

When subsidy becomes payable

             (1)  Subsidy becomes payable to a subsidised borrower in relation to a loan to the borrower if:

                     (a)  the loan is made by a declared loan provider; and

                     (b)  the loan is secured by a mortgage over an interest (including a leasehold interest) in land; and

                     (c)  the conditions under Subdivision B are met.

             (2)  Subsidy becomes payable to a subsidised borrower with effect from the beginning of the monthly authorisation period during which subsection (1) starts to apply in relation to the borrower.

When subsidy continues to be payable

             (3)  After subsidy becomes payable to a subsidised borrower, monthly subsidy continues to be payable to him or her during a continuous period (an **_entitlement period_**) until it stops being payable under section 36, subject to  section 44 (revocation of authorisation of payment of subsidy).

Note 1:       If subsidy is payable to a person, the person is a **_subsidised borrower_** (see section 3).

Note 2:       If payment of subsidy is suspended under section 61 because of a subsidised borrower’s death, the suspension does not break the continuity of the entitlement period.

Note 3:       If the Secretary revokes an authorisation under section 44 in relation to an entitlement period, subsidy is taken never to have been payable during the period.

Multiple loans and subsidised borrowers who are partners etc.

             (4)  Nothing in this Part prevents subsidy from being payable:

                     (a)  in relation to more than one loan during different entitlement periods; or

                     (b)  in relation to more than one house, or interest in land, during different entitlement periods; or

                     (c)  to each of 2 subsidised borrowers in his or her own right in relation to the same loan.

Note:          Special rules may apply for working out the amount of loan capital (which affects the amount of subsidy) if a subsidised borrower and another person are liable in respect of the same subsidised loan (see sections 51A, 51B and 51C).

#### Subdivision B—When subsidy becomes payable

                     (a)  a subsidy certificate held by the subsidised borrower must be in force;

                     (b)  the subsidised borrower must have a service credit under section 46.

Note:          Immediately after the first authorisation day for the subsidy, the subsidy certificate stops being in force (see section 22). If subsidy stops being payable (under section 36), the subsidised borrower can only again become entitled to subsidy under this Division if he or she is given a new subsidy certificate.

##### <a id="30"></a>30  When subsidy becomes payable—use of subsidised loan

             (1)  The Secretary must be satisfied that the subsidised loan is used, or is to be used, to do one of the following:

                     (a)  to buy the interest in land, if there is a house on the land;

                     (b)  to buy the interest in land and undertake work (**_building work_**) on the land consisting of any of the following:

                              (i)  the construction or the completion of a house, other than a unit, on the land;

                             (ii)  the enlargement, renovation or repair of a house on the land;

                            (iii)  the construction of any other permanent improvement on the land, if the improvement is used primarily for private or domestic purposes in association with the house;

                     (c)  if the subsidised borrower already has an interest in the land—to undertake building work on the land;

                     (d)  to discharge another loan used by the subsidised borrower for a purpose mentioned in paragraph (a), (b) or (c).

             (2)  If a house mentioned in subsection (1) is a unit, paragraphs (1)(b) and (c) do not cover building work in relation to any accompanying common property.

Note:          For the definitions of **_house_** and **_unit_**, see section 3.

                   The following conditions must be met:

                     (a)  the subsidised borrower, or the subsidised borrower and his or her partner together, must hold a 50% or greater interest in the land:

                              (i)  no matter whether the interest is held individually, as joint tenants or as tenants in common; and

                     (b)  not for the purpose of building work, or to discharge another loan for that purpose.

Subsidy condition

             (2)  The Secretary must be satisfied that the subsidised borrower, or a dependant of the subsidised borrower, occupies a house on the land as a home.

Note 1:       This condition need only be satisfied for the first year after the first authorisation day for the subsidy (see  section 39).

Note 2:       In the case of a loan for the purpose of building work, a similar occupation condition applies to the continuation of entitlement to subsidy after the completion of the building work (see section 40).

##### <a id="33"></a>33  When subsidy becomes payable—use of land

             (1)  The Secretary must be satisfied that the land is not used primarily for the purpose of carrying on a business, trade or profession.

                     (e)  the subsidised borrower must have at least the number of months standing to his or her service credit that is stated in the request;

                      (f)  the Secretary must be satisfied that there is a reasonable expectation that monthly subsidy will be payable to the subsidised borrower during an entitlement period of:

                             (ii)  if the subsidised borrower is, at the time, a member of the Reserves—at least the number of months remaining in the service year;

                     (g)  subsection (2) (previous home ownership etc.) must not apply.

Note:          Sections 137.1 and 137.2 of the _Criminal Code_ create offences for providing false or misleading information or documents (for example, in a request under paragraph (1)(a)).

Previous home ownership etc.

             (2)  This subsection applies if all of the following conditions are met:

                     (a)  the subsidised borrower has, at a time when the subsidised borrower was a member of the Defence Force, bought an interest in land in Australia;

                     (b)  the purchase results in the borrower, or the borrower and his or her partner together, holding a 50% or greater interest in the land:

                              (i)  no matter whether the interest is held individually, as joint tenants or tenants in common; and

                             (ii)  no matter whether the interest is legal or equitable;

                             (ii)  the house is occupied by the borrower or another person as a home, or could be occupied by the borrower or another person as a home;

                     (d)  either:

                              (i)  the interest in land is not the interest in relation to which the request for lump sum subsidy is made; or

                             (ii)  if the interest in land is the interest in relation to which the request for lump sum subsidy is made—the interest was bought before the Secretary gave the borrower the subsidy certificate on the basis of which the lump sum subsidy is requested.

##### <a id="42"></a>42  When subsidy stops being payable—disclosure of changes of circumstances

Scope

             (1)  This section applies if any of the following events occurs:

                     (a)  a reasonably significant change to the agreement for the subsidised loan between the subsidised borrower and the loan provider who made the loan to the subsidised borrower, or to the conditions of the mortgage;

                     (b)  a change that affects the way in which the subsidised borrower’s service credit is worked out;

                     (c)  a reasonably significant change to a house or permanent improvement mentioned in section 30 (including the destruction of the house or improvement), or any other reasonably significant  change affecting the land;

             (2)  If the subsidised loan relates to a unit, paragraph (1)(h) does not apply to any accompanying common property, or any other unit, held under the same strata title (or similar) system.

Subsidy condition

Note:          Sections 137.1 and 137.2 of the _Criminal Code_ create offences for providing false or misleading information or documents.

             (4)  Without limiting subsection (3), a subsidised borrower fails to comply with the subsection even if, at the constructive knowledge time, the borrower was not aware of the event.

Note:          A failure to comply with this condition is grounds for the Secretary to refuse to give a subsidy certificate on a future occasion, and to refuse authorisation for the payment of subsidy in relation to a future entitlement period (see sections 16 and 27).

##### <a id="43"></a>43  When subsidy stops being payable—on request by the subsidised borrower

             (1)  The subsidised borrower may, in the approved form, request the Secretary to stop the payment of subsidy.

             (2)  On receipt of a request under subsection (1), the Secretary must stop the payment of subsidy, by written notice given to the subsidised borrower.

             (3)  The Secretary may, in the notice, state a day for the payment of subsidy to be stopped that is later than the day requested by the subsidised borrower.

Note:          Part 5 provides for the administrative review of a decision by the Secretary to state a day in a notice under this subsection.

             (4)  The Secretary must give a copy of the notice to the loan provider who made the subsidised loan to the subsidised borrower.

#### Subdivision D—Revocation and variation

##### <a id="44"></a>44  Revocation of authorisation for the payment of subsidy

Scope

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  the Secretary authorises the payment of subsidy to a subsidised borrower under section 27 in relation to a subsidised loan, on the basis of a subsidy certificate; and

                     (b)  as a result, subsidy has been paid to the subsidised borrower during an entitlement period.

Note:          If the payment of subsidy is authorised because the subsidised borrower is a surviving partner of a deceased partner, the subsidy certificate concerned may be a subsidy certificate given to the deceased partner or to the surviving partner.

Revocation of authorisation

             (2)  The Secretary may, by written notice to the subsidised borrower, revoke the authorisation of the payment of subsidy to the subsidised borrower in relation to the entitlement period if the Secretary is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the subsidy certificate ought not to have been given; or

                     (b)  the subsidy certificate was only given because of a false or misleading statement by the subsidised borrower (or anyone else); or

                     (c)  payment of subsidy at any time during the entitlement period was only made (or continued) because of a false or misleading statement by the subsidised borrower (or anyone else).

Note:          Part 5 provides for the administrative review of the Secretary’s decision to revoke the authorisation.

             (3)  The Secretary may give a notice under subsection (2) during the entitlement period, or at any time after the end of the entitlement period.

Effect of revocation

             (4)  If an authorisation is revoked under this section _,_ subsidy is taken not to have become payable to the subsidised borrower during the entitlement period.

Note:          The Commonwealth may recover, as overpayments, any subsidy paid to a subsidised borrower during the entitlement period if subsidy is taken not to have become payable to the borrower (see Division 6).

Notice to loan provider

             (5)  The Secretary must give a copy of a notice under subsection (2) to the loan provider who made the loan to the subsidised borrower.

If the subsidised borrower has died

             (6)  If the subsidised borrower has died, the Secretary may revoke the authorisation of the payment of subsidy to the subsidised borrower by giving a notice under subsection (2) to the borrower’s legal personal representative.

If the subsidised borrower is a surviving partner

             (7)  In the application of this section to a surviving partner (of a deceased partner) who is a subsidised borrower because of section 60 or 61:

                     (a)  a reference in paragraph (2)(c) to the payment of subsidy includes a reference to the payment of subsidy to the deceased partner during the entitlement period; and

                     (b)  subsection (4) does not apply to the deceased partner’s entitlement to subsidy.

Note 1:       Revocation of an authorisation is grounds for the Secretary to refuse to give a subsidy certificate on a future occasion, and to refuse authorisation for the payment of subsidy in relation to a future entitlement period (see sections 16 and 27).

Note 2:       If section 45 (variation of authorisation of payment of subsidy—when a person is not a member of the Reserves) applies, the authorisation of the payment of subsidy cannot be revoked under this section because of the operation of subsection 5(2) (which relates to when a member stops being a member of the Reserves) (see subsection 45(5)).

##### <a id="45"></a>45  Variation of authorisation of payment of subsidy—when a person is not a member of the Reserves

Scope

             (1)  This section applies in relation to a subsidised borrower if the Secretary is satisfied that, immediately after the end of a service year:

                     (a)  the Secretary, under section 27, has authorised the payment of subsidy to the subsidised borrower during an entitlement period beginning at or after the start of the service year on the basis of the borrower’s eligibility as a member of the Reserves; and

                     (b)  subsection 5(2) applies to the subsidised borrower’s membership of the Reserves in relation to the service year; and

                     (c)  by the operation of that subsection, the Secretary would (apart from this section) have the power to revoke the authorisation of the payment of subsidy to the subsidised borrower under section 44; and

                     (d)  during the entitlement period, the Secretary could have given a subsidy certificate to the subsidised borrower, and subsidy on the basis of that certificate would have been payable to the borrower, otherwise than on the basis of the borrower’s eligibility as a member of the Reserves.

Example 1: Paragraph (d) may apply because of the operation of subsection 5(2). Subsidy might have otherwise been payable to the subsidised borrower on the basis of the borrower’s eligibility as a separated member (as the result of the person’s being taken to have stopped being a member of the Reserves).

Example 2: Paragraph (d) may also apply despite the operation of subsection 5(2). If the subsidised borrower’s partner is a member of the Defence Force, and the partner dies, subsidy might in any case have been payable to the borrower as the surviving partner of the deceased partner.

Variation of authorisation

             (2)  The Secretary may, by written notice to the subsidised borrower, vary the authorisation of the payment of subsidy to the borrower in relation to the entitlement period.

Note:          Part 5 provides for the administrative review of the Secretary’s decision to vary the authorisation.

             (3)  The Secretary may give a notice under subsection (2) during the entitlement period, or at any time after the end of the entitlement period.

Effect of variation

             (4)  If an authorisation is varied under this section:

                     (a)  subsidy is payable, and is taken to have become payable, to the subsidised borrower on the basis of the borrower’s eligibility (otherwise than as a member of the Reserves) as mentioned in paragraph (1)(d); and

                     (b)  subsidy is taken to have become (and continued) to be so payable (subject otherwise to this Act) with effect from the earliest time that subsidy would have been payable to the subsidised borrower as mentioned in paragraph (1)(d).

Note:          If the amount of subsidy paid to the subsidised borrower during the entitlement period on the basis of the borrower’s membership of the Reserves exceeds the amount of subsidy payable to the borrower as a result of the operation of this subsection, the Commonwealth may recover the amount of the excess as an overpayment (see Division 6).

Application of section 44

             (5)  If this section applies in relation to the authorisation of the payment of subsidy to a subsidised borrower, the authorisation cannot be revoked under section 44 only because of the operation of subsection 5(2).

Notice to loan provider

             (6)  The Secretary must give a copy of a notice under subsection (2) to the loan provider who made the loan to the subsidised borrower.

If the subsidised borrower has died

             (7)  If the subsidised borrower has died, the Secretary may vary the authorisation of the payment of subsidy to the subsidised borrower by giving a notice under subsection (2) to the borrower’s legal personal representative.

### Division 2—Service credits

##### <a id="46"></a>46  Working out service credits

             (1)  Whether a person has a **_service credit_** at a particular time (the **_subsidy time_**) for the purposes of an entitlement period, and the length of time standing to the person’s service credit, is worked out as follows.

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1\. Work out the person’s accrued subsidy period under section 47, in completed months, as at the subsidy time.

Step 2.    Add together the following:

               (a)     if a subsidy lump sum has become payable to the person—the number of months of service credit accessed for the subsidy lump sum (see section 54);

               (b)     in any case—the number of months in respect of which monthly subsidy has been payable in relation to the person under this Act, as at the subsidy time;

               (c)     in any case—the number of months in respect of which subsidy has been payable in relation to the person under the _Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act 1990_ and the _Defence Service Homes Act 1918_, as at the subsidy time.

Step 3.    If the step 1 result exceeds the step 2 result, the person has a **_service credit_** at the subsidy time.

Step 4.    The number of months (if any) by which the step 1 result exceeds the step 2 result is the number of months standing to the person’s service credit.

* * *

             (2)  Step 2 of the method statement in subsection (1):

                     (a)  includes months during a previous entitlement period or periods; and

                     (b)  includes a reference to a subsidy lump sum that became payable to a person during a previous entitlement period; and

                     (c)  includes months during which subsidy was paid (under this or another Act) whether or not the months are continuous.

##### <a id="47"></a>47  Service credits—working out accrued subsidy periods

             (1)  A person’s **_accrued subsidy period_**, at a particular time, is the period that applies to the person in accordance with the following table.

                     (b)  at the time of death, item 1 of the table in subsection 51A(2) applied to the surviving borrower and the deceased borrower because:

                              (i)  they were parties to a single subsidised loan; and

                             (ii)  each of them was a subsidised borrower in his or her own right; and

                     (c)  with effect from the time of death, the entitlement of the deceased borrower to the payment of subsidy in relation to the subsidised loan is transferred to the surviving borrower under section 60 (joint interest in land) or 61 (inherited interest in land).

                     (a)  item 1 of the table in subsection 51A(2) continues to apply to the surviving borrower, in his or her own right, in relation to the subsidised loan; and

                     (b)  for the purposes of that application, the amount of the surviving borrower’s loan limit at a particular time (the **_loan limit time_**) is the average of the amounts of the loan limits that would apply in relation to the surviving borrower and the deceased borrower at the loan limit time if:

                             (ii)  the surviving borrower had the loan limit (under subsection 51(2)) that would apply to him or her at the loan limit time if he or she were the sole party to the loan.

Note:          This section applies only to the surviving borrower’s entitlement to subsidy in his or her own right, and not to the entitlement transferred from the deceased borrower (as mentioned in paragraph (1)(c)). For how the transferred entitlement applies to the surviving borrower, see sections 64 and 65.

##### <a id="51C"></a>51C  Monthly subsidy—joint and several liability for subsidised loans between non-partners

                     (b)  at any particular time, the subsidised borrower has the loan limit that applies under subsection 51(2).

Note 1:       If liability for the subsidised loan is shared between the subsidised borrower and his or her partner, see sections 51A and 51B.

Note 2:       If the subsidised borrower and another person (other than the borrower’s partner) are liable individually in respect of the subsidised loan, section 51 applies in relation to the actual capital amount owing by the borrower on the subsidised loan.

##### <a id="52"></a>52  Monthly subsidy—average house price

                     (b)  that interest in land is, at a particular time (the **_transfer time_**), transferred under the deceased partner’s will, or an intestacy law, to the surviving partner; and

                     (c)  that interest in land is so transferred subject to the subsidised loan.

Suspension of subsidy payments

             (2)  Payment of subsidy in relation to the subsidised loan is suspended for the period starting at the time of the deceased partner’s death and ending at the transfer time.

Entitlement to subsidy with effect from time of death

             (3)  However:

                     (a)  the entitlement of the deceased partner to the payment of subsidy in relation to the subsidised loan is taken to have been transferred to the surviving partner with effect from the time of death; and

                     (b)  subsidy is taken to have become payable to the surviving partner accordingly, with effect from the time of the deceased partner’s death.

Application of this Part to surviving partner

             (4)  At and after the time of the deceased partner’s death, this Part is taken to have applied (and continues to apply) to the surviving partner in the same way as it would have applied to the deceased partner (had he or she not died), subject to section 64.

Note:          Section 64 provides for how this Part applies to the surviving partner.

Continuity of entitlement period

             (5)  The suspension and transfer (under subsections (2) and (3)) does not break the continuity of the entitlement period in respect of which subsidy had been payable to the deceased partner immediately before his or her death.

##### <a id="62"></a>62  Surviving partners of subsidised borrowers—interest in land not inherited by surviving partner etc.

Scope

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  immediately before the death of the deceased partner, the interest in land by virtue of which subsidy was payable to the deceased partner was not held by the deceased partner and the surviving partner as joint tenants; and

                     (b)  that interest in land is, at a particular time (the **_transfer time_**), transferred under the deceased partner’s will, or an intestacy law; and

                     (c)  that interest in land is so transferred:

                              (i)  to a person other than the surviving partner; or

                             (ii)  free of the subsidised loan.

Suspension of subsidy payments

             (2)  Payment of subsidy in relation to the subsidised loan is suspended for the period starting at the time of the deceased partner’s death and ending at the transfer time.

Subsidy taken to have stopped being payable

             (3)  Subsidy is taken to have stopped being payable to the deceased partner with effect from the start of the monthly authorisation period during which the deceased partner died.

#### Subdivision B—Surviving partners holding subsidy certificates

##### <a id="63"></a>63  Subsidy for surviving partners—if they hold subsidy certificates

Scope

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a person dies; and

                     (b)  the person has a surviving partner; and

                     (c)  the surviving partner holds a subsidy certificate given under section 18 that is in force; and

                     (d)  subsidy is not payable to the surviving partner because of section 60 or 61.

Note 1:       The person who dies is the **_deceased partner_** of his or her surviving partner (see section 4).

Note 2:       Sections 60 and 61 provide for entitlement to subsidy to be transferred from a deceased partner to a surviving partner in certain circumstances, without the requirement for the surviving partner to obtain a new subsidy certificate.

Application of this Part to surviving partner

             (2)  This Part applies to the surviving partner in the same way as it would have applied to the deceased partner (had he or she not died), subject to section 64.

Note:          Section 64 provides for how this Part applies to the surviving partner.

Section 61 subsidy becomes payable

             (3)  However, if subsidy becomes payable to the surviving partner because of section 61 (with effect from the time of the death of the deceased partner), any subsidy paid to the surviving partner because of the operation of subsection (2) is taken not to have become payable.

Note:          If subsidy is taken not to have become payable to a surviving partner because of this subsection, the Commonwealth may recover the amount of any payments of subsidy during the entitlement period from the surviving partner (see Division 6).

#### Subdivision C—Application of this Part

##### <a id="64"></a>64  Subsidy for surviving partners—how this Part applies

Scope

             (1)  This section applies if subsidy is payable to a surviving partner of a deceased partner because of section 60 or 61, or by the operation of section 63.

How this Part applies to surviving partner

             (2)  For the purposes of this Part, unless otherwise expressly provided, the surviving partner  must be treated in the same way as the deceased partner, assuming that:

                     (a)  the deceased partner had not died; and

                     (b)  the deceased partner were eligible as provided in the following table.

<table>
<colgroup>

      that he or she had completed at the time of death</div>
  </td>
</tr></table>

Note:          This section, together with sections 60, 61 and 63, ensures (among other things) that the deceased partner’s accrued subsidy period and loan limit may be used in determining the surviving partner’s entitlement to subsidy under this Part.

Example:    Assume that subsidy has been payable to a person. The person dies, and this Part applies to the person’s surviving partner.

Under subsection 46(1), the number of months in respect of which subsidy had been payable to the deceased partner (as at the time of death) must be taken into account in working out the surviving partner’s service credit (see step 2 of the method statement in that subsection).

In addition, the number of months in respect of which subsidy has continued to be payable to the surviving partner must also be taken into account in working out the surviving partner’s service credit (because after the death of the person, this Part applies to the surviving partner in the same way as it would have applied to the deceased partner).

##### <a id="65"></a>65  Subsidy for surviving partners—if surviving partner eligible in his or her own right etc.

                   To remove doubt, this Division applies:

                     (a)  whether or not the surviving partner of the deceased partner is eligible under Part 2 in his or her own right; and

                     (b)  whether or not subsidy is payable to the surviving partner of the deceased partner in a capacity other than as surviving partner.

### Division 6—Recovery of overpayments

##### <a id="66"></a>66  Recovery of overpayments—scope

             (1)  This Division applies if:

                     (a)  the Secretary has paid an amount (the **_overpaid amount_**) to a loan provider as subsidy, by way of a payment into a subsidised loan account for the benefit of a subsidised borrower (the **_debtor_**); but

                     (b)  the overpaid amount is not payable to the debtor under this Act.

             (2)  This Division applies in relation to a debtor who is not, or who has stopped being, a subsidised borrower as if the person were a subsidised borrower.

##### <a id="67"></a>67  Recovery of overpayments—amount payable

             (1)  The debtor must pay the amount (the **_due amount_**) covered by subsection (2) to the Commonwealth.

             (2)  The amount covered by this subsection is the sum of the following:

                     (a)  the overpaid amount;

                     (b)  interest, at the general interest charge rate per day, on so much of the overpaid amount as remains unpaid from time to time after the overpaid amount was paid to the loan provider.

             (3)  In this section:

                    <a name="gener-interest-charg-rate"></a>**_general interest charge rate_** means the general interest charge rate worked out under section 8AAD of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

                     (a)  add an amount equal to the due amount (or part) to the principal outstanding of the debtor’s subsidised loan; and

                     (b)  pay the due amount (or part) to the Commonwealth.

             (2)  If the loan provider receives a notice under subsection (1), the loan provider must comply with the notice in relation to the lesser of the following amounts (the **_loan account amount_**):

                     (a)  the amount stated in the notice;

                     (b)  the amount available for payment out of the debtor’s subsidised loan account in accordance with the terms of the debtor’s subsidised loan.

             (3)  Payment by the loan provider to the Secretary of the loan account amount is, to the extent of the payment, a discharge of any liability of the debtor to the Commonwealth under this Division.

             (4)  Section 67 applies in relation to the due amount, at the time the loan account amount is paid, as if:

                     (a)  so much of the overpaid amount (the **_current overpaid amount_**) as at that time remains unpaid were reduced by the loan account amount; and

                     (b)  if the loan account amount exceeds the current overpaid amount—the amount of interest covered by paragraph 67(2)(b) were reduced by the amount of the excess.

##### <a id="69"></a>69  Recovery of overpayments—from sale of interest in land

             (1)  The loan provider must pay to the Commonwealth the amount covered by subsection (2), if:

                     (a)  the loan provider sells an interest in land; and

                     (b)  the sale is by way of enforcing a mortgage securing the subsidised loan or another loan to the debtor.

             (2)  This subsection covers the lesser of the following amounts (the **_land sale amount_**):

                     (a)  the part of the proceeds of the sale that, apart from this subsection, would have been payable by the loan provider to the debtor;

                     (b)  the unpaid part of the due amount.

             (3)  Payment by the loan provider to the Commonwealth of the land sale amount is, to the extent of the payment, a discharge of any liability:

                     (a)  of the debtor to the Commonwealth; and

                     (b)  of the loan provider to the debtor under the mortgage or the loan agreement.

             (4)  Section 67 applies in relation to the due amount, at the time the land sale amount is paid, as if:

                     (a)  so much of the overpaid amount (the **_current overpaid amount_**) as at that time remains unpaid were reduced by the land sale amount; and

                     (b)  if the land sale amount exceeds the current overpaid amount—the amount of interest covered by paragraph 67(2)(b) were reduced by the amount of the excess.

##### <a id="70"></a>70  Recovery of overpayments—in a court
