Advice to Governor-General

                     (b)  if, after the Minister has consulted the Prime Minister, the Minister is satisfied that, for reasons of urgency, the Governor-General should act with the advice of the Minister alone—the Minister.

When order takes effect

Effect of revocation of order

             (6)  To avoid doubt, if an order is revoked the call out under that order ends.

Further orders

Direction by Chief of the Defence Force or a service chief

             (1)  A member of the Reserves who is covered by a call out order under section 50D is bound to render the period of continuous full time naval, military or air force service (as appropriate) that the Chief of the Defence Force or a service chief directs in relation to the member.

Length of period of service

             (3)  The period of service specified in a direction under subsection (1):

                     (a)  must start on the day on which the relevant call out order takes effect; and

                     (b)  may be indefinite or limited.

However, a direction has no effect to the extent that it specifies a period of service after the day on which the call out under the order ends.

Direction must be in writing

             (4)  A direction under this section must be in writing.

Further directions

             (5)  The fact that a direction has been given in relation to an order under section 50D does not prevent further directions being given in relation to the same order.

Continuous full time service otherwise than under this section

             (6)  Nothing in this section prevents a member of the Reserves from being bound to render continuous full time naval, military or air force service otherwise than under this section.

                     (a)  one or more authorising Ministers have the power to give an authorisation or make a declaration under a provision of Division 2, 3, 3A or 3B; and

                     (b)  that Division applies because of an order made under this section;

the authorisation or declaration need not be in writing, despite any requirement of the provision to the contrary.

           (10)  If the authorisation or declaration is not in writing, the authorising Minister or authorising Ministers, and the Chief of the Defence Force, must each:

                     (a)  make a written record of the authorisation or declaration; and

                     (b)  sign the record; and

                     (c)  cause the signing of the record to be witnessed; and

                     (d)  in the case of an authorising Minister—as soon as practicable cause the record to be given to the Chief of the Defence Force; and

                     (e)  in the case of the Chief of the Defence Force—as soon as practicable:

                              (i)  cause the record to be given to the authorising Minister; or

                             (ii)  cause the record to be given to one of the authorising Ministers, and cause a copy of the record to be given to the other authorising Minister;

                            as the case requires.

However, a failure to comply with paragraph (d) or (e) does not affect the validity of the authorisation or declaration.

           (11)  If the authorisation or declaration is not in writing, it comes into force when the authorising Minister or authorising Ministers, and the Chief of the Defence Force, have complied with paragraph (10)(c).

References to certain circumstances

           (12)  To avoid doubt, a reference in this section to the circumstances referred to in subsection 51A(1), 51AA(1), 51AB(1), 51B(1) or 51C(1):

                     (a)  does not include a reference to the authorising Ministers being satisfied as to particular matters; and

                     (b)  in relation to section 51B, includes a reference to a State Government having made an application of a kind referred to in subsection 51B(1); and

                     (c)  in relation to section 51C, includes a reference to a State Government having made an application of a kind referred to in subsection 51C(1).

Involvement of State or Territory under subsection 51A(3) not required

           (13)  To avoid doubt, paragraph 51A(3)(b) does not apply to an order under this section that would have effect as if it were an order made by the Governor-General under section 51A.

##### <a id="51CB"></a>51CB  Declaration of designated critical infrastructure

             (1)  The authorising Ministers may, in writing, declare that particular infrastructure, or a part of particular infrastructure, in Australia or in the Australian offshore area is designated critical infrastructure.

             (2)  However, the authorising Ministers may do so only if they believe on reasonable grounds that:

                     (a)  there is a threat of damage or disruption to the operation of the infrastructure or the part of the infrastructure; and

                     (b)  the damage or disruption would directly or indirectly endanger the life of, or cause serious injury to, other persons.

             (3)  If the authorising Ministers no longer believe those matters, they must revoke the declaration.

             (4)  To avoid doubt, the authorising Ministers may make a declaration under this section whether or not an order is in force under this Division.

             (5)  If the infrastructure, or the part of the infrastructure, is in a State or a self-governing Territory:

                     (a)  the authorising Ministers may make the declaration referred to in subsection (1) whether or not the Government of the State or the self-governing Territory requests the making of the declaration; and

                     (b)  if the Government of the State or the self-governing Territory does not request the making of the declaration referred to in subsection (1), an authorising Minister must, subject to subsection (6), consult that Government about the making of the declaration.

             (6)  However, paragraph (5)(b) does not apply if the authorising Ministers are satisfied that, for reasons of urgency, it is impracticable to comply with the requirements of that paragraph.

                     (e)  the member has no reason to believe that the superior order was based on a mistake as to a material fact; and

                      (f)  giving the order was reasonable and necessary to give effect to the superior order.

Ministerial authorisation

             (4)  However, the member must not take measures against an aircraft, or give an order of a kind mentioned in paragraph (1)(b) in connection with an aircraft, unless an authorising Minister has in writing authorised the taking of measures against the aircraft.

Exception

             (5)  Subsection (4) does not apply if:

                     (a)  the member believes on reasonable grounds that there is insufficient time to obtain the authorisation because a sudden and extraordinary emergency exists; or

                     (b)  the measures are taken in specified circumstances that an authorising Minister has authorised under subsection (6).

             (6)  An authorising Minister may in writing authorise the taking of measures against an aircraft in specified circumstances if this Division applies because an order states in accordance with paragraph 51AB(4)(c) that this Division and Division 4 apply in relation to the order.

Authorising Minister must be satisfied of reasonableness and necessity

             (7)  An authorising Minister must not authorise the taking of measures against an aircraft unless the Minister is satisfied that:

                     (a)  in the case of an authorisation under subsection (4)—taking action against the aircraft is reasonable and necessary; or

                     (b)  in the case of an authorisation under subsection (6)—taking action against the aircraft would be reasonable and necessary if the specified circumstances in question were to arise.

International obligations

             (8)  An authorising Minister must, in giving an authorisation under this section, have regard to Australia’s international obligations.

#### Subdivision A—Use of reasonable and necessary force

##### <a id="51T"></a>51T  Use of reasonable and necessary force

             (1)  A member of the Defence Force may, in exercising any power under Division 2, 2A, 3, 3A or 3B or this Division, use such force against persons and things as is reasonable and necessary in the circumstances.

          (1A)  However, subsection (1) does not apply to the powers under Subdivision E of Division 3A.

          (1B)  To avoid doubt, any use of force by a member of the Defence Force under this Part must be in accordance with this section.

Further restrictions on use of force

             (2)  Despite subsection (1), in exercising powers under Division 2, 3 or 3A (other than subparagraph 51SE(1)(a)(i) or (ii)) or this Division, a member of the Defence Force must not, in using force against a person:

                     (a)  do anything that is likely to cause the death of, or grievous bodily harm to, the person unless the member believes on reasonable grounds that doing that thing is necessary to protect the life of, or to prevent serious injury to, another person (including the member); or

                     (b)  subject the person to greater indignity than is reasonable and necessary in the circumstances.

          (2A)  Despite subsection (1), in exercising powers under Division 2A, a member of the Defence Force must not, in using force against a person:

                     (a)  do anything that is likely to cause the death of, or grievous bodily harm to, the person unless the member believes on reasonable grounds that doing that thing is necessary to:

                              (i)  protect the life of, or to prevent serious injury to, another person (including the member); or

                             (ii)  protect, against the threat concerned, the designated critical infrastructure in respect of which the powers are being exercised; or

                     (b)  subject the person to greater indignity than is reasonable and necessary in the circumstances.

          (2B)  Despite subsection (1), in exercising powers under subparagraph 51SE(1)(a)(i) or (ii) or Division 3B, a member of the Defence Force must not, in using force against a person or thing, do anything that is likely to cause the death of, or grievous bodily harm to, the person unless the member believes on reasonable grounds that:

                     (a)  doing that thing is necessary to protect the life of, or to prevent serious injury to, another person (including the member); or

                     (b)  doing that thing is necessary to protect designated critical infrastructure against a threat of damage or disruption to its operation; or

                     (c)  doing that thing is necessary and reasonable to give effect to the order under which, or under the authority of which, the member is acting.

             (3)  In addition, if a person is attempting to escape being detained by fleeing, a member of the Defence Force must not do anything that is likely to cause the death of, or grievous bodily harm to, the person unless the person has, if practicable, been called on to surrender and the member believes on reasonable grounds that the person cannot be apprehended in any other manner.

##### <a id="51U"></a>51U  Persons to be informed of offence if detained

             (1)  A member of the Defence Force who, in accordance with subparagraph 51I(1)(b)(ii), 51IB(b)(i) or 51SE(1)(b)(ii) or paragraph 51V(e), detains a person must inform the person, at the time the person is detained, of the offence mentioned in that provision.

             (2)  It is sufficient if the person is informed of the substance of the offence, and it is not necessary that this be done in language of a precise or technical nature.

             (3)  Subsection (1) does not apply to the detention of a person if:

                     (a)  the person should, in the circumstances, know the substance of the offence; or

                     (b)  the person’s actions make it impracticable for the member to inform the person of the offence.

#### Subdivision B—Action to be taken if things are seized

##### <a id="51V"></a>51V  Action to be taken if things are seized

                   If a member of the Defence Force seizes a thing under Division 2, 2A, 3 or 3A, the member:

                     (a)  may take such action as is reasonable and necessary to make the thing safe or prevent it being used; and

                     (b)  if the member seized the thing from a person—must, if it is practicable to do so, give the person a receipt for the thing; and

                     (c)  if the member believes on reasonable grounds that the thing has been used or otherwise involved in the commission of an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory—must give the thing to a member of a police force at the earliest practicable time; and

                     (d)  if paragraph (c) does not apply—must:

                              (i)  if the member seized the thing from a person and it is practicable to do so—return the thing to the person; or

                             (ii)  if not, give it to a member of a police force; and

                     (e)  if:

                              (i)  the member seized the thing from a person; and

                             (ii)  the member believes on reasonable grounds that the person used the thing in the commission of an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory;

                            may detain the person for the purpose of placing him or her in the custody of a member of a police force at the earliest practicable time.

#### Subdivision C—Members not entitled to exercise powers if obligations not complied with

##### <a id="51W"></a>51W  Members not entitled to exercise powers if obligations not complied with

                   If, before, during or after exercising a power under Division 2, 2A, 3, 3A or 3B or this Division, a member of the Defence Force fails to comply with any obligation imposed under any of those Divisions that relates to the exercise of the power, the member is not, or is taken not to have been, entitled to exercise the power.

### Division 4A—Applicable criminal law

##### <a id="51WA"></a>51WA  Applicable criminal law

             (1)  The substantive criminal law of the Jervis Bay Territory, as in force from time to time, applies in relation to a criminal act of a member of the Defence Force that is done, or purported to be done, under this Part.

             (2)  The substantive criminal law of the States and the other Territories, as in force from time to time, does not apply in relation to a criminal act of a member of the Defence Force that is done, or purported to be done, under this Part.

             (3)  To avoid doubt, Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ does not apply to an act done, or purported to be done, under this Part that is a criminal act (except to the extent that it constitutes an offence against the law of the Commonwealth).

             (4)  To avoid doubt, the functions of the Director of Public Prosecutions under section 6 of the _Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983_ in relation to the law of the Jervis Bay Territory as applied by subsection (1) are exclusive of the corresponding functions of any officer of a State or Territory, in relation to the law of the Jervis Bay Territory as so applied, under a law corresponding to that Act.

Note:          It is not intended that this section or Act restrict or limit the power of State or Territory police to investigate any criminal acts done, or purported to be done, by Defence Force members when operating under Part IIIAAA of this Act.

##### <a id="51WB"></a>51WB  Defence of superior orders in certain circumstances

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), the fact that a criminal act was done, or purported to be done, by a member of the Defence Force under this Part under an order of a superior does not relieve the member of criminal responsibility.

             (2)  It is a defence to a criminal act done, or purported to be done, by a member of the Defence Force under this Part that:

                     (a)  the criminal act was done by the member under an order of a superior; and

                     (b)  the member was under a legal obligation to obey the order; and

                     (c)  the order was not manifestly unlawful; and

                     (d)  the member had no reason to believe that circumstances had changed in a material respect since the order was given; and

                     (e)  the member had no reason to believe that the order was based on a mistake as to a material fact; and

                      (f)  the action taken was reasonable and necessary to give effect to the order.

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not limit the defences that may be available to the person.

### Division 5—Miscellaneous

          (1A)  Paragraph 46AA(1)(a) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ applies, in relation to a determination, as if the reference in that paragraph to disallowable legislative instruments also included a reference to:

                     (c)  the decision is or was made in response to an application.

             (2)  However, a decision is not a **_reviewable decision_** if the decision:

                     (a)  was made before 3 September 1939; or

                     (b)  relates to service rendered before 3 September 1939.

                     (a)  must review the decision; and

                     (b)  may make any recommendations to the Minister that the Tribunal considers appropriate.

Note 1:       The Tribunal does not have power to affirm or set aside the decision.

                     (a)  affirm the decision; or

                     (b)  set the decision aside and:

                              (i)  substitute a new decision (being a decision to recommend a person or group of persons for a defence award or a foreign award); or

                             (ii)  refer the matter to a person determined by the Tribunal, for reconsideration in accordance with any directions of the Tribunal.

Note:          Formal requirements relating to decisions etc. of the Tribunal are dealt with in section 110XE.

             (3)  The Tribunal may also make any recommendations to the Minister that the Tribunal considers appropriate and that arise out of, or relate to, the Tribunal’s review under subsection (2) of a reviewable decision.

             (4)  If, under subsection (2), the Tribunal sets aside a reviewable decision and substitutes a new decision then, unless the Tribunal determines otherwise, the substituted decision:

                     (a)  is taken to be a decision of the person who made the reviewable decision (except for the purpose of any review of the substituted decision, whether by the Tribunal or otherwise); and

                     (b)  has effect, or is taken to have had effect, on and from the date determined by the Tribunal.

                     (a)  the person must reconsider the matter accordingly; and

                     (b)  if the person’s decision on the reconsideration is a refusal of a kind described in paragraph 110V(1)(a)—the decision is taken to be a reviewable decision made by that person in response to an application made by the person or persons who made the application referred to in subsection (2) of this section.

Tribunal is bound by eligibility criteria that governed making of reviewable decision

             (6)  In reviewing a reviewable decision, the Tribunal is bound by the eligibility criteria that governed the making of the reviewable decision.

##### <a id="110VC"></a>110VC  Power to dismiss review applications

             (1)  Despite section 110VB, the Chair may, in writing, dismiss an application for review of a reviewable decision if the Chair considers that:

                     (a)  there is another process for review, by the Commonwealth, of the decision, and it would be preferable for the decision to first be reviewed by that process; or

                     (b)  the question whether the person, or group of persons, concerned should be recommended for the defence honour, defence award or foreign award concerned has already been adequately reviewed (whether by the Tribunal or otherwise); or

                     (c)  the application is frivolous or vexatious.

             (2)  The Chair’s power under subsection (1) to dismiss an application for review of a reviewable decision may be exercised at any time, whether before or after the Tribunal has started to review the decision.

_Tax Laws Amendment (Repeal of Inoperative Provisions) Act 2006 
 (No. 101, 2006)_

## Schedule 6

## 1  Application of Schedule 1 and 2 amendments

Except as mentioned in items 2 and 3, the repeals and amendments made by Schedules 1 and 2 apply:

                     (a)  so far as they affect assessments—to assessments for the 2006-07 income year and all later income years; and

                     (b)  otherwise—to acts done or omitted to be done, or states of affairs existing, after the commencement of the repeals and amendments.

## 6  Object

The object of this Part is to ensure that, despite the repeals and amendments made by this Act, the full legal and administrative consequences of:

                     (a)  any act done or omitted to be done; or

                     (b)  any state of affairs existing; or

                     (c)  any period ending;

before such a repeal or amendment applies, can continue to arise and be carried out, directly or indirectly through an indefinite number of steps, even if some or all of those steps are taken after the repeal or amendment applies.

## 7  Making and amending assessments, and doing other things, in relation to past matters

Even though an Act is repealed or amended by this Act, the repeal or amendment is disregarded for the purpose of doing any of the following under any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_):

                     (a)  making or amending an assessment (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

                     (b)  exercising any right or power, performing any obligation or duty or doing any other thing (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

Example 1: On 31 July 1999, Greg Ltd lodged its annual return under former section 160ARE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The return stated that the company had a credit on its franking account and that no franking deficit tax was payable for the 1998-99 franking year. Under former section 160ARH of that Act, the Commissioner was taken to have made an assessment consistent with the return.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of Part IIIAA of that Act, the Commissioner concludes that Greg Ltd fraudulently overfranked dividends it paid during the 1998-99 franking year, and had a franking account deficit for that franking year. As a result, the Commissioner considers that franking deficit tax and a penalty by way of additional tax are payable.

                   The Commissioner can amend the assessment under former section 160ARN of that Act, because item 7 of this Schedule disregards the repeal of that section for the purposes of making an assessment in relation to the 1998-99 franking year. Item 7 will also disregard the repeal of Division 11 of former Part IIIAA to the extent necessary for the Commissioner to assess Greg Ltd’s liability to a penalty by way of additional tax.

                   Despite the repeal of sections 160ARU and 160ARV, item 9 will ensure that the general interest charge will accrue on the unpaid franking deficit tax and penalty until they are paid.

                   Item 7 will also preserve Greg Ltd’s right, under former section 160ART of that Act, to object against the Commissioner’s amended assessment (including the penalty), since the objection is the exercise of a right in relation to a franking year that ended before the repeal of Part IIIAA.

Example 2: During the 1997-98 income year, Duffy Property Ltd withheld amounts from its employees’ wages as required by former Divisions 1AAA and 2 of Part VI of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The company failed to notify the Commissioner of those amounts, and failed to remit them to the Commissioner.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of those Divisions, the Commissioner discovers that the withheld amounts have not been remitted. The company’s records are incomplete and the Commissioner is unable to completely ascertain the extent of its liability for the withheld amounts. Under section 222AGA of that Act, the Commissioner makes an estimate of the liability.

                   Item 7 will disregard the repeal of section 220AAZA of that Act (which empowered the Commissioner to recover the amount of the estimate). Even though the estimate is made after the repeal, it relates to amounts withheld before the repeal.

## 8  Saving of provisions about effect of assessments

If a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act deals with the effect of an assessment, the repeal or amendment is disregarded in relation to assessments made, before or after the repeal or amendment applies, in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

## 9  Saving of provisions about general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty

If:

                     (a)  a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act provides for the payment of:

                              (i)  general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty (all within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_); or

                             (ii)  interest under the _Taxation (Interest on Overpayments and Early Payments) Act 1983_; and

                     (b)  in a particular case, the period in respect of which the charge, penalty or interest is payable (whether under the provision or under the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_) has not begun, or has begun but not ended, when the provision is repealed or amended;

then, despite the repeal or amendment, the provision or part continues to apply in the particular case until the end of the period.

## 10  Repeals disregarded for the purposes of dependent provisions

If the operation of a provision (the **_subject provision_**) of any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_) made under any Act depends to any extent on an Act, or a provision of an Act, that is repealed by this Act, the repeal is disregarded so far as it affects the operation of the subject provision.

## 11  Schedule does not limit operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_

This Schedule does not limit the operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.
