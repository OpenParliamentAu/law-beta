             (1)  Where the annual rate of pay applicable to a contributing member changes, otherwise than by reason of the member ceasing to hold an acting or temporary rank, or of the amendment of the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits (Annual Rates of Pay) Regulations made by section 9 of the _Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Amendment Act 1981_ and, as a result of the change, the amount of each fortnightly contribution to be paid by him would, if he did not make an election under this subsection, become less, he may, by notice in writing given to the Authority within a period of 90 days after the change, or within such further period as the Authority, in special circumstances, allows, elect to have that change in his annual rate of pay disregarded, and, if he so elects, the change shall be disregarded for the purposes of this Act.

             (2)  Where a contributing member who is entitled to make an election under subsection (1) does not make that election, he is entitled to a refund, payable by the Commonwealth, of so much of the contributions paid by him under section 17 as is equal to the difference between the amount of the contributions payable by him under that section before the change referred to in subsection (1) and the amount of the contributions that would have been so payable by him if the amount of each fortnightly contribution so payable by him had not exceeded the amount that is the amount of each fortnightly contribution payable by him after the change, and the amount of any contributions in respect of which he becomes so entitled to a refund shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed not to have been paid by him.

##### <a id="21"></a>21  Purchase of previous non-contributory service

             (4)  An election under subsection (1) is of no effect unless, at the time when the election is made, or, within such period after that time as the Authority, in special circumstances, allows, there is refunded to the Commonwealth, or arrangements satisfactory to the Authority are made for there to be refunded to the Commonwealth, any payment of a prescribed kind (being a payment of, or in the nature of, a gratuity or bounty or deferred pay) paid to the person under the previous legislation, or under legislation relating to conditions of service of members of the Defence Force, in respect of the period to which the election relates.

             (5)  Where a person who makes an election under this section had credited to him, in respect of the period to which the election relates, under the previous legislation or under legislation relating to the conditions of service of members of the Defence Force, any deferred pay or interest thereon, that credit shall, by force of this section, be deemed to have been cancelled.

                     (b)  any amount paid to the person in pursuance of an application, under section 74 of the previous Act, to commute a portion of any pension payable to him under that Act reduced by:

             (6)  For the purposes of paragraph (5)(f), the prescribed amount is:

                     (a)  if the previous election made by the person had specified the maximum amount (in this subsection called the **_previous maximum amount_**) that could have been specified in that election in accordance with subsection (2A)—an amount equal to the maximum amount (in this subsection called the **_putative maximum amount_**) that the person could (under subsection (2A)) specify in an election made under subsection (1) if the person were entitled to make the election on his or her becoming entitled to the retirement pay; or

                     (b)  if the previous election made by the person had specified a lesser amount than the previous maximum amount—an amount calculated by using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2008C00210/Html/DefForRetDeathBen1973_WD02_image006.gif)

                     (a)  a reference in subparagraph 39(2)(b)(ii) or (2)(c)(ii) of the previous Act to the rank held by an officer shall be read as a reference to the rank held by the officer on

             (3)  Where the previous pension percentage of pay applicable to a person to whom this section applies is greater than the new pension percentage of pay applicable to him, he may, by notice in writing given to the Authority within a period of 90 days after the date of his retirement, or within such further period as the Authority, in special circumstances, allows, elect that the rate at which retirement pay shall be payable to him shall be an amount per annum that is such percentage of his annual rate of pay for the purposes of this Act immediately before his retirement as is the same as the previous pension percentage of pay applicable to him, and, subject to subsection (4), the election has effect accordingly.

             (4)  Where the Authority so determines, an election under subsection (3) is of no effect unless the person making the election pays to the Commonwealth a contribution under this section of such amount as the Authority determines as being appropriate in the circumstances or arrangements satisfactory to the Authority are made for the payment of that contribution to the Commonwealth.

                     (d)  classify the member under subsection (1) according to that percentage of incapacity, as if the member had not died.

          (1B)  Where a deceased member of the scheme is classified under this section, the classification is taken to have had effect at all times on and after his or her retirement.

             (2)  In determining, for the purposes of subsection (1), the percentage of incapacity in relation to civil employment of a member of the scheme, the Authority shall have regard to the following matters only:

                     (a)  the vocational, trade and professional skills, qualifications and experience of the member;

                     (b)  the kinds of civil employment which a person with the skills, qualifications and experience referred to in paragraph (a) might reasonably undertake;

             (1)  A member of the scheme who is entitled to invalidity benefit and is classified as Class A or Class B under section 30 (whether on his retirement or by reason of his having been reclassified under subsection 34(1)) is entitled to invalidity pay at the rate applicable to him in accordance with this section.

             (2)  Subject to subsections (3) and (4), the rate at which invalidity pay is payable to a member of the scheme under this section is such amount per annum as is equal to, in the case of a recipient member classified as Class A under section 30, 76.5%, and, in the case of a recipient member classified as Class B, 38.25%, of the annual rate of pay applicable to him immediately before his retirement.

             (3)  Subject to section 33, where but for this subsection, the rate of invalidity pay payable to a member of the scheme under subsection (2) at any time would be less than the rate at which retirement pay would have been payable to him at that time if, at the time when he was retired on the ground of invalidity or of physical or mental incapacity to perform his duties, he had retired on other grounds, the rate of invalidity pay payable to him at that first-mentioned time is the rate at which retirement pay would have been so payable at that time.

             (4)  If the member of the scheme makes an election under subsection 124(1), the rate at which invalidity pay is payable to the member is the rate worked out by using the formula:

                     (a)  if the member does not make an election under subsection 124(1)—to invalidity pay at the rate at which retirement pay would have been payable to the member if the member had not made an election under subsection 124(1) in respect of the retirement pay; or

                              (i)  the lump sum payment referred to in paragraph (a); and

                    <a name="new-pension-percentag-pai"></a>**_new pension percentage of pay_**:

                     (a)  in relation to a person to whom this section applies who, on his retirement, is classified as Class B or Class C under section 30—means the annual rate of his invalidity pay (expressed as a percentage of the rate that was his annual rate of pay, for the purposes of this Act, immediately before his retirement) that is, or, but for an election under this section, would be, payable to him under this Act on his retirement; or

                     (b)  in relation to a person to whom this section applies who, on his retirement, is classified as Class A under section 30 but is subsequently reclassified as Class B—means the rate that would have been the annual rate of his invalidity pay (expressed as a percentage of the rate that was his annual rate of pay, for the purposes of this Act, immediately before his retirement) that would have been payable to him under this Act on his retirement if he had been classified as Class B on his retirement.

                    <a name="previou-pension-percentag-pai"></a>**_previous pension percentage of pay_**, in relation to a person to whom this section applies, means the annual rate of pension (expressed as a percentage of the rate that was his annual rate of pay, for the purpose of the previous Act, on 30 September 1972) that would have been payable to him under the previous legislation if he had retired on 30 September 1972, otherwise than on the ground of invalidity or of physical or mental incapacity to perform his duties, and:

                     (a)  in the case of a person who was, on 30 September 1972, an officer of the Permanent Forces—he had, on that date, attained the retiring age for the rank held by him on that date; or

             (3)  Where the previous pension percentage of pay applicable to a person to whom this section applies, being a person who on his retirement, is classified as Class B or Class C under section 30, is greater than the new pension percentage of pay applicable to him, he may, by notice in writing given to the Authority within a period of 90 days after the date of his retirement, or within such further period as the Authority, in special circumstances, allows, elect that the rate at which invalidity pay shall be payable to him shall be an amount per annum that is such percentage of his annual rate of pay for the purposes of this Act immediately before his retirement as is the same as the previous pension percentage of pay applicable to him, and, subject to subsection (5), the election has effect accordingly.

             (5)  Where the Authority so determines, an election under subsection (3) or (4) is of no effect unless the person making the election pays to the Commonwealth a contribution under this section of such amount as the Authority determines as being appropriate in the circumstances or arrangements satisfactory to the Authority are made for the payment of that contribution to the Commonwealth.

             (6)  In the application of this section to a person who was, on 30 September 1972, a non-Permanent Forces officer as defined by section 54A of the previous Act, the retiring age for the rank held shall be the age that would be deemed, for the purposes referred to in subsection 54A(2) of that Act, to be the retiring age for the rank held by the person on his retirement if he had retired on 30 September 1972.

       (1AA)  If, at a time when the Authority is reviewing, but has not yet determined, for the purposes of subsection (1), the percentage of incapacity in relation to civil employment of a recipient member, the recipient member dies:

                     (a)  the Authority must determine what was, immediately before the member’s death, his or her percentage of incapacity in relation to civil employment; and

                     (b)  where the Authority is satisfied, having regard to that percentage of incapacity, that, if the member had not died, the member would be reclassified and given a classification higher than that of the member at the time of his or her death, the Authority must reclassify the member under subsection (1) according to that percentage of incapacity, as if the member had not died.

          (1A)  In determining:

                    (aa)  what is the percentage of incapacity in relation to civil employment of a recipient member; or

                  (aab)  what was, immediately before his or her death, the percentage of incapacity in relation to civil employment of a recipient member who has died;

          (2A)  Where a deceased member is reclassified under this section:

                     (a)  the Authority must specify the day from which the reclassification has effect; and

                     (b)  the member is taken, for the purposes of this Part, to have been classified under section 30 accordingly on and after that day.

                     (a)  the member is reclassified as Class A or, having been classified as Class C, is reclassified as Class B; and

                     (b)  the Authority is satisfied that special circumstances exist that justify an earlier date being so specified.

             (4)  If, upon the reclassification of a recipient member as Class C, he would, but for this subsection, be entitled to benefit in accordance with subsection 32(2), he is entitled to that benefit only to the extent that the amount of that benefit exceeds the sum of the payments of invalidity pay received by him.

### Division 2—Benefits for non-member spouse

##### <a id="49B"></a>49B  Associate pension for non-member spouse if operative time in payment phase

             (1)  This section applies to a superannuation interest (the **_original interest_)**if:

                     (a)  the Authority receives a splitting agreement or splitting order in respect of the original interest; and

                     (b)  the original interest is not an entitlement to pension under section 42 or 43; and

                     (c)  the member spouse and the non-member spouse are both alive at the operative time; and

                     (d)  if a base amount applies—the base amount at the operative time is not more than the family law value or the scheme value.

             (2)  If, at the operative time, standard pension is payable in respect of the original interest, then the non-member spouse is entitled to associate pension from the operative time, at the rate calculated under the Orders by reference to the transfer amount.

Note:          If standard pension is not payable at the operative time in respect of the original interest, then the non-member spouse will be entitled to benefits under the _Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991_.

##### <a id="49C"></a>49C  Commutation of small associate pension

             (1)  If the annual rate of associate pension to which the non-member spouse becomes entitled is less than the amount determined under the Orders, then the non-member spouse may elect to commute the pension.

             (2)  The election must be made in writing to the Chairman not later than 3 months after the non-member spouse becomes entitled to the pension.

             (3)  If the non-member spouse makes the election, then the non-member spouse is entitled instead to a lump sum equal to the transfer amount.

### Division 3—Reduction of benefits for member spouse

                     (a)  at the operative time, standard pension is not payable in respect of the original interest; and

                     (b)  after the operative time, standard pension becomes payable to the member spouse in respect of the original interest;

then the annual rate of that standard pension is reduced to the amount calculated under the Orders.

Note:          If the member spouse dies before becoming entitled to standard pension, then subsection (1) will nevertheless result in an indirect reduction of any widow’s pension that becomes payable. This happens because the amount of the widow’s pension is based on the amount of invalidity pay (a standard pension) that would have become payable to the member spouse at the time of death.

             (2)  A reduction under subsection (1) is to be disregarded in calculating the amount of any non-standard pension that later becomes payable.

Note:          For example, the reduction will be disregarded in calculating the amount of pension under section 42 payable to a child of the member spouse after the member spouse’s death.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  at the operative time, standard pension is not payable in respect of the original interest; and

                     (b)  after the operative time, a lump sum amount becomes payable, in respect of the original interest, under section 32, 48, 48A, 56, 57 or 77;

then that lump sum amount is reduced to the amount calculated under the Orders.

##### <a id="49E"></a>49E  Operative time during payment phase—reduction of standard pension or lump sum amount

             (1)  If, at the operative time, standard pension is payable to the member spouse in respect of the original interest, then the annual rate of that pension is reduced to the amount calculated under the Orders.

Reduction of later standard pensions

          (1A)  If:

                     (a)  the annual rate of a standard pension (the **_first pension_**) payable to the member spouse is reduced under subsection (1); and

                     (b)  after the operative time, another standard pension (the **_later pension_**) becomes payable to the member spouse;

then the annual rate of the later pension is reduced to the amount calculated under the Orders.

Reduction in later payments of lump sum amounts

          (1B)  If:

                     (a)  the annual rate of a standard pension payable to the member spouse is reduced under subsection (1); and

                     (b)  after the operative time, a lump sum amount becomes payable, in respect of the member spouse, under section 32, 48, 48A, 56, 57 or 77;

then the lump sum amount is reduced to the amount calculated under the Orders.

             (2)  A reduction under this section is to be disregarded in calculating the amount of any non-standard pension that later becomes payable.

Note:          For example, the reduction will be disregarded in calculating the amount of pension under section 42 payable to a child of the member spouse after the member spouse’s death.

### Division 4—Miscellaneous

             (2)  For the purpose of calculating the contributions that a reinstated candidate to whom this Part applies is required to pay in respect of the period to which the election made by him under section 51 relates, his annual rate of pay during that period shall be deemed to be the annual rate of pay that would have been applicable to him during that period if he had not ceased to be an eligible member of the Defence Force.

             (1)  Where a person who is a re-instated candidate to whom this Part applies became entitled to retirement pay upon his ceasing to be an eligible member of the Defence Force, he shall pay to the Commonwealth an amount equal to the aggregate of the payments of retirement pay received by him.

             (1)  For the purposes of this Act, subsections  10(2), 11(2) and 12(2) of the Defence (Parliamentary Candidates) Act do not apply to or in relation to a re-instated candidate who is not, and does not become, a re-instated candidate to whom this Part applies.

then, for the purposes of this Act, he shall be deemed to have continued to have been an eligible member of the Defence Force during the period that commenced upon his ceasing to be an eligible member of the Defence Force and ended on the day on which he dies and his annual rate of pay on the day on which he dies shall be deemed to be the annual rate of pay that would have been applicable to him on that day if he had not ceased to be an eligible member of the Defence Force.

                     (a)  that, if a person to whom this section applies had not ceased to be an eligible member of the Defence Force, he would, at a time (in this subsection referred to as **_the relevant time_**) within:

                    <a name="life-polici"></a>**_life policy_** has the same meaning as in the _Life Insurance Act 1995_.

                    <a name="owner-life-polici"></a>**_owner of a life policy_** has the same meaning as in the _Life Insurance Act 1995_.

                    <a name="rule"></a>**_rules_**, in relation to a superannuation scheme, means the rules governing the operation of the scheme, whether contained in a law or in a trust deed or other instrument.

             (2)  For the purposes of this Part, the membership by a person of a House of the Parliament of the Commonwealth or of a State shall be treated as if it were employment of the person by the Commonwealth or by that State, as the case may be.

          (2A)  For the purposes of this Part, the membership by a person of the Legislative Assembly for the Northern Territory or a legislative or advisory body for another Territory prescribed for the purposes of section 7 of the _Defence (Parliamentary Candidates) Act 1969-1974_ shall be treated as if it were employment of the person by the Commonwealth.

             (3)  A reference in this Part to a superannuation scheme shall be read as a reference to a superannuation or retirement scheme, however established, and, unless the contrary intention appears, shall be read as including a reference to the previous benefits scheme or to the benefits scheme constituted by this Act.

             (4)  For the purposes of this Part, a benefit payable to or in respect of a member under a superannuation scheme shall not be taken to have been based partly on contributions under the scheme by the employer by reason only that the benefit included interest upon contributions made under the scheme by the member.

             (5)  A person in respect of whom benefits are applicable under a superannuation scheme by reason of his being employed in any employment, whether or not he has made contributions under the scheme, shall be deemed to be a member of the superannuation scheme.

### Division 2—Contributing members who have preserved rights from previous employment

##### <a id="68"></a>68  Transfer value payable in respect of previous employment

             (1)  In this Division:

                     (a)  a reference, in relation to a contributing member, to a transfer value payable to or in respect of the member under a superannuation scheme applicable in relation to any employment in which he was employed at any time before the date on which he became an eligible member of the Defence Force is a reference to a benefit by way of a lump sum payable to or in respect of the member under that scheme upon the termination of the employment otherwise than on the ground of invalidity or of physical or mental incapacity to perform the duties of the employment, being a benefit that was based wholly upon contributions under that scheme by the employer or was based partly upon such contributions and partly upon contributions under the scheme by the member; and

                     (b)  a reference to the amount of a transfer value to which paragraph (a) applies does not include a reference to any part of the lump sum that was based upon contributions by the member that were of a similar nature to contributions under the _Superannuation Act 1922_, or that Act as amended and in force from time to time, for reserve units of pension or to supplementary contributions under the Superannuation Act.

             (2)  If, after a transfer value became payable to or in respect of a person under a superannuation scheme, an amount equal to the whole or any part of that transfer value was paid to a person administering another superannuation scheme (not being the benefits scheme constituted by this Act):

                     (a)  where the whole of the transfer value was so paid—that transfer value shall be disregarded for the purposes of this Division; or

                     (b)  where part of the transfer value was so paid—the amount of that transfer value shall be deemed, for the purposes of this Division, to be reduced by the amount so paid.

             (3)  Subject to subsection (4), a transfer value shall be deemed, for the purposes of this Division, to have become payable in respect of a person under a superannuation scheme upon the termination of any employment if, upon the termination of that employment, the person was the owner of a life policy, or was entitled to have the rights of the owner of a life policy assigned to him or her, being a policy the premiums for which were, while the person was employed in that employment, paid in whole or in part by the person’s employer, and, in that case, the surrender value of the policy as at the date of the termination of the employment shall be taken to be the amount of the transfer value.

             (4)  Where a transfer value is, by virtue of subsection (3), to be deemed, for the purposes of this Division, to have become payable in respect of a person upon the termination of any employment by reason that, upon the termination of that employment, the person was the owner of a life policy, or was entitled to have the rights of the owner of a life policy assigned to him or her, a transfer value shall not be deemed, for those purposes, to have become payable in respect of the person upon the termination of any previous employment by reason that, upon the termination of that previous employment, the person was the owner of that policy, or was entitled to have the rights of the owner of that policy assigned to him or her.

### Division 3—Preservation of rights of contributing members ceasing to be eligible members of the Defence Force

##### <a id="70"></a>70  Interpretation

             (1)  For the purposes of this Division, the prescribed period in relation to a person who has ceased to be an eligible member of the Defence Force is:

                     (a)  in the case of a person other than a person in relation to whom paragraph (b) applies—the period of 90 days immediately after he ceased to be an eligible member of the Defence Force; or

                     (b)  in the case of a person who ceased to be an eligible member of the Defence Force by reason of his having been transferred to a Reserve or discharged from the Defence Force, or having had his continuous full-time service terminated, under the Defence (Parliamentary Candidates) Act for the purpose of enabling him to become a candidate for election as a member of a House of the Parliament of Australia or of a State or of the Legislative Assembly for the Northern Territory or a legislative or advisory body for another Territory prescribed for the purposes of section 7 of the _Defence (Parliamentary Candidates) Act 1969-1974_ and was a candidate at the election:

                              (i)  if he is elected—the period commencing immediately after he ceased to be an eligible member and ending on the date on which he becomes a member of that House, Assembly or body, as the case may be; or

                             (ii)  if he is not elected—the period of 90 days immediately after the date that is the declared date in relation to the election under the Defence (Parliamentary Candidates) Act.

             (2)  For the purposes of this Division but subject to subsection (3):

                     (a)  a period in respect of which invalidity pay was payable to a person under this Act and immediately before the commencement of which he was a contributing member, or a period in respect of which a pension, being invalidity benefit, was payable to a person under the previous Act and immediately before the commencement of which he was a contributor under that Act, shall be treated as if it had been a period during which he was a contributing member or a contributor, as the case may be;

                     (b)  a period in respect of which invalidity pay was payable to a person under this Act and immediately before the commencement of which he was employed in public employment, or a period in respect of which a pension, being invalidity benefit, was payable to a person under the previous Act and immediately before the commencement of which he was employed in public employment, shall be treated as if it had been a period during which he was employed in public employment; and

                     (c)  a period in respect of which a pension was payable to a person under a superannuation scheme applicable in respect of any employment of the person (other than the previous benefits scheme or the benefits scheme constituted by this Act) by reason of his invalidity or of his physical or mental incapacity to perform the duties of that employment and immediately before the commencement of which he was employed in that employment shall be treated as if it had been a period in which he was employed in that employment.

             (3)  Where invalidity pay was not payable to a person under this Act during any period by reason only of section 35, or a pension, being invalidity benefit, was not payable to a person under the previous Act during any period by reason only of section 53A or section 53B of the previous Act, that period shall be treated for the purposes of this Division as if it had been a period during which that invalidity pay or pension, as the case may be, was payable but:

                     (a)  if the person was, immediately before the invalidity pay or the pension, as the case may be, became payable, a contributing member for the purposes of this Act or a contributor under the previous Act—shall not, in the calculation of the period during which he was employed in eligible employment, be treated as if it had been a period of effective service in relation to him under this Act; or

                     (b)  if the person was, immediately before the invalidity pay or the pension, as the case may be, became payable, employed in public employment—shall not, in the calculation of the period during which he was employed in public employment, be treated as if it had been a period during which he was employed in public employment.

##### <a id="130"></a>130  Attachment of benefits

             (1)  Where a judgment given by a court for the payment of a sum of money has not been fully satisfied by the judgment debtor and the judgment debtor is entitled to a benefit under this Act, the judgment creditor may serve on the Authority a copy of the judgment, certified under the hand of the Registrar or other proper officer of the court by which the judgment was given, and a statutory declaration by the judgment creditor stating that the judgment has not been fully satisfied by the judgment debtor and specifying the amount due by the judgment debtor under the judgment.

             (2)  Where a copy of a judgment and a statutory declaration are served on the Authority in accordance with subsection (1), the Authority shall, as soon as practicable, by notice in writing given to the judgment debtor, inform him of the service of those documents and require him, within such period as is specified in the notice and in such manner as is so specified, to notify the Authority whether the amount specified in the declaration is still due under the judgment and, if no amount or a lesser amount is due under the judgment, to furnish to the Authority, in such manner as is specified in the notice, evidence in support of that fact.

                    Maximum penalty:    $40.

             (4)  If, at the expiration of the period specified in the notice, the Authority is satisfied that an amount is due under the judgment, the Authority may, in its discretion, authorize the deduction from the benefit, and the payment to the judgment creditor, of such sums as do not exceed that amount, and those deductions and those payments shall be made accordingly.

             (6)  If, after a copy of a judgment given against any person entitled to a benefit under this Act, being a judgment in respect of which the Authority is satisfied that an amount is due, has been served in accordance with subsection (1), a copy of another judgment given (whether before or after the first-mentioned judgment) against the same person in favour of the person in whose favour the first-mentioned judgment was given, or in favour of another person, is served in accordance with that subsection, a payment shall not be made in pursuance of this section to the judgment creditor under the other judgment in respect of the amount due under that judgment until the amount due under the first-mentioned judgment has been paid.

             (7)  A payment made to a judgment creditor in pursuance of this section shall, as between the Commonwealth and the person entitled to benefit under this Act, be deemed to be a payment by the Commonwealth to the person entitled to benefit.

## Table A

### Application, saving or transitional provisions

_Defence Legislation Amendment (Enhancement of the Reserves and Modernisation) Act 2001 (No. 10, 2001)_

## Schedule 2

## 94  Saving—old regulations

(1)        Regulations that were in effect under any Act immediately before the commencement of this item continue to have effect after that time as if members of an arm of the Defence Force who were members of a particular part or component of that arm immediately before the commencement of this item were still members of that part or component after that time, even if that part or component no longer exists.

_Example: Assume that, immediately before the commencement of this item, regulations imposed training obligations on members of the Air Force Specialist Reserve. Those obligations would continue to apply to former members of that Reserve after commencement, even though the Air Force Specialist Reserve itself is no longer mentioned in the Air Force Act 1923 and the members have now become members of the Air Force Reserve._

(2)        However, regulations that continue in effect under this item do so only to the extent that they are not amended or revoked by later regulations.

## 95  Regulations about transitional matters

(1)        The regulations may make provision in relation to other saving and transitional matters in connection with the amendments made by this Schedule.

(2)        In particular, such regulations may deal with the status, after the commencement of the amendments, of persons who were members of the Defence Force immediately before that time.

(3)        Subitem (2) does not limit the scope of subitem (1).

             (2)  For the purposes of this section, if an act or omission is alleged to have taken place between 2 dates, one before and one on or after the day on which a particular amendment commences, the act or omission is alleged to have taken place before the amendment commences.

_Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Indexation) Act 2001 (No. 148, 2001)_

## Schedule 3  

## 31  Application

(1)        The amendments and repeals made by this Schedule apply:

                             (ii)  each subsequent prescribed half-year; and

                     (b)  for any other purpose related to the purpose mentioned in paragraph (a).

(2)        To avoid doubt, the amendments and repeals made by this Schedule do not affect any increase in the rate of a pension benefit that arose from the operation of any provision amended or repealed by this Schedule.

* * *

_Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Family Law and Other Matters) Act 2004 (No. 58, 2004)_

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Application of family law interest-splitting amendments
