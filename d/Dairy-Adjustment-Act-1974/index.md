## An Act to provide Financial Assistance in connexion with Dairy Adjustment Programs

WHEREAS the policies for assistance to the dairying industry announced by the Australian Government before the dissolution of the Parliament on 11 April 1974 were given effect to in part only by the _Marginal Dairy Farms Agreements Act 1974_ and further provision is necessary to give effect to the remainder of those policies:

AND WHEREAS, by reason of the matters recited in the _Marginal Dairy Farms Agreements Act 1974_, it is appropriate that the further provision should be made without receipt of a report of the Industries Assistance Commission in relation to the matter of assistance to the dairying industry:

AND WHEREAS it is expedient to give effect to the foregoing by repealing the _Marginal Dairy Farms Agreements Act 1970‑1974_ and re‑enacting and extending the provisions of that Act to give effect to the whole of the policies so announced:
