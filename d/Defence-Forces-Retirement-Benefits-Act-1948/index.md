          (3B)  Where the category of a member changes and, as a result of the change, the amount of contribution to be paid fortnightly by him to the Fund would, if he did not make an election under this subsection, become less, he may, by notice in writing given to the Board within 4 months after the change, elect to have that change in category disregarded, and, if he so elects, that change in category shall be disregarded for the purposes of this Act.

             (4)  In this section, **_the prescribed amount_** means such amount, being a multiple of $130, as is specified in the regulations for the purposes of this section.

             (5)  In making a regulation for the purposes of subsection (4), the Governor-General shall have regard to any general variations in the rates of annual pay of members that have occurred.

             (6)  A regulation for the purposes of subsection (4) may be expressed to have taken effect from a date earlier than the date on which the regulation is made, being a date not earlier than 6 months before the date on which the regulation is made.

##### <a id="12A"></a>12A  Delegation

             (1)  The Authority may, by resolution, either generally or as otherwise provided in the instrument of delegation, delegate to a member or to a deputy member, or to any other person, all or any of its powers under this Act, other than this power of delegation.

             (3)  A delegation of a power under this section:

                     (b)  does not prevent the exercise of the power by the Authority; and

                     (c)  continues in force notwithstanding a change in the membership of the Authority.

             (4)  Section 34A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ applies in relation to a delegation under this section as if the Authority were a person.

             (5)  A certificate signed by the Chairman stating any matter with respect to a delegation of a power under this section is _prima facie_ evidence of that matter.

             (6)  A document purporting to be a certificate mentioned in subsection (5) shall, unless the contrary is established, be deemed to be such a certificate and to have been duly given.

##### <a id="13"></a>13  Cost of management

             (2)  Where a contributor retires and, without a break in the continuity of his service, again becomes a member, he shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed not to have ceased to be a member by reason of that retirement.

##### <a id="26"></a>26  Application of the _Criminal Code_

                             (ii)  retires before attaining the retiring age for the rank held by him;

                            and the Board is satisfied that the purpose of his retirement is to meet the needs of the Service; or

the officer is entitled, on his retirement, to a pension in accordance with the succeeding provisions of this section.

             (3)  Subject to this Act, the rate at which pension is payable under this section to an officer whose age on the date of his retirement is 60 years or more is an amount per annum ascertained by multiplying the amount of $91 by the number that is his category number on that date.

          (3A)  Subject to this Act, the rate at which pension is payable under this section to an officer whose age on the date of his retirement is less than 60 years is the amount per annum that would be the rate applicable to him under subsection (3) if he had attained the age of 60 years on that date multiplied by the factor set out in the third column of the Second Schedule opposite to the age set out in the first column of that Schedule that is his age on that date.

             (4)  In the application of subsections (3) and (3A) to an officer referred to in paragraph (2)(a), the age of that officer at the date of his retirement shall be deemed to be his actual age on that date reduced by:

             (3)  Subject to this Act, the rate at which pension is payable to a member under this section is an amount per annum ascertained by multiplying the amount of $91 by the number that is his category number on the date of his retirement and, except where he has completed 40 years’ service for pension, multiplying the result by the factor set out in the third column of the Second Schedule opposite to the number of years set out in the second column of that Schedule that is the number of years of service for pension completed by him.

             (4)  This section does not apply to a person who retires on or after 1 October 1972.

##### <a id="41A"></a>41A  Annual amount of certain pensions to be calculated to nearest dollar

                     (a)  if that last-mentioned amount is less than 50 cents—the amount of pension shall be deemed to be reduced by that last-mentioned amount; and

                     (b)  in any other case—the amount of pension shall be deemed to be increased by treating the cents as $1.

##### <a id="43"></a>43  Non-completion of engagement

             (1)  Except as otherwise provided in this Act, where a member (not being an officer), who is a contributor, retires before completing the engagement under which he was serving immediately prior to his retirement, he shall be entitled to a refund of the amount of any contributions paid by him under this Act in respect of the period served under the uncompleted engagement and shall also be entitled, as from the date of his retirement, to the pension or benefits (if any) to which he would have been entitled if he had retired immediately before commencing to serve under that engagement:

Provided that a member who has completed 20 years’ service for pension prior to attaining the retiring age for his rank and retires with the approval of the Service Board shall not be entitled to a refund under this section, but shall be entitled to the same pension as that to which he would have been entitled if the pension had been granted under section 41 and if the engagement, which was uncompleted at the date of his retirement, had been an engagement for the completed portion thereof and he had retired on the completion of that engagement.

             (2)  This section does not apply to a person who retires on or after 1 October 1972.

##### <a id="44"></a>44  Completion of engagement

             (1)  Subject to this section, a member shall not, for the purposes of sections 41, 42 and 43, be deemed to have completed an engagement unless he has served under the engagement up to the date on which the engagement was due to terminate.

he shall, for the purposes of subsection 42(1), be deemed to have completed his engagement or the last of those engagements, as the case may be, but, for the purposes of subsection 42(2), he shall not be deemed to have completed a period of service for pension longer than the period completed by him immediately before his retirement or discharge.

##### <a id="45"></a>45  Pension increase on officer retiring at age of 61 years or over

                     (c)  he is entitled to a pension under section 38, or under subsection 52(1);

the amount of that pension shall be increased by an amount ascertained by multiplying the portion of the pension equivalent to the contributions paid by him to the Fund by:

                     (e)  in any other case—13%.

##### <a id="50"></a>50  Service on Reserve

                     (a)  does not agree so to serve; or

                     (b)  having agreed so to serve, is released at his or her own request from the agreement;

there shall, subject to subsection (2), be deducted from each fortnightly instalment of the pension (other than an instalment that becomes payable on or after 1 October 1972) an amount of $4 if the person is a male or $2 if the person is a female.

             (2)  The sum of the deductions made from instalments of the pension of a person under subsection (1) shall not exceed:

                     (a)  if the person has not agreed to serve on the Reserve—$400 if the person is a male or $200 if the person is a female; or

                     (b)  if the person has agreed to serve on the Reserve but is released at his or her own request from the agreement—such amount as the Board determines, being an amount that does not exceed $400 if the person is a male or $200 if the person is a female.

             (3)  Where, under this section, an amount is deducted from a payment of pension to a person, the amount that, but for this subsection, the Commonwealth would be required to pay to the Fund under this Act in respect of the payment shall be such amount as the Commonwealth would have been required to pay if the deduction had not been made less the amount of the deduction.

##### <a id="51"></a>51   Classification in respect of incapacity

             (1)  Subject to subsection (3), where:

                     (a)  a member who is a contributor has been retired before attaining the retiring age for the rank held by him;

                     (b)  an officer who is a contributor has been granted an extension of service for a period that does not extend beyond the period of 2 years after the attainment by him of the retiring age for the rank held by him and has been retired before the expiration of the period of the extension;

                     (c)  a member (not being an officer) who is a contributor has been engaged for a period of service extending beyond the date on which he will attain the retiring age for the rank held by him and has been retired before the expiration of a period of 2 years after that date and before the expiration of the period of the engagement; or

                     (d)  the age for compulsory retirement of a member (not being an officer) who is a contributor has been extended and the member has been retired before the attainment by him of the extended age and before the expiration of a period of 2 years after the attainment by him of the retiring age for the rank held by him;

on the ground of invalidity or of physical or mental incapacity to perform his duties (not, in the opinion of the Authority, due to wilful action on his part for the purpose of obtaining pension or other benefit), he is entitled to benefit in accordance with sections 52, 52A and 53, but, subject to section 60, is not otherwise entitled to benefit under this Act.

             (2)  Where a person (not being a person to whom section 52A applies) is, or is about to become, entitled to benefit by virtue of subsection (1), the Authority shall determine the percentage of total incapacity of the person in relation to civil employment and shall classify the person according to the percentage of incapacity as follows: 

                            Percentage of Incapacity                                                                    Class

          (2A)  Where:

                     (a)  a person (other than a person to whom section 52A applies) who is entitled to benefit by virtue of subsection (1) dies; and

                     (b)  at the time of his or her death, the Authority has not made a determination in respect of the person under subsection (2);

the Authority must:

                     (c)  determine what was, immediately before the person’s death, his or her percentage of incapacity in relation to civil employment; and

                     (d)  classify the person under subsection (1) according to that percentage of incapacity, as if the person had not died.

          (2B)  Where a deceased member of the scheme is classified under this section, the classification is taken to have had effect at all times on and after his or her retirement.

             (3)  Where:

                     (a)  a member, within 3 months after becoming a contributor, is retired on the ground of invalidity or of physical or mental incapacity to perform his duties; and

                     (b)  the Authority is satisfied that:

                              (i)  the invalidity or incapacity was caused, or was substantially contributed to, by a physical or mental condition that existed at the time he became a contributor; and

                             (ii)  the condition was not aggravated, or was not materially aggravated, by his service as a member;

subsection (1) does not apply in relation to him.

             (4)  Where a person who has ceased to be a member again becomes a member (other than a person referred to in Part VIA as a **_re-instated candidate to whom this Part applies_**), subsection (3) applies in relation to him as if he had become a contributor at the time he commenced to make contributions after again becoming a member.

             (5)  This section does not apply to a person who retires on or after 1 October 1972.

             (6)  Where a member who is a contributor has, before 1 October 1972, been retired otherwise than on the ground of invalidity or of physical or mental incapacity to perform his duties but the Chief of Navy, the Chief of Army or the Chief of Air Force or a person authorized in writing by the Chief of Navy, the Chief of Army or the Chief of Air Force, as the case requires, informs the Authority that, at the time the member was retired, grounds existed on which he could have been retired on the ground of invalidity or of physical or mental incapacity to perform his duties, he may, for the purposes of this Act, be treated as if he had been retired on that ground.

##### <a id="52"></a>52  Rate or amount of invalidity benefit

             (1)  A person who is entitled to invalidity benefit and is classified as Class A under subsection 51(2) is entitled to a pension at a rate of such amount per annum as is ascertained by multiplying the amount of $91 by the number that is his category number on the date of his retirement.

             (2)  A person who is entitled to invalidity benefit, is classified as Class B under subsection 51(2) and was an officer immediately before his retirement is entitled to a pension:

                     (a)  if, immediately before his retirement, he had completed 20 years’ service for pension but had not attained the retiring age for the rank held by him at that time—at the rate at which pension would be payable to an officer of the same category as the category of the person immediately before his retirement who became entitled to a pension under section 38 upon retiring on attaining the retiring age for the rank held by the person immediately before his retirement;

                     (b)  if, immediately before his retirement, he had completed 20 years’ service for pension and had attained the retiring age for the rank held by him at that time—at the rate at which pension would be payable to him under section 38 if he were not entitled to invalidity benefit; or

                     (c)  in any other case—at whichever is the lesser of the following rates:

                              (i)  the rate at which pension would be payable to an officer of the same category as the category of the person immediately before his retirement who became entitled to a pension under section 38 upon retiring on attaining the retiring age for the rank held by the person immediately before his retirement; or

                             (ii)  a rate equal to one-half of the rate at which pension would be payable to him if he were classified as Class A under subsection 51(2).

             (3)  A person who is entitled to invalidity benefit, is classified as Class B under subsection 51(2) and was not an officer immediately before his retirement is entitled to a pension:

                     (a)  if, immediately before his retirement, he had completed 20 years’ service for pension—at the rate at which pension would be payable to him under section 41 if he were not entitled to invalidity benefit; or

                     (b)  in any other case—at the rate at which pension would be payable to a member of the same category as the category of the person immediately before his retirement who became entitled to a pension under section 41 upon retiring on completing 20 years’ service for pension.

             (4)  Where a person to whom paragraph (3)(a) applies retired before completing the engagement under which he was serving on the date of his retirement and before attaining the retiring age for the rank held by him, then, for the purpose of determining the rate at which pension is payable to him, his period of service for pension shall be deemed to be the period that would have been his period of service for pension if he had retired upon completing that engagement.

             (5)  A person who is entitled to invalidity benefit, is classified as Class C under subsection 51(2) and was an officer immediately before his retirement is entitled:

                     (a)  if, immediately before his retirement, he had completed 20 years’ service for pension but had not attained the retiring age for the rank held by him at that time—to a pension at the rate at which pension would be payable to him if, upon retirement, he had become entitled to a pension under section 39 by virtue of paragraph 39(2)(b);

                     (b)  if, immediately before his retirement, he had completed 20 years’ service for pension and had attained the retiring age for the rank held by him at that time—to a pension at the rate at which pension would be payable to him if he were classified as Class B; or

                     (c)  in any other case—in addition to a refund under section 60 of the amount of contributions paid by him under this Act, to a gratuity in accordance with subsections (6) and (7).

             (6)  Subject to subsection (7), the gratuity to which a person is entitled under paragraph (5)(c) is an amount calculated at the rate of $150 if the person is a male, or $75 if the person is a female, for each year of service for pension completed by the person.

             (7)  Where the period of service for pension of a person who was an officer immediately before his retirement includes a period served by the person as a member other than an officer, the gratuity to which the person is entitled under paragraph (5)(c) is the sum of:

                     (a)  an amount calculated at the rate of $100 per annum if the person is a male, or $50 per annum if the person is a female, in respect of the period of service for pension completed by the person as a member other than an officer; and

                     (b)  an amount calculated at the rate of $150 per annum if the person is a male, or $75 per annum if the person is a female, in respect of the period that is equal to the difference between:

                              (i)  the period comprising the years of service for pension completed by the person on retirement; and

                             (ii)  the period of service for pension completed by the person as a member other than an officer.

             (8)  A person who is entitled to invalidity benefit, is classified as Class C under subsection 51(2) and was not an officer immediately before his retirement is entitled:

                     (a)  if, immediately before his retirement, he had completed 20 years’ service for pension—to a pension at the rate at which pension would be payable to a member of the same category as the category of the person immediately before his retirement who became entitled to a pension under section 41 upon retiring on completing a period of service for pension equal to the period of service for pension completed by that person; or

                     (b)  in any other case—in addition to a refund under section 60 of the amount of contributions paid by the person under this Act, to a gratuity:

                              (i)  if the person is a male—of an amount calculated at the rate of $100 for each year of service for pension completed by him; or

                             (ii)  if the person is a female—of an amount calculated at the rate of $50 for each year of service for pension completed by her.

             (9)  For the purposes of subsections (6) and (7) and subparagraphs (8)(b)(i) and (ii), **_service for pension_** includes service before attaining the age of 20 years under any engagement under which the person has served, but does not include any period of such service under an initial engagement of less than one year.

           (10)  Where at any time the Authority is satisfied that the value of any invalidity benefit payable to a person who was an officer immediately before his retirement and was retired on or after attaining the retiring age for the rank held by him is less than the value of any benefit to which he would have been entitled under this Act if he had not been entitled to invalidity benefit, the Authority may vary the invalidity benefit to such extent as it thinks proper in the circumstances, but not so as to reduce its value.

##### <a id="52A"></a>52A  Invalidity benefit payable to certain contributors under Superannuation Act

             (1)  This section applies to a member who becomes entitled to benefit by virtue of subsection 51(1) of this Act and who, at the time he becomes so entitled, is an employee for the purposes of the _Superannuation Act 1922-1968_ whose liability to make contributions to the Superannuation Fund is deferred by virtue of section 35A of that Act or is a person whose entitlement to a pension under that Act is suspended by force of subsection 48C(1) of that Act.

             (2)  Notwithstanding anything contained in section 52, the invalidity benefit to which a person to whom this section applies is entitled is, in addition to a refund under section 60 of the amount of contributions paid by him under this Act, the gratuity to which he would have been entitled if:

                     (a)  this section had not applied to him; and

                     (b)  he had been classified as Class C under subsection 51(2).

##### <a id="53"></a>53  Reclassification in respect of incapacity

             (1)  The Authority may, from time to time, if it is satisfied that the percentage of incapacity in relation to civil employment of a pensioner classified under section 51 is such that the classification of the pensioner should be altered, reclassify him in the appropriate classification set out in subsection 51(2) according to the percentage of his incapacity in relation to civil employment.

       (1AA)  If, at a time when the Authority is reviewing, but has not yet determined, for the purposes of subsection (1), the percentage of incapacity in relation to civil employment of a pensioner, the pensioner dies:

                     (a)  the Authority must determine what was, immediately before the pensioner’s death, his or her percentage of incapacity in relation to civil employment; and

                     (b)  where the Authority is satisfied, having regard to that percentage of incapacity, that, if the pensioner had not died, the pensioner would be reclassified and given a classification higher than that of the pensioner at the time of his or her death, the Authority must reclassify the pensioner under subsection (1) according to that percentage of incapacity, as if the pensioner had not died.

          (1A)  In determining:

                    (aa)  what is the percentage of incapacity in relation to civil employment of a pensioner; or

                  (aab)  what was, immediately before his or her death, the percentage of incapacity in relation to civil employment of a pensioner who has died;

the Authority shall have regard to the following matters only:

                     (a)  the vocational, trade and professional skills, qualifications and experience of the pensioner;

                     (b)  the kinds of civil employment which a person with skills, qualifications and experience referred to in paragraph (a) might reasonably undertake;

                     (c)  the degree to which any physical or mental impairment of the pensioner, being a prescribed physical or mental impairment, has or had diminished the capacity of the pensioner to undertake the kinds of civil employment referred to in paragraph (b);

                     (d)  such other matters (if any) as are prescribed for the purposes of this subsection.

          (1B)  In subsection (1A), **_prescribed physical or mental impairment_**, in relation to a pensioner or a deceased pensioner, means:

                     (a)  a physical or mental impairment of the pensioner that was the cause, or one of the causes, of the invalidity or physical or mental incapacity by reason of which the pensioner was retired, whether or not that impairment changed, for better or worse, since that retirement; or

                     (b)  any other physical or mental impairment of the pensioner causally connected with a physical or mental impairment referred to in paragraph (a).

             (2)  Where a person is reclassified under this section, the Authority shall specify the date from which the reclassification has effect and, on and after that date, the person shall, for the purposes of section 52, be deemed to be classified accordingly.

          (2A)  Where a deceased person is reclassified under this section:

                     (a)  the Authority must specify the day from which the reclassification has effect; and

                     (b)  the person is taken, for the purposes of section 52, to have been classified accordingly on and after that day.

             (3)  If, upon reclassification as Class C, a person would, but for this subsection, be entitled in accordance with section 52 to invalidity benefit consisting of a refund of contributions and a gratuity, he is entitled to that benefit only to the extent that it exceeds the sum of the payments of pension received by him as invalidity benefit.

             (4)  In this section, **_pensioner_** includes a person who is classified as Class C by reason of his having been reclassified (whether before or after the commencement of this subsection) under subsection (1) of this section, whether or not the person is entitled to a pension.

##### <a id="53B"></a>53B  Power to require invalid pensioners to be medically examined and to furnish information as to employment

             (1)  The Authority may, by notice in writing to a person to whom a pension, being invalidity benefit, is being paid, require that person:

                     (a)  to submit himself for medical examination by a legally qualified medical practitioner at a time and place specified in the notice; or

                     (b)  to furnish in writing to the Authority, within such period as is specified in the notice, such information as is required by the notice with respect to any employment (whether as an employee or on his own account) in which the person has been engaged during such period as is specified in the notice.

             (2)  A notice under subsection (1) shall set out the effect of subsection (3).

             (3)  Where a person fails to comply with a notice given under subsection (1) and the Authority is not satisfied that there was a reasonable excuse for the failure, the Authority may, by notice in writing given to the person, suspend the person’s pension with effect from such day as the Authority determines, being a day not earlier than:

                     (a)  in a case where the first-mentioned notice required the person to submit to a medical examination on a day specified in the notice—the day next following that day; or

                     (b)  in a case where the first-mentioned notice required the person to furnish information within a period specified in the notice—the day next following the end of that period.

             (4)  A notice to a person under subsection (3) shall set out the effect of subsections (5B), (5D) and (5E).

             (5)  Pension is not payable in respect of a period during which a suspension under subsection (3) is in force.

          (5A)  Where:

                     (a)  the pension of a person is suspended under subsection (3); and

                     (b)  the Authority, having regard to such matters as it considers relevant, is of the opinion that the suspension should be revoked;

the Authority may, by notice in writing given to the person or to the person and a person acting on the person’s behalf, as the case may be, revoke the suspension with effect from such day as the Authority determines, being a day not later that the day on which the notice is given.

          (5B)  Without limiting subsection (5A), where the pension of a person (in this subsection called the **_relevant person_**) is suspended under subsection (3), the relevant person, or another person acting on the relevant person’s behalf, may, by notice in writing given to the Authority, request the Authority to revoke the suspension, and where such a request is made, the Authority shall, by notice in writing given to the relevant person or to the relevant person and the other person, as the case may be:

                     (a)  if the pension has been suspended by virtue of the relevant person’s having failed to comply with a notice requiring the relevant person to submit to a medical examination—require the relevant person to submit to a medical examination by a medical practitioner at a time and place specified in the second-mentioned notice; or

                     (b)  if the pension has been suspended by virtue of the relevant person’s having failed to comply with a notice requiring the relevant person to give information to the Authority (in this paragraph called **_the original notice_**)—require the relevant person to give in writing to the Authority, within such period as is specified in the second-mentioned notice, such information as was required by the original notice to be given.

          (5C)  A notice given by the Authority under subsection (5B) shall set out the effects of subsections (5D) and (5E).

          (5D)  Where:

                     (a)  because of a request having been made to revoke the suspension of the pension of a person (in this subsection called the **_relevant person_**), a notice under subsection (5B) is given to the relevant person or to the relevant person and another person; and

             (4)  Where a person is reclassified under subsection (3), the Authority shall specify the date from which the reclassification has effect, and, on and after that date, the person shall, for the purposes of subsection (2), be deemed to be classified accordingly.

##### <a id="82E"></a>82E  Application of Part

             (1)  This Part applies to a person who, being in receipt of or entitled to a pension under this Act that became payable by reason of his having been a member other than a pension being a deferred benefit applicable under Division 3 of Part VIC, has become liable under section 23 to make contributions to the Fund upon again becoming, or after having again become, a member and has not again ceased to be a member.

             (2)  In determining, for the purposes of subsection (1), whether a person who again becomes a member is required by section 23 to contribute to the Fund, any reference in subsection 23(3) or (4) to engagement, re-engagement, appointment or re-appointment shall be read as not including a reference to an engagement, re-engagement, appointment or re-appointment of the person before he again became a member.

             (3)  For the purposes of this section, a person shall not be deemed to have ceased to be entitled to a pension by reason only that the pension has been suspended under this Act.

             (1)  The application of Part IV to and in relation to a person to whom this Part applies is subject to this section.

             (3)  For the purpose of determining the amount of contribution payable by a person to whom this Part applies, the age at which he became a person to whom this Part applies shall be deemed to be the age at which he became a contributor prior to becoming entitled to a pension.

             (4)  Where the new category number of a person to whom this Part applies is a lower number than his previous category number, he may, by notice in writing given to the Board within 4 months after he became a person to whom this Part applies, elect to be treated as if his new category number were the same as his previous category number, and, if he so elects, his category number shall, upon his becoming a person to whom this Part applies and until the category number applicable to him under section 4A is a number higher than his previous category number, be deemed, for the purposes of this Act, to be a number the same as his previous category number.

             (5)  In subsection (4):

                    <a name="new-categori-number"></a>**_new category number_**, in relation to a person to whom this Part applies, means the category number of the person at the time when he became a person to whom this Part applies.

                    <a name="previou-categori-number"></a>**_previous category number_**, in relation to a person to whom this Part applies, means the category number of the person immediately before he became a pensioner or, if that category number would, if this Act, and the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Regulations, as in force at the time when he became a person to whom this Part applies, had been in force immediately before he became a pensioner, have been a different number, that different number.

             (6)  The reference in the definition of **_previous category number_** in subsection (5) to the category number of a person immediately before he became a pensioner shall, in the case of a person who became a pensioner before 14 December 1959, be read as a reference to the number of units for which the person was last contributing to the Fund before he became a pensioner.

             (7)  Nothing in Part III of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1959-1966_, Part IV of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1962-1963_ or Part IV of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1963-1965_ shall be construed as affecting the amount of contributions payable by a person to whom this Part applies.

### Division 2—Contributors who have preserved rights from previous employment

##### <a id="82L"></a>82L  Transfer value payable in respect of previous employment

             (1)  In this Division:

                     (a)  a reference, in relation to a member, to a transfer value payable to or in respect of the member under a superannuation scheme applicable in relation to any employment in which he was employed at any time before the date on which he became a member is a reference:

                              (i)  in the case of the superannuation scheme constituted by the provisions of this Act and the other Acts relating to retirement benefits for members of the Defence Force—to a transfer value payable in respect of the member under Division 3 of this Part or to a refund of contributions and a gratuity payable to the member; and

                             (ii)  in the case of any other superannuation scheme—to a benefit by way of a lump sum payable to or in respect of the member under that scheme upon the termination of the employment otherwise than on the ground of invalidity or of physical or mental incapacity to perform the duties of the employment, being a benefit that was based wholly upon contributions under that scheme by the employer or was based partly upon such contributions and partly upon contributions under the scheme by the member; and

                     (b)  a reference to the amount of a transfer value to which subparagraph (a)(ii) applies does not include a reference to any part of the lump sum that was based upon contributions by the member that were of a similar nature to contributions under the _Superannuation Act 1922-1971_ for reserve units of pension.

             (2)  If, after a transfer value became payable to or in respect of a person under a superannuation scheme, an amount equal to the whole or any part of that transfer value was paid to a person administering another superannuation scheme (not being the superannuation scheme constituted by the provisions of this Act and of the other Acts relating to retirement benefits for members of the Defence Force):

                     (a)  where the whole of the transfer value was so paid—that transfer value shall be disregarded for the purposes of this Division; or

             (3)  Subject to subsection (4), a transfer value shall be deemed, for the purposes of this Division, to have become payable in respect of a person under a superannuation scheme upon the termination of any employment if, upon the termination of that employment, the person was the owner of a life policy, or was entitled to have the rights of the owner of a life policy assigned to him or her, being a policy the premiums for which were, while the person was employed in that employment, paid in whole or in part by the person’s employer, and, in that case, the surrender value of the policy as at the date of the termination of the employment shall be taken to be the amount of the transfer value.

             (4)  Where a transfer value is, by virtue of subsection (3), to be deemed, for the purposes of this Division, to have become payable in respect of a person upon the termination of any employment by reason that, upon the termination of that employment, the person was the owner of a life policy, or was entitled to have the rights of the owner of a life policy assigned to him or her, a transfer value shall not be deemed, for those purposes, to have become payable in respect of the person upon the termination of any previous employment by reason that, upon the termination of that previous employment, the person was the owner of that policy, or was entitled to have the rights of the owner of that policy assigned to him or her.

                     (b)  where a pension referred to in paragraph (a) was commuted, in whole or in part, for a lump sum after the pension became payable and before the date on which the person to whom the pension was payable became a member, the pension shall, for the purposes of this Division, be treated as not having been so commuted.

                     (b)  in the case of any other superannuation scheme—to benefits, whether by way of a lump sum or of a pension, applicable in respect of the member under the scheme but not immediately payable, being benefits based wholly upon contributions under the scheme by the employer or based partly upon such contributions and partly upon contributions under the scheme by the member.

                     (a)  in the case of a person other than a person in relation to whom paragraph (b) applies—the period of 3 months immediately after he ceased to be a member; or

                     (b)  in the case of a person who ceased to be a member by reason of his having been transferred to a Reserve or discharged from the Defence Force, or having had his continuous full-time service terminated, under the _Defence (Parliamentary Candidates) Act 1969_ for the purpose of enabling him to become a candidate for election as a member of a House of the Parliament of the Commonwealth or of a State and was a candidate at the election:

                              (i)  if he is elected—the period commencing immediately after he ceased to be a member and ending on the date on which he becomes a member of that House; or

                             (ii)  if he is not elected—the period of 3 months immediately after the date that is the declared date in relation to the election under the _Defence (Parliamentary Candidates) Act 1969_.

                     (a)  a period in respect of which a pension, being invalidity benefit, was payable to a person under this Act and immediately before the commencement of which he was a contributor shall be treated as if it had been a period during which he was a contributor;

                     (b)  a period in respect of which a pension, being invalidity benefit, was payable to a person under this Act and immediately before the commencement of which he was employed in public employment shall be treated as if it had been a period in which he was employed in public employment; and

             (3)  Where a pension, being invalidity benefit, was not payable to a person under this Act during any period by reason only of section 53A or 53B, that period shall be treated for the purposes of this Division as if it had been a period during which that pension was payable, but:

                     (a)  if the person was, immediately before the pension became payable, a contributor—shall not, in the calculation of the period during which he was employed in eligible employment, be treated as if it had been a period during which he was a contributor; or

##### <a id="83"></a>83  Interpretation

             (1)  In this Part, unless the contrary intention appears:

                    <a name="first-quarter"></a>**_first quarter_**, in relation to a half-year, means:

                     (a)  for a half-year beginning on 1 January in a year—the March quarter of the year; and

                     (b)  for a half-year beginning on 1 July in a year—the September quarter of the year.

                    <a name="half-year"></a>**_half-year_** means a period of 6 months beginning on 1 January or 1 July in any year.

                    <a name="pension"></a>**_pension_** means a pension payable under or in accordance with this Act, Part III of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1959_, Part IV of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1962_, Part IV of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1963_ or the _Defence Forces Special Retirement Benefits Act 1960_, but does not include associate pension under Part VIA of this Act.

                    <a name="statistician"></a>**_Statistician_** means the Australian Statistician.

             (2)  Subject to subsection (3), if at any time, whether before or after the commencement of this Part, the Statistician has published or publishes in respect of a particular first quarter in a half-year an all groups consumer price index number for the weighted average of the 8 capital cities in substitution for an index number previously published by him in respect of that quarter, the publication of the later index number shall be disregarded for the purposes of this Part.

             (3)  If at any time, whether before or after the commencement of this Part, the Statistician has changed or changes the reference base for the Consumer Price Index, then, for the purposes of the application of this Part after the change took place or takes place, regard shall be had only to index numbers published in terms of the new reference base.

             (4)  Where the prescribed percentage for the purposes of section 84 is or includes a fraction of one-tenth of 1%:

                     (a)  if that fraction is less than one-half of one-tenth—that fraction shall be disregarded; and

                     (b)  if that fraction is not less than one-half of one-tenth—that fraction shall be treated as one-tenth.

##### <a id="84"></a>84  Increase in certain pensions

             (1)  Subject to this Part, if the all groups consumer price index number for the weighted average of the 8 capital cities published by the Statistician in respect of the first quarter of the half-year immediately preceding a prescribed half-year exceeds the highest all groups consumer price index number for the weighted average of the 8 capital cities published by the Statistician in respect of the first quarter of any earlier half-year, not being a half-year earlier than the half-year that commenced on 1 July 1985, a person who was in receipt of a pension immediately before the commencement of that prescribed half-year is entitled, at the commencement of that prescribed half-year, to an increase, as ascertained in accordance with this section, in the rate at which the pension was payable to him immediately before the commencement of that prescribed half-year.

             (2)  The increase provided for by subsection (1) in the rate at which a pension was payable to a person immediately before the commencement of a prescribed half-year is the prescribed percentage, ascertained in accordance with subsection (3), of that rate.

             (3)  For the purposes of this section, the prescribed percentage, in relation to a prescribed half-year, is the percentage that represents A-B expressed as a percentage of B, where:

                       A  is the all groups consumer price index number for the weighted average of the 8 capital cities published by the Statistician in respect of the first quarter of the half-year immediately preceding the prescribed half-year; and

                       B  is the highest all groups consumer price index number for the weighted average of the 8 capital cities published by the Statistician in respect of the first quarter of any half-year earlier than the half-year immediately preceding the prescribed half-year but not being earlier than the half-year that commenced on 1 July 1985.

             (4)  Where, by reason of the death on 30 June or 31 December (as the case requires) immediately preceding the commencement of a prescribed half-year of a person in receipt of pension that became payable to him upon his retirement, including pension that became payable by reason of the invalidity of the person or of his physical or mental incapacity to perform his duties, a pension becomes payable, on the following day, to another person, that other person shall be entitled, at the commencement of that prescribed half-year, to such an increase in the rate of that pension as he would have been entitled to had the pension become payable to him on that 30 June or 31 December (as the case requires).

##### <a id="84A"></a>84A  Application of increase to suspended pensions

                   Where a pension would, but for its suspension under section 53B, be payable to a person immediately before the commencement of a prescribed half-year, that pension shall, for the purposes of this Part, be deemed to have been payable to that person immediately before the commencement of that prescribed half-year but any increase in the rate of that pension by virtue of this Part does not take effect in respect of any part of that period of suspension.

##### <a id="84B"></a>84B  Adjustment of increases in case of certain pensions

             (1)  Where a person in receipt of a pension payable in accordance with section 82ZB would, but for this section, be entitled to an increase in the rate at which the pension was payable to the person immediately before the commencement of the prescribed half-year and:

                     (a)  if the pension became payable to the person otherwise than as a widow—the pension became payable to the person during the half-year (in this section referred to as the **_preceding half-year_**) immediately preceding that prescribed half-year;

                     (b)  if the pension became payable to the person as the widow of another person and pension in accordance with that section was not payable to that other person immediately before his death—the pension became payable to the widow during the preceding half-year; or

                     (c)  if the pension became payable to the person as the widow of another person and pension in accordance with that section was payable to that other person immediately before his death—pension became payable to that other person during that preceding half-year;

the following provisions of this section have effect in relation to the first-mentioned pension.

             (2)  If the pension that became payable by virtue of section 82ZB to the person, or, in a case where paragraph (1)(c) applies, to another person in relation to whom the person is a widow, became so payable after 16 June or 16 December (as the case requires) in the preceding half-year, the person is not entitled to an increase.

             (3)  If the pension that became payable by virtue of section 82ZB to the person, or, in a case where paragraph (1)(c) applies, to another person in relation to whom a person is a widow, became so payable on or before 16 June or 16 December (as the case requires) in the preceding half-year, the amount of the increase is so much only of the amount that, but for this section, would have been the amount of the increase as bears to the last-mentioned amount the same proportion as the number of months in the period that commenced on the day on which the pension became payable, and ended on 30 June or 31 December (as the case requires) in the preceding half-year bears to 6.

             (4)  If the period referred to in subsection (3) is less than 1 month, that period shall be treated as 1 month.

             (5)  If the period referred to in subsection (3) consists of a number of whole months and a part of a month:

                     (a)  where the number of days in that part of that month is less than one-half of the number of days in that month—that part shall be disregarded; and

                     (b)  where the number of days in that part of that month is not less than one-half of the number of days in that month—that part shall be treated as a whole month.

##### <a id="84C"></a>84C  Increases in children’s pensions

             (1)  Section 84 does not apply to a pension payable to or in respect of an eligible child, but, for the purposes of paragraph 55(1)(b), subsection 55(2), paragraph 57(1)(b), subsection 57(4) and subsection 58(1), regard shall be had to any increase in the rate of a pension payable under paragraph 55(1)(a), under paragraph 57(1)(a) or under subsection 57(3) to which, by virtue of this Act, a widow is, or, but for her death or divorce, would be, entitled.

             (2)  If the all groups consumer price index number for the weighted average of the 8 capital cities published by the Statistician in respect of the first quarter of the half-year immediately preceding a prescribed half-year exceeds the highest all groups consumer price index number for the weighted average of the 8 capital cities published by the Statistician in respect of the first quarter of any earlier half-year, not being a half-year earlier than the half-year that commenced on 1 July 1985:

                     (a)  paragraphs 55(1)(b) and 57(1)(b) have effect as if, for the amount of $312, there were substituted; and

                     (b)  subsections 55(2), 57(4) and 58(1) have effect as if, for the amount of $5,000, there were substituted;

on the first day of that prescribed half-year, an amount calculated by adding to the existing amount the prescribed percentage of the existing amount.

             (3)  For the purposes of the application of subsection (2) to a provision specified in that subsection, the existing amount is:

                     (a)  in relation to the prescribed half-year that commenced on 1 January 2002—the amount that was the existing amount in relation to that provision, as calculated under this section immediately before the commencement of Schedule 2 to the _Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Family Law and Other Matters) Act 2004_; and

                     (b)  in relation to any subsequent prescribed half-year—the amount that, because of a previous application or previous applications of subsection (2), is taken to have been substituted, or last substituted, for the amount specified in that provision.

##### <a id="84D"></a>84D  Date of payment of increases

                   Subject to sections 84E and 84F, an increase payable by virtue of this Part in the rate of a pension that was, or is, under subsection 84(4), to be treated as having been, payable to a person on 30 June or 31 December (as the case requires) in a half-year applies in relation to the instalment of pension falling due on the first pension pay-day occurring after that day and in relation to all subsequent instalments.

##### <a id="84E"></a>84E  Rate of invalidity pension payable on reclassification during a prescribed half-year

             (1)  Where:

                     (a)  a person to whom pension is payable under section 52 is reclassified under section 53 during a prescribed half-year;

                     (b)  the person became entitled at the commencement of that half-year to an increase under this Part in the rate at which the pension was payable to him immediately before the commencement of that half-year;

the rate at which the pension is payable to him on and after the date from which the reclassification has effect is the rate at which the pension would have been payable to him at the commencement of that half-year if his classification, on and after the date on which he became entitled to the pension, had been in accordance with the reclassification.

             (3)  Where:

                     (a)  at the commencement of a prescribed half-year a person entitled to invalidity benefit was classifed as Class C under subsection 51(2) but was not entitled to pension under section 52; and

                     (b)  during the prescribed half-year the person is reclassified as Class A or Class B;

the rate at which a pension is payable to the person on or after the day from which the reclassification has effect is the rate at which the pension would be payable to the person on that day if, at all times during the period during which the person was classified as Class C, the person had been classified as Class A or Class B (as the case may be).

##### <a id="84F"></a>84F  Commutation of pension benefits during a prescribed half-year

             (1)  Section 74 does not authorize the commutation of a pension in so far as the pension has been increased by virtue of this Part.

             (2)  Where:

                     (a)  a portion of the pension of a person is commuted during a prescribed half-year; and

                     (b)  the person became entitled at the commencement of that half-year to an increase under this Part in the rate at which pension was payable to him immediately before the commencement of that half-year;

the rate at which the pension is payable to him on and after the date on which that portion of the pension is so commuted is the rate at which the pension would have been payable to him at the commencement of that half-year if he had so commuted that portion of his pension on the date on which he became entitled to the pension.

## Part VII—Miscellaneous

##### <a id="85"></a>85  Assignment of pensions

                   Subject to section 85A, pensions and other benefits under this Act are not capable of being assigned or charged or of passing by operation of law, and any moneys payable out of the Fund, or by the Commonwealth, on the death of a member are not liable to be applied or made available in payment of his debts or liabilities.

##### <a id="85A"></a>85A  Attachment of pensions

             (1)  Where a judgment given by a court for the payment of a sum of money has not been fully satisfied by the judgment debtor and the judgment debtor is entitled to a pension or other benefit under this Act, the judgment creditor may serve on the Authority a copy of the judgment, certified under the hand of the Registrar or other proper officer of the court by which the judgment was given, and a statutory declaration by the judgment creditor stating that the judgment has not been fully satisfied by the judgment debtor and specifying the amount due by the judgment debtor under the judgment.

             (2)  Where a copy of a judgment and a statutory declaration are served on the Authority in accordance with subsection (1), the Authority shall, as soon as practicable, by notice in writing given to the judgment debtor, inform him of the service of those documents and require him, within such period as is specified in the notice and in such manner as is so specified, to notify the Authority whether the amount specified in the declaration is still due under the judgment and, if no amount or a lesser amount is due under the judgment, to furnish to the Authority, in such manner as is specified in the notice, evidence in support of that fact.

             (3)  A person is guilty of an offence if:

                     (a)  the person is given a notice under subsection (2); and

                     (b)  the person does not comply with the requirements in the notice.

                    Maximum penalty:    $40.

             (4)  If, at the expiration of the period specified in the notice, the Authority is satisfied that an amount is due under the judgment, the Authority may, in its discretion, deduct from the pension or benefit, and pay to the judgment creditor, such sums as do not exceed that amount or, in a case where a payment of pension or benefit becomes payable on or after 1 October 1972, the Authority may, in its discretion, authorize the deduction from the pension or benefit, and the payment to the judgment creditor, of such sums as do not exceed that amount, and those deductions, and those payments, shall be made accordingly.

             (5)  A deduction shall not be made from:

                     (a)  an instalment of pension payable in respect of a child; or

                     (b)  an instalment of any other pension if the deduction will reduce the amount of the instalment payable to less than one-half of the amount that would, but for this section, be payable.

             (6)  If, after a copy of a judgment given against a pensioner or beneficiary, being a judgment in respect of which the Authority is satisfied that an amount is due, has been served in accordance with subsection (1), a copy of another judgment given (whether before or after the first-mentioned judgment) against the same pensioner or beneficiary in favour of the person in whose favour the first-mentioned judgment was given or in favour of another person is served in accordance with that subsection, a payment shall not be made in pursuance of this section to the judgment creditor under the other judgment in respect of the amount due under that judgment until the amount due under the first-mentioned judgment has been paid.

             (7)  A payment made to a judgment creditor in pursuance of this section shall, as between the Board and the pensioner or beneficiary, be deemed to be a payment from the Fund to the pensioner or beneficiary and, in the case of a payment made to the judgment creditor in relation to a payment of pension or benefit that became payable on or after 1 October 1972, shall, as between the Commonwealth and the pensioner or beneficiary, be deemed to be a payment by the Commonwealth to the pensioner or beneficiary.

             (8)  A judgment creditor is guilty of an offence if:

                     (a)  the judgment creditor serves a copy of a judgment on the Authority under subsection (1); and

                     (b)  the judgment creditor does not notify the Authority immediately the judgment debt is satisfied.

                    Maximum penalty:    

                     (c)  if the offender is a natural person—$100 or imprisonment for 3 months; or

                     (d)  if the offender is a body corporate—$500.

             (9)  If the amounts paid in pursuance of this section to a judgment creditor in respect of a judgment exceed, in the aggregate, the amount due under the judgment, the excess is repayable by the judgment creditor to the judgment debtor and, in default of payment, may be recovered by the judgment debtor from the judgment creditor in any court of competent jurisdiction.

##### <a id="86"></a>86  Recovery of contributions

                   The Authority may recover contributions under the Act in any court of competent jurisdiction.

                     (a)  a person makes an election (whether before or after the commencement of this subsection) under section 74, 82R or 82Z;

                     (b)  that person makes an application to the Authority not later than 3 months after the day on which the election is made, or within such further period as the Authority, in special circumstances, allows, requesting that the Authority cancel the election; and

                     (c)  the Authority, having regard to such matters (if any) as it considers relevant, is satisfied that the election should be cancelled;

the Authority may direct that the election shall be cancelled and, if it so directs, this Act has effect as if the election had not been made.

##### <a id="87"></a>87  Extension or modification of the Act by regulations

                   The regulations may make provision for or in relation to:

                     (a)  the modification of the application of this Act in relation to members in the conditions of whose service there is a change; and

                     (b)  the application, with or without modification, of this Act in relation to members of the Defence Force of the Commonwealth in relation to whom this Act does not otherwise apply;

and provisions so made shall have effect notwithstanding anything contained in this Act.

##### <a id="88"></a>88  Regulations

             (1)  The Governor-General may make regulations, not inconsistent with this Act, prescribing all matters which by this Act are required or permitted to be prescribed, or which are necessary or convenient to be prescribed for carrying out or giving effect to this Act, and in particular:

                     (a)  for prescribing the time within which an election under this Act may be made;

                     (b)  for prescribing the manner in which the accounts of the Fund shall be kept; and

_Example: Assume that, immediately before the commencement of this item, regulations imposed training obligations on members of the Air Force Specialist Reserve. Those obligations would continue to apply to former members of that Reserve after commencement, even though the Air Force Specialist Reserve itself is no longer mentioned in the Air Force Act 1923 and the members have now become members of the Air Force Reserve._

(2)        However, regulations that continue in effect under this item do so only to the extent that they are not amended or revoked by later regulations.

(1)        The regulations may make provision in relation to other saving and transitional matters in connection with the amendments made by this Schedule.

(2)        In particular, such regulations may deal with the status, after the commencement of the amendments, of persons who were members of the Defence Force immediately before that time.

## 95  Saving—regulations

Regulations that were in effect for the purposes of subsection 69(7) of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948_ immediately before the commencement of this item continue to have effect after that time as if they had been made for the purposes of subsection 69(7) of that Act, as in force after that time.

                     (a)  a person would have been entitled to one or more payments (the **_lost payments_**) under an Act that is amended by Schedule 1, 2, 3 or 5 to this Act if the relevant Schedule had commenced on 1 July 2008; and

                     (c)  the person makes an application to the Finance Minister for one or more payments (the **_replacement payments_**) to compensate the person for the lost payments;

the Finance Minister must make a determination, in accordance with subsection (4), to fully compensate the person.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  a person would have been entitled to one or more payments (the **_lost payments_**) under the _Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991_ if the first amendment of the Trust Deed under that Act that is made after the commencement of this section had commenced on 1 July 2008; and

                     (b)  because that amendment did not commence until after 1 July 2008, the person is not entitled to the payment or payments; and

                     (c)  the person makes an application to the Finance Minister for one or more payments (the **_replacement payments_**) to compensate the person for the lost payments;

                             (ii)  the method of determining the amount and timing of the replacement payments.

             (5)  An application must be in writing in the form approved by the Finance Minister.

             (6)  To avoid doubt, a determination of the Finance Minister that a person is entitled to one or more replacement payments does not affect the entitlements of any other person under an Act amended by Schedule 1, 2, 3 or 5 to this Act, the _Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991_ or the _Superannuation Act 1990_.

             (7)  Replacement payments are to be made out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which is appropriated accordingly.
