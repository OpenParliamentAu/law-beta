                     (b)  the liabilities of DRDC.

             (2)  At the conversion time, the assets and liabilities cease to be assets and liabilities of DRDC and become assets and liabilities of Dairy Australia Limited without any conveyance, transfer or assignment.

             (3)  Immediately after the conversion time, Dairy Australia Limited becomes DRDC’s successor in law in relation to the assets and liabilities.

Note:          The effect of converting ADC into a Corporations Act company is not to create a new legal entity. The assets and liabilities of ADC immediately before the conversion time will remain assets and liabilities of Dairy Australia Limited immediately after that time.

##### <a id="16"></a>16  Transfer of pending proceedings

                   If any proceedings to which DRDC was a party:

                     (b)  related, in whole or in part, to an asset or liability of DRDC;

Dairy Australia Limited is, by force of this section, substituted for DRDC as a party to the proceedings to the extent to which the proceedings relate to the asset or liability.

                     (b)  that a specified thing was done in connection with a specified exempt matter.

             (3)  In all courts, and for all purposes, a certificate under subsection (2) is evidence of the matter stated in the certificate.

             (4)  In this section:

                    <a name="exempt-matter"></a>**_exempt matter_** means:

                     (a)  the transfer of an asset or a liability under section 15; or

                     (b)  the operation of this Division in any other respect.

##### <a id="18"></a>18  References in certain instruments

             (1)  This section applies to an instrument if:

                     (a)  it is in operation immediately before the conversion time; and

                     (b)  it is an instrument:

                              (i)  to which DRDC is a party; or

                             (ii)  which was given to, or in favour of, DRDC; or

                            (iii)  in which a reference is made to DRDC; or

                            (iv)  under which any right or liability accrues or may accrue to DRDC.

             (2)  The instrument continues to have effect after the conversion time as if a reference in the instrument to DRDC were a reference to Dairy Australia Limited.

             (3)  In this section:

                    <a name="instrum"></a>**_instrument_** does not include regulations or any other instrument made under the _Superannuation Act 1976_ or the _Superannuation Act 1990_.

##### <a id="19"></a>19  Certificates in relation to assets

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  an asset vests in Dairy Australia Limited under this Division; and

                     (b)  there is lodged with an assets official a certificate that:

                              (i)  is signed by the Minister; and

                             (ii)  identifies the asset; and

                            (iii)  states that the asset has become vested in Dairy Australia Limited under this Division.

             (2)  The assets official may:

                     (a)  deal with, and give effect to, the certificate as if it were a proper and appropriate instrument for transactions in relation to assets of that kind; and

                     (b)  make such entries in the register as are necessary having regard to the effect of this Division.

             (3)  In this section:

                    <a name="asset-offici"></a>**_assets official_** means the person or authority who, under a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, under a trust instrument or otherwise, has responsibility for keeping a register in relation to assets of the kind concerned.

### Division 4—Transferring employees of dairy corporations

                   At the conversion time, each employee of DRDC ceases to be employed by DRDC and is taken to have been engaged as an employee of Dairy Australia Limited.

Note:          The effect of converting ADC into a Corporations Act company is not to create a new legal entity. The employees of ADC immediately before the conversion time will remain employees of Dairy Australia Limited immediately after that time.

##### <a id="21"></a>21  Terms and conditions of transferring employees

DRDC employees

##### <a id="22"></a>22  Variation of terms and conditions of employment

             (1)  This Part does not prevent the terms and conditions of a transferring ADC employee’s employment, or a transferring DRDC employee’s employment, after the conversion time from being varied:

                     (a)  in accordance with those terms and conditions; or

                     (b)  by or under a law, award, determination or agreement.

(2)In this section:

                    <a name="vari"></a>**_vary_**, in relation to terms and conditions, includes:

                     (b)  adding to those terms and conditions; or

                     (c)  substituting new terms or conditions for any of those terms and conditions.

#### Subdivision B—Application of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act
