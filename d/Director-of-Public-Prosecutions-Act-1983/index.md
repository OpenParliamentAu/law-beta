          (2A)  The Director may, with the consent of the person concerned, institute a prosecution of a person on indictment for an indictable offence against the laws of the Commonwealth in respect of which the person has not been examined or committed for trial.

          (2B)  Where a person has been committed for trial in respect of an indictable offence or indictable offences against the laws of the Commonwealth, the Director may, whether or not the Director institutes a prosecution on indictment for the offence, or for all or any of the offences, for which the person was committed for trial, institute a prosecution of the person on indictment for:

                     (a)  an offence for which the person was examined but not committed for trial; or

                     (b)  any other offence founded on facts or evidence disclosed in the course of committal proceedings;

without:

                     (c)  where paragraph (a) applies—the person having been committed for trial in respect of the offence; or

          (2C)  Where:

                     (a)  a person has been committed for trial otherwise than in respect of an offence against the laws of the Commonwealth; and

                     (b)  the Director is satisfied:

                              (i)  that the facts or evidence on the basis of which the person was committed for trial disclose the commission of an indictable offence or indictable offences against the laws of the Commonwealth; and

                             (ii)  that, had the person’s committal for trial for the indictable offence or indictable offences been sought on the basis of those facts or that evidence, the person could have been committed for trial for the indictable offence or indictable offences;

the Director may institute a prosecution on indictment of the person for the indictable offence or indictable offences or any of the indictable offences without the person having been examined or committed for trial.

          (2D)  Subject to subsection (2E), in any other case where the Director considers it appropriate to do so, the Director may institute a prosecution of a person on indictment for an indictable offence against the laws of the Commonwealth in respect of which the person has not been examined or committed for trial.

          (2E)  Notwithstanding anything contained in subsection (2D), the Director may not institute a prosecution of a person on indictment for an offence against the _War Crimes Act 1945_ unless the person has first been examined or committed for trial.

           (2F)  If a person is committed for trial before a court (the **_initial court_**) for one or more indictable offences against the laws of the Commonwealth, the Director may institute in another court (the **_later court_**) a prosecution of the person on indictment for any or all of the offences.

          (2G)  Subsection (2F) applies even if the Director has instituted a prosecution (the **_initial prosecution_**) before the initial court for any or all of the offences. However, the Director must discontinue the initial prosecution in respect of each offence covered by the prosecution in the later court.

             (3)  The Attorney‑General may, by writing signed by the Attorney‑General, specify a matter or class of matters for the purposes of paragraph (1)(g) or (h) and, where the Attorney‑General so specifies a matter or class of matters, a copy of the instrument specifying that matter or class of matters shall be published in the _Gazette_ when the Attorney‑General considers it appropriate to do so.

             (4)  A person who has, pursuant to a law of the Commonwealth, the power to consent to prosecutions for offences of a particular kind against the laws of the Commonwealth (not being a person who has that power by virtue of an authorization granted to the person by another person) may, by instrument in writing published in the _Gazette_, authorize the Director to consent to prosecutions for offences of that kind, but the giving of such an authorization does not prevent the giving of a consent by a person who, but for this subsection, would have the power to give a consent.

             (5)  Where the Director consents to a prosecution for an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, being an offence of a kind in relation to which an instrument under subsection (4) is in force, the prosecution may be instituted and carried on without the consent of any other person.

             (6)  The institution or carrying on by the Director of proceedings for the recovery of a pecuniary penalty under a law of the Commonwealth, or any other act or thing done by the Director in relation to such proceedings, shall not be challenged or called in question in any court on the ground that the proceedings did not or do not relate to a matter in relation to which paragraph (1)(g) applies.

             (7)  The taking by the Director of a civil remedy, or any other act or thing done by the Director in relation to the taking of a civil remedy, shall not be challenged or called in question in any court on any of the following grounds:

                     (a)  that the taking of the civil remedy did not or does not relate to a relevant matter;

                     (b)  that the civil remedy was not or is not being taken for, or in connection with, recovery, or securing the payment, of an amount of tax;

                     (c)  that the taking of the civil remedy did not or does not relate to a matter in relation to which an instrument under subsection (3) was or is in force.

             (8)  In this section:

                    <a name="amount"></a>**_amount of_** means an amount payable under, or by virtue of, a law of the Commonwealth that imposes, or deals with the imposition, assessment or collection of:

                     (a)  a tax (however described); or

                     (b)  without limiting the generality of paragraph (a), a duty, charge or levy.

                    <a name="relev-matter"></a>**_relevant matter_** means a matter connected with, or arising out of:

                     (c)  an alleged or suspected offence in respect of which the Director proposes to institute a prosecution;

                     (d)  in a case where a person other than the Director proposes to institute a prosecution in respect of an alleged or suspected offence and the Director proposes to take over or carry on the prosecution—that alleged or suspected offence;

                     (e)  in a case where:

                              (i)  a course of activity is alleged or suspected to have involved the commission of an offence, whether or not the nature of the offence has been identified; and

                             (ii)  the Director is considering that course of activity for the purpose of deciding whether to institute a prosecution;

                            that course of activity; or

                      (f)  in a case where:

                              (i)  a course of activity is alleged or suspected to have involved the commission of an offence, whether or not the nature of the offence has been identified;

                             (ii)  a person other than the Director is considering that course of activity for the purpose of deciding whether to institute a prosecution; and

                            (iii)  the Director proposes, if the person institutes a prosecution as a result of that consideration, to take over or carry on the prosecution;

                            that course of activity.

             (9)  Where, at the time when the Director first commences to take civil remedies in respect of a particular matter, or first commences to co‑ordinate or supervise the taking of civil remedies in respect of a particular matter, the matter is a relevant matter, the matter shall be deemed, for the purposes of this section, to continue to be a relevant matter while the Director continues to take civil remedies in respect of the matter, or to co‑ordinate or supervise the taking of civil remedies in respect of the matter, as the case may be.

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Consultation

             (1)  The Director shall, if requested to do so by the Attorney‑General, consult with the Attorney‑General with respect to matters concerning the performance of the Director’s functions or the exercise of the Director’s powers.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Directions and guidelines by Attorney‑General

             (1)  In the performance of the Director’s functions and in the exercise of the Director’s powers, the Director is subject to such directions or guidelines as the Attorney‑General, after consultation with the Director, gives or furnishes to the Director by instrument in writing.

                     (b)  cause a copy of that instrument to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after that time.

             (4)  Subject to subsection (5), the relevant time for the purposes of subsection (3), in relation to an instrument under subsection (1), is the time when the instrument is made.

             (5)  Where:

                            as the case may be.

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Powers of Director

             (1)  For the purposes of the performance of his or her functions, the Director may prosecute by indictment in his or her official name indictable offences against the laws of the Commonwealth, but nothing in this subsection prevents the Director from prosecuting an offence against a law of the Commonwealth in any other manner.

the Director may decline to proceed further in the prosecution and may, if the person is in custody, by warrant signed by the Director, direct the discharge of the person from custody, and where such a direction is given, the person shall be discharged accordingly.

             (5)  For the purposes of the performance of his or her functions, the Director may take over a proceeding that was instituted or is being carried on by another person, being a proceeding:
