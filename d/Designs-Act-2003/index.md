# Chapter 2—Design rights, ownership and registrable designs

## Part 1—Simplified outline of Chapter 2

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Simplified outline

                   The following is a simplified outline of this Chapter:

* * *

This Chapter sets out matters relating to design rights.

Part 2 specifies the exclusive rights of the registered owners of a registered design.

Part 3 specifies:

               (a)     who is entitled to be registered as the owner of an unregistered design; and

              (b)     who is the registered owner of a registered design.

Part 4 defines the key concepts of **_registrable design_**, **_newness_**, **_distinctiveness_** and **_substantial similarity_**. These concepts are important because:

               (a)     in examining a design under Chapter 5, the Registrar must decide whether it is new and distinctive when compared to the prior art base; and

              (b)     in deciding whether a person has infringed a registered design under Chapter 6, a court must consider whether the allegedly infringing design is substantially similar in overall impression to the registered design.

* * *

## Part 2—Design rights

##### <a id="10"></a>10  Exclusive rights of registered owners

             (1)  The registered owner of a registered design has the exclusive right, during the term of registration of the design:

                     (a)  to make or offer to make a product, in relation to which the design is registered, which embodies the design; and

                     (b)  to import such a product into Australia for sale, or for use for the purposes of any trade or business; and

                     (c)  to sell, hire or otherwise dispose of, or offer to sell, hire or otherwise dispose of, such a product; and

                     (d)  to use such a product in any way for the purposes of any trade or business; and

                     (e)  to keep such a product for the purpose of doing any of the things mentioned in paragraph (c) or (d); and

                      (f)  to authorise another person to do any of the things mentioned in paragraph (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e).

             (2)  The exclusive rights mentioned in subsection (1) are personal property and are capable of assignment and of devolution by will or by operation of law.

             (3)  This section is subject to this Act.

##### <a id="11"></a>11  Assignment of interest in a design

             (1)  The registered owner of a registered design may assign all or part of the registered owner’s interest  in the design by writing.

             (2)  An assignment under subsection (1) must be signed by, or on behalf of, the assignor and the assignee.

             (3)  An assignment under subsection (1) may be for a particular place.

Note:          Section 114 deals with amendments to the Register to record the assignment of an interest in a design.

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Power of registered owner to deal with registered design

             (1)  The registered owner of a registered design may, subject to any rights appearing in the Register to be vested in another person, deal with the registered owner’s interest in the design as absolute owner of it, and give good discharges for any consideration for such dealing.

             (2)  However, subsection (1) does not protect a person who deals with the registered owner of a registered design otherwise than as a purchaser in good faith for value and without notice of any fraud on the part of the registered owner.

          (2A)  Despite subsection (1), the recording in the Register of a right that is a PPSA security interest does not affect a dealing with an interest in a registered design.

             (3)  Equities in relation to a registered design may be enforced against the registered owner, except to the prejudice of a purchaser in good faith for value.

             (4)  Subsection (3) does not apply in relation to an equity that is a PPSA security interest.

Note:          The _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_ deals with the rights of purchasers of personal property (including intellectual property such as designs) that is subject to PPSA security interests. That Act also provides for the priority and enforcement of PPSA security interests. See the following provisions of that Act:

(a)    Part 2.5 (taking personal property free of security interests);

(b)    Part 2.6 (priority between security interests);

(c)    Chapter 4 (enforcement of security interests).

## Part 3—Ownership of designs

##### <a id="13"></a>13  Who is entitled to be registered as the registered owner of a design

             (1)  A person mentioned in any of the following paragraphs is entitled to be entered on the Register as the registered owner of a design that has not yet been registered:

                     (a)  the person who created the design (the **_designer_**);

                     (b)  if the designer created the design in the course of employment, or under a contract, with another person—the other person, unless the designer and the other person have agreed to the contrary;

                     (c)  a person who derives title to the design from a person mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b), or by devolution by will or by operation of law;

                     (d)  a person who would, on registration of the design, be entitled to have the exclusive rights in the design assigned to the person;

                     (e)  the legal personal representative of a deceased person mentioned in paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (d).

             (2)  Despite subsection (1), a person is not entitled to be entered on the Register as the registered owner of a design that has not yet been registered if:

                     (a)  the person has assigned all of the person’s rights in the design to another person; or

                     (b)  the person’s rights in the design have devolved on another person by operation of law.

             (3)  To avoid doubt:

                     (a)  more than one person may be entitled to be entered on the Register as the registered owner of a design; and

                     (b)  unless the contrary intention appears, a reference to the registered owner of a registered design in this Act is a reference to each of the registered owners of the design.

             (4)  No person other than a person mentioned in paragraph (1)(a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) is entitled to be entered on the Register as the registered owner of a design that has not yet been registered.

##### <a id="14"></a>14  Ownership of registered designs

             (1)  The registered owner of a registered design at a particular time is:

                     (a)  the person who, at that time, is entered in the Register as the registered owner of the design; or

                     (b)  if, at that time, there are 2 or more such persons—each of them.

             (2)  If there are 2 or more registered owners of a registered design:

                     (a)  each of them is entitled to an equal, undivided share in the exclusive rights in that design; and

                     (b)  subject to paragraph (c), each registered owner is entitled to exercise the exclusive rights in the design to the registered owner’s own benefit without accounting to the others; and

                     (c)  none of them can grant a licence to exercise the exclusive rights in the design, or assign an interest in the design, without the consent of the others.

             (3)  If a product that embodies a registered design is sold by any of 2 or more registered owners of the design, the buyer, and a person claiming through the buyer, may deal with the product as if it had been sold by all the registered owners.

             (4)  Subsection (2) is subject to any contrary agreement between the registered owners of a registered design.

## Part 4—Registrable designs: Validity

### Division 1—Registrable designs

##### <a id="15"></a>15  Registrable designs

             (1)  A design is a **_registrable design_** if the design is new and distinctive when compared with the prior art base for the design as it existed before the priority date of the design.

             (2)  The **_prior art base_** for a design (the **_designated design_**) consists of:

                     (a)  designs publicly used in Australia; and

                     (b)  designs published in a document within or outside Australia; and

                     (c)  designs in relation to which each of the following criteria is satisfied:

                              (i)  the design is disclosed in a design application;

                             (ii)  the design has an earlier priority date than the designated design;

                            (iii)  the first time documents disclosing the design are made available for public inspection under section 60 is on or after the priority date of the designated design.

Note:          For **_document_**, see section 2B of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

##### <a id="16"></a>16  Designs that are identical or substantially similar in overall impression

             (1)  A design is new unless it is identical to a design that forms part of the prior art base for the design.

             (2)  A design is distinctive unless it is substantially similar in overall impression to a design that forms part of the prior art base for the design (see section 19).

             (3)  Subject to paragraph 15(2)(c), the newness or distinctiveness of a design is not affected by the mere publication or public use of the design in Australia on or after the priority date of the design, or by the registration of another design with the same or a later priority date.

##### <a id="17"></a>17  Certain things to be disregarded in deciding whether a design is new and distinctive

             (1)  For the purpose of deciding whether a design is new and distinctive, the person making the decision must disregard:

                     (a)  any publication or use of the design, with the consent of the registered owner of the design, or the registered owner’s predecessor in title, in circumstances prescribed by the regulations; and

                     (b)  any publication or use of the design, without the consent of the registered owner of the design, by another person who derived or obtained the design from the registered owner of the design, or from the registered owner’s predecessor in title;

but only if a design application in respect of the design is made within the prescribed period.

             (2)  For the purpose of deciding whether a design is new and distinctive, the person making the decision must disregard:

                     (a)  any information given by, or with the consent of, the registered owner of the design, or the registered owner’s predecessor in title, to any of the following, but to no other person or organisation:

                              (i)  the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory;

                             (ii)  a person authorised by the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory to investigate the design; and

                     (b)  anything done for the purpose of an investigation mentioned in subparagraph (a)(ii).

##### <a id="18"></a>18  Certain designs not to be treated as other than new and distinctive

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  copyright under the _Copyright Act 1968_ subsists in an artistic work; and

                     (b)  an application is made by, or with the consent of, the owner of that copyright for registration of a corresponding design.

             (2)  The design is not to be treated, for the purposes of this Act, as being other than new and distinctive, or as having been published, by reason only of any use previously made of the artistic work, unless:

                     (a)  the previous use consisted of, or included, the sale, letting for hire or exposing for sale or hire of products to which the design had been applied industrially, other than products specified in regulations for the purposes of paragraph 43(1)(a); and

                     (b)  the previous use was by, or with the consent of, the owner of the copyright in the artistic work.

             (3)  In this section:

                    <a name="applied-industri"></a>**_applied industrially_** has the meaning given by regulations under section 77 of the _Copyright Act 1968_.

### Division 2—Substantial similarity in overall impression

##### <a id="19"></a>19  Factors to be considered in assessing substantial similarity in overall impression

             (1)  If a person is required by this Act to decide whether a design is substantially similar in overall impression to another design, the person making the decision is to give more weight to similarities between the designs than to differences between them.

             (2)  The person must also:

                     (a)  have regard to the state of development of the prior art base for the design; and

                     (b)  if the design application in which the design was disclosed included a statement (a **_statement of newness and distinctiveness_**) identifying particular visual features of the design as new and distinctive:

                              (i)  have particular regard to those features; and

                             (ii)  if those features relate to only part of the design—have particular regard to that part of the design, but in the context of the design as a whole; and

                     (c)  if only part of the design is substantially similar to another design, have regard to the amount, quality and importance of that part in the context of the design as a whole; and

                     (d)  have regard to the freedom of the creator of the design to innovate.

             (3)  If the design application in which the design was disclosed did not include a statement of newness and distinctiveness in respect of particular visual features of the design, the person must have regard to the appearance of the design as a whole.

             (4)  In applying subsections (1), (2) and (3), the person must apply the standard of a person who is familiar with the product to which the design relates, or products similar to the product to which the design relates (the **_standard of the informed user_**).

             (5)  In this section, a reference to a person includes a reference to a court.

# Chapter 3—Design applications

## Part 1—Simplified outline of Chapter 3

##### <a id="20"></a>20  Simplified outline

                   The following is a simplified outline of this Chapter:

* * *

This Chapter sets out the rules relating to design applications.

Part 2 provides that a person may file a design application in relation to one or more designs.

If the design application meets the minimum filing requirements, the design application is allocated a filing date, and each design disclosed in it obtains a **_priority date_**.

Under Chapter 4, a person who has filed a design application may, within the prescribed period, request registration or publication of all or any of the designs disclosed in the application.

Part 3 deals with amendment and withdrawal of design applications.

Part 4 deals with the lapsing of design applications.

* * *

## Part 2—Design applications

### Division 1—Applications

##### <a id="21"></a>21  Person may file a design application

             (1)  A person may file an application (a **_design application_**) in respect of a design.

             (2)  A design application must comply with:

                     (a)  any requirements prescribed by the regulations in relation to representations of designs disclosed in the application; and

                     (b)  any other requirements prescribed by the regulations.

These are the **_minimum filing requirements_**.

             (3)  A design application may be made by more than one person.

             (4)  A design application must specify the entitled person or persons in relation to the designs disclosed in the design application.

##### <a id="22"></a>22  A design application may be in respect of more than one design

             (1)  A single design application may be in respect of:

                     (a)  one design in relation to one product; or

                     (b)  one design that is a common design in relation to more than one product; or

                     (c)  more than one design in relation to one product; or

                     (d)  more than one design in relation to more than one product, if each product belongs to the same Locarno Agreement class.

             (2)  If more than one design is disclosed in a design application, the entitled person or persons must be the same in relation to each design.

Note:          This means that a separate application must be made in respect of designs with a different entitled person or persons.

             (3)  To avoid doubt, a design that is a common design in relation to more than one product is a design in relation to each product.

##### <a id="23"></a>23  Design applications covering excluded designs

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  one or more designs are disclosed in a design application (the **_initial application_**); and

                     (b)  after the initial application is filed, it is amended under section 28 to exclude one or more of those designs (the **_excluded designs_**); and

                     (c)  the initial application has not lapsed or been withdrawn; and

                     (d)  none of the designs in the initial application has been registered, or published under section 57;

the applicant may file a design application under section 21 in respect of one or more of the excluded designs.

             (2)  An application in respect of one or more excluded designs must be filed within the period prescribed by the regulations.

             (3)  To avoid doubt, an application in respect of one or more excluded designs must not include a design that has been withdrawn under subsection 32(2) from the initial application or refused registration or publication.

### Division 2—How Registrar must deal with a design application

##### <a id="24"></a>24  Design applications that meet the minimum filing requirements

             (1)  If a design application meets the minimum filing requirements mentioned in subsection 21(2), the Registrar must give a written notice to the applicant stating:

                     (a)  that the design application meets the minimum filing requirements; and

                     (b)  the filing date of the application; and

                     (c)  if the design application was not accompanied by a request for registration or publication of each design disclosed in the application—that such a request may be made under section 35.

             (2)  If a purported design application does not meet the minimum filing requirements, the Registrar must give a written notice to that effect to the applicant.

             (3)  A notice under subsection (1) or (2) must be given in accordance with the regulations.

##### <a id="25"></a>25  Publication of receipt of application

                   The Registrar must publish, in the manner prescribed by the regulations, the details prescribed by the regulations in relation to each design application that meets the minimum filing requirements.

### Division 3—Filing date and priority date

##### <a id="26"></a>26  Filing date

                   A design application has the filing date determined in accordance with the regulations.

##### <a id="27"></a>27  Priority date

             (1)  The priority date of a design disclosed in a design application that meets the minimum filing requirements is:

                     (a)  the filing date of the design application; or

                     (b)  if, before the design application was filed, an application for protection in respect of the design had been made in a Convention country in accordance with the regulations—the date prescribed by the regulations; or

                     (c)  if the regulations provide for a different date as the priority date—the date prescribed by the regulations.

             (2)  If more than one design is disclosed in a design application, the designs may have different priority dates.

## Part 3—Amendment or withdrawal of design applications

##### <a id="28"></a>28  Amendment of design applications

             (1)  The Registrar may amend a design application if requested to do so by the applicant.

             (2)  A request under subsection (1) must be made in the manner prescribed by the regulations.

             (2)  The Registrar may, on a request made in accordance with the regulations by any of the persons, make any determinations the Registrar thinks fit for either or both of the following purposes:

                     (a)  enabling the application to specify which of those persons is an entitled person in relation to a design disclosed in the application;

                     (b)  regulating the manner in which the application is to proceed.

             (3)  A person mentioned in subsection (1) or (2) must be:

                     (a)  the applicant; or

                     (a)  an applicant; or

                     (b)  an entitled person in relation to a design disclosed in the application.

             (2)  The Registrar may give the direction if the person would, if the design were registered, be entitled under an assignment or agreement, or by operation of law, to:

                     (a)  the registered design or an interest in it; or

                     (b)  an undivided share in the registered design or in such an interest.

             (3)  If the Registrar gives the direction:

                     (a)  the person is taken to be an applicant or an entitled person in relation to the design, as the case requires; and

                     (b)  the application is taken to be amended accordingly.

             (4)  A request under subsection (1) must be in accordance with the regulations.

##### <a id="31"></a>31  Publication of certain details of amended application

##### <a id="32"></a>32  Withdrawal of designs and design applications

             (1)  A person who has filed a design application may withdraw the application by written notice filed within the period prescribed by the regulations.

             (2)  A person who has filed a design application in respect of more than one design may withdraw one or more of those designs from the application by written notice filed within the period prescribed by the regulations.

             (3)  If the design application was filed by more than one person, the notice is not effective unless each of them consented to the giving of the notice.

             (4)  If a design is withdrawn from a design application, the person or persons who withdrew the design may not subsequently request registration or publication of the design under Part 2 of Chapter 4 unless the person makes another application in respect of the design under section 21.

## Part 4—Lapsing of design applications

##### <a id="33"></a>33  Lapsing of design applications

             (1)  A design application lapses if:

                     (a)  a request to register or publish each design disclosed in the application has not been made, in accordance with Part 2 of Chapter 4, within the period prescribed by the regulations; or

# Chapter 4—Registration or publication of designs

## Part 1—Simplified outline of Chapter 4

##### <a id="34"></a>34  Simplified outline

                   The following is a simplified outline of this Chapter:

* * *

Part 2 permits an applicant to request registration or publication of all or any of the designs disclosed in a design application.

The Registrar must register or publish the designs under Part 3 or 4 if specified requirements are satisfied.

                     (a)  increase the scope of the design registration; or

                     (b)  alter the scope of the registration by the inclusion of matter that was not in substance disclosed in the original design application, representations or other documents.

##### <a id="67"></a>67  Certificate of examination where registration valid

             (1)  This section applies in relation to a registered design if:

                     (a)  the Registrar has examined the design and is satisfied that a ground for revocation of the registration of the design has not been made out, or that any such ground would be removed if the Register were amended as proposed in a request made under section 66; and

# Chapter 6—Infringement

## Part 1—Simplified outline of Chapter 6

##### <a id="70"></a>70  Simplified outline

                   The following is a simplified outline of this Chapter:

* * *

Chapter 6 is about infringement.

Part 2 provides that a person infringes a registered design if, without the appropriate authority, the person deals in certain ways with a product that embodies the design, or a design that is substantially similar to it.

Part 2 also provides that the registered owner of a design may bring infringement proceedings. The defendant may counter‑claim for rectification of the Register.

Various remedies are available, including injunction, damages or an account of profits.

Part 3 deals with unjustified threats of infringement proceedings.

* * *

## Part 2—Infringement of registered design

##### <a id="71"></a>71  Infringement of design

             (1)  A person infringes a registered design if, during the term of registration of the design, and without the licence or authority of the registered owner of the design, the person:

                     (a)  makes or offers to make a product, in relation to which the design is registered, which embodies a design that is identical to, or substantially similar in overall impression to, the registered design; or

                     (b)  imports such a product into Australia for sale, or for use for the purposes of any trade or business; or

                     (c)  sells, hires or otherwise disposes of, or offers to sell, hire or otherwise dispose of, such a product; or

                     (d)  uses such a product in any way for the purposes of any trade or business; or

                     (e)  keeps such a product for the purpose of doing any of the things mentioned in paragraph (c) or (d).

             (2)  Despite subsection (1), a person does not infringe a registered design if:

                     (a)  the person imports a product, in relation to which the design is registered, which embodies a design that is identical to, or substantially similar in overall impression to, the registered design; and

                     (b)  the product embodies the design with the licence or authority of the registered owner of the design.

             (3)  In determining whether an allegedly infringing design is substantially similar in overall impression to the registered design, a court is to consider the factors specified in section 19.

             (4)  Infringement proceedings must be started within 6 years from the day on which the alleged infringement occurred.

##### <a id="72"></a>72  Certain repairs do not infringe registered design

             (1)  Despite subsection 71(1), a person does not infringe a registered design if:

                     (a)  the person uses, or authorises another person to use, a product:

                              (i)  in relation to which the design is registered; and

                             (ii)  which embodies a design that is identical to, or substantially similar in overall impression to, the registered design; and

                     (b)  the product is a component part of a complex product; and

                     (c)  the use or authorisation is for the purpose of the repair of the complex product so as to restore its overall appearance in whole or part.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  a person uses or authorises another person to use a product:

                              (i)  in relation to which a design is registered; and

                             (ii)  which embodies a design that is identical to, or substantially similar in overall impression to, the registered design; and

                     (b)  the person asserts in infringement proceedings that, because of the operation of subsection (1), the use or authorisation did not infringe the registered design;

the registered owner of the design bears the burden of proving that the person knew, or ought reasonably to have known, that the use or authorisation was not for the purpose mentioned in paragraph (1)(c).

             (3)  For the purposes of subsection (1):

                     (a)  a repair is taken to be so as to restore the overall appearance of a complex product in whole if the overall appearance of the complex product immediately after the repair is not materially different from its original overall appearance; and

                     (b)  a repair is taken to be so as to restore the overall appearance of a complex product in part if any material difference between:

                              (i)  the original overall appearance of the complex product; and

                             (ii)  the overall appearance of the complex product immediately after the repair;

                            is solely attributable to the fact that only part of the complex product has been repaired.

             (4)  In applying subsection (3), a court must apply the standard of the informed user.

             (5)  In this section:

                    <a name="repair"></a>**_repair_**, in relation to a complex product, includes the following:

                     (a)  restoring a decayed or damaged component part of the complex product to a good or sound condition;

                     (b)  replacing a decayed or damaged component part of the complex product with a component part in good or sound condition;

                     (c)  necessarily replacing incidental items when restoring or replacing a decayed or damaged component part of the complex product;

                     (d)  carrying out maintenance on the complex product.

                    <a name="standard-informed-user"></a>**_standard of the informed user_**, in relation to the overall appearance of a complex product, means the standard of a person who is familiar with the complex product, or with products similar to that product.

                    <a name="us"></a>**_use_**, in relation to a product, means:

                     (a)  to make or offer to make the product; or

                     (b)  to import the product into Australia for sale, or for use for the purposes of any trade or business; or

                     (c)  to sell, hire or otherwise dispose of, or offer to sell, hire or otherwise dispose of, the product; or

                     (d)  to use the product in any other way for the purposes of any trade or business; or

                     (e)  to keep the product for the purpose of doing any of the things mentioned in paragraph (c) or (d).

##### <a id="73"></a>73  Infringement proceedings

             (1)  The registered owner of a registered design may bring proceedings against another person alleging that the person has infringed the registered design.

             (2)  Infringement proceedings may be brought in a prescribed court or in another court that has jurisdiction in relation to the proceedings.

             (3)  However, infringement proceedings may not be brought under subsection (1) until:

                     (a)  the design has been examined under Chapter 5; and

                     (b)  a certificate of examination has been issued.

             (4)  If a person files an application under section 21 for registration of a design as a result of the operation of section 55, the person may only bring infringement proceedings in respect of infringements of the design occurring after the date on which the application was filed under section 21.

##### <a id="74"></a>74  Counter‑claims

                   A defendant in infringement proceedings in respect of a registered design may apply, by way of counter‑claim in the proceedings, for the revocation of the registration of the design under section 93.

##### <a id="75"></a>75  Remedies for infringement

             (1)  Without limiting the relief that a court may grant in infringement proceedings, the relief may include:

                     (a)  an injunction subject to such terms as the court thinks fit; and

                     (b)  at the option of the plaintiff—damages or an account of profits.

             (2)  The court may refuse to award damages, reduce the damages that would otherwise be awarded, or refuse to make an order for an account of profits, if the defendant satisfies the court:

                     (a)  in the case of primary infringement:

                              (i)  that at the time of the infringement, the defendant was not aware that the design was registered; and

                             (ii)  that before that time, the defendant had taken all reasonable steps to ascertain whether the design was registered; or

                     (b)  in the case of secondary infringement—that at the time of the infringement, the defendant was not aware, and could not reasonably have been expected to be aware, that the design was registered.

             (3)  The court may award such additional damages as it considers appropriate, having regard to the flagrancy of the infringement and all other relevant matters.

             (4)  It is prima facie evidence that the defendant was aware that the design was registered if the product embodying the registered design to which the infringement proceedings relate, or the packaging of the product, is marked so as to indicate registration of the design.

             (5)  In this section:

                    <a name="primari-infring"></a>**_primary infringement_** means infringement of a kind mentioned in paragraph 71(1)(a).

                    <a name="secondari-infring"></a>**_secondary infringement_** means infringement of a kind mentioned in paragraph 71(1)(b), (c), (d) or (e).

##### <a id="76"></a>76  Intervention by Registrar

                   A court may grant the Registrar leave to intervene in infringement proceedings.

## Part 3—Relief from unjustified threats

##### <a id="77"></a>77  Application for relief from unjustified threats

             (1)  If a person is threatened by another person (the **_respondent_**) with infringement proceedings, or other similar proceedings, in respect of a design, an aggrieved person (the **_applicant_**) may apply to a prescribed court, or to another court that has jurisdiction to hear and determine the application, for:

                     (a)  a declaration that the threats are unjustified; and

                     (b)  an injunction against the continuation of the threats; and

                     (c)  the recovery of damages sustained by the applicant as a result of the threats.

             (2)  A threat mentioned in subsection (1) may be by means of circulars, advertisements or otherwise.

             (3)  If a certificate of examination has not been issued in respect of a design, a threat to bring infringement proceedings, or other similar proceedings, in respect of the design is an unjustified threat for the purposes of this section.

##### <a id="78"></a>78  Court’s power to grant relief

                   A court may grant the relief sought by an applicant under section 77, unless the respondent satisfies the court that:

                     (a)  the design concerned is registered, has been examined and a certificate of examination has been issued; and

                     (b)  the acts about which the threats were made infringe, or would infringe, the registered design.

##### <a id="79"></a>79  Counter‑claim

             (1)  The respondent in proceedings under section 77 in respect of a design may apply, by way of counter‑claim, for relief to which the respondent would be entitled in separate infringement proceedings against the applicant in respect of the design.

             (2)  If the respondent applies under subsection (1) by way of counter‑claim, the applicant may, without making a separate application under section 93, apply for revocation of the registration of the design.

             (3)  The provisions of this Act relating to infringement proceedings apply, with the necessary modifications, to a counter‑claim under subsection (1).

             (4)  The provisions of this Act relating to proceedings for the revocation of the registration of a design apply, with the necessary modifications, to an application under subsection (2).

##### <a id="80"></a>80  Mere notification of registration not a threat

                   The mere notification of the existence of a registered design does not constitute a threat of infringement proceedings for the purposes of section 77.

##### <a id="81"></a>81  Legal practitioners, registered patent attorneys and registered trade marks attorneys

                   A legal practitioner, a registered patent attorney or a registered trade marks attorney is not liable to proceedings under section 77 in respect of an act done in a professional capacity on behalf of a client.

Part 4 also deals with the capacity of a prescribed court to revoke the registration of a design in certain other circumstances.

* * *

## Part 2—Jurisdiction

##### <a id="83"></a>83  Jurisdiction of Federal Court

             (1)  The Federal Court has jurisdiction with respect to matters arising under this Act.

                     (a)  the jurisdiction is conferred to the extent that the Constitution permits so far as it relates to:

                              (i)  infringement proceedings; or

                             (ii)  an application for revocation of registration of a design because of section 74; and

                     (b)  in any other case, the jurisdiction is conferred only in relation to proceedings instituted by:

                              (i)  a natural person who is resident in the Territory at the time the proceedings are brought; or

                     (b)  upon application of a party made at any stage in the proceedings.

             (2)  If proceedings are transferred from one court to another court under this section:

                     (a)  all documents of record relevant to the proceedings are to be sent to the Registrar or other appropriate officer of the other court; and

                     (b)  the other court must proceed as if:

                             (ii)  the same steps in the proceedings had been taken in that court as had been taken in the transferring court.

##### <a id="87"></a>87  Appeals

             (1)  An appeal lies to the Federal Court from a judgment or order of:

                     (a)  another prescribed court exercising jurisdiction under this Act; or

                     (b)  any other court in a proceeding referred to in section 73 or 77.

             (2)  An appeal does not lie to the full court of the Federal Court from a judgment or order of a single judge of the Federal Court, in the exercise of its jurisdiction to hear and determine appeals from decisions of the Registrar, other than with the leave of the Federal Court.

             (3)  An appeal lies to the High Court, with special leave of the High Court, from a judgment or order referred to in subsection (1).

                   The Registrar may appear and be heard at the hearing of an appeal to the Federal Court against a decision or direction of the Registrar, even if the Registrar is not a party to the appeal.

## Part 3—Compulsory licences and revocation of registration

##### <a id="90"></a>90  Person may apply to court for compulsory licence

             (1)  A person may apply to a prescribed court, after the end of the prescribed period, for an order requiring the registered owner of a registered design to grant the person a licence to do any of the things mentioned in paragraphs 10(1)(a) to (e) in relation to the design.

             (2)  An application under subsection (1) may not be made unless a certificate of examination has been issued.

             (3)  After hearing the application, the court may make such an order if it is satisfied that:

                     (a)  products embodying the design have not been made in Australia, to the extent that is reasonable in the circumstances of the case; and

                     (b)  the registered owner of the design has given no satisfactory reason for failing to exercise the exclusive rights in the design; and

                     (c)  the applicant has tried for a reasonable period, but without success, to obtain from the registered owner of the design an authorisation to do, on reasonable terms and conditions, any of the things mentioned in paragraphs 10(1)(a) to (e) in relation to the design.

##### <a id="91"></a>91  Terms of compulsory licence

             (1)  This section applies if a court makes an order granting a licence under section 90.

             (2)  The order must direct that the licence:

                     (a)  does not give the licensee any exclusive rights in the design; and

                     (b)  is to be assignable only in connection with an enterprise or goodwill in connection with which the licence is used;

and may direct that the licence is to be granted on any other terms specified in the order.

             (3)  The order operates, without prejudice to any other method of enforcement, as if it were embodied in a deed granting a licence and executed by the registered owner of the design and all other necessary parties.

             (4)  The applicant is to pay the registered owner of the design:

                     (a)  such amount as is agreed between the applicant and the registered owner of the design; or

                     (b)  if paragraph (a) does not apply—such amount as is determined by a prescribed court to be just and reasonable having regard to the economic value of the licence.

             (5)  The registered owner of the design or a prescribed court may revoke the licence if:

                     (a)  the registered owner of the design and the licensee are agreed, or the court on application made by either party finds, that the circumstances that justified the grant of the licence have ceased to exist and are unlikely to recur; and

                     (b)  the legitimate interests of the licensee are not likely to be adversely affected by the revocation.

##### <a id="92"></a>92  Revocation of registration after grant of compulsory licence

             (1)  If a licence is granted under section 90, an interested person may apply to a prescribed court, after the end of the prescribed period, for an order revoking the registration of the design.

             (2)  After hearing the application, the court may make the order if it is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the reasonable requirements of the public with respect to the design have not been satisfied; and

                     (b)  the registered owner of the design has given no satisfactory reason for failing to exercise the exclusive rights in the design.

## Part 4—Revocation of registration by court in other circumstances

##### <a id="93"></a>93  Revocation of registration in other circumstances

             (1)  A person may apply to a prescribed court for an order revoking the registration of a design.

             (2)  An application under subsection (1) may be made only after the design has been examined under Chapter 5 and a certificate of examination has been issued.

             (3)  The grounds on which a court may revoke the registration of the design are:

                     (a)  that the design is not a registrable design; or

                     (b)  that one or more of the original registered owners was not an entitled person in relation to the design when the design was first registered; or
