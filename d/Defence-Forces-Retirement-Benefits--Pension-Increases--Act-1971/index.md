## An Act to provide for Increases in certain Defence Forces Retirement Pensions

##### <a id="1"></a>1  Short title [_see_ Note 1]

                   This Act may be cited as the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits (Pension Increases) Act 1971_.

##### <a id="2"></a>2  Commencement [_see_ Note 1]

                   This Act shall come into operation on the day on which it receives the Royal Assent.

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Interpretation

             (1)  In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears:

                    <a name="actual-pension-entitl"></a>**_actual pension entitlement_**, in relation to an eligible pensioner, means the rate at which pension was payable to him immediately before the commencing date, or, if section 69 of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948_ applied in relation to him at that time, he had commuted a portion of his pension before that time or he had made an election under section 61A or section 61B of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1963-1968_, the rate at which pension would have been payable to him at that time if that section had not so applied in relation to him, he had not commuted a portion of his pension or he had not made that election, as the case may be.

                    <a name="basic-pension-entitl"></a>**_basic pension entitlement_**, in relation to an eligible pensioner, means:

                     (a)  in the case of a pensioner who retired before the commencement of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits (Pension Increases) Act 1961_:

                              (i)  the rate at which pension was payable to him immediately before the commencement of that Act; or

                             (ii)  if section 69 of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948_ applied in relation to him at that time, he had commuted a portion of his pension before that time or (if pension is payable to him under section 52 of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948_) his classification for the purposes of that section was, at that time, different from his classification on the commencing date—the rate at which pension would have been payable to him at that time if section 69 of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948_ had not so applied in relation to him, he had not commuted a portion of his pension or his classification at that time had been the same as his classification on the commencing date, as the case may be;

                     (b)  in the case of a pensioner who retired after the commencement of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits (Pension Increases) Act 1961_ but before the commencement of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1963_:

                              (i)  the rate at which pension was payable to him immediately before the commencement of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1963_; or

                             (ii)  if section 69 of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948_ applied in relation to him at that time, he had commuted a portion of his pension before that time or (if pension is payable to him under section 52 of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948_) his classification for the purposes of that section was, at that time, different from his classification on the commencing date—the rate at which pension would have been payable to him at that time if section 69 of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948_ had not so applied in relation to him, he had not commuted a portion of his pension or his classification at that time had been the same as his classification on the commencing date, as the case may be;

                     (c)  in the case of a pensioner who retired after the commencement of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1963_ but before the commencement of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits (Pension Increases) Act 1967_:

                              (i)  the rate at which pension was payable to him immediately before the commencement of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits (Pension Increases) Act 1967_; or

                             (ii)  if section 69 of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948_ applied in relation to him at that time, he had commuted a portion of his pension before that time or (if pension is payable to him under section 52 of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948_) his classification for the purposes of that section was, at that time, different from his classification on the commencing date or he had made an election under section 61A or section 61B of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1963-1968—_ the rate at which pension would have been payable to him at that time if section 69 of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948_ had not so applied in relation to him, he had not commuted a portion of his pension, his classification at that time had been the same as his classification on the commencing date or he had not made that election, as the case may be; and

                    <a name="notion-rate-annual-pai"></a>**_notional rate of annual pay_**, in relation to an eligible pensioner or a pensioner included in a class of eligible pensioners, means such rate of annual pay payable to members on the thirtieth day of June, One thousand nine hundred and seventy-one, as the Treasurer determines to be the rate that corresponds with the maximum rate of annual pay that was applicable to the pensioner or to that class of pensioners, as the case may be, immediately before the retirement of the pensioner.

                    <a name="pension-current-rate"></a>**_pension at current rate_**, in relation to an eligible pensioner, means:

                     (a)  except in the case of a pensioner to whom paragraph (b) of this definition applies—the rate at which pension would have been payable to him immediately before the commencing date if the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948-1971_ had been in force immediately before his retirement and he were, subject to subsection (3) of this section, entitled to pension in accordance with the provisions of that Act; and

                     (b)  in the case of a pensioner in relation to whose pension section 45 of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948_ applies—such rate of pension as is ascertained by multiplying the rate of Ninety-one dollars per annum by a number the same as the category number applicable under section 4A of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948-1971_ to a rate of annual pay the same as the notional rate of annual pay of the pensioner.

             (2)  In determining the basic pension entitlement of an eligible pensioner for the purposes of this Act, any increase in the rate of his pension that was effected by the operation of section 45 of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948_ shall be disregarded.

                     (c)  if the eligible pensioner retired before the commencement of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1959_, paragraph (b) of subsection (4) of section 39 of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948-1971_ shall be disregarded;

                     (d)  if the eligible pensioner was an officer immediately before his retirement and retired:

                             (ii)  after attaining the retiring age for the rank held by him immediately before his retirement; and

                              (i)  before the commencement of the _Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1959_;

                             (ii)  after attaining the retiring age for the rank held by him immediately before his retirement;
