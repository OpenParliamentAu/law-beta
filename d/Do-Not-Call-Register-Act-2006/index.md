##### <a id="24"></a>24  Civil penalty orders

             (1)  If the Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Court is satisfied that a person has contravened a civil penalty provision, the court may, on the application of the ACMA, order the person to pay to the Commonwealth a pecuniary penalty.
