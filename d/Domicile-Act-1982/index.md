             (1)  The object of this Act is to abolish the rule of law whereby a married woman has at all times the domicile of her husband, and to make certain other reforms to the law relating to domicile, for the purposes of:

                     (a)  the laws of the Commonwealth; and

             (5)  Where a provision of a law of the Commonwealth refers to domicile in, or to domicile outside, Australia, the provision shall, for the purposes of the application of this Act, be taken to refer to domicile in, or to domicile outside, as the case may be, the area that constitutes Australia, within the meaning of that provision, considered as a single country.

             (6)  The Territories to which this Act applies are the Australian Capital Territory, the Jervis Bay Territory and the external Territories (if any) that are declared by the regulations to be Territories to which this Act extends.

                     (b)  his or her parents are living separately and apart or the child does not have another living parent;

the domicile of the child at that time is the domicile that the parent with whom the child has his or her principal home has as at that time and thereafter the child has the domicile that that parent has from time to time or, if that parent dies, the domicile that that parent has at the time of death.

             (2)  Where a child is adopted, his or her domicile:

                     (a)  if, upon his or her adoption, he or she has 2 adoptive parents—is, at the time of the adoption and thereafter, the domicile he or she would have if he or she were a child born in wedlock to those parents; and

                     (b)  his or her parents resume or commence living together.

             (5)  Where the adoption of a child is rescinded, the domicile of the child shall thereafter be determined in accordance with any provisions with respect to that domicile that are included in the order rescinding the adoption and, so far as no provision is applicable, as if the adoption had not taken place.

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Evidence of acquisition of domicile of choice

                   The acquisition of a domicile of choice in place of a domicile of origin may be established by evidence that would be sufficient to establish the domicile of choice if the previous domicile had also been a domicile of choice.
