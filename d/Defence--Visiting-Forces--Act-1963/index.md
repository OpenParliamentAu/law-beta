                     (b)  a person who, not being an Australian citizen or a person ordinarily resident in Australia, is a dependant of a member of the visiting force or of a member of a civilian component of that force.

             (5)  In determining, for the purposes of this Act, whether a person is, or was at any time, ordinarily resident in Australia, account shall not be taken of any period during which that person has been or intends to be present in Australia while being:

             (7)  A reference in any provision of this Act to the designated authority of a country shall be read as a reference to such authority as is designated for the purposes of that provision by the appropriate authority or officer of that country.

             (8)  A reference in any provision of this Act to trial by a court shall be read as including a reference to hearing and determination by a court of summary jurisdiction of a charge that a person has committed an offence against a law of Australia or of a State or Territory.

             (2)  Where it appears to the Governor‑General that it is expedient that any of the provisions of this Act should have effect in relation to a country other than a country referred to in paragraph (a) of the last preceding subsection, the regulations may declare that country to be a country in relation to which such provisions of this Act as are specified in the regulations have effect.

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Extension of Act to Territories

                   This Act extends to every Territory.

## Part II—Visiting Forces

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Exercise of powers by service tribunals and authorities of countries sending visiting forces

             (1)   The service tribunals and service authorities of a country in relation to which this section applies may, within Australia, or on board a ship or aircraft belonging to or in the service of the Defence Force or a part of the Defence Force, exercise over persons subject to their jurisdiction in accordance with this section all such powers as are exercisable by them in accordance with the law of that country.

             (2)  The persons subject to the jurisdiction of the service tribunals and service authorities of a country in accordance with this section are:

                     (a)  members of any visiting force of that country; and

                     (b)  all other persons who, being neither Australian citizens nor persons ordinarily resident in Australia, are for the time being subject to the service law of that country otherwise than as members of that country’s forces.

             (3)  For the purposes of the last preceding subsection, a person shall be treated as not being a member of a visiting force of a country if he or she became, or last became, a member of that country’s forces at a time when he or she was in Australia, unless he or she then became a member of those forces with his or her consent.

             (4)  Where a sentence has, whether within or beyond the territorial limits of Australia, been passed by a service tribunal of a country in relation to which this section applies upon a person who was, immediately before the sentence was passed, subject to the jurisdiction of that tribunal in accordance with this section, then, for the purposes of any proceedings in a court:

                     (a)  the service tribunal shall be deemed to have been properly constituted;

                     (b)  the sentence shall be deemed to be within the jurisdiction of the service tribunal and in accordance with the law of that country; and

                     (c)  the sentence shall, if executed according to its tenor, be deemed to have been lawfully executed.

             (5)  Notwithstanding anything in the preceding provisions of this section, a sentence of death passed by a service tribunal of a country in relation to which this section applies shall not be carried out in   Australia.

             (6)  A person who:

                     (a)  is detained in custody in pursuance of a sentence with respect to which subsection (4) has effect; or

                     (b)  being subject in accordance with this section to the jurisdiction of the service tribunals of a country in relation to which this section applies, is detained in custody pending or during the trial by a service tribunal of that country of a charge brought against him or her;

shall, for the purposes of any proceedings in a court, be deemed to be in lawful custody.

             (7)  For the purpose of enabling the service tribunals and service authorities of a country in relation to which this section applies to exercise more effectively the powers referred to in subsection (1), the Chief of Navy, the Chief of Army or the Chief of Air Force, if so requested by the designated authority of that country, may, by general or special orders, direct members of that part of the Defence Force under his or her command to arrest any person who, being a member of a visiting force of that country, is alleged to have committed an offence punishable under the law of that country and to deliver him or her to such service authority of that country as is designated by or under any of those orders.

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Restriction, with respect to certain offences, of trial by courts of offenders connected with visiting force

             (1)  Subject to this section, a person charged with an offence against a law of Australia or of a State or Territory is not liable to be tried for that offence by a court if he or she was, at the time when the offence is alleged to have been committed, a member of a visiting force or of a civilian component of a visiting force and:

                     (a)  the alleged offence, if committed by him or her, arose out of and in the course of his or her duty as a member of that force or component, as the case may be, or is an offence solely against the security of the sending country;

                     (b)  the alleged offence is an offence against the person, and the person or, if the act or omission constituting the offence has relation to more than one person, each of the persons in relation to whom the offence is alleged to have been committed had at the time of the alleged commission of the offence a relevant association either with that force or with another visiting force of the same country; or

                     (c)  the alleged offence is an offence against property, and the whole of the property in relation to which it is alleged to have been committed (or, in a case where different parts of that property were differently owned, each part of the property) was, at the time of the alleged commission of the offence, the property either of the sending country or of an authority of that country or of a person or persons having such an association as is specified in the last preceding paragraph.

             (2)  The last preceding subsection does not apply if:

                     (a)  at the time when the offence is alleged to have been committed, the alleged offender was a person not subject to the jurisdiction of the service tribunals of the sending country in accordance with the last preceding section; or

                     (b)  the alleged offender was at that time a member of a civilian component of a visiting force and the case cannot be dealt with under the service law of the sending country.

             (3)  Subsection (1):

                     (a)  does not prevent a person from being tried by a court in a case where the Attorney‑General certifies in writing, either before or in the course of the trial, that the designated authority of the sending country has notified him or her that it is not proposed to deal with the case under the law of that country;

                     (b)  does not affect anything done or omitted in the course of a trial unless in the course of the trial objection has already been made that, by reason of that subsection, the court is not competent to deal with the case; and

                     (c)  shall not, after the conclusion of a trial, be treated as having affected the validity of the trial, if no such objection was made in the proceedings at any stage before the conclusion of the trial.

             (4)  Where the charge is a charge (by whatever words expressed) of attempting or conspiring to commit an offence, or of aiding, abetting, inciting, procuring or being accessory to the commission of an offence:

                     (a)  paragraphs (b) and (c) of subsection (1) have effect as if references in those paragraphs to the alleged offence were references to the offence that the person charged is alleged to have attempted or conspired to commit or, as the case may be, the offence the commission of which it is alleged that he or she aided, abetted, incited or procured or to the commission of which he or she was accessory; and

                     (b)  references in those paragraphs to persons in relation to whom, or property in relation to which, the offence is alleged to have been committed shall be construed accordingly.

             (5)  This section does not derogate from any provision of any law that restricts the prosecution of any proceedings or requires the consent of an authority of Australia or of a State or Territory to the prosecution of any proceedings.

             (6)  For the purposes of this section, the expressions **_offence against the person_** and **_offence against property_** shall be construed in accordance with the provisions of the Schedule.

##### <a id="10"></a>10  Waiver of jurisdiction otherwise exercisable by a court

             (1)  Where:

                     (a)  a service tribunal of a country in relation to which this section applies has jurisdiction to try a person alleged to have committed an offence against the law of Australia or of a State or Territory; and

                     (b)  the jurisdiction of a court with respect to the alleged offence is not excluded by virtue of the last preceding section;

the designated authority of that country may request the Attorney‑General that jurisdiction be not exercised by a court with respect to the alleged offence and, if the Attorney‑General agrees to that request, he or she shall, by writing under his or her hand, notify the appropriate authority of Australia or of a State or Territory, as the case requires, that it is not desirable that the case should be dealt with by a court.

             (2)  Upon the Attorney‑General notifying an appropriate authority under the last preceding subsection, the provisions of the last preceding section shall be deemed to apply as if the alleged offence were an offence described in subsection (1) of that section.

##### <a id="11"></a>11  Courts not to try offenders tried by service tribunals of visiting forces

             (1)  Where a person has been tried for an offence by a service tribunal of a country in relation to which section 8 applies in the exercise of the powers referred to in subsection (1) of that section, he or she shall not be tried by a court for an offence that is substantially the same offence.

             (2)  Where a person who has been convicted of an offence by a service tribunal of such a country in the exercise of those powers is convicted by a court of a different offence, but it appears to the court that the conviction by the service tribunal was wholly or partly in respect of acts or omissions in respect of which he or she is convicted by the court, the court may, in determining any penalty that may be imposed or order that may be made, have regard to the sentence of the service tribunal.

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Arrest, custody etc. of offenders against Australian law

             (1)  Neither section 9 nor the last preceding section affects:

                     (a)  any powers of arrest, search, entry, seizure or custody exercisable under the law of Australia or of a State or Territory with respect to offences committed or suspected or believed to have been committed;

                     (b)  any obligation of a person in respect of a recognisance or bail bond entered into in consequence of his or her arrest, or the arrest of another person, for such an offence; or

                     (c)  any power of a court to remand (whether in custody or otherwise) a person brought before the court in connexion with such an offence.

             (2)  Where a person is charged with an offence against a law of Australia or of a State or Territory, and it appears that that person is subject to the jurisdiction of the service tribunals of a country in relation to which section 8 applies, the designated authority of that country shall be notified.

             (3)  Where a person is charged with an offence against a law of Australia or of a State or Territory, and it appears to the court before which he or she is charged that he or she is a person subject to the jurisdiction of the service tribunals of a country in relation to which section 8 applies, the court shall determine the period that it considers reasonable to enable inquiries to be made with a view to determining whether he or she should be dealt with by a court or by a service tribunal of that country, and further proceedings with respect to the offence charged are, by force of this Act, stayed for that period.

             (4)  Where:

                     (a)  a person referred to in the last preceding subsection is remanded in custody by order of a court; and

                     (b)  the Attorney‑General, by writing under his or her hand:

                              (i)  states that the designated authority of the sending country has requested that that person be delivered into the custody of a service authority of that country pending trial; and

                             (ii)  requests that that person be so delivered;

the court shall revoke the order and shall order that that person be so delivered.

##### <a id="13"></a>13  Restriction of proceedings in respect of service of members etc. of visiting force

                   Proceedings shall not be brought in any court with respect to:

                     (a)  the pay of a person in respect of his or her service as a member of a visiting force or of a civilian component of a visiting force;

                     (b)  the terms of a person’s service as a member of a visiting force or of a civilian component of a visiting force; or

                     (c)  a person’s discharge from the service of a visiting force or of a civilian component of a visiting force.

##### <a id="14"></a>14  Inquests

             (1)  If a coroner having jurisdiction to hold an inquest into the manner and cause of a death is satisfied that the deceased person had, at the time of his or her death, a relevant association with a visiting force, the coroner:

                     (a)  shall not hold the inquest; or

                     (b)  where the inquest has been commenced but is not then completed, shall adjourn the inquest;

and, where a jury has been summoned, shall discharge the jury.

             (2)  If, on an inquest into the manner and cause of a death, the coroner is satisfied that:

                     (a)  a person who in accordance with section 8 is subject to the jurisdiction of the service tribunals of a country in relation to which this section applies has been charged before a service tribunal of that country with the homicide of the deceased person, whether or not that charge has been dealt with; or

                     (b)  such a person is being detained by an authority of that country with a view to his or her being so charged;

the coroner shall adjourn the inquest and, where a jury has been summoned, shall discharge the jury.

             (3)  The last preceding subsection does not prevent the coroner from:

                     (a)  taking evidence of the identity of the deceased person and of the place and date of his or her death;

                     (b)  furnishing information to the appropriate authority of the State or Territory concerned for the purpose of registration of the death; or

                     (c)  authorizing the burial, cremation or other disposal of the body of the deceased person.

             (4)  Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this section, the Attorney‑General may notify the appropriate authority of the State or Territory concerned that there are no circumstances connected with the operation of this Act that make it undesirable that an inquest into the manner and cause of a specified death should be held or continued, as the case may be, and, if the Attorney‑General gives such a notification, the inquest may be held or resumed, as the case requires, and in the case of resumption proceed as if it were commenced for the first time.

             (5)  Where an inquest is held or resumed as provided by the last preceding subsection, it is not obligatory that the coroner shall view the body of the deceased person.

             (6)  A law in force in any part of Australia that imposes restrictions upon the removal out of Australia, or a part of Australia, of the body of a deceased person does not apply to or in relation to the body of a deceased person who at the time of his or her death had a relevant association with a visiting force, and the body of such a deceased person may be disposed of as the Attorney‑General, having regard to any request by the designated authority of the country concerned, determines.

             (7)  In this section, the expression **_homicide_** includes murder, manslaughter and infanticide and any other offence under the law of the country concerned that is substantially similar to any of those offences.

##### <a id="15"></a>15  Imprisonment etc. of persons sentenced by service tribunals

             (1)  Where the designated authority of a country in relation to which this section applies requests the Attorney‑General that assistance be given in carrying out a sentence of imprisonment or detention imposed upon a person by a service tribunal of that country, the Attorney‑General may, by writing under his or her hand, authorize the reception of a person so sentenced, and his or her confinement for the whole or any part of the term of his or her sentence, in a prison or other place in Australia provided for the confinement of persons accused or convicted of offences against the laws of Australia or of a State or Territory.

             (2)  A person held in custody or under restraint or kept in confinement for the purpose of giving effect to an authority given under the last preceding subsection shall be deemed to be in lawful custody.

             (3)  The regulations may make provision with respect to the circumstances under which the persons imprisoned or detained as provided by this section may be discharged or returned to the service authorities of the country under the service law of which they were sentenced.

##### <a id="16"></a>16  Application to visiting forces of law relating to Defence Force

             (1)  Where, under an enactment, a power is exercisable by an authority or person with respect to:

                     (a)  the Defence Force, a part of that Force, members of that Force or of a part of that Force or other persons connected in any way with that Force or a part of that Force;

                    (aa)  service tribunals, within the meaning of the _Defence Force Discipline Act 1982_;

                   (ab)  a court of inquiry or a board of inquiry appointed under regulations under the _Defence Act 1903_;

                     (b)  any property used or to be used for the purposes of that Force or a part of that Force; or

                     (c)  taking possession of any property to be so used, or acquiring (whether by agreement or compulsorily) any property so used or to be so used;

the regulations may provide that that power shall, subject to such conditions (if any) as are prescribed, be exercisable by that authority or person with respect to a visiting force, its service tribunals, persons connected with the visiting force or property used or to be used by the visiting force to any extent to which the power would be exercisable if the visiting force were a part of the Defence Force.
