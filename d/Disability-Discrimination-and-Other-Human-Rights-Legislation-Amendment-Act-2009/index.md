##### <a id="5"></a>5  Direct disability discrimination

             (1)  For the purposes of this Act, a person (the **_discriminator_**) **_discriminates_** against another person (the **_aggrieved person_**) on the ground of a disability of the aggrieved person if, because of the disability, the discriminator treats, or proposes to treat, the aggrieved person less favourably than the discriminator would treat a person without the disability in circumstances that are not materially different.

             (2)  For the purposes of this Act, a person (the **_discriminator_**) also **_discriminates_** against another person (the **_aggrieved person_**) on the ground of a disability of the aggrieved person if:

                     (a)  the discriminator does not make, or proposes not to make, reasonable adjustments for the person; and

                     (b)  the failure to make the reasonable adjustments has, or would have, the effect that the aggrieved person is, because of the disability, treated less favourably than a person without the disability would be treated in circumstances that are not materially different.

             (3)  For the purposes of this section, circumstances are not **_materially different_** because of the fact that, because of the disability, the aggrieved person requires adjustments.

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Indirect disability discrimination

             (1)  For the purposes of this Act, a person (the **_discriminator_**) **_discriminates_** against another person (the **_aggrieved person_**) on the ground of a disability of the aggrieved person if:

                     (a)  the discriminator requires, or proposes to require, the aggrieved person to comply with a requirement or condition; and

                     (b)  because of the disability, the aggrieved person does not or would not comply, or is not able or would not be able to comply, with the requirement or condition; and

                     (c)  the requirement or condition has, or is likely to have, the effect of disadvantaging persons with the disability.

             (2)  For the purposes of this Act, a person (the **_discriminator_**) also **_discriminates_** against another person (the **_aggrieved person_**) on the ground of a disability of the aggrieved person if:

                     (a)  the discriminator requires, or proposes to require, the aggrieved person to comply with a requirement or condition; and

                     (b)  because of the disability, the aggrieved person would comply, or would be able to comply, with the requirement or condition only if the discriminator made reasonable adjustments for the person, but the discriminator does not do so or proposes not to do so; and

                     (c)  the failure to make reasonable adjustments has, or is likely to have, the effect of disadvantaging persons with the disability.

             (3)  Subsection (1) or (2) does not apply if the requirement or condition is reasonable, having regard to the circumstances of the case.

             (4)  For the purposes of subsection (3), the burden of proving that the requirement or condition is reasonable, having regard to the circumstances of the case, lies on the person who requires, or proposes to require, the person with the disability to comply with the requirement or condition.

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Discrimination in relation to associates

             (1)  This Act applies in relation to a person who has an associate with a disability in the same way as it applies in relation to a person with the disability.

Example:    It is unlawful, under section 15, for an employer to discriminate against an employee on the ground of a disability of any of the employee’s associates.

             (2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), but without limiting that subsection, this Act has effect in relation to a person who has an associate with a disability as if:

                     (a)  each reference to something being done or needed because of a disability were a reference to the thing being done or needed because of the fact that the person has an associate with the disability; and

                     (b)  each other reference to a disability were a reference to the disability of the associate.

             (3)  This section does not apply to section 53 or 54 (combat duties and peacekeeping services) or subsection 54A(2) or (3) (assistance animals).

Note:          The combined effect of sections 7 and 8 is that this Act applies in relation to a person who has an associate who has a carer, assistant, assistance animal or disability aid in the same way as it applies in relation to a person with a disability.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Discrimination in relation to carers, assistants, assistance animals and disability aids

             (1)  This Act applies in relation to having a carer, assistant, assistance animal or disability aid in the same way as it applies in relation to having a disability.

Example:    For the purposes of section 5 (direct discrimination), circumstances are not materially different because of the fact that a person with a disability requires adjustments for the person’s carer, assistant, assistance animal or disability aid (see subsection 5(3)).

             (2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), but without limiting that subsection, this Act has effect in relation to a person with a disability who has a carer, assistant, assistance animal or disability aid as if:

                     (a)  each reference to something being done or needed because of a disability were a reference to the thing being done or needed because of the fact that the person has the carer, assistant, animal or aid; and

                     (b)  each other reference to a disability were a reference to the carer, assistant, animal or aid.

             (3)  This section does not apply to section 48 (infectious diseases) or section 54A (exemptions in relation to assistance animals).

Note:          The combined effect of sections 7 and 8 is that this Act applies in relation to a person who has an associate who has a carer, assistant, assistance animal or disability aid in the same way as it applies in relation to a person with a disability.

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Carer, assistant, assistance animal and disability aid definitions

Meanings of **carer or assistant**, **assistance animal** and **disability aid**

             (1)  For the purposes of this Act, a **_carer or assistant_**, in relation to a person with a disability, is one of the following who provides assistance or services to the person because of the disability:

                     (b)  an assistant;

                     (c)  an interpreter;

                     (d)  a reader.

             (2)  For the purposes of this Act, an **_assistance animal_** is a dog or other animal:

                     (a)  accredited under a law of a State or Territory that provides for the accreditation of animals trained to assist a persons with a disability to alleviate the effect of the disability; or

                     (b)  accredited by an animal training organisation prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph; or

                     (c)  trained:

                              (i)  to assist a person with a disability to alleviate the effect of the disability; and

                             (ii)  to meet standards of hygiene and behaviour that are appropriate for an animal in a public place.

Note:          For exemptions from Part 2 for discrimination in relation to assistance animals, see section 54A.

             (3)  For the purposes of this Act, a **_disability aid_**, in relation to a person with a disability, is equipment (including a palliative or therapeutic device) that:

##### <a id="21A"></a>21A  Exception—inherent requirements

Inherent requirements

             (1)  This Division does not render it unlawful for a person (the **_discriminator_**) to discriminate against another person (the **_aggrieved person_**) on the ground of a disability of the aggrieved person if:

                     (a)  the discrimination relates to particular work (including promotion or transfer to particular work); and

                     (b)  because of the disability, the aggrieved person would be unable to carry out the inherent requirements of the particular work, even if the relevant employer, principal or partnership made reasonable adjustments for the aggrieved person.

             (2)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), the following factors are to be taken into account in determining whether the aggrieved person would be able to carry out the inherent requirements of the particular work:

                     (a)  the aggrieved person’s past training, qualifications and experience relevant to the particular work;

                     (b)  if the aggrieved person already works for the discriminator—the aggrieved person’s performance in working for the discriminator;

                     (e)  both of the following apply:

                              (i)  the other person is an authority or body that is empowered to confer, renew, extend, revoke or withdraw an authorisation or qualification that is needed for or facilitates the practice of a profession, the carrying on of a trade or the engaging in of an occupation;

                             (ii)  the aggrieved person is a member of that profession, carrying on that trade or engaged in that occupation.

##### <a id="29A"></a>29A  Unjustifiable hardship

                   This Division (other than section 30) does not render it unlawful for a person (the **_discriminator_**) to discriminate against another person on the ground of a disability of the other person if avoiding the discrimination would impose an unjustifiable hardship on the discriminator.

##### <a id="30"></a>30  Requests for information

             (1)  This section applies in relation to a person (the **_first person_**) if, under Division 1 or this Division, it would be unlawful for the first person, in doing a particular act, to discriminate against another person on the ground of a disability of the other person.

             (2)  It is unlawful for the first person to request or require the other person to provide information (whether by completing a form or otherwise) if:

                     (a)  the first person requests or requires the information in connection with, or for the purposes of, doing the act referred to in subsection (1); and

                     (b)  either or both of the following applies:

                              (i)  persons who do not have the disability would not be requested or required to provide the information in circumstances that are not materially different;

                             (ii)  the information relates to the disability.

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not apply if:

                     (a)  evidence is produced to the effect that none of the purposes for which the first person requested or required the information was the purpose of unlawfully discriminating against the other person on the ground of the disability; and

                     (b)  the evidence is not rebutted.

Example:    An employer may not require a prospective employee to provide genetic information if the employer intends to use that information to unlawfully discriminate against the employee on the ground of a disability of the employee.

                   However, the employer may require such information in order to determine if the prospective employee would be able to carry out the inherent requirements of the employment or to determine what reasonable adjustments to make for the employee.

             (4)  This section has effect subject to subsection 54A(5) (evidence that an animal is an assistance animal).
