                     (a)  data about persons may be transferred between agencies; and

                     (b)  data about persons may be matched or otherwise dealt with by the matching agency or the tax agency; and

             (2)  There are to be no more than 9 data matching cycles in any one year.

             (3)  Only one data matching cycle is to be in progress at any one time.

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Steps in data matching cycle

                   The steps in a data matching cycle are as follows:

**STEP 1**

              1.  The assistance agencies give the matching agency the basic data about persons that is held by those agencies for the purposes of personal assistance.

              2.  The matching agency checks the validity of the TFN data given under paragraph 1 by using any algorithm given to it for the purposes of this Act by the tax agency.

              4.  Where the check identifies TFN data that appears to be incorrect, the matching agency gives particulars of the data to the source agency that gave it.

**STEP 2**

              5.  The matching agency extracts from data given to it in Step 1 the TFN data, and any identification numbers for the purposes of personal assistance, of assisted persons.

              6.  The matching agency gives the tax agency the data extracted under paragraph 5.

**STEP 3**

              7.  The tax agency uses tax data from not more than the 4 financial years immediately before the current financial year and data given to it under Step 2 to find out the following available data in respect of each person who has a tax file number:

                     (a)  tax file number;

                     (b)  personal identity data;

                     (c)  declared income;

                    (ca)  the date of the most recent assessment under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ of the person’s declared income;

                    (cb)  the amount of spouse rebate;

                     (d)  surname and any other name or initial of any other name of a spouse in respect of whom spouse rebate is claimed;

                     (e)  surname and any other name or initial of any other name of any spouse of the person.

              8.  The tax agency gives the matching agency the data found out under paragraph 7 and any identification numbers for the purposes of personal assistance of the person.

            8A.  If the tax agency gives the matching agency tax file numbers under paragraph 8, the tax agency may indicate to the matching agency which, if any, of those tax file numbers, according to the tax agency’s records, may have become known to, or used by, a person not authorised to know or use that tax file number.

**STEP 4**

              9.  The matching agency carries out identity matching by matching the personal identity data given under paragraph 8 with the family identity data given to it.

             11.  Where there is an unresolved discrepancy in data given to the matching agency by a source agency, the matching agency gives the source agency particulars of the discrepancy.

**STEP 5**

             12.  The matching agency carries out payment matching by matching the following data given by assistance agencies in Step 1:

                     (a)  family identity data; and

                     (b)  if it is necessary to do so—personal assistance data;

to find out:

                     (c)  if personal assistance is being, or has been, given to, or is being claimed by, persons who might not be, or might not have been, entitled to it; and

                     (d)  if personal assistance is not being, or has not been, given to, or claimed by, persons who might be, or might have been, entitled to it.

             13.  Where the matching of family identity data given by assistance agencies in Step 1 cannot identify a person for the purposes of paragraph 12, the matching agency matches TFN data given to it in Step 1 with the data being matched under that paragraph.

             14.  The matching agency carries out income matching of persons by using any identification number for the purposes of personal assistance of a person to match:

                     (a)  income data of the person given to it by assistance agencies; and

                     (b)  except where the matching agency has, under paragraph 11, given particulars of a discrepancy in data about the person to a source agency, the tax income data of the person given to the matching agency in earlier steps;

to find out if there are any inconsistencies in the income data of the person.

          14A.  If the source agency and the matching agency have agreed that this paragraph applies, the following subparagraphs apply:

                     (a)  if the matching agency thinks that any results of a payment or income matching appear to be results to which paragraph 15 applies, the matching agency gives a sample to the source agency;

                     (b)  the source agency tests the sample;

                     (c)  if the source agency thinks the sample may be wrong, and that the error may be corrected by adjusting an algorithm used by the matching agency, the source agency suggests the adjustment;

                     (d)  the matching agency makes the adjustment and repeats the relevant parts of the matching;

                     (e)  subject to section 9, these subparagraphs apply as often as necessary until the matching is complete;

                      (f)  if the source agency is an assistance agency, information exchanged under this paragraph may include the return of TFN data from the matching agency to the source agency;

                     (g)  the source agency must destroy the sample as soon as practicable after the matching is complete.

**STEP 6**

             15.  The matching agency gives to each source agency the results of matching under earlier steps that are of concern to that other agency and have not been given to the other agency in an earlier step, being results that indicate:

                     (a)  in the case of an assistance agency:

                              (i)  that personal assistance is being, or has been, given to, or is being claimed by, persons who might not be, or might not have been, entitled to it; and

                             (ii)  that personal assistance is not being, or has not been, given to, or claimed by, persons who might be, or might have been, entitled to it; or

                     (b)  in the case of the tax agency—that a person might be evading, or might have evaded, tax.

             16.  Information exchanged in paragraph 15 may include the return of TFN data from the matching agency to an assistance agency.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Data may be sent on-line

                   Data may be transferred between agencies in the data matching program by on-line computer connections.

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Length of data matching cycle

             (1)  A data matching cycle is to be completed no later than 2 months after it began.

             (2)  Step 5 in a data matching cycle is to be completed no later than 7 days after it began.

          (2A)  The following times do not count for the purposes of subsection (2):

                     (a)  any time during which the cycle is interrupted by a computer malfunction;

                     (b)  any time during which the cycle is interrupted by industrial action.

             (3)  Step 6 in a data matching cycle is to be completed within 7 days after the completion of Step 5.

##### <a id="10"></a>10  Source agencies may use results of data program

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2) and section 11, a source agency may take action on the basis of information received by it under Step 1, 4 or 6 of a data matching cycle to:

                     (a)  in the case of an assistance agency:

# Schedule—Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Guidelines

_Section 12_

##### Scope of Operation

              1.  These Guidelines apply to, and only to, the matching program referred to in the _Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990_ (**_the Act_**).

##### Definitions

             2.1  Any term used in these Guidelines has:

                              (i)  where it is defined in the Act, that meaning; or

                             (ii)  where it is not defined in the Act but is defined in the _Privacy Act 1988_, that meaning.

             2.2  In addition the following terms used in these Guidelines have the following meanings:

                     (a)  **_Program_** refers to the data matching program as defined in the Act.

                     (b)  **_Discrepancy_** refers to a result of the program which warrants further action by any relevant data agency for the purposes of giving effect to the program.

                     (c)  **_action_** refers to the actions set out in section 10 of the Act

##### Basis of Program

             3.1  A program protocol must be prepared by the matching agency in consultation with the source agencies before 1 April 1991 and must:

                              (i)  identify the matching agency and the source agencies;

                             (ii)  in the case of each data agency, set out the legal basis for any collection, use or disclosure of personal information involved in the program;

                            (iii)  outline the objectives of the program, the procedures to be employed, the nature and frequency of the matching covered by the program, and the justifications for the program;

                            (iv)  explain what methods other than data-matching were available and why they were rejected;

                             (v)  detail any cost/benefit analysis or other measures of effectiveness which were taken into account in deciding to initiate the program;

                            (vi)  outline the technical controls proposed to ensure data quality, integrity and security in the conduct of the program;

                           (vii)  provide an explanation for any use of identification numbers and, in particular, the tax file numbers;

                           (viii)  outline the nature of the action proposed to be taken in relation to the results of the program including the pro formas of any letters to be used by source agencies when providing notice under section 11 of the Act;

                            (ix)  indicate what form of notice, if any, of the proposed activities in relation to their personal information has been given or is intended to be given to affected individuals; and

                             (x)  specify any time-limits on the conduct of the program.

The Program Protocol must be filed with the Privacy Commissioner and available for public inspection unless the Privacy Commissioner is satisfied that to do so would be or would be likely to be contrary to the public interest (e.g. by prejudicing the integrity of legitimate investigative methods).

             3.2  Agencies must comply with the Program Protocol.

             3.3  Source agencies must take all reasonable steps to ensure that their clients are informed that a Program Protocol which outlines the nature and purposes of the data matching program is available from the Privacy Commissioner.

##### Technical Standards in relation to data quality, integrity and security

             4.1  _Technical Standards Report_: Detailed technical standards must be established by the matching agency to govern the conduct of the program. They should deal with the following matters:

                              (i)  integrity of data supplied by source agencies, referring in particular to: key terms and their definition; relevance, timeliness and completeness;

                             (ii)  matching techniques, referring in particular to: the matching algorithm, any use of identification numbers especially tax file numbers, the nature of the matters being sought to be identified by the matching process, the relevant data definitions and the procedure for recognising matches;

                            (iii)  controls being employed to ensure the continued integrity of the program including the procedures that have been established to confirm the validity of matching results;

                            (iv)  security features included within the program to minimise and audit access to personal information.

             4.2  These matters should be dealt with in a Technical Standards Report to be held by the matching agency and copies held by the source agencies. A draft Report must be finalised before 1 April 1991 and the final report before 1 July 1991, taking account of  initial experience of the operation of the program. Any subsequent variations to the technical standards should be the subject of a Variation Report appended to the original Report.

             4.3  The Privacy Commissioner has the power to require that the content of the draft and final Technical Standards Reports be varied. Non-compliance with the variations will be taken as a breach of the Guidelines and be subject to investigation in accordance with section 13 of the Act.

             4.4  Agencies must comply with the Technical Standards Report.

##### Safeguards for individuals affected by the results of programs

Fairness

             5.1  The source agencies must establish reasonable procedures for confirming the validity of results before relying on them as a basis for administrative action against an individual, unless there are reasonable grounds to believe that such results are not likely to be in error. In forming that view, regard is to be had to the consistency in content and context of data being matched.

             5.2  Where such confirmation procedures do not take the form of checking the results against the source data but instead involve direct communication with the affected individual, the source agency shall notify the affected individual that no check has been made against the records which formed the basis for the data supplied for the program. The notification must include (either in the letter or by way of an attachment) an explanation of the procedures that are involved in the examination of a discrepancy as well as the rights of complaint under the _Privacy Act 1988_.

             5.3  If there is a dispute as to the accuracy of the data or the propsed action which the source agency does not concede, it must inform the individual of the rights of complaint conferred by the _Privacy Act 1988_. Any further action taken by the agency must, unless otherwise provided by law, not interfere with an individual’s opportunity to exercise any rights of appeal or review.

             5.4  Wherever data supplied by a person prior to 1 January 1991, is to be used, or is likely to be used, in a data matching program, the person who has supplied the data shall be notified in writing either before the data is first used or as soon as practicable thereafter that the data is likely to be used for this purpose.

##### Record Controls

             6.1  _No Discrepancy_: Personal information used in a matching cycle that does not lead to a discrepancy must be destroyed by the matching agency as soon as is practicable after the beginning of Step 5 in the cycle. In any case, destruction of the information must not occur later than 24 hours after the beginning of Step 5 of the cycle unless additional time is required because of a computer malfunction or industrial action.

             6.2  _Discrepancy_: In cases where a discrepancy occurs as a result of Steps 1, 4 and 5 in a data matching cycle, the results must be supplied to the relevant source agency within 7 days of completion of the relevant step. Source agencies must deal with the results in accordance with section 10 of the Act. If, during the period referred to in that section or at any later time, a decision not to take further action is made, wherever practicable the information must be destroyed within 14 days.

             6.3  On final completion of the action commenced in accordance with section 10(1) of the Act, all information which gave rise to such action is to be destroyed.

For the purposes of this guideline **_final completion of the action_** means:

                      (i)  in the situation where, at the expiration of twelve months from the commencement of action in accordance with section 10(1), the case is under the control of the Australian Federal Police and is proceeding to the satisfaction of the source agency—when all investigation action, legal proceedings and repayment of debts due to the Commonwealth is finalised;

                      (ii)  in the situation where, at the expiration of twelve months from the commencement of action in accordance with section 10(1), the case is under the control of the Director of Public Prosecutions and is proceeding to the satisfaction of the source agency—when all legal proceedings and repayment of debts due to the Commonwealth are finalised;

                     (iii)  in the situation where, at the expiration of twelve months from the commencement of action in accordance with section 10(1), a debt due to the Commonwealth remains outstanding and action is being taken to recover it—when the debt is fully recovered, waived or written off; and

                     (iv)  in all other situations, within twelve months from the date of commencement of action in accordance with section 10(1).

##### No New Databank

             7.1  Subject to paragraph 7.2 below, source agencies must not permit the information used in the program to be linked or merged in such a way that a new separate permanent register (or databank) of information is created about any, or all of the individuals whose information has been subject to the program.

             7.2  Paragraph 7.1 does not prevent a source agency from maintaining a register of individuals in respect of whom further inquiries are warranted following the decision required by section 10 of the Act.

             7.3  After the completion of action in relation to an individual that is taken in accordance with clause 10, the source agency must delete any information that relates to that action from any register of the type described in paragraph 7.2.

##### Reports and Monitoring by the Privacy Commissioner

              8.  The Privacy Commissioner is to be responsible for monitoring the compliance with these Guidelines and giving advice to the relevant matching and source agencies as to their responsibilities under the Guidelines.

              9.  The matching and source agencies must report to the Privacy Commissioner on a periodic basis as agreed with the Privacy Commissioner. The Commissioner may require an agency to report on any relevant matter, including any of the following matters:

                      (i)  actual costs and benefits flowing from the program;

                      (ii)  any non-financial factors that are considered relevant;

                     (iii)  difficulties in the operation of the program and how these have been overcome;

                     (iv)  the extent to which internal audits or other forms of assessment have been undertaken by agencies and their outcome;

                     (v)  examples of circumstances in which the giving of notice under section 11 would prejudice the effectiveness of an investigation into the possible Commission of an offence; and

                     (vi)  such other matters as: the total number of matches undertaken, the proportion of matches that result in discrepancies, the number of discrepancies, proportion of discrepancies which resulted in action being taken, the number of instances of subsequent action being taken, the number of cases in which action proceeded despite a challenge as to the accuracy of the data, the proportion of discrepancies which did not proceed to action after the individual was contacted; and the number of cases where successful recovery action occurred.

           10.1  The Privacy Commissioner must include in his annual report an assessment of the extent of the program’s compliance with the Act, these Guidelines and the _Privacy Act 1988_; and to that end, may exercise any of the powers as to investigation and audit contained in the _Privacy Act 1988_.

           10.2  Agencies must report their data matching activities under this Act in their annual entry for the Personal Information Digest of the Privacy Commissioner.

             11.  These Guidelines are additional to provisions of the _Privacy Act 1988_ including the Information Privacy Principles.

             12.  The matching agency and each source agency must table a comprehensive report in both Houses of Parliament six months after the commencement of the first data matching cycle. These reports are to include all of the following details:

                      (i)  actual cost and benefits flowing from the program;

                      (ii)  any non-financial factors that are considered relevant;

                     (iii)  difficulties in the operation of the program and how these have been overcome;

                     (iv)  the extent to which internal audits or other forms of assessment have been undertaken by agencies and their outcome; and

                     (v)  such other matters as: the total number of matches undertaken, the proportion of matches that result in discrepancies, the number of discrepancies, the proportion of discrepancies which resulted in action being taken, the number of instances of subsequent action being taken, the number of cases in which action proceeded despite a challenge as to the accuracy of the data, the proportion of discrepancies which did not proceed to action after the individual was contacted; and the number of cases where successful recovery action occurred.

_Paid Parental Leave (Consequential Amendments) Act 2010 
 (No. 105, 2010)_

The following provisions commence 1 October 2010:

## Schedule 2

## 1  Employer determination made where expected or actual date of birth is before 1 July 2011

(1)        The _Paid Parental Leave Act 2010_ applies, with the modifications set out in this item, in relation to a person who has made a claim for parental leave pay for a child, if:

                     (a)  for a claim made before the day the child is born—the expected date of birth of the child is before 1 July 2011; or

                     (b)  for a claim made after the child is born—the day the child is born is before 1 July 2011.

_Note:       For a claim made before the day the child is born, see subitem (9) if the expected date of birth of the child is before 1 July 2011, but the child is born on or after that date._

(2)        Section 101 of that Act (and the other provisions of that Act so far as they relate to that section) applies in relation to the person as if subsections (1) and (2) of that section were omitted and the following subsection substituted:

             (1)  The Secretary must make a determination under this section (the **_employer determination_**) that a person’s employer is to pay the person instalments if the Secretary is satisfied, when making the determination, that:

                     (a)  a payability determination that parental leave pay is payable to the person, or an initial eligibility determination for the person, is in force; and

                     (b)  the employer has made an election under section 109 that applies to the person; and

                     (c)  the person has consented in the claim to the employer paying instalments to the person; and

                     (d)  the person is likely to be an Australian-based employee of the employer during whichever of the following periods applies:

                              (i)  if the Secretary has made a payability determination that parental leave pay is payable to the person—the person’s PPL period;

                             (ii)  otherwise—the period of days for which instalments are likely, if the determination is made, to be payable to the person by the employer; and

                     (e)  the employer has an ABN; and

                      (f)  if paragraphs (b) to (e) are satisfied in relation to more than one employer of the person—the person nominated the employer in the claim as the employer who would be required to pay instalments to the person.

(3)        For the purposes of this item, an employer determination made under subsection 101(1), as that subsection applies because of subitem (2) of this item, is a **_transitional employer determination_**.

(4)        The following provisions of that Act do not apply in relation to a transitional employer determination:

                     (a)  section 103 (which deals with responding to a notice of an employer determination);

                     (b)  subsection 107(2) (which deals with when an employer determination comes into force);

                     (c)  subsections 207(3) and 224(1) (which deal with applying for review of employer determination decisions).

(5)        Within 14 days after the date of the notice given under section 102 of that Act in relation to the transitional employer determination, the employer may give the Secretary a written notice (the **_acceptance notice_**) that complies with section 104 of that Act.

(6)        If the employer gives the acceptance notice to the Secretary within that 14 day period, the transitional employer determination comes into force on the day the Secretary receives the acceptance notice.

(7)        If the employer does not give the acceptance notice to the Secretary within that 14 day period, the following paragraphs have effect:

                     (a)  the Secretary must revoke the transitional employer determination;

                     (b)  the revocation comes into force on the day of the revocation;

                     (c)  to avoid doubt, subsection 108(5) of that Act (which deals with giving notice of the revocation) applies in relation to the revocation.

(8)        The Secretary may extend the 14 day period referred to in subitem (5) in relation to an employer. If the Secretary does so, subitems (6) and (7) have effect accordingly.

(9)        Despite paragraph (1)(a) and subitem (2) of this item, if the person’s child is born on or after 1 July 2011, then the following paragraphs have effect:

                     (a)  the Secretary may make an employer determination for the person and the person’s employer under section 101 of the _Paid Parental Leave Act 2010_, as that section applies apart from this item;

                     (b)  if the Secretary does so and has previously made a transitional employer determination for the person and the employer, the Secretary is taken never to have made the transitional employer determination.

(10)      The following provisions of the _Paid Parental Leave Act 2010_, apply in relation to this item as if it were a provision of that Act:

                     (a)  section 275 (which deals with how that Act applies to an adopted child);

                     (b)  section 276 (which deals with how that Act applies to claims made in exceptional circumstances).

## 2  Employer determination made where expected date of birth is on or after 1 July 2011 but child born before that date

(1)        This item applies if:

                     (a)  the Secretary makes an employer determination for an employer and a person under the _Paid Parental Leave Act 2010_; and

                     (b)  the person’s claim is made before the day the child is born; and

                     (c)  the expected date of birth of the child is on or after 1 July 2011; and

                     (d)  the child is born before 1 July 2011; and

                     (e)  the person’s employer has not made an election under section 109 of that Act that applies to the person.

(2)        If, after the employer determination is made, the Secretary makes a payability determination that parental leave pay is payable to the person for the child, the notice given to the employer under section 113 of that Act must:

                     (a)  state the day the child was born; and

                     (b)  be dated as at the date the preparation of the notice was completed; and

                     (c)  contain a statement to the effect that the employer determination will be revoked, unless the employer:

                              (i)  agrees to being required to pay instalments to the person, even though the child was born before 1 July 2011; and

                             (ii)  gives the Secretary a written notice indicating that agreement within 14 days of the date referred to in paragraph (b).

(3)        If the employer does not give the notice referred to in subparagraph (2)(c)(ii) to the Secretary within that 14 day period, the following paragraphs have effect:

                     (a)  the Secretary must revoke the employer determination;

                     (b)  the revocation comes into force on the day of the revocation;

                     (c)  to avoid doubt, subsection 108(5) of that Act (which deals with giving notice of the revocation) applies in relation to the revocation;

                     (d)  section 103 of that Act (which deals with responding to a notice of an employer determination) is taken to have never applied in relation to the employer determination.

(4)        The following provisions of that Act  apply in relation to this item as if it were a provision of that Act:

                     (a)  section 275 (which deals with how that Act applies to an adopted child);

                     (b)  section 276 (which deals with how that Act applies to claims made in exceptional circumstances).
