                     (a)  the financial capacity of local governing bodies; and

                     (b)  the capacity of local governing bodies to provide their residents with an equitable level of services; and

                     (c)  the certainty of funding for local governing bodies; and

                     (d)  the efficiency and effectiveness of local governing bodies; and

                     (e)  the provision by local governing bodies of services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.

             (3)  The financial assistance is to be provided by the making to the States, for local government purposes, of general grants under section 9 and additional funding under section 12.

             (4)  In providing this financial assistance the Parliament’s goals are to:

                     (a)  increase the transparency and accountability of the States in respect of the allocation of funds under this Act to local governing bodies; and

                     (b)  promote consistency in the methods by which grants are allocated to achieve equitable levels of services by local governing bodies.

             (5)  To achieve those goals this Act provides for:

                     (a)  the formulation of national principles for the purposes of the allocation of funds by the States to local governing bodies (section 6); and

                     (b)  the making of an annual report to the Parliament about the operation of this Act (subsection 16(1)); and

##### <a id="6"></a>6  National principles governing allocation by States among local governing bodies

             (1)  The Minister, after consulting the relevant State Ministers and with a body or bodies representative of local government, must formulate, in writing, national principles for the purpose of allocating among local governing bodies amounts payable to States (other than the Australian Capital Territory) under this Act in the year beginning on 1 July 1996 and later years.

             (2)  In formulating national principles, the Minister:

                     (a)  is to have regard to the need to ensure that the allocation of funds for local government purposes under section 9 is made, as far as practicable, on a full horizontal equalisation basis; but

                     (b)  must ensure that no local governing body in a State will be allocated an amount under section 9 in a year that is less than the amount that would be allocated to the body if 30% of the amount to which the State is entitled under that section in respect of the year were allocated among local governing bodies in the State on a per capita basis.

             (3)  The reference in paragraph (2)(a) to the allocation of funds for local government purposes on a full horizontal equalisation basis is a reference to an allocation of funds that:

                     (a)  ensures that each local governing body in a State is able to function, by reasonable effort, at a standard not lower than the average standard of other local governing bodies in the State; and

                     (b)  takes account of differences in the expenditure required to be incurred by local governing bodies in the performance of their functions and in their capacity to raise revenue.

             (4)  The Minister may, after consulting with relevant State Ministers and with a body or bodies representative of local government, in writing, revoke or vary any principles formulated under subsection (1).

             (5)  The Minister must cause to be given to the relevant State Minister of each State other than the Australian Capital Territory and to a body or bodies representative of local government a copy of any instrument formulating principles under subsection (1) and a copy of any instrument under subsection (4) revoking or varying any of those principles.

             (6)  National principles formulated under subsection (1), and revocations or variations of national principles under subsection (4), are disallowable instruments for the purposes of section 46A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

             (7)  If there are no national principals in force under this section, paragraph 11(2)(d) is to be read as requiring the Commission to make the recommendations on the same basis as the basis on which the Minister is, under subsection (2) of this section, required to act in formulating national principles (see paragraphs (2)(a) and (b)).

             (8)  For the purposes of this section, any possibility of a reduction in the amount allocated to any local governing body in complying with the condition in paragraph 15(aa) is to be disregarded.

             (5)  In addition to any other conditions to which a payment under this Act is subject, payment of an amount to a State under this Act is subject to the condition that if the final grant amount for the State in respect of a year is less than the preliminary grant amount for the State in respect of the year, the State will pay to the Commonwealth an amount equal to the difference.

             (6)  If an amount is payable to a State under subsection (4) in respect of a year, the amount is to be paid to the State in the following year by equal quarterly instalments at the times when instalments to which the State is entitled under section 9 in respect of the following year are paid.

             (7)  If a State is liable to pay an amount to the Commonwealth under subsection (5) in respect of a year, one-quarter of the amount is to be deducted from each quarterly instalment that, apart from this subsection, would be payable to the State under section 9 in respect of the following year.

##### <a id="13"></a>13  Adjustment of estimates—section 12 payments

             (1)  This section applies to a State in respect of a year (the **_current year_**) if the amount worked out under section 12 (the **_preliminary additional grant amount_**) in relation to the State in respect of the current year is greater or less than the amount (the **_final additional grant amount_**) worked out in relation to the State in respect of the current year using the formula:

                   where:

                    <a name="addition-previou-year-fund-amount"></a>**_Additional previous year funding amount_** means the additional previous year funding amount in relation to the State for the current year.

                    <a name="final-factor"></a>**_Final factor_** means the final factor for the current year.

Note:          For **_additional previous year funding amount_** and **_final factor_** see subsection 4(2).

             (3)  In addition to any other conditions to which a payment under this Act is subject, payment of an amount to a State under this Act is subject to the condition that, if the final additional grant amount for the State in respect of a year is less than the preliminary additional grant amount for the State in respect of the year, the State will pay to the Commonwealth an amount equal to the difference.

             (4)  If an amount is payable to a State under subsection (2) in respect of a year, the amount is to be paid to the State in the following year by equal quarterly instalments at the times when instalments to which the State is entitled under section 12 in respect of that following year are paid.

             (5)  If a State is liable to pay an amount to the Commonwealth under subsection (3), one-quarter of the amount is to be deducted from each quarterly instalment that, apart from this subsection, would be payable to the State under section 12 in respect of the following year.

                             (ii)  if the year is a later year—in accordance with any relevant national principles in force under section 6 in respect of the later year that relate to expenditure on local roads by local governing bodies or, if those principles have been modified under section 26 in relation to the State in respect of the later year, in accordance with those principles as so modified; and
