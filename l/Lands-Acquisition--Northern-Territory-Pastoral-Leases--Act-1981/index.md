                     (b)  freed and discharged from all interests (other than mining interests), trusts, restrictions, dedications, reservations, obligations, contracts, licences, charges and rates;

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Notice to owner

             (1)  The Minister shall, as soon as practicable after the acquisition of the relevant land under section 5, cause a copy of a notice of acquisition of the land, in accordance with a form approved by the Minister, to be served upon each person who had a non-mining interest in the land immediately before the commencement of this Act or on 22 June 1978 (in this section referred to as an **_owner_**), or such of them as can, after diligent inquiry, be ascertained.

             (2)  Where:

                     (a)  the Minister is unable, after diligent inquiry, to ascertain the identity of an owner; or

                     (b)  service on an owner cannot be effected under subsection (1) in accordance with section 66 of the Lands Acquisition Act as applying by virtue of section 12 of this Act;

service on that owner may be effected by causing a copy of the notice of acquisition to be published in a newspaper circulating in the district in which the relevant land is situated.

             (1)  After the commencement of this Act, the Secretary to the Department  may lodge with the Registrar-General for the Northern Territory or other proper officer of the Northern Territory a copy of the notice of acquisition referred to in section 8, certified by writing signed by the Secretary.

             (2)  The officer with whom the copy of a notice of acquisition is lodged in pursuance of subsection (1) may register the acquisition in the manner as nearly as may be in which dealings with land are registered, and may deal with and give effect to the copy of the notice of acquisition as if it were a grant, conveyance, memorandum or instrument of transfer of the land to the Commonwealth duly executed under the laws in force in the Northern Territory.

##### <a id="10"></a>10  Compensation for acquisition

                   Part IV of the Lands Acquisition Act applies in relation to interests in the relevant land that have been acquired by the Commonwealth by force of this Act as if the relevant land had been acquired by compulsory process under the Lands Acquisition Act on the commencement of this Act and as if the right to compensation under section 7 of this Act were a right to compensation under section 11 of the Lands Acquisition Act.

##### <a id="11"></a>11  Mortgages over relevant land

                   Part VI of the Lands Acquisition Act applies in relation to interests in the relevant land that have been acquired by the Commonwealth by force of this Act as if the relevant land had been acquired by compulsory process under the Lands Acquisition Act on the commencement of this Act.

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Miscellaneous

                   This Act shall not be read as implying that:

                     (a)  the relevant land or an interest in the relevant land was not acquired by compulsory process under the Lands Acquisition Act so that the relevant land or interest became vested in the Commonwealth on 23 June 1978; or

##### <a id="14"></a>14  Application to Aboriginal Land Commissioner

                   For the purposes of any application in respect of the whole or any part of the land described in the Schedule that was made before the commencement of this Act to the Aboriginal Land Commissioner under subsection 50(1) of the _Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976_, that land shall be deemed to have at all times been unalienated Crown land to the intent that the Commissioner may complete his consideration of the application, and make and report his findings and make any recommendations, under that subsection as if the land had been unalienated Crown land when the application was made and had not ceased to be unalienated Crown land.
