##### <a id="10"></a>10  Bulk customers of relevant fuel industry corporations or of relevant persons

             (1)  At any time (whether or not during a period of national liquid fuel emergency), the Minister may, by instrument in writing:

                     (a)  specify guidelines to be observed in identifying persons who, or organizations which, have purchased in bulk, or who propose to purchase in bulk, a refined liquid petroleum product of a kind specified in the instrument from a relevant fuel industry corporation or from a relevant person as bulk customers of that corporation or that relevant person, as the case may be, in relation to that product;

             (2)  Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), guidelines specified under that subsection may relate to the likelihood that activities carried on by a person or organization before being identified as a bulk customer will continue to be carried on by that person or organization during the period in relation to which the identification has effect.

             (3)  The Minister may, by instrument in writing:

                     (a)  identify a person or an organization as a bulk customer of a relevant fuel industry corporation or of a relevant person in relation to a period of national liquid fuel emergency and to a particular refined liquid petroleum product; and

             (4)  The Minister shall not identify a person or an organization as a bulk customer of a particular relevant fuel industry corporation or of a particular relevant person in relation to a period of national liquid fuel emergency and to a particular refined liquid petroleum product unless the person or organization is so identified in accordance with guidelines specified under subsection (1) that are in force, in relation to that product, immediately before the person or organization is so identified.

             (5)  The Minister shall not revoke an instrument identifying a person or an organization as a bulk customer of a relevant fuel industry corporation or of a relevant person in relation to a particular period of national liquid fuel emergency and to a particular refined liquid petroleum product unless he is satisfied that the person or organization has ceased to carry on activities by reason of which the person or organization could have been identified as such a bulk customer at the time when the instrument so revoked was made.

             (6)  For the purposes of this Act, a person or an organization identified as a bulk customer of a particular relevant fuel industry corporation or of a particular relevant person in relation to a period of national liquid fuel emergency and to a particular refined liquid petroleum product shall be taken:

             (5)  An identification of a person or organization by the Energy Minister for a State or Territory as an essential user, or as a high priority user, of a particular refined liquid petroleum product in that State or Territory that would, but for this subsection, be taken to be an identification of the person for the purposes of subsection (6) shall not be taken to be an identification for those purposes if at the time of the identification, the person could have been identified under subsection (3).

             (6)  For the purposes of this Act, a person or organization identified as an essential user, or a high priority user, of a particular refined liquid petroleum product in a particular State or Territory by the Energy Minister for that State or Territory, or by the Minister, shall be taken:

                     (a)  if the person or organization was so identified at a time other than during any planning period and the identification is not revoked before the commencement of the planning period next following the identification—to be such an essential user, or such a high priority user, for the duration of that planning period; or

                     (b)  if the person or organization was so identified during a planning period—to have been such an essential user, or high priority user, during that part of the planning period that preceded the identification of the person or organization, and to be such an essential user, or high priority user, as the case requires, during the remainder of that planning period.

             (7)  Where the Minister makes a decision identifying, or refusing to identify, a person or organization seeking identification as an essential user, or as a high priority user, of a particular refined liquid petroleum product in a State or Territory as such an essential user or as such a high priority user, he shall forthwith cause notice in writing of that decision to be made available:

                     (a)  to that person or organization; and

                     (b)  to the Energy Minister for that State or Territory.

             (8)  Where the Energy Minister for a Territory other than the Northern Territory makes a decision identifying, or refusing to identify, a person seeking identification as an essential user, or as a high priority user, of a particular refined liquid petroleum product in that Territory as such an essential user or as such a high priority user, the Energy Minister for that Territory shall forthwith cause notice in writing of that decision to be made available to that person or organization.
