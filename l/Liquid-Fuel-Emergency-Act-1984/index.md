Note:       See also section 32A.

                     (b)  a warrant is in force under subsection (4) authorising the exercise of the power; or

                     (c)  subsection (6) authorises the exercise of the power.

                     (a)  authorise an authorised person to exercise the powers set out in subsection (1) of this section and section 32 in relation to the land, premises, vehicle, ship or aircraft; and

                     (a)  there is situated upon the land, or upon or in the premises, vehicle, ship or aircraft, any article or thing that may afford evidence of a contravention of a civil penalty provision or an offence against this Act; and

                     (b)  the exercise of those powers is necessary to prevent the concealment, loss or destruction of the article or thing.

             (7)  However, subsection (6) does not apply unless the powers set out in subsection (1) of this section and section 32 are exercised in circumstances of such seriousness and urgency as to require and justify the immediate exercise of those powers without the authority of a warrant issued under subsection (4) of this section.

Stopping and detaining vehicles, ships or aircraft
