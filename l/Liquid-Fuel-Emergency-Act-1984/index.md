	(5)	An identification of a person or organization by the Energy Minister for a State or Territory as an essential user, or as a high priority user, of a particular refined liquid petroleum product in that State or Territory that would, but for this subsection, be taken to be an identification of the person for the purposes of subsection (6) shall not be taken to be an identification for those purposes if at the time of the identification, the person could have been identified under subsection (3).
	(6)	For the purposes of this Act, a person or organization identified as an essential user, or a high priority user, of a particular refined liquid petroleum product in a particular State or Territory by the Energy Minister for that State or Territory, or by the Minister, shall be taken:
	(a)	if the person or organization was so identified at a time other than during any planning period and the identification is not revoked before the commencement of the planning period next following the identification—to be such an essential user, or such a high priority user, for the duration of that planning period; or
	(b)	if the person or organization was so identified during a planning period—to have been such an essential user, or high priority user, during that part of the planning period that preceded the identification of the person or organization, and to be such an essential user, or high priority user, as the case requires, during the remainder of that planning period.
