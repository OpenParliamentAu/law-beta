                              (i)  the Integrity Commissioner is investigating a corruption issue that involves, or may involve, an offence against a law of the Commonwealth or a Territory; and

Specificity of acts or omissions

             (3)  For the purposes of paragraph (2)(c), the specificity of the acts or omissions involved in committing a State offence is to be determined having regard to the circumstances in which the offence was committed (whether or not those circumstances are expressed to be elements of the offence).

                     (b)  producing a document or thing;

does not otherwise affect a claim of legal professional privilege that anyone may make in relation to that information, document or thing.

             (7)  A person does not commit an offence, and is not liable to any penalty, under the provisions of any other enactment (other than a taxation secrecy provision or a law enforcement secrecy provision) because the person gives information, or produces a document or thing, when required to do so under section 75 or 76.

##### <a id="81"></a>81  Protection of person required to give information and produce documents

             (1) A person who gives information, or produces a document or thing, to the Integrity Commissioner in response to a request under section 75 or 76 has the same protection as a witness in proceedings in the High Court.

             (2)  Subsection (3) applies if it appears to the Integrity Commissioner that, because a person:

                     (a)  is to give information, or produce a document or thing; or

                     (b)  has given information, or produced a document or thing;

to the Integrity Commissioner in response to a request under section 75 or 76, either:

                     (c)  the safety of the person or any other person may be prejudiced; or

                     (d)  the person or any other person may be subjected to intimidation or harassment.

             (3)  The Integrity Commissioner may make such arrangements as are necessary:

                     (a)  to protect the safety of any person mentioned in paragraph (2)(c); or

                             (ii)  the fair trial of a person who has been, or may be, charged with an offence; or

                     (a)  the Integrity Commissioner makes evidence available to a court under subsection (4); and

                     (b)  the court, after examining the evidence, is satisfied that the interests of justice so require;

**_corruption issue_** has the same meaning as in the _Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006_.
