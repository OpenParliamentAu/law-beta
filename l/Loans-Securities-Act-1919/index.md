##### <a id="3"></a>3  Conditions of loans

             (1)  Where under an Act the Treasurer has the authority to borrow money in accordance with the _Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act 1911_ or any Act authorising the issue of Treasury bills, the Governor-General may, in spite of anything in those Acts, in writing, authorise the Treasurer:

                     (a)  to borrow the money in amounts not exceeding, in the aggregate, such amount as the Governor-General determines;

                     (b)  to borrow the money:

                             (ii)  in such manner as the Governor-General determines; and

                            (iii)  at prices, and on terms and conditions, that are not less favourable to the Commonwealth than the prices, and the terms and conditions, determined by the Governor-General; and

                     (c)  to issue, in such form as the Governor-General determines, such stock and securities as the Governor-General determines.

             (2)  An authority under subsection (1) may, instead of determining any matter referred to in paragraph (1)(b) or (c), authorise the Treasurer to determine that matter and, in that case, the Treasurer is empowered to determine, in writing, that matter.

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Payment of principal and interest

                   The principal money secured by any Stock or security issued under this Act and the interest thereon shall be payable out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which is hereby appropriated for the purpose.
