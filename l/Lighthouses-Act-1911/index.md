		This Act may be cited as the Lighthouses Act 1911.
2  Commencement [see Note 1]
		This Act shall commence on a day to be fixed by Proclamation.
3  Interpretation
		In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears:
Authority means the Australian Maritime Safety Authority established by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Act 1990.
Marine navigational aid means:
	(a)	a lighthouse, lightship, beacon or buoy; or
	(b)	any other structure, mark, device or apparatus that is an aid to marine navigation, including a radio beacon or an electronic aid, but not including any device or apparatus used, or for use, on a ship, not being a lightship.
Ship includes every description of vessel used in navigation not ordinarily propelled by oars only.
the Safety Convention has the same meaning as in Part IV of the Navigation Act 1912.
4  Application to Territories
	(1)	This Act extends to:
	(c)	the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands;
	(d)	the Coral Sea Islands Territory; and
	(e)	any other Territory not forming part of the Commonwealth to which the Governor‑General by Proclamation declares that this Act shall extend.

Part II—Marine Navigational Aids

	(1)	The Commonwealth may enter into an agreement with a State, or with any person, for the acquisition by the Commonwealth of any marine navigational aid the property of that State or person.
	(2)	For the purposes of this Act, any marine navigational aid vested in any authority of a State shall be deemed to be the property of the State.
	(3)	The Commonwealth may purchase from any State or person any lighthouse tender, store vessel, stores or equipment or other property used by it or him in connexion with any marine navigational aid.
6  Transfer of lighthouses etc. to be valid and effectual
		Where the Governor‑General has entered into an agreement with a State, or with any person, for the acquisition by the Commonwealth of any marine navigational aid, any instrument or assurance for granting or transferring the marine navigational aid to the Commonwealth accordingly shall, by virtue of this Act, and notwithstanding anything in the law of the State, be valid and effectual to vest the marine navigational aid in the Commonwealth according to the tenor thereof.
6A  Acquisition of lighthouses by compulsory process
	(1)	Where the Commonwealth has failed to enter into an agreement with a State for the acquisition of any particular marine navigational aid the property of that State, the Commonwealth may acquire by compulsory process the marine navigational aid together with any lighthouse tender, store vessel, stores or equipment or other property used by it or him in connexion with the marine navigational aid, and so much of the land reserved dedicated set apart or used for the purpose of the marine navigational aid as the Governor‑General thinks sufficient.
	(2)	For the purposes of this section, any marine navigational aid vested in any authority of a State shall be deemed to be the property of the State.
	(3)	The provisions of the Lands Acquisition Act 1989 in relation to the acquisition of interests in land by compulsory process and to the determination of the amount of compensation payable in respect of interests so acquired shall so far as applicable apply in relation to the acquisition of any marine navigational aid under this section.

	(5)	The interest payable in pursuance of this section shall be payable as from the date of the acquisition of the marine navigational aid, and shall be paid annually or at such shorter periods as the Minister for Finance thinks fit.
	(6)	All payments to be made in pursuance of this section shall be payable out of moneys from time to time appropriated by the Parliament for the purpose.
