## Part II—Marine Navigational Aids

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Acquisition of lighthouses etc.

             (1)  The Commonwealth may enter into an agreement with a State, or with any person, for the acquisition by the Commonwealth of any marine navigational aid the property of that State or person.

             (2)  For the purposes of this Act, any marine navigational aid vested in any authority of a State shall be deemed to be the property of the State.

             (3)  The Commonwealth may purchase from any State or person any lighthouse tender, store vessel, stores or equipment or other property used by it, him or her in connexion with any marine navigational aid.

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Transfer of lighthouses etc. to be valid and effectual

                   Where the Governor-General has entered into an agreement with a State, or with any person, for the acquisition by the Commonwealth of any marine navigational aid, any instrument or assurance for granting or transferring the marine navigational aid to the Commonwealth accordingly shall, by virtue of this Act, and notwithstanding anything in the law of the State, be valid and effectual to vest the marine navigational aid in the Commonwealth according to the tenor thereof.

##### <a id="6A"></a>6A  Acquisition of lighthouses by compulsory process

             (1)  Where the Commonwealth has failed to enter into an agreement with a State for the acquisition of any particular marine navigational aid the property of that State, the Commonwealth may acquire by compulsory process the marine navigational aid together with any lighthouse tender, store vessel, stores or equipment or other property used by it or him in connexion with the marine navigational aid, and so much of the land reserved dedicated set apart or used for the purpose of the marine navigational aid as the Governor-General thinks sufficient.

             (2)  For the purposes of this section, any marine navigational aid vested in any authority of a State shall be deemed to be the property of the State.

             (3)  The provisions of the _Lands Acquisition Act 1989_ in relation to the acquisition of interests in land by compulsory process and to the determination of the amount of compensation payable in respect of interests so acquired shall so far as applicable apply in relation to the acquisition of any marine navigational aid under this section.

             (4)  The mode of compensation to the State in respect of each marine navigational aid acquired under this section shall be the payment in perpetuity of interest at the rate of three and one-half per centum per annum on the amount of compensation so determined in respect of the marine navigational aid so acquired.

             (5)  The interest payable in pursuance of this section shall be payable as from the date of the acquisition of the marine navigational aid, and shall be paid annually or at such shorter periods as the Minister for Finance thinks fit.

             (6)  All payments to be made in pursuance of this section shall be payable out of moneys from time to time appropriated by the Parliament for the purpose.

             (7)  In this section, other than subsection (1), the words **_marine navigational aid_**, include any lighthouse tender, store vessel, stores, equipment or other property, or land, acquired by the Commonwealth under subsection (1) of this section.

                   The Authority may:

                     (a)  establish and maintain lighthouses, lightships, beacons or buoys and, for the purpose of giving effect to the undertaking of the Commonwealth under Regulation 14 of Chapter V of the Safety Convention, establish and maintain other marine navigational aids;

                     (b)  add to, alter or remove any marine navigational aid the property of, or under the control of, the Authority; and

                     (c)  vary the character of any marine navigational aid the property of, or under the control of, the Authority.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Powers of inspection and maintenance

             (1)  The Authority or a person authorised in writing by the Authority may, at any reasonable time in the day or night:

                     (a)  inspect any marine navigational aid, lamp or light which, in the opinion of the Authority or authorised person, may affect the safety or convenience of navigation, whether the marine navigational aid, lamp or light is the property of a State or authority of a State or of any private person, and for that purpose may enter upon any property, whether of a public or private nature; and

                     (b)  for any purpose in connexion with the maintenance of a marine navigational aid which is the property of, or under the control of, the Authority or in connexion with the establishment of any marine navigational aid by the Authority, transport, or cause to be transported, any goods through any property whether of a public or private nature.

##### <a id="10"></a>10  Powers in relation to lights and navigational aid

             (1)  The Authority may, by notice in writing served on the owner of any marine navigational aid or of any lamp or light, if in its opinion it is desirable for the safety of navigation to do so, require the owner of the marine navigational aid, lamp or light:

                     (a)  by a date specified in the notice—to remove it entirely or to move it to another position; or

                     (b)  by a date specified in the notice—to modify it or to alter its character to such an extent and in such a manner as the Authority specifies in the notice; or

                     (c)  in the case of a lamp, with effect from a date specified in the notice—to refrain from lighting the lamp either entirely or for such a period as the Authority specifies in the notice; or

                     (d)  in the case of a light, with effect from a date specified in the notice—to cease exhibiting the light either entirely or for such a period as the Authority specifies in the notice.

             (2)  Unless exceptional circumstances relating to the safety of persons or ships require otherwise, the date specified in a notice referred to in subsection (1) must be at least one day after the service of the notice on the owner of the marine navigational aid, lamp or light concerned.

Note:          If the person who is required under subsection (1) to take action by or from a date specified in the notice does not take that action by or from that specified date, the obligation to take that action continues after that specified date, with daily offences being committed until the obligation is complied with (see section 4K of the _Crimes Act 1914_).

             (3)  If the notice is not complied with, the Authority may take possession of the marine navigational aid or of the lamp or light referred to in the notice, and may order it to be forfeited, or may do in regard to it, at the expense of the owner, anything which the owner was required by the notice to do.

             (4)  Any expense incurred by the Authority under this section may be recovered by the Authority from the owner, as a debt due by the owner to the Authority.

             (5)  A person commits an offence if the person does not comply with a notice under this section.

                    Penalty:  40 penalty units.

       (5AA)  Subsection 4K(2) of the _Crimes Act 1914_ ceases to apply in relation to an offence against subsection (5) of this section on the sixth day after the day on which the obligation to take the action first arose.

Note:          Because of this subsection, 200 penalty units is the maximum penalty that can be imposed for offences against subsection (5).

          (5A)  Subsection (5) does not apply if the person has reasonable cause.

Note:          A defendant bears a legal burden in relation to the matter in subsection (5A) (see section 13.4 of the _Criminal Code_).

          (5B)  An offence under subsection (5) is an offence of strict liability.

Note:          For **_strict liability_**, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

             (6)  In this section **_owner_** includes a State Government and any authority of a State having the control or management of any marine navigational aid or of any lamp or light:

Provided that nothing in this section shall render a State Government or any authority of a State liable to a pecuniary penalty under subsection (5).

             (7)  A notice under subsection (1) is not a legislative instrument for the purposes of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_.

##### <a id="11"></a>11  Returns of harbour light and navigational aid
