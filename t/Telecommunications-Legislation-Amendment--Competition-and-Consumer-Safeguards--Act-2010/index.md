## Part 33—Voluntary undertakings given by Telstra

### Division 1—Introduction

##### <a id="577"></a>577  Simplified outline

                   The following is a simplified outline of this Part:

* * *

•        Telstra may give the following undertakings:

               (a)     an undertaking about structural separation;

              (b)     an undertaking about hybrid fibre‑coaxial networks;

               (c)     an undertaking about subscription television broadcasting licences.

•        An undertaking comes into force when it is accepted by the ACCC.

•        The Minister may, by legislative instrument, determine that the excluded spectrum regime applies to Telstra. If the Minister does so, Telstra will not be allowed to supply services using a designated part of the spectrum unless all 3 undertakings given by Telstra are in force.

•        However, the Minister may exempt Telstra from the requirement to have an undertaking about hybrid fibre‑coaxial networks or subscription television broadcasting licences if the Minister is satisfied that Telstra’s undertaking about structural separation is sufficient to address concerns about the degree of Telstra’s power in telecommunications markets.

* * *

### Division 2—Structural separation

#### Subdivision A—Undertaking about structural separation

##### <a id="577A"></a>577A  Acceptance of undertaking about structural separation

             (1)  The ACCC may accept a written undertaking given by Telstra that:

                     (a)  at all times after the designated day:

                              (i)  Telstra will not supply fixed‑line carriage services to retail customers in Australia using a telecommunications network over which Telstra is in a position to exercise control; and

                             (ii)  Telstra will not be in a position to exercise control of a company that supplies fixed‑line carriage services to retail customers in Australia using a telecommunications network over which Telstra is in a position to exercise control; and

                     (b)  Telstra will, in connection with paragraph (a), take specified action and/or refrain from taking specified action.

Note 1:       For when Telstra is in a position to exercise control of a network, see section 577Q.

Note 2:       For control of a company, see section 577P.

Transparency and equivalence

             (2)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), a matter relating to transparency and equivalence in relation to the supply by Telstra of regulated services to:

                     (a)  Telstra’s wholesale customers; and

                     (b)  Telstra’s retail business units;

during the period:

                     (c)  beginning when the undertaking comes into force; and

                     (d)  ending at the start of the designated day;

is taken to be a matter that is in connection with paragraph (1)(a).

             (3)  The ACCC must not accept an undertaking under this section unless the ACCC is satisfied that:

##### <a id="74"></a>74  Functional separation principles

             (1)  The **_functional separation principles_** are as follows:

                     (a)  the principle that there should be  equivalence in relation to the supply by Telstra of regulated services to:

                              (i)  Telstra’s wholesale customers; and

                             (ii)  Telstra’s retail business units;

                     (b)  the principle that Telstra should maintain:

                              (i)  one or more retail business units; and

                             (ii)  a wholesale/network business unit;

                     (c)  the principle that Telstra should maintain  arm’s length functional separation between:

                              (i)  its wholesale/network business unit; and

                             (ii)  its retail business units;

                     (d)  the principle that Telstra should have  systems, procedures and practices that relate to:

                              (i)  compliance with a final functional separation undertaking; and

                             (ii)  monitoring of, and reporting on, compliance with a final functional separation undertaking; and

                            (iii)  the development of performance measures relating to compliance with a final functional separation undertaking; and

                            (iv)  independent audit, and other checks, of compliance with a final functional separation undertaking;

                     (e)  the principle that Telstra’s wholesale/network business unit should not consult Telstra’s retail business units about:

                              (i)  proposed services to be supplied by Telstra’s wholesale/network business unit; or

                             (ii)  proposed developments in connection with services supplied by Telstra’s wholesale/network business unit;

                            unless Telstra’s wholesale/network business unit also consults Telstra’s wholesale customers at the same time and in the same manner.

             (2)  In determining the principle of equivalence covered by paragraph (1)(a), regard must be had to whether:

                     (a)  the terms and conditions relating to price or a method of ascertaining price; and

                     (b)  other terms and conditions;

on which Telstra supplies regulated services to its wholesale customers are no less favourable than the terms and conditions on which Telstra supplies those services to its retail business units.

             (3)  Subclause (2) does not limit the matters to which regard may be had.

             (4)  To avoid doubt, this clause does not affect the meaning of anything in Part 33.

##### <a id="75"></a>75  Functional separation requirements determination

             (1)  The Minister may make a written determination (a **_functional separation requirements determination_**) specifying requirements to be complied with by a draft or final functional separation undertaking.

             (2)  A functional separation requirements determination may deal with the manner in which the functional separation principles are to be implemented.

             (3)  A functional separation requirements determination may deal with the manner in which a requirement set out in paragraph 73(1)(b) or (c) is to be met.

Note:          Clause 73 deals with the contents of a draft or final functional separation undertaking.

             (4)  Subclauses (2) and (3) do not limit subclause (1).

          (4A)  Before making or varying a functional separation requirements determination, the Minister must:

                     (a)  cause to be published on the Department’s website a notice:

                              (i)  setting out the determination or variation; and

                             (ii)  inviting persons to make submissions to the Minister about the determination or variation within 14 days after the notice is published; and

                     (b)  give the ACCC a copy of the notice; and

                     (c)  consider any submissions received within the 14‑day period mentioned in paragraph (a); and

### Division 4—Access determinations

#### Subdivision A—Commission may make access determinations

##### <a id="152BC"></a>152BC  Access determinations

             (1)  The Commission may make a written determination relating to access to a declared service.

             (2)  A determination under subsection (1) is to be known as an **_access determination_**.

             (3)  An access determination may:

                     (a)  specify any or all of the terms and conditions on which a carrier or carriage service provider is to comply with any or all of the standard access obligations applicable to the carrier or provider; or

                     (b)  specify any other terms and conditions of an access seeker’s access to the declared service; or

                     (c)  require a carrier or carriage service provider to comply with any or all of the standard access obligations applicable to the carrier or provider in a manner specified in the determination; or

                     (d)  require a carrier or carriage service provider to extend or enhance the capability of a facility by means of which the declared service is supplied; or

                     (e)  impose other requirements on a carrier or carriage service provider in relation to access to the declared service; or

                      (f)  specify the terms and conditions on which a carrier or carriage service provider is to comply with any or all of those other requirements; or

                     (g)  require access seekers to accept, and pay for, access to the declared service; or

                     (h)  provide that any or all of the obligations referred to in section 152AR are not applicable to a carrier or carriage service provider, either:

                              (i)  unconditionally; or

                             (ii)  subject to such conditions or limitations as are specified in the determination; or

                      (i)  restrict or limit the application to a carrier or carriage service provider of any or all of the obligations referred to in section 152AR; or

                      (j)  deal with any other matter relating to access to the declared service.

             (4)  Subsection (3) does not limit subsection (1).

             (5)  An access determination may make different provision with respect to:

                     (a)  different carriers or carriage service providers; or

                     (b)  different classes of carriers or carriage service providers; or

                     (c)  different access seekers; or

                     (d)  different classes of access seekers.

             (6)  Subsection (5) does not, by implication, limit subsection 33(3A) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

             (7)  An access determination may provide for the Commission to perform functions, and exercise powers, under the determination.

             (8)  Terms and conditions specified in an access determination as mentioned in paragraph (3)(a), (b) or (f) must include terms and conditions relating to price or a method of ascertaining price.

             (9)  An access determination is not a legislative instrument.

##### <a id="152BCA"></a>152BCA  Matters that the Commission must take into account

             (1)  The Commission must take the following matters into account in making an access determination:

                     (a)  whether the determination will promote the long‑term interests of end‑users of carriage services or of services supplied by means of carriage services;

                     (b)  the legitimate business interests of a carrier or carriage service provider who supplies, or is capable of supplying, the declared service, and the carrier’s or provider’s investment in facilities used to supply the declared service;

                     (c)  the interests of all persons who have rights to use the declared service;

                     (d)  the direct costs of providing access to the declared service;

                     (e)  the value to a person of extensions, or enhancement of capability, whose cost is borne by someone else;

                      (f)  the operational and technical requirements necessary for the safe and reliable operation of a carriage service, a telecommunications network or a facility;

                     (g)  the economically efficient operation of a carriage service, a telecommunications network or a facility.

             (2)  If a carrier or carriage service provider who supplies, or is capable of supplying, the declared service supplies one or more other eligible services, then, in making an access determination that is applicable to the carrier or provider, as the case may be, the Commission may take into account:

                     (a)  the characteristics of those other eligible services; and

                     (b)  the costs associated with those other eligible services; and

                     (c)  the revenues associated with those other eligible services; and

                     (d)  the demand for those other eligible services.

             (3)  The Commission may take into account any other matters that it thinks are relevant.

             (4)  This section does not apply to an interim access determination.

             (5)  In this section:

                    <a name="elig-servic"></a>**_eligible service_** has the same meaning as in section 152AL.

##### <a id="152BCB"></a>152BCB  Restrictions on access determinations

             (1)  The Commission must not make an access determination that would have any of the following effects:

                     (a)  preventing a service provider who already has access to the declared service from obtaining a sufficient amount of the service to be able to meet the service provider’s reasonably anticipated requirements, measured at the time when the access seeker made a request in relation to the service under section 152AR;

                     (b)  preventing a carrier or carriage service provider from obtaining a sufficient amount of the service to be able to meet the carrier’s or provider’s reasonably anticipated requirements, measured at the time when the access seeker made a request in relation to the service under section 152AR;

                     (c)  preventing a person from obtaining, by the exercise of a pre‑determination right, a sufficient level of access to the declared service to be able to meet the person’s actual requirements;

                     (d)  depriving any person of a protected contractual right;

                     (e)  resulting in an access seeker becoming the owner (or one of the owners) of any part of a facility without the consent of the owner of the facility;

                      (f)  requiring a person (other than an access seeker) to bear an unreasonable amount of the costs of:

                              (i)  extending or enhancing the capability of a facility; or

                             (ii)  maintaining extensions to or enhancements of the capability of a facility;

                     (g)  requiring a carrier or carriage service provider to provide an access seeker with access to a declared service if there are reasonable grounds to believe that:

                              (i)  the access seeker would fail, to a material extent, to comply with the terms and conditions on which the carrier or provider provides, or is reasonably likely to provide, that access; or

                             (ii)  the access seeker would fail, in connection with that access, to protect the integrity of a telecommunications network or to protect the safety of individuals working on, or using services supplied by means of, a telecommunications network or a facility.

             (2)  Examples of grounds for believing as mentioned in subparagraph (1)(g)(i) include:

                     (a)  evidence that the access seeker is not creditworthy; and

                     (b)  repeated failures by the access seeker to comply with the terms and conditions on which the same or similar access has been provided (whether or not by the carrier or carriage service provider).

             (3)  The Commission must not make an access determination that is inconsistent with any of the standard access obligations that are, or will be, applicable to a carrier or carriage service provider.

          (3A)  If a final migration plan is in force, the Commission must not make an access determination that would have the effect of requiring Telstra to engage in conduct in connection with matters covered by the final migration plan.

             (4)  If the Commission makes an access determination that has the effect of depriving a person (the **_second person_**) of a pre‑determination right to require the carrier or provider to provide access to the declared service to the second person, the determination must also require the access seeker:

                     (a)  to pay to the second person such amount (if any) as the Commission considers is fair compensation for the deprivation; and

                     (b)  to reimburse the carrier or provider and the Commonwealth for any compensation that the carrier or provider or the Commonwealth agrees, or is required by a court order, to pay to the second person as compensation for the deprivation.

             (5)  An access determination is of no effect to the extent to which it contravenes subsection (1), (3) or (3A).

             (6)  In this section:

                    <a name="pre-determin-right"></a>**_pre‑determination right_** means a right under a contract that was in force:

                     (a)  if the access determination is one of a series of 2 or more successive access determinations—immediately before the first access determination came into force; or

                     (b)  otherwise—immediately before the access determination came into force.

                    <a name="protect-contractu-right"></a>**_protected contractual right_** means a right under a contract that was in force at the beginning of 13 September 1996.

##### <a id="152BCC"></a>152BCC  Access agreements prevail over inconsistent access determinations

                   If an access determination is applicable to the following parties:

                     (a)  a carrier or carriage service provider;

                     (b)  an access seeker;

the access determination has no effect to the extent to which it is inconsistent with an access agreement that is applicable to those parties.

##### <a id="152BCCA"></a>152BCCA  Final migration plan prevails over inconsistent access determinations

                   If a final migration plan is in force, an access determination has no effect to the extent to which it would have the effect of:

                     (a)  preventing Telstra from complying with the final migration plan; or

                     (b)  requiring Telstra to engage in conduct in connection with matters covered by the final migration plan.

##### <a id="152BCD"></a>152BCD  Fixed principles provisions

             (1)  An access determination may include a provision that is specified in the determination to be a fixed principles provision.

             (2)  If a fixed principles provision is included in an access determination, the determination must provide that a specified date is the nominal termination date for the fixed principles provision. The nominal termination date may be later than the expiry date for the determination.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  an access determination (the **_replacement access determination_**) is expressed to replace a previous access determination; and

                     (b)  the previous access determination included a fixed principles provision; and

                     (c)  the nominal termination date for the fixed principles provision is later than the day on which the replacement access determination comes into force;

then:

                     (d)  the replacement access determination must include a provision in the same terms as the fixed principles provision; and

                     (e)  the provision must be specified in the replacement access determination to be a fixed principles provision; and

                      (f)  the nominal termination date for the fixed principles provision so included in the replacement access determination must be the same as, or later than, the nominal termination date for the fixed principles provision included in the previous access determination; and

                     (g)  if the previous access determination provided that the previous access determination must not be varied so as to alter or remove the fixed principles provision—the replacement access determination must provide that the replacement access determination must not be varied so as to alter or remove the fixed principles provision; and

                     (h)  if the previous access determination provided that the previous access determination must not be varied so as to alter or remove the fixed principles provision except in such circumstances as are specified in the previous access determination:

                              (i)  the replacement access determination must provide that the replacement access determination must not be varied so as to alter or remove the fixed principles provision except in such circumstances as are specified in the replacement access determination; and

                             (ii)  those circumstances must be the same as the circumstances specified in the previous access determination.

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  a fixed principles provision is included in an access determination; and

                     (b)  the access determination ceases to be in force before the nominal termination date for the fixed principles provision;

the fixed principles provision ceases to be in force when the access determination ceases to be in force.

Note:          Even though a fixed principles provision ceases to be in force when the access determination ceases to be in force, subsection (3) requires that a replacement access determination include a provision in the same terms as the fixed principles provision.

             (5)  If a fixed principles provision is included in an access determination, the access determination must:

                     (a)  provide that the access determination must not be varied so as to alter or remove the fixed principles provision; or

                     (b)  provide that the access determination must not be varied so as to alter or remove the fixed principles provision except in such circumstances as are specified in the access determination.

##### <a id="152BCE"></a>152BCE  Access determinations may be set out in the same document

                   Two or more access determinations may be set out in the same document.

##### <a id="152BCF"></a>152BCF  Duration of access determination

             (1)  An access determination relating to access to a declared service:

                     (a)  comes into force on the day specified in the determination as the day on which the determination is to come into force; and

                     (b)  unless sooner revoked, ceases to be in force on the expiry date for the determination.

             (2)  The specified day may be earlier than the day on which the determination was made.

          (2A)  The specified day must not be earlier than the date of commencement of this section.

             (3)  If the declared service is covered by a declaration under section 152AL, and the declaration is not a fresh declaration that replaces a previous declaration, the specified day must not be earlier than the day on which the declaration came into force.

          (3A)  If the declared service is covered by subsection 152AL(7), the specified day must not be earlier than the day on which the service became a declared service under that subsection.

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  an access determination is expressed to replace a previous access determination relating to access to the declared service; and

                     (b)  the previous access determination is not an interim access determination;

the specified day must be the first day after the expiry of the previous access determination.

          (4A)  If:

                     (a)  an access determination is expressed to replace a previous access determination relating to access to the declared service; and

                     (c)  the declared service is covered by a declaration under section 152AL;

the specified day must not be earlier than the day on which the declaration came into force.

Expiry date

             (5)  An access determination must specify an expiry date for the determination.

             (6)  In specifying an expiry date for an access determination, the Commission must have regard to:

                     (a)  in a case where the declared service is covered by a declaration under section 152AL—the principle that the expiry date for the determination should be the same as the expiry date for the declaration (as that declaration stood at the time when the access determination was made) unless, in the Commission’s opinion, there are circumstances that warrant the specification of another date as the expiry date for the access determination; and

                     (b)  such other matters (if any) as the Commission considers relevant.

             (7)  If an access determination expires, this Part does not prevent the Commission from making a fresh access determination under section 152BC in the same terms as the expired access determination.

Automatic revocation of access determination

             (8)  If:

                     (a)  an access determination relating to access to a declared service is in force; and

                     (b)  the declared service is covered by a declaration under section 152AL, and the declaration ceases to be in force; and

                     (a)  an interim access determination relating to access to a declared service is in force; and

                     (b)  a final access determination relating to access to the declared service comes into force;

the interim access determination is taken to be revoked at the time when the final access determination comes into force.

Extension of access determination

           (10)  If:

                     (a)  an access determination (the **_original access determination_**) relating to access to a declared service is in force; and

                     (b)  the Commission has commenced to hold a public inquiry under Part 25 of the _Telecommunications Act 1997_ about a proposal to make another access determination in relation to access to the service; and

                     (c)  the Commission considers that it will make the other access determination, but will not be in a position to do so before the expiry date for the original access determination;

the Commission may, by writing, declare that the expiry date for the original access determination is taken to be the day immediately before the day on which the other access determination comes into force.

           (11)  The Commission must publish a declaration under subsection (10) on the Commission’s website.

           (12)  If:

                     (a)  after holding a public inquiry under subsection 152ALA(7) in relation to a section 152AL declaration, the Commission:

                              (i)  extends or further extends the expiry date for the declaration by a period of not more than 12 months; and

                             (ii)  decides to allow the declaration to expire after the end of that period; and

                     (b)  an access determination is in force in relation to access to the declared service;

the Commission may, by writing _,_ extend the expiry date for the access determination by the same period.

           (13)  The Commission must publish an instrument under subsection (12) on the Commission’s website.

           (14)  The Commission is not required to observe any requirements of procedural fairness in relation to a decision under subsection (10) or (12).

           (15)  A declaration under subsection (10) is not a legislative instrument.

           (16)  An instrument under subsection (12) is not a legislative instrument.

##### <a id="152BCG"></a>152BCG  Interim access determinations

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  the Commission makes a declaration under section 152AL after the commencement of this section; and

                     (b)  the declaration is not a fresh declaration that replaces a previous declaration; and

                     (c)  the Commission has commenced to hold a public inquiry under Part 25 of the _Telecommunications Act 1997_ about a proposal to make an access determination in relation to access to the declared service; and

                     (d)  either:

                              (i)  the Commission considers that it is unlikely that a final access determination in relation to access to the service will be made within 6 months after the commencement of the public inquiry; or

                             (ii)  the Commission considers that there is an urgent need to make an access determination in relation to access to the service before the completion of the public inquiry;

the Commission must make an interim access determination in relation to access to the service.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  a declaration is in force under section 152AL; and

                     (b)  no access determination has previously been made in relation to access to the declared service;

             (1)  The Commission may make written rules that:

                     (a)  specify any or all of the terms and conditions on which a carrier or carriage service provider is to comply with any or all of the standard access obligations applicable to the carrier or provider in relation to a specified declared service; or

                     (b)  require a carrier or carriage service provider to comply with any or all of the standard access obligations applicable to the carrier or provider in relation to a specified declared service in a manner specified in the rules;

if the Commission considers that there is an urgent need to do so.

Note:          For variation and revocation, see subsection 33(3) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

             (2)  Rules under subsection (1) are to be known as **_binding rules of conduct_**.

             (3)  Binding rules of conduct may be of general application or may be limited as provided in the rules.

             (9)  An instrument under subsection (1) is not a legislative instrument.

##### <a id="152BDAA"></a>152BDAA  Matters that the Commission must take into account

             (1)  The Commission must take the following matters into account in making binding rules of conduct:

                     (a)  whether the binding rules of conduct will promote the long‑term interests of end‑users of carriage services or of services supplied by means of carriage services;

                     (b)  the legitimate business interests of a carrier or carriage service provider who supplies, or is capable of supplying, the declared service, and the carrier’s or provider’s investment in facilities used to supply the declared service;

                     (c)  the interests of all persons who have rights to use the declared service;

                     (d)  the direct costs of providing access to the declared service;

                     (e)  the value to a person of extensions, or enhancement of capability, whose cost is borne by someone else;

                      (f)  the operational and technical requirements necessary for the safe and reliable operation of a carriage service, a telecommunications network or a facility;

                     (g)  the economically efficient operation of a carriage service, a telecommunications network or a facility.

             (2)  If a carrier or carriage service provider who supplies, or is capable of supplying, the declared service supplies one or more other eligible services, then, in making binding rules of conduct that are applicable to the carrier or provider, as the case may be, the Commission may take into account:

                     (a)  the characteristics of those other eligible services; and

                     (b)  the costs associated with those other eligible services; and

                     (c)  the revenues associated with those other eligible services; and

             (6)  In this section:

                    <a name="elig-servic"></a>**_eligible service_** has the same meaning as in section 152AL.

##### <a id="152BDA"></a>152BDA  Restrictions on binding rules of conduct

             (1)  The Commission must not make binding rules of conduct that would have any of the following effects:

                     (a)  preventing a service provider who already has access to the declared service from obtaining a sufficient amount of the service to be able to meet the service provider’s reasonably anticipated requirements, measured at the time when the access seeker made a request in relation to the service under section 152AR;

                     (b)  preventing a carrier or carriage service provider from obtaining a sufficient amount of the service to be able to meet the carrier’s or provider’s reasonably anticipated requirements, measured at the time when the access seeker made a request in relation to the service under section 152AR;

                     (c)  preventing a person from obtaining, by the exercise of a pre‑rules right, a sufficient level of access to the declared service to be able to meet the person’s actual requirements;

                     (d)  depriving any person of a protected contractual right;

                     (e)  resulting in an access seeker becoming the owner (or one of the owners) of any part of a facility without the consent of the owner of the facility;

                      (f)  requiring a person (other than an access seeker) to bear an unreasonable amount of the costs of:

                              (i)  extending or enhancing the capability of a facility; or

                             (ii)  maintaining extensions to or enhancements of the capability of a facility;

                     (g)  requiring a carrier or carriage service provider to provide an access seeker with access to a declared service if there are reasonable grounds to believe that:

                              (i)  the access seeker would fail, to a material extent, to comply with the terms and conditions on which the carrier or provider provides, or is reasonably likely to provide, that access; or

                             (ii)  the access seeker would fail, in connection with that access, to protect the integrity of a telecommunications network or to protect the safety of individuals working on, or using services supplied by means of, a telecommunications network or a facility.

             (2)  Examples of grounds for believing as mentioned in subparagraph (1)(g)(i) include:

                     (a)  evidence that the access seeker is not creditworthy; and

                     (b)  repeated failures by the access seeker to comply with the terms and conditions on which the same or similar access has been provided (whether or not by the carrier or carriage service provider).

             (3)  The Commission must not make binding rules of conduct that are inconsistent with any of the standard access obligations that are, or will be, applicable to a carrier or carriage service provider.

          (3A)  If a final migration plan is in force, the Commission must not make binding rules of conduct that would have the effect of requiring Telstra to engage in conduct in connection with matters covered by the final migration plan.

             (4)  If the Commission makes binding rules of conduct that have the effect of depriving a person (the **_second person_**) of a pre‑rules right to require the carrier or provider to provide access to the declared service to the second person, the rules must also require the access seeker:

                     (a)  to pay to the second person such amount (if any) as the Commission considers is fair compensation for the deprivation; and

                     (b)  to reimburse the carrier or provider and the Commonwealth for any compensation that the carrier or provider or the Commonwealth agrees, or is required by a court order, to pay to the second person as compensation for the deprivation.

             (5)  Binding rules of conduct are of no effect to the extent to which they contravene subsection (1), (3) or (3A).

             (6)  In this section:

                    <a name="pre-rule-right"></a>**_pre‑rules right_** means a right under a contract that was in force immediately before the binding rules of conduct came into force.

##### <a id="152BDCA"></a>152BDCA  Final migration plan prevails over inconsistent binding rules of conduct

                   If a final migration plan is in force, binding rules of conduct have no effect to the extent to which they would have the effect of:

                     (a)  preventing Telstra from complying with the final migration plan; or

                     (b)  requiring Telstra to engage in conduct in connection with matters covered by the final migration plan.

##### <a id="152BDD"></a>152BDD  Commission must give copy of binding rules of conduct to carrier etc.

                   If binding rules of conduct are limited to a particular carrier, carriage service provider or access seeker, as soon as practicable after making the rules, the Commission must give a copy of the rules to the carrier, carriage service provider or access seeker, as the case may be.

##### <a id="152BDE"></a>152BDE  Access determinations that are inconsistent with binding rules of conduct
