<li class="BoxList" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 21.25pt">•     If the amount calculated is greater than the surcharge threshold, the Commissioner will calculate the rate of surcharge and assess the amount of surcharge payable by the taxpayer on the payments. Only part of certain employment-related termination payments is subject to the surcharge.</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 21.25pt">•     If, after the assessment of surcharge, the taxpayer’s adjusted taxable income is found to be different from the amount that was previously calculated or the termination payments are found to be different from the amount on which the assessment was based, the Commissioner may amend the assessment.</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 21.25pt">•     If liability for surcharge is increased as a result of an amendment of an assessment, the general interest charge is payable on the additional surcharge.</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 21.25pt">·      A taxpayer may object against an assessment of surcharge in the way set out in Part IVC of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ for objecting against assessment of income tax.</li>

How a notice is to be given

             (6)  A notice of assessment may be given in any manner prescribed by the regulations.

             (7)  The validity of any assessment is not affected by any non-compliance with a provision of this Act.

##### <a id="11A"></a>11A  Periods within which assessments may be amended

General provision

             (1)  The Commissioner may, subject to this section, at any time amend an assessment of surcharge on a termination payment or termination payments made to or for a taxpayer by making such alterations or additions as the Commissioner thinks necessary, even though surcharge has been paid in respect of the assessment. Such an amendment may be made on the Commissioner’s own initiative or at the request of the member.

Period for making further amendment

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  an assessment has been amended in any particular in a way that effected a reduction in the amount of surcharge payable; and

                     (b)  for the purposes of making the amendment, the Commissioner accepted a statement made by or on behalf of a taxpayer;

the Commissioner may, within 4 years from the date of service of the notice of the amended assessment, further amend the assessment in, or in respect of, that particular in a way that increases the amount of the surcharge payable to the extent that the Commissioner considers necessary.

Period where avoidance of surcharge

             (3)  Subject to this section, if there has been an avoidance of surcharge, the Commissioner may:

                     (a)  if the Commissioner is of the opinion that the avoidance of surcharge is due to fraud or evasion—at any time; or

                     (b)  in any other case—within 4 years from the date upon which the surcharge became due and payable under the assessment;

amend the assessment by making such alterations or additions as the Commissioner thinks necessary to correct the assessment.

Period where amendment reduces surcharge

             (4)  An amendment effecting a reduction in the amount of surcharge payable under an assessment is not to be made after the end of 4 years from the date upon which the surcharge became due and payable under the assessment.

Application or request for extension of period

                     (a)  the Commissioner has begun an examination of the affairs of a taxpayer; and

                     (b)  the examination was not completed within the period within which the Commissioner may amend an assessment to which the examination relates under subsection (3) or, if that period has been extended by any previous order or orders of the Federal Court of Australia made under subsection (6), or by any previous consent or consents of the taxpayer given under subsection (7), within that period as so extended;

the Commissioner may, before the end of the period referred to in paragraph (b) of this subsection, apply to the Federal Court for an order extending, or request the taxpayer to consent to the extension of, the period within which the Commissioner may amend the assessment under paragraph (3)(b).

Court may extend period

             (6)  If, on application made to the Federal Court of Australia in accordance with subsection (5), the Court is satisfied that it was not reasonably practicable, or it was inappropriate, for the Commissioner to complete the examination within the period referred to in paragraph (5)(b) because of any action taken by the taxpayer or any failure of the taxpayer to take action that it would have been reasonable for the taxpayer to take, the Court may make an order extending the period within which the Commissioner may amend the assessment under paragraph (3)(b) for such period as the Court considers appropriate.

Taxpayer may extend period

             (7)  If a request is made to the taxpayer in accordance with subsection (5), the taxpayer may, by writing, consent to the extension of the period within which the Commissioner may amend the assessment under paragraph (3)(b) for such period as is specified in the instrument of consent.

Meaning of **take action**

             (8)  In subsection (6), a reference to action taken by a taxpayer includes a reference to the institution by the taxpayer of a proceeding before a court or tribunal.

Period for further amendment reducing surcharge

             (9)  If an assessment has, under this section, been amended in any particular, the Commissioner may, within 4 years from the date upon which surcharge became due under the amended assessment, make, in or in respect of that particular, such further amendment of the assessment as, in the Commissioner’s opinion, is necessary to effect such reduction in the amount of surcharge payable under the assessment as is just.

Case when subsection (9) does not apply

           (10)  Subsection (9) does not authorise the further amendment of an earlier further amendment of an assessment made under subsection (2).

Assessment following application by taxpayer

           (11)  If:

                     (a)  an application for an amendment of an assessment is made by a taxpayer within 4 years from the date upon which surcharge became due and payable under the assessment; and

                     (b)  the taxpayer has given to the Commissioner within that period all information needed by the Commissioner for the purpose of deciding the application;

the Commissioner may amend the assessment when he or she decides the application even though that period has elapsed.

Information to be contained in application

           (13)  An application for amendment must be given in the prescribed manner and contain the prescribed information.

Certain other powers of amendment not affected

           (14)  Nothing in this section prevents:

                     (b)  the amount of the payment or the sum of the amounts of the payments is greater or less than the amount that was taken to be the amount of the payment or the sum for the purposes of the assessment.

Commissioner may amend assessment

             (2)  The Commissioner may amend the assessment to take account of any matter referred to in paragraph (1)(a) or (b).

Amendment increasing surcharge

Amendment reducing surcharge

             (4)  If, as a result of the amendment of the assessment, the amount of surcharge is reduced:

                     (a)  the amount by which the surcharge is reduced is taken never to have been payable; and

                     (b)  the Commissioner must:

                     (a)  started at the beginning of 15 June in the financial year; and

                     (b)  finishes at the end of the day before the amended assessment is made.

Note:          The general interest charge is worked out under Division 1 of Part IIA of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.
