An Act relating to the assesment and collection of termination payments tax, and for related purposes
Part 1—Preliminary
  
1  Short title [see Note 1]
		This Act may be cited as the Termination Payments Tax (Assessment and Collection) Act 1997.
2  Commencement [see Note 1]
		This Act commences on the day on which it receives the Royal Assent.
3  Act to bind Crown
	(1)	This Act binds the Crown in right of the Commonwealth, of each of the States, of the Australian Capital Territory, of the Northern Territory and of Norfolk Island.
	(2)	Nothing in this Act permits the Crown to be prosecuted for an offence.
4  Extension to Territories
		This Act extends to Norfolk Island, the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands and the Territory of Christmas Island.
5  Object of Act
		The object of this Act is to provide for the assessment and collection of the termination payments surcharge. The surcharge is payable on payments of kinds commonly known as golden handshakes that are made to high‑income taxpayers in consequence of the termination of their employment.
6  Outline of Act 
		The following is a simplified outline of this Act.
•	If any termination payments have been or are made to or for a taxpayer after 7.30 pm on 20 August 1996, the Commissioner will calculate the taxpayer’s adjusted taxable income for the financial year in which the payments were or are made.
•	If the amount calculated is greater than the surcharge threshold, the Commissioner will calculate the rate of surcharge and assess the amount of surcharge payable by the taxpayer on the payments. Only part of certain employment‑related termination payments is subject to the surcharge.
•	If, after the assessment of surcharge, the taxpayer’s adjusted taxable income is found to be different from the amount that was previously calculated or the termination payments are found to be different from the amount on which the assessment was based, the Commissioner may amend the assessment.
•	If liability for surcharge is increased as a result of an amendment of an assessment, the general interest charge is payable on the additional surcharge.
	A taxpayer may object against an assessment of surcharge in the way set out in Part IVC of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 for objecting against assessment of income tax.
•	A late payment penalty applies if surcharge is not paid on time.

	(3)	Surcharge is not payable on any termination payments made to or for a taxpayer in a financial year if the taxpayer is a Territory resident for the purposes of Division 1A of Part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act as it applies to the year of income that comprises that financial year.
Taxpayer liable for surcharge
	(4)	The taxpayer is liable to pay the surcharge.
9  Surcharge payable only on part of certain termination payments

where:
post‑20 August 1996 period means the number of days in the period of the taxpayer’s employment for which the termination payment was made that occurred after 20 August 1996.
total period means the number of days in the period of the taxpayer’s employment for which the termination payment was made.
Termination payments made on or after 20 August 2001
	(2)	If:

	(1)	The surcharge threshold for the 1996‑97 financial year is $70,000.
Surcharge threshold for later financial year

	(b)	otherwise—the amount is to be rounded up to the nearest whole dollar.
Indexation factor
	(4)	The indexation factor for a financial year is the number calculated, to 3 decimal places, using the formula:

current March year means the period of 12 months ending on 31 March immediately before the financial year for which the surcharge threshold is being calculated.
