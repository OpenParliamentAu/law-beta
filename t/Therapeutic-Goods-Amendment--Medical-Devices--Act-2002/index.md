Division&#160;2&#151;Interpretation
 41BD  What is a medical device

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>A _medical device_ is:

</dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>any instrument, apparatus, appliance, material or other article (whether

used alone or in combination, and including the software necessary for its

proper application) intended, by the person under whose name it is or is to be

supplied, to be used for human beings for the purpose of one or more of the

following:

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(i)</dt><dd>diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, treatment or alleviation of disease;</dd>

<dt>(ii)</dt><dd>diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, alleviation of or compensation for an

injury or handicap;</dd>

physiological process;</dd>

<dt>(iv)</dt><dd>control of conception;

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl></dl>

<center>Back to Top</center>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

		and that does not achieve its principal intended action in or on the human

body by pharmacological, immunological or metabolic means, but that may be

assisted in its function by such means; or

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>an accessory to such an instrument, apparatus, appliance, material or

other article.

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note:	Declarations under subsection&#160;(3) exclude articles

from the scope of this definition. Declarations under section&#160;7 can also

have this effect: see subsection 7(4).

 </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(2)</dt><dd>For the purposes of paragraph&#160;(1)(a), the purpose for which an

article is to be used is to be ascertained from the information supplied, by

the person under whose name the article is or is to be supplied, on or in any

one or more of the following:

</dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>the labelling on the article;</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>the instructions for using the article;</dd>

<dt>(c)</dt><dd>any advertising material relating to the article.

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(3)</dt><dd>The Secretary may, by order published in the _Gazette_, declare that

a particular instrument, apparatus, appliance, material or other article, or

that a particular class of instruments, apparatus, appliances, materials or

other articles, are not, for the purposes of this Act, medical devices.

Kinds of medical devices can be included in the Register if they comply with the essential principles, and conformity assessment procedures have been applied to the kinds of devices (and certain other requirements are complied with).
 Inclusions in the Register are subject to certain automatic conditions and the Secretary may impose further conditions.

Division&#160;1&#151;Including medical devices in the Register
 41FA  What this Division is about

Kinds of medical devices are usually included in the Register automatically once a proper application is made, together with the required certification. However, applications may be selected for audit, which involves checking some or all aspects of the application and certification.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note 1:	In some cases, an application relating to a kind of

medical device will not be effective unless that kind of device is covered by a

conformity assessment certificate under Part&#160;4-4: see paragraph

41FC(2)(c). Note 2:	Dealing in medical devices of a kind not included in the Register may be an offence: see Division&#160;3 of Part&#160;4-11\.  </dl></dl>
