             (2)  Subject to subsection (3), the Register is to be kept in such form as the Secretary determines.

             (3)  The Register is to contain these 3 parts:

                     (a)  a part for goods to be known as registered goods; and

                     (b)  a part for goods to be known as listed goods; and

                     (c)  a part for medical devices included in the Register under Chapter 4.

             (4)  The regulations may prescribe:

                     (a)  the therapeutic goods, or the classes of therapeutic goods, that are required to be included in each part of the Register; and

                     (b)  the ways in which:

                              (i)  goods that are included in the part of the Register relating to registered goods may be transferred, or may be required to be transferred, to the part of the Register for listed goods; and

                             (ii)  goods that are included in the part of the Register relating to listed goods may be transferred, or may be required to be transferred, to the part of the Register for registered goods; and

                     (c)  the ways in which goods that have been assigned a registration or listing number may be assigned a different registration or listing number; and

                     (d)  the ways in which medical devices that have been assigned a device number may be assigned a different device number.

             (5)  The Minister may, by notice published in the _Gazette_, require that specified therapeutic goods be included in the part of the Register for listed goods.

             (6)  If the regulations are amended to require any of those goods to be included in the part of the Register for listed or registered goods, then the _Gazette_ notice ceases to have effect in respect of the goods included in the regulations.

##### <a id="9B"></a>9B  When registrations or listings of medical devices are taken to be cancelled

             (1)  The registration or listing of a medical device to which subsection 15A(5) applied is taken to be cancelled:

                     (a)  on the second anniversary of the day on which Chapter 4 commences; or

                     (b)  if the medical device is of a kind included in the Register under Chapter 4 before that second anniversary—when that inclusion takes effect.

             (2)  The registration or listing of any other medical device is taken to be cancelled:

                     (a)  on the fifth anniversary of the day on which Chapter 4 commences; or

                     (b)  if the medical device is of a kind included in the Register under Chapter 4 before that fifth anniversary—when that inclusion takes effect.

             (3)  This section does not prevent the Secretary from taking action under section 30.

##### <a id="9C"></a>9C  Inspection of entries in Register

             (1)  The Register is not open for public inspection, but a person in relation to whom therapeutic goods are entered on the Register may make a written request to the Secretary for a copy of the entry in the Register in relation to the goods.

             (2)  If the person makes such a request, the Secretary must send to the person a copy of so much (if any) of that entry as is contained in any computer database maintained by the Department for purposes connected with the administration of this Act (other than any part of that entry that was supplied in confidence by another person).

             (3)  If the person makes such a request, then, instead of providing a copy of an entry to the person, the Secretary may, if the request is for the provision of an electronic copy, provide the information contained in the entry:

                     (a)  on a data processing device; or

                     (b)  by way of electronic transmission.

##### <a id="9D"></a>9D  Variation of entries in Register

             (1)  The Secretary may:

                     (a)  following a request by a person in relation to whom therapeutic goods are entered on the Register; or

                     (b)  on the Secretary’s own initiative;

vary the entry in the Register in relation to the goods if the entry contains information that is incomplete or incorrect.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  the person in relation to whom therapeutic goods are registered or listed has requested the Secretary to vary product information included in the entry in the Register that relates to the goods; and

                     (b)  the only effect of the variation would be:

                              (i)  to reduce the class of persons for whom the goods are suitable; or

                             (ii)  to add a warning, or precaution, that does not include any comparison of the goods with any other therapeutic goods by reference to quality, safety or efficacy;

the Secretary must vary the entry in accordance with the request.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  the person in relation to whom therapeutic goods are registered or listed has requested the Secretary to vary information included in the entry in the Register that relates to the goods; and

                     (b)  subsection (2) does not apply to the request; and

                     (c)  the Secretary is satisfied that the variation requested does not indicate any reduction in the quality, safety or efficacy of the goods for the purposes for which they are to be used;

the Secretary may vary the entry in accordance with the request.

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  particular therapeutic goods cease to be medical devices because of a declaration under subsection 41BD(3); and

                     (b)  those goods are included in the Register under Chapter 4 as a kind of medical device;

the Secretary must move the entry relating to the goods from the part of the Register for medical devices to the part for goods to be known as registered goods or to the part for goods to be known as listed goods (whichever is applicable).

             (5)  In this section:

                    <a name="product-inform"></a>**_product information_**, in relation to therapeutic goods, means information relating to the safe and effective use of the goods, including information regarding the usefulness and limitations of the goods.

Note:          Variations to the Register also occur to give effect to limited cancellations of entries of kinds of medical devices from the Register: see subsection 41GO(2).

##### <a id="9E"></a>9E  Publication of list of goods on Register

                   The Secretary must, at least once every 12 months, publish a list of the therapeutic goods included in the Register.

## 38  Transitional for publication of list of goods on Register

The first list published under section 9E of the _Therapeutic Goods Act 1989_ after the commencement of this Schedule must be published within 12 months after the last list published under section 33 of the _Therapeutic Goods Act 1989_.

Note:          A registration or listing can be cancelled under section 30, or can be taken to be cancelled under section 9B.

Pending applications

             (3)  This Part continues to apply to a medical device if:

Note:          Medical devices that are registered or listed because of this subsection are taken to be cancelled 2 years after Chapter 4 commences, or before then if medical devices of that kind are included in the Register under Chapter 4: see subsection 9B(1).

Medical devices that are exempt goods

             (6)  This Part applies to a medical device, during the period of 2 years after the commencement of this section, if the device is exempt goods.

Existing approvals under section 19

             (7)  This Part continues to apply to a medical device if:

                   The purpose of this Chapter is to ensure the safety and satisfactory performance of medical devices. It does this by:

                     (a)  setting out particular requirements for medical devices; and

                     (b)  establishing administrative processes principally aimed at ensuring those requirements are met; and

                     (c)  providing for enforcement through a series of offences.

##### <a id="41BA"></a>41BA  Requirements for medical devices (Parts 4-2 and 4-3)

                   The requirements for medical devices are:

                     (a)  essential principles (that are about the safety and performance characteristics of medical devices); and

                     (b)  conformity assessment procedures (that are mainly about the application of quality management systems).

Note:          Medical device standards may be made under Division 2 of Part 4-2, and conformity assessment standards may be made under Division 2 of Part 4-3, but they are not requirements.

##### <a id="41BB"></a>41BB  Administrative processes (Parts 4-4 to 4-10)

                   The administrative processes under this Chapter are:

                     (a)  issuing conformity assessment certificates for some manufacturers of medical devices; and

                     (b)  including medical devices in the Register; and

                     (c)  suspending or cancelling entries of medical devices from the Register; and

                     (d)  exempting medical devices from the requirement to be included in the Register; and

                     (e)  obtaining information about medical devices; and

                      (f)  requiring public notification of problems with medical devices, and recovery of such devices.

Note:          Part 4-10 provides for assessment fees to be payable in some circumstances.

##### <a id="41BC"></a>41BC  Enforcement (Part 4-11)

                   Part 4-11 contains offences that are aimed at ensuring that:

                     (a)  the requirements for medical devices are complied with; and

                     (b)  the administrative processes under this Chapter (particularly the inclusion of medical devices in the Register) are followed.

Note:          There are some offences in Parts 4-4 to 4-9\. They generally relate to matters ancillary to administrative processes in those Parts (e.g. false or misleading statements in applications).

### Division 2—Interpretation

##### <a id="41BD"></a>41BD  What is a _medical device_

             (1)  A **_medical device_** is:

                     (a)  any instrument, apparatus, appliance, material or other article (whether used alone or in combination, and including the software necessary for its proper application) intended, by the person under whose name it is or is to be supplied, to be used for human beings for the purpose of one or more of the following:

                              (i)  diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, treatment or alleviation of disease;

                             (ii)  diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, alleviation of or compensation for an injury or handicap;

                            (iii)  investigation, replacement or modification of the anatomy or of a physiological process;

                            (iv)  control of conception;

                            and that does not achieve its principal intended action in or on the human body by pharmacological, immunological or metabolic means, but that may be assisted in its function by such means; or

                     (b)  an accessory to such an instrument, apparatus, appliance, material or other article.

Note:          Declarations under subsection (3) exclude articles from the scope of this definition. Declarations under section 7 can also have this effect: see subsection 7(4).

             (2)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), the purpose for which an article is to be used is to be ascertained from the information supplied, by the person under whose name the article is or is to be supplied, on or in any one or more of the following:

                     (a)  the labelling on the article;

                     (b)  the instructions for using the article;

                     (c)  any advertising material relating to the article.

             (3)  The Secretary may, by order published in the _Gazette_, declare that a particular instrument, apparatus, appliance, material or other article, or that a particular class of instruments, apparatus, appliances, materials or other articles, are not, for the purposes of this Act, medical devices.

Note:          A declaration under this section does not stop articles from being therapeutic goods.

             (4)  A declaration under this section takes effect on the day on which the declaration is published in the _Gazette_ or on such later day as is specified in the order.

##### <a id="41BE"></a>41BE  Kinds of medical devices

General

             (1)  For the purposes of this Chapter, a medical device is taken to be of the same kind as another medical device if they:

                     (a)  have the same sponsor; and

                     (b)  have the same manufacturer; and

                     (c)  have the same device nomenclature system code (see subsection (3)); and

                     (d)  have the same medical device classification; and

                     (e)  are the same in relation to such other characteristics as the regulations prescribe, either generally or in relation to medical devices of the kind in question.

Unique medical devices

             (2)  If a medical device is not of the same kind as any other medical device:

                     (a)  this Chapter applies in relation to the device as if it were a kind of medical device; and

                     (b)  references in this Chapter to delivering a reasonable number of samples of the kind of device are taken to be references to delivering the device.

Device nomenclature codes

             (3)  The regulations may specify device nomenclature codes for medical devices.

##### <a id="41BF"></a>41BF  System or procedure packs

             (1)  A package and therapeutic goods in the package are a **_system or procedure pack_** if:

                     (a)  the package and the therapeutic goods are for use as a unit, either in combination as a system or in a medical or surgical procedure; and

                     (b)  the package contains at least one medical device; and

                     (c)  the package and the therapeutic goods do not constitute a composite pack.

             (2)  To avoid doubt, a system or procedure pack is a medical device.

##### <a id="41BG"></a>41BG  Manufacturers of medical devices

             (1)  The **_manufacturer_** of a medical device is the person who is responsible for the design, production, packaging and labelling of the device before it is supplied under the person’s name, whether or not it is the person, or another person acting on the person’s behalf, who carries out those operations.

             (2)  If subsection (1) does not apply to a medical device, the **_manufacturer_** of the device is the person who, with a view to supplying the device under the person’s name, does one or more of the following using ready-made products:

                     (a)  assembles the device;

                     (b)  packages the device;

                     (c)  processes the device;

                     (d)  fully refurbishes the device;

                             (ii)  the instructions for using the device;

                            (iii)  any advertising material relating to the device.

             (3)  However, a person is not the manufacturer of a medical device if:

                     (a)  the person assembles or adapts the device for an individual patient; and

                     (b)  the device has already been supplied by another person; and

                     (c)  the assembly or adaptation does not change the purpose intended for the device by means of information supplied by that other person, on or in any one or more of the following:

                              (i)  the labelling on the device;

                             (ii)  the instructions for using the device;

                            (iii)  any advertising material relating to the device.

##### <a id="41BH"></a>41BH  Meaning of compliance with essential principles

             (1)  A medical device complies, for the purposes of this Chapter (including Part 4-11), with the essential principles if and only if it does not contravene any of the essential principles.

             (2)  However, a medical device is also taken, for the purposes of this Chapter (other than Part 4-11), to comply with the essential principles if:

                     (a)  the medical device complies with one or more medical device standards that apply to it; and

                     (b)  the medical device contravenes the essential principles only in respect of a part or parts of the essential principles to which that medical device standard, or one or more of those medical device standards, relate.

             (3)  For the purposes of this section, a medical device standard relates to a part or parts of the essential principles only if the standard specifies that part or parts.

##### <a id="41BI"></a>41BI  Meaning of non-application of conformity assessment procedures

             (1)  A conformity assessment procedure is taken, for the purposes of this Chapter, not to have been applied to a medical device if:

                     (a)  there has been a contravention of the conformity assessment procedures; and

                     (b)  the contravention relates, wholly or partly, to that device or its manufacture.

             (2)  However, for the purposes of this Chapter (other than Part 4-11), subsection (1) does not apply if:

                     (a)  the quality management system applied in the manufacture of the medical device complies with one or more conformity assessment standards that apply to it; and

                     (b)  the contravention is only in respect of a part or parts of the conformity assessment procedures to which that conformity assessment standard, or one or more of those conformity assessment standards, relate.

             (3)  For the purposes of this section, a conformity assessment standard relates to a part or parts of the conformity assessment procedures only if the standard specifies that part or parts.

### Division 3—Application provisions
