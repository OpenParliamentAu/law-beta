(3)        To avoid doubt, subsection 5A(2) of the _Telecommunications (Numbering Charges) Act 1997_ applies even if:

                     (a)  the agreement mentioned in that subsection was made before the day on which this Act received the Royal Assent; or

                     (b)  the notice mentioned in that subsection was given before that day.

In this Schedule:

**_Imposition Act_** means the _Telecommunications (Numbering Charges) Act 1997_.

**_transition time_** means the commencement of this Schedule.

## 2  Continued effect of transfer notices

A determination made by the ACA under subsection 13(1), 15(2), 18(2), 20(1) or 22(2) of the Imposition Act that was in force immediately before the transition time has effect on and after the transition time as if it had been made by the ACMA under that subsection as amended by Schedule 1 to this Act.
