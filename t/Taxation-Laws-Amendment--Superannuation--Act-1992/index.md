**_Division 2 - Amendments relating to limits for deductions for_**

**_contributions to superannuation funds_**

TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (SUPERANNUATION) ACT 1992 No. 208 of 1992

- SECT 4

Deduction for contributions to eligible superannuation fund

for employees

  4\. Section 82AAC of the Principal Act is amended by omitting subsections (2)

and (2A) and substituting the following subsections:

  &quot;(2) Subject to subsection (2D) (which deals with elective deduction

limits), the total of the deductions allowable under subsection (1) for

contributions made by a taxpayer, or by a taxpayer and one or more associates

of the taxpayer, in a year of income in respect of a particular employee must

not exceed the employee's deduction limit for the year of income (worked out

under subsection (2A)).

  &quot;(2A) An employee's deduction limit for a year of income is worked out:

  (a) by identifying the day in the year of income, or the last day in the

year of income, on which the taxpayer, or any of the associates of the

taxpayer, made a contribution in respect of the employee, where a deduction

would have been allowable to the taxpayer, or to the associate, under

subsection (1) for that contribution (assuming subsection (2) had not been

enacted); and

  (b) by working out the age reached by the employee as at the end of that

day; and

  (c) if the year of income is the 1994-95 year of income-by applying the

following table:

         Age in years           Deduction limit

           under 35                 $ 9,000

           35 to 49                 $25,000

         50 and over                $62,000              ; and

  (d) if the year of income is a later year of income-by applying that table

subject to the indexation arrangements set out in subsection (2B).

  &quot;(2B) The table in subsection (2A) applies for the 1995-96 year of income or

a later year of income as if each indexable amount were replaced by the amount

worked out using the formula:

             Indexation factor   x   Previous indexable amount

where:

  'Indexation factor' means the indexation factor for the year of income

worked out under section 159SG;

  'Previous indexable amount' means the indexable amount concerned for the

previous year of income.

  &quot;(2C) In subsection (2B):

  'indexable amount' means:

  (a) an amount of $9,000, $25,000 or $62,000 specified in the table in

subsection (2A); or

  (b) if any such amount has previously been altered under subsection (2B)-the

altered amount.

  &quot;(2D) If:

  (a) at all times during so much of a year of income as occurred when a

taxpayer was an employer, 10 or more employee positions under the taxpayer are

filled by employees of the taxpayer; and

  (b) apart from subsection (2) and this subsection, deductions are allowable

to the taxpayer, or to one or more associates of the taxpayer, under

subsection (1) for contributions made in the year of income in respect of at

least 10 of those positions; and

  (c) the taxpayer elects that this subsection is to apply to the taxpayer for

the year of income;

then, in spite of subsection (2), the total of the deductions allowable under

subsection (1) in respect of contributions made by the taxpayer, or by the

taxpayer and one or more of the associates of the taxpayer, in the year of

income in respect of all of the employees of the taxpayer must not exceed:

  (d) if the year of income is the 1994-95 year of income-the amount

calculated using the formula:

            Full-year employee   x   $25,000

                positions

where:

  'Full-year employee positions' means the number of employee positions under

the employer which satisfy the following conditions:

    (i) the employee positions were filled by employees of the

taxpayer at all times during so much of the year of income as occurred when

the taxpayer was an employer;

    (ii) apart from subsection (2) and this subsection, deductions are

allowable to the taxpayer, or to one or more associates of the taxpayer, under

subsection (1) for contributions made in the year of income in respect of the

employees who filled those positions; or

  (e) if the year of income is a later year of income-the amount calculated

using that formula subject to the indexation arrangements set out in

subsection (2E).

  &quot;(2E) The formula in subsection (2D) applies for the 1995-96 year of income

or a later year of income as if the indexable amount were replaced by the

amount worked out using the formula:

         Indexation factor   x   Previous indexable amount

where:

  'Indexation factor' means the indexation factor for the year of income

worked out under section 159SG;

  'Previous indexable amount' means the indexable amount for the previous year

of income.

  &quot;(2F) In subsection (2E):

  'indexable amount' means:

  (a) an amount of $25,000 specified in the formula in subsection (2D); or

  (b) if that amount has previously been altered under subsection (2E)-the

altered amount.

  &quot;(2G) An election by a taxpayer under subsection (2D) must be made before:

  (a) the date of lodgment of the taxpayer's return of income for the year of

income to which the election relates; or

  (b) such later date as the Commissioner allows.

  &quot;(2H) For the purposes of subsection (2D), if:

  (a) at a particular time ('cessation time'), an employee of an employer

ceases to fill an employee position under the employer; and

  (b) at a later time, the employee position is filled by another employee of

the employer; and

  (c) the period:

    (i) beginning at the cessation time; and

    (ii) ending at that later time;

does not exceed 3 months;

the employee position is taken to have been filled by an employee of the

employer at all times during that period.&quot;.

TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (SUPERANNUATION) ACT 1992 No. 208 of 1992

- SECT 5

Deductions for superannuation contributions by eligible persons

  5\. Section 82AAT of the Principal Act is amended by omitting subsection (2)

and substituting the following subsections:

  &quot;(2) The total of the deductions allowable to a taxpayer under this section

for a year of income must not exceed the lesser of the following:

  (a) the sum of:

    (i) $3,000; and

    (ii) 75% of the amount (if any) by which the total amount of the

contributions exceeds $3,000;

  (b) the taxpayer's deduction limit for the year of income (worked out under

subsection (2A)).

  &quot;(2A) A taxpayer's deduction limit for a year of income is worked out:

  (a) by identifying the day in the year of income, or the last day in the

year of income, on which the taxpayer made a contribution to a fund, where a

deduction would have been allowable to the taxpayer under this section in

respect of the contribution (assuming that subsections (1A) and (2) had not

been enacted); and

  (b) by working out the age reached by the taxpayer as at the end of that

day; and

  (c) if the year of income is the 1994-95 year of income-by applying the

following table:

         Age in years           Deduction limit

Division is inserted:

         &quot;Division 14-Reasonable benefit limits (RBLs)

     &quot;Subdivision A-Objects, simplified outline and example

Objects of Division

  &quot;140\. The objects of this Division are:

  (a) to provide for a system of reasonable benefit limits (RBLs) applicable

to certain eligible termination payments (ETPs), superannuation pensions and

annuities; and

  (b) to require the payer of such an ETP, pension or annuity to give the

Commissioner information about the ETP, pension or annuity; and

  (c) to provide for the Commissioner to determine the extent to which the

ETP, pension or annuity exceeds the recipient's RBLs; and

  (d) in the case of an ETP which exceeds the recipient's RBLs-to generate an

excessive component, which is included in assessable income under subsection

27B(3) and not subject to any concessional tax treatment; and

  (e) in the case of a pension or annuity which exceeds the recipient's

RBLs-to generate an excessive amount, which is used to work out the proportion

(if any) of the pension or annuity that is rebatable under Subdivision AAB of

Division 17.

Simplified outline (Outline)

  &quot;140A.(1) The following is a simplified outline of the scheme of this

Division.

(Step 1-payer of ETP, pension or annuity notifies Commissioner)

  &quot;(2) The payer of an ETP, superannuation pension or annuity must give the

Commissioner information about the ETP, pension or annuity (section 140M).

The payer is not required to notify the Commissioner if the ETP, pension or

annuity does not count towards the recipient's RBLs.  Section 140ZC sets out

the benefits which count towards the recipient's RBLs.  The payer is taken not

to have paid an ETP to the extent to which the ETP is rolled-over (section

140D).

(Step 2-Commissioner determines extent to which the ETP, pension or annuity

exceeds the recipient's RBLs)

  &quot;(3) Subdivision D provides for the Commissioner to determine the extent to

which the ETP, pension or annuity exceeds the recipient's RBLs.

(Step 3-Method of determining extent to which the ETP, pension or annuity

('current benefit') exceeds the recipient's RBLs)

         Current benefit in excess of recipient's RBLs

                         TABLE OMITTED

       Current benefit not in excess of recipient's RBLs

                         TABLE OMITTED

  &quot;(4) The method of determining the extent to which the ETP, pension or

annuity ('current benefit') exceeds the recipient's RBLs is set out in section

140ZA.  The method may be summarised as follows:

  (a) work out the RBL amount of the ETP, pension or annuity (see Subdivision

H);

  (b) work out the sum of the adjusted RBL amounts of previous benefits (see

subsections 140ZA(4) and (5));

  (c) work out whether the ETP, pension or annuity is to be assessed against

the recipient's lump sum RBL or the recipient's pension RBL (see subsection

140ZA(3) and section 140ZF);

  (d) work out the amount of whichever of the lump sum RBL or the pension RBL

is applicable (see Subdivision G);

  (e) apply the RBL formula set out in subsection 140ZA(3), namely:

    RBL amount of       Sum of adjusted       Applicable

    current benefit  +  RBL amounts of     -  RBL

                        previous benefits

  (f) if the amount ('formula amount') calculated using the RBL formula

exceeds 0, then:

    (i) the ETP, pension or annuity exceeds the recipient's RBLs; and

    (ii) the amount of that excess is equal to so much of the RBL

amount of the ETP, pension or annuity as does not exceed the formula amount;

  (g) if the formula amount does not exceed 0, the ETP, pension or annuity is

not in excess of the recipient's RBLs.

Example of how to determine whether a benefit is in excess of the recipient's

RBLs

(Typical example)

  &quot;140B.(1) This section sets out how to determine whether a benefit exceeds

the recipient's RBLs in a typical case involving a 61-year old person who

receives a retirement lump sum (ETP) from an employer-sponsored superannuation

fund.  The person retires on31 December 1994 at the end of a 10-year period of

employment.  All contributions to the superannuation fund were made by the

person's employer.  The amount of the ETP is $500,000.  The ETP consists

wholly of the taxed element of the post-June 83 component of the ETP.  The

person has not received any previous benefits which count towards the person's

RBLs.

The person is considering the following options:

  (a) taking the whole of the ETP (and not rolling-over any of the ETP);

  (b) rolling-over the whole of the ETP in the purchase from a life assurance

company of an annuity which meets the pension and annuity standards.

(Option (a)-taking the whole of the ETP (and not rolling-over any of the

ETP))

  &quot;(2) If the person takes the whole of the ETP (and does not roll-over any of

the ETP), the RBL amount of the ETP is $500,000(section 140ZH). The ETP will

be assessed against the person's lump sum RBL ($400,000 for 1994-95).  The

result of applying the RBL formula is as follows:

           $500,000  +  0  -  $400,000  =  $100,000

$100,000 exceeds 0, so the ETP is in excess of the person's RBLs.  The amount

of that excess is $100,000.

(Option (b)-rolling-over the ETP in the purchase from a life assurance company

of an annuity which meets the pension and annuity standards)

  &quot;(3) If the person rolls-over the ETP in the purchase from a life assurance

company of an annuity which meets the pension and annuity standards, the

benefit to be assessed against the person's RBLs is the annuity instead of the

ETP.  The RBL amount of the annuity is $500,000, that is, the amount of the

ETP rolled-over to purchase the annuity (section 140ZM).  The annuity is

assessed against the person's pension RBL ($800,000 for 1994-95).  The result

of applying the RBL formula is as follows:

          $500,000  +  0  -  $800,000  =  -$300,000

Since the amount calculated using the RBL formula does not exceed 0, the

annuity is not in excess of the person's RBLs.

Interim determinations

(Commissioner to make interim determination)

  &quot;140T.(1) Subject to subsection (2) (which deals with non-quotation of tax

file numbers), if:

  (a) the Commissioner, having received a notice under subsection 140M(1):

    (i) is required to make a final determination in relation to an

ETP or the payment of a superannuation pension or an annuity; or

    (ii) would have been required to make such a final determination

if subsection 140R(4) (which deals with tax file numbers) had not been

enacted; and

  (b) either:

    (i) the Commissioner does not have sufficient information to make

the determination; or

    (ii) the notice does not specify the tax file number of the person

whose tax file number may be quoted to the payer concerned under section

140N;

the Commissioner must, within 60 days after receiving the notice, make an

interim determination of:

  (c) whether the ETP, pension or annuity is in excess of the recipient's

RBLs; and

  (d) if the ETP, pension or annuity is in excess of the recipient's RBLs:

    (i) the extent to which it is in excess of the recipient's RBLs;

rebatable ETP annuity-the rebatable proportion of the pension or annuity.

(Where tax file number not specified)

  &quot;(2) If the notice does not specify the recipient's tax file number, then,

in spite of any other provision of this Division, the Commissioner's interim

determination must be to the effect that:

  (a) the whole of the RBL amount of the ETP, pension or annuity is in excess

of the recipient's RBLs; and

  (b) in the case of a rebatable superannuation pension or a rebatable ETP

annuity-the rebatable proportion of the pension or annuity is 0.

(Interim determination that benefit is not in excess of RBLs to take effect as

final determination)

  &quot;(3) If an interim determination is to the effect that a benefit is not in

excess of the recipient's RBLs, the interim determination has effect as if it

were a final determination.

Interim determination may be made on certain assumptions

  &quot;140U. In making an interim determination:

  (a) if the Commissioner does not know:

    (i) whether a reversion applies to a superannuation pension

payable to a person; or

    (ii) the level of a reversion that applies to a superannuation

pension payable to a person;

the Commissioner is to assume that a reversion of 85% applies to the pension;

and

  (b) if the Commissioner does not know the rate (if any) at which a

superannuation pension is indexed-the Commissioner is to assume that the

pension is indexed in a year at the standard indexation rate determined under

section 140V; and

  (c) if the Commissioner does not know whether a superannuation pension is a

rebatable superannuation pension-the Commissioner is to assume that it is;

and

  (d) if the Commissioner does not know whether a benefit has been, or is

being, paid as a result of the death of another person-the Commissioner is to

assume that it has not been, or is not being, so paid; and

  (e) if the Commissioner does not know whether a superannuation pension or

annuity meets the pension and annuity standards-the Commissioner is to assume

that it does not; and

  (f) if the Commissioner does not know whether an ETP is made as a result of

the commutation of, or the residual capital value of, a superannuation pension

or annuity that had commenced to be paid-the Commissioner is to assume that it

is not; and

  (g) if the Commissioner does not know whether a superannuation pension or an

annuity payable to a person as the result of the death of another person is

payable as a reversion of another superannuation pension or annuity that was

already payable to the other person-the Commissioner is to assume that it is

not; and

  (h) if the Commissioner does not know if a superannuation pension is payable

for life-the Commissioner is to assume that it is.

Commissioner may determine standard indexation rate

  &quot;140V. Before a particular financial year, the Commissioner may determine

the standard indexation rate applicable to that financial year for the

purposes of this Division.

approved by the Commissioner) in which the person may provide that additional

information; and

    (iii) if the additional information is, or includes, the person's

tax file number-advising the person that, because the Commissioner has not

been notified of the person's tax file number, the interim determination is to

the effect that:

      (A) the whole of the RBL amount of the benefit is in excess of

the person's RBLs; and

      (B) if the benefit is a rebatable superannuation pension or a

rebatable ETP annuity-the rebatable proportion of the pension or annuity is

0.

(Determination that benefit is not in excess of a person's RBLs)

  &quot;(2) Whenever the Commissioner makes a final determination or an interim

determination to which subsection (1) does not apply, the Commissioner may, if

          &quot;Subdivision E-When benefits exceed recipient's RBLs

When benefits exceed recipient's RBLs

(When benefits not in excess of recipient's RBLs)

  &quot;140ZA.(1) If:

  (a) a benefit ('current benefit') does not count towards the recipient's

RBLs; or

  (b) the amount calculated in relation to the current benefit using the RBL

formula in subsection (3) does not exceed 0;

the benefit is not in excess of the recipient's RBLs.

(When benefits in excess of recipient's RBLs)

  &quot;(2) If:

  (a) section 140M applies to a benefit ('current benefit'); and

  (b) the amount calculated in relation to the current benefit using the RBL

formula in subsection (3) exceeds 0;

then:

  (c) the current benefit is in excess of the recipient's RBLs; and

  (d) the amount of that excess is equal to so much of the RBL amount of the

current benefit as does not exceed the amount calculated using that formula.

(RBL formula)

  &quot;(3) This is the RBL formula mentioned in subsections (1) and (2):

    RBL amount of       Sum of adjusted RBL amounts  -  Applicable RBL

    current benefit  +  of previous benefits

where:

  'RBL amount of current benefit' means the RBL amount of the current

benefit;

  'Sum of adjusted RBL amounts of previous benefits' has the meaning given by

subsection (4);

  'Applicable RBL' means:

  (a) if the current benefit is to be assessed against the recipient's lump

sum RBL for the year of income in which the current benefit was paid or

commenced to be paid-that lump sum RBL; or

  (b) in any other case-the recipient's pension RBL for the year of income in

which the current benefit was paid or commenced to be paid.

(Sum of adjusted RBL amounts of previous benefits)

  &quot;(4) The sum of the adjusted RBL amounts of previous benefits is worked out

by:

  (a) calculating the following amount for each benefit that was previously

received by the recipient:

                               Index number for

                               second-last quarter

    RBL amount     x           Index number for

                               payment quarter

where:

  'RBL amount' means the RBL amount of the benefit, reduced by any excessive

component or excessive amount;

  'Index number for second-last quarter' means the index number for the

quarter 2 quarters before the quarter in which the current benefit was paid or

in which the commencement day of the current benefit occurred;

  'Index number for payment quarter' means the index number for the quarter in

which the previous benefit was paid or in which the commencement day of the

previous benefit occurred; and

  (b) by adding the amounts calculated under paragraph (a).

(No indexation if previous benefits paid within 12 months of current benefit)

  &quot;(5) If the current benefit is paid or commences to be paid within 12 months

of the payment of a previous benefit or of the commencement day of a previous

benefit, the formula in paragraph (4)(a) applies to the previous benefit as if

both of the index numbers were 1.

Discretion to treat benefits as within recipient's RBLs

  &quot;140ZB. If:

  (a) the whole or a part of an ETP, a superannuation pension or an annuity

would, apart from this section, exceed the recipient's RBLs; and

  (b) the Commissioner is satisfied that, because of the special circumstances

of the case, the whole or a part of the ETP, pension or annuity should be

treated as if it were not in excess of the recipient's RBLs;

the Commissioner may make a final determination or an interim determination

accordingly.

specifies, as the percentage referred to in paragraph 23(2)(b), the percentage

that represents the contribution amount as a proportion of the employee's

notional earnings base in relation to the contribution period for the purposes

of subsection 23(2).

  &quot;(3) Subject to subsection (4), the employee's notional earnings base in

relation to a contribution period for the purposes of subsection 23(2) is the

adjustment earnings in respect of that period.
