  (b)  at such rate of interest as is, or such rates of interest as are,

applicable for the purposes of section 10 of the Taxation (Interest on

subsection called the `principal amounts'):

  (a)  the distributed amount of the non-resident trust's year of income;

income of a taxpayer of a year of income under section 99B in relation to a

trust estate is attributable to an amount (in this subsection called the

`trust amount') covered by subparagraph (1) (b) (i) or (ii) is to be

determined in accordance with the following paragraphs:

(in this paragraph called the `adjusted section 99B amount'), being so much of

the section 99B amount as is attributable to the income and profits of the

trust estate of the non-resident trust's year of income, represents eligible

designated concession income in relation to any listed country in relation to

the non-resident trust's year of income is calculated using the formula:

non-resident trust's year of income;

Total income means the number of dollars in the income and profits of the

trust estate of the non-resident trust's year of income;

  (c)  if subparagraph (1) (b) (ii) applies - the extent to which the amount

(in this paragraph called the `adjusted section 99B amount'), being so much of

the section 99B amount as is attributable to the income and profits of the

trust estate of the non-resident trust's year of income, represents income and

profits that have not been subject to tax in a listed country in a tax

accounting period mentioned in that subparagraph is calculated using the

     section 99B       x       Untaxed income

     amount                    Total income

where:

Adjusted section 99B amount means the adjusted section 99B amount;

Untaxed income means the number of dollars in the amount, being so much of the

income and profits of the trust estate of the non-resident trust's year of

income as is not subject to tax in any listed country in a tax accounting

period mentioned in that subparagraph;

Total income means the number of dollars in the income and profits of the

trust estate of the non-resident trust's year of income.

  &quot;(8) For the purposes of subsection (7), an amount of income or profits of a

trust estate is to be taken to be distributed if the amount is paid to, or

applied for the benefit of (within the meaning of section 99B), a beneficiary

of the trust estate.

  &quot;(9) Where, apart from this subsection, the amount of interest that would be

payable under this section by a taxpayer in respect of the distributed amount

of a non-resident trust's year of income, or in respect of the taxpayer's

portion of the distributed amount of a non-resident trust's year of income, is

less than 50 cents, interest is not payable by the taxpayer under this

section.

  &quot;(10) For the purposes of this section, the applicable rate of tax in

relation to a taxpayer is:

  (a)  if the taxpayer is a company (other than a company in the capacity of a

trustee) - the general company tax rate (within the meaning of Part IIIAA) for

the year of tax to which the assessment year of income relates; or

  (b)  in any other case - the maximum rate specified in Column 2 of the table

in Part I of Schedule 7 of the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 that applies for the

assessment year of income.

  &quot;(11) For the purposes of the application of this section to a taxpayer, the

assessment year of income is:

  (a)  if subsection (2) or (3) applies - the current year of income; or

  (b)  if subsection (4) applies - the year of income referred to in

subparagraph (4) (b) (i).

  &quot;(12) The Commissioner must make an assessment of the interest payable by a

taxpayer under this section.

  &quot;(13) Nothing in this Act precludes notice of an assessment made in respect

of a taxpayer under subsection (12) from being incorporated in a notice of any

other assessment made in respect of the taxpayer under this Act.

  &quot;(14) Unless the contrary intention appears, in sections 170, 172, 174, 201,

204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 214, 215, 216, 254, 255, 258, 259 and 265, but

relation to the underlying transfer;

        (D) it is not the case that the sole purpose of

the underlying transfer was the acquisition of units in the trust estate where

the parties to the underlying transfer were at arm's length with each other in

relation to the underlying transfer and the trust estate was a public unit

trust at all times during the entity's current year of income when the trust

estate was in existence; and

  (b)  if the entity is a natural person (other than a natural person in the

capacity of a trustee):

  (i)  if:

  (A)  the natural person first commenced to be a resident of Australia at a

time (in this subparagraph called the `first residence time') after the IP

time and before the end of the entity's current year of income; and

  (B)  the transfer, or each of the transfers, covered by paragraph (a) was

made before the first residence time;

the trust estate was not a non-resident family trust in relation to the

natural person at all times:

  (C)  after the beginning of the first year of income of the natural person

after the first residence time; and

  (D)  before the end of the entity's current year of income;

       when the trust estate was in existence; or

  (ii)  in any other case - the trust estate was not a non-resident family

trust in relation to the natural person at all times after the beginning of

the year of income of the taxpayer commencing on 1 July 1990 and before the

end of the entity's current year of income when the trust estate was in

existence; and

  (c)  it is not the case that:

  (i)  the entity is a natural person (other than a natural person in the

capacity of a trustee) who first commenced to be a resident of Australia at a

time (in this paragraph called the `first residence time') after the IP time

and before the end of the entity's current year of income; and

  (ii)  the transfer was made before the first residence time; and

  (iii)  the entity was not in a position to control the trust estate at any

time during the period:

  (A)  commencing at the beginning of the first year of income of the entity

after the first residence time; and

  (B)  ending at the end of the entity's current year of income.

  &quot;(2) For the purposes of this section, if:

  (a)  an entity (in this subsection called the `transferor') being a

partnership is an attributable taxpayer in relation to the entity's current

year of income and in relation to a particular trust estate (in this

subsection called the `transferee trust estate') because of one or more

transfers (being actual transfers or transfers taken to have been made because

of subsection 102AAK (1), (2) or (5)) of property or services made by the

transferor to the transferee trust estate; or

  (b)  an entity (in this subsection also called the `transferor') being a

trust estate is an attributable taxpayer in relation to the entity's current

year of income and in relation to another trust estate (in this subsection

also called the `transferee trust estate') because of one or more transfers

(being actual transfers or transfers taken to have been made because of

subsection 102AAK (1), (2) or (5)) of property or services made by the

transferor to the transferee trust estate;

the question whether any other entity is an attributable taxpayer in relation

to the same year of income and in relation to the transferee trust estate is

to be determined as if:

  (c)  if paragraph (a) applies - subsection 102AAK (6) did not apply in

relation to any of the transfers mentioned in that paragraph; or

  (d)  if paragraph (b) applies - subsection 102AAK (8) did not apply in

relation to any of the transfers mentioned in that paragraph.

  &quot;(3) If:

  (a)  apart from this subsection, an entity, being a natural person (other

than a natural person in the capacity of a trustee), is not an attributable

taxpayer in relation to the entity's current year of income and in relation to

a trust estate; and

  (b)  apart from paragraph (1) (b), the entity would have been such an

attributable taxpayer; and

  (c)  apart from subparagraph 102AAH (2) (b) (i) or (3) (a) (ii), the trust

estate was not a non-resident family trust in relation to the natural person

at some time after the entity's current year of income when the natural person

was alive and the trust estate was in existence;

the following provisions have effect:

  (d)  subsection (1) has effect as if paragraph (1) (b) had applied;

  (e)  section 170 does not prevent the amendment of an assessment at any time

for the purposes of giving effect to this subsection.

  &quot;(4) If:

  (a)  apart from this subsection, an entity is not an attributable taxpayer

in relation to the entity's current year of income and in relation to a trust

estate; and

  (b)  apart from sub-subparagraph (1) (a) (i) (E) or (F) or paragraph (1)

        (c), the entity would have been such an attributable taxpayer; and

  (c)  the entity was in a position to control the trust estate at some time

after the entity's current year of income when the trust estate was in

existence;

the following provisions have effect:

  (d)  subsection (1) has effect as if sub-subparagraph (1) (a) (i) (E) or (F)

or paragraph (1) (c), as the case may be, had applied;

  (e)  section 170 does not prevent the amendment of an assessment at any time

for the purposes of giving effect to this subsection.

Attributable income of a trust estate

  &quot;102AAU. (1) Subject to this Subdivision, the attributable income of a

non-resident trust estate of a year of income is:

  (a)  if the non-resident trust estate is not a listed country trust estate

in relation to the year of income - the net income of the non-resident trust

estate of the year of income; or

  (b)  if the non-resident trust estate is a listed country trust estate in

relation to the year of income - the amount that would have been the net

income of the non-resident trust estate of the year of income if the exempt

income of the trust estate included all income and profits of the trust estate

other than eligible designated concession income in relation to any listed

country in relation to the year of income;

reduced by:

  (c)  so much (if any) of the amount covered by paragraph (a) or (b) as

represents:

     (i)  an amount:

        (A) that is or has been included in the

assessable income of a beneficiary under section 97; or

        (B) in respect of which the trustee of the

non-resident trust estate is or has been assessed and liable to pay tax under

section 98, 99 or 99A; or

     (ii)  an amount:

        (A) that is paid to a beneficiary, being a

resident of a listed country, during the period of 13 months commencing at the

beginning of the year of income; and

  (B)  subject to tax in a listed country in a tax accounting period ending

before the end of the year of income or commencing during the year of income;

or

     (iii)  an amount that consists of, or is

attributable to, so much of a frankable dividend (within the meaning of Part

IIIAA) as has been franked in accordance with section 160AQF; or

     (iv)  an amount that is included in the assessable

income of the trustee of the trust estate under section 160AQT; or

     (v)  if an amount is or has been included in the

assessable income of any taxpayer under section 102AAZD because the taxpayer

is an attributable taxpayer in relation to any year of income (in this

subparagraph called the `taxpayer's year of income') and in relation to a

trust estate other than the non-resident trust estate - so much of an amount

paid to the trustee of the non-resident trust estate as represents the

attributable income of that other trust estate of the taxpayer's year of

income; or

  (vi)  if:

  (A)  one or more amounts (in this subparagraph called the `section 458

amounts') are included in the assessable incomes of one or more taxpayers

under section 458 in respect of a dividend paid by a CFC; and

  (B)  the assessable income of the trust estate of the year of income

includes an amount that is attributable (either directly or indirectly through

one or more interposed partnerships or trusts) to the payment of the

dividend;

the total of the section 458 amounts; or

  (vii)  if:

  (A)  an attribution account payment is made to the trustee of the trust

estate during the year of income; and

  (B)  the making of the attribution account payment gives rise to an

attribution debit, in relation to any taxpayer, for the entity making the

payment;

the amount of the attribution debit; or

  (viii)  an amount of income or profits of the trust estate:

  (A)  that is subject to tax in any listed country in a tax accounting period

ending before the end of the year of income or commencing during the year of

income; and

  (B)  that is not eligible designated concession income in relation to any

listed country in relation to the year of income; and

  (d)  so much of any foreign tax or Australian tax paid by the trustee or a

beneficiary as is attributable to so much of the amount covered by paragraph

        (a) or (b), as the case requires, as remains after the reduction or 

reductions covered by paragraph (c).

  &quot;(2) The attributable income of a resident trust estate of a year of income

is 0.

  &quot;(3) For the purposes of sub-subparagraph (1) (c) (ii) (A), a beneficiary is

to be taken to be a resident of a listed country if, and only if, the

beneficiary is treated as a resident of the listed country for the purposes of

the tax law of the listed country.

  &quot;(4) If the tax law of a listed country adopts some criterion other than

treatment as a resident as the criterion for applying a worldwide source tax

base to a beneficiary, then, subsection (3) has effect, in relation to that

tax law, as if that criterion were the same as treatment as a resident of the

listed country for the purposes of that tax law.

  &quot;(5) For the purposes of this section, where, because of section 101, a

beneficiary is presently entitled to a particular amount, the amount is taken

to have been paid to the beneficiary.

  &quot;(6) For the purposes of this section, the extent to which an amount

referred to in subparagraph (1) (c) (i) or (ii) (in this subsection called the

`taxed amount') represents the amount covered by paragraph (1) (b) (in this

subsection called the `listed country trust amount') is calculated using the

formula:

Taxed amount

                                 Listed country

         Taxed amount    x       trust amount

                                 --------------

                                 Net income

where:

Taxed amount means the taxed amount;

Listed country trust amount means the number of dollars in the listed country

trust amount;

Net income means the number of dollars in the net income of the non-resident

trust estate concerned of the year of income concerned.

Double tax agreements to be disregarded

  &quot;102AAV. In calculating the attributable income of a trust estate, the

Income Tax (International Agreements) Act 1953 is to be disregarded, except

for the purpose of references in this Act to that Act.

Certain provisions to be disregarded in calculating attributable income

  &quot;102AAW. For the purpose of applying this Act in calculating the

attributable income of a trust estate, sections 20, 23AI, 38 to 43

        (inclusive), 128D, 456, 457, 458 and 459 are to be disregarded.

Income and expenses to be expressed in Australian currency

  &quot;102AAX. (1) For the purpose of applying this Act in calculating the

attributable income of a trust estate of a year of income, any amount (in this

section called an `eligible amount') of income wherever derived or of

expenditure wherever incurred is to be expressed in Australian currency.

  &quot;(2) Where, according to the accounts of the trust estate that are used to

calculate the attributable income of the trust estate of the year of income,

some or all of the eligible amounts of the trust estate are not expressed in

Australian currency, then any such eligible amount is to be converted:

  (a)  if there is a single or predominant foreign currency in which the

eligible amounts of the trust estate are expressed in the accounts and

paragraph (b) does not apply:

  (i)  where the eligible amount is expressed in that currency - to Australian

currency at a rate equal to:

  (A)  if sub-subparagraph (B) does not apply - the average of the exchange

rates applicable from time to time during the year of income; or

  (B)  if the trustee of the trust estate elects in accordance with subsection

(3) - the exchange rate applicable on the last day of the year of income; or

  (ii)  in any other case - first to the single or predominant currency using

any reasonable method and then to Australian currency in accordance with

whichever of sub-subparagraph (i) (A) or (B) applies; or

  (b)  if the eligible amount is an amount of foreign tax paid by the trustee

of the trust estate:

  (i)  if the foreign tax was paid by deduction from another amount - to

Australian currency, or to another currency and then to Australian currency,

according to the method applicable under paragraph (a) or (c) for the

conversion of the amount from which it was deducted; or

  (ii)  in any other case - to Australian currency at the rate of exchange

applicable at the time when the foreign tax was paid; or

  (c)  if neither paragraph (a) or (b) applies - to Australian currency using

any reasonable method.

  &quot;(3) The trustee of the trust estate may elect that sub-subparagraph (2) (a)

        (i) (B) is to apply in relation to the trust estate.

  &quot;(4) An election under subsection (3):

  (a)  must be in writing; and

  (b)  must be lodged with the Commissioner before the end of the period of 30

days after the end of the year of income concerned, or within such further

period as the Commissioner allows.

  &quot;(5) Where the trustee of the trust estate does so, that sub-subparagraph

applies instead of sub-subparagraph (2) (a) (i) (A) in calculating the

attributable income of the trust estate for the year of income and for all

subsequent years of income.

Modified application of trading stock provisions

  &quot;102AAY. For the purpose of applying this Act in calculating the

attributable income of the trust estate, Subdivision B of Division 2 of Part

III has effect as if the value of the article of trading stock to be taken

into account at the beginning of the year of income were its cost price.

Modified application of depreciation provisions

  &quot;102AAZ. (1) For the purpose of determining the attributable income of a

trust estate of a year of income (in this section called the `attributable

year of income'), where property has been held by the trustee of the trust

estate in a non-attributable year of income before the attributable year of

income, then, in relation to the application of a depreciation provision to

the property, subsection (2) applies.

  &quot;(2) Such amount as the Commissioner considers appropriate to take account

of the holding of the property as mentioned in subsection (1) is, under the

depreciation provision:

  (a)  an allowable deduction to the trustee of the trust estate; or

  (b)  included in the assessable income of the trust estate;

as the case requires, for the attributable year of income in substitution for

any amount that would otherwise be so included or allowable.

  &quot;(3) For the purpose of exercising the Commissioner's power under subsection

(2) in relation to deductions allowable under sections 54 to 62 (inclusive),

the Commissioner must assume that the property was used by the trustee of the

trust estate during any non-attributable year of income wholly and exclusively

for the purpose of producing assessable income.

Modified application of Division 13 of Part III

  &quot;102AAZA. In calculating the attributable income of a trust estate of a year

of income:

  (a)  for the purposes of section 136AC, if the trust estate is a

non-resident trust estate in relation to the year of income - the trustee is

taken to be a non-resident, within the meaning of that section, without regard

to the assumption about the trustee's residence that is made in whichever of

the following provisions is applicable:

  (i)  the definition of `net income' in subsection 95 (1);

  (ii)  the definition of `net income' in subsection 102D (1);

  (iii) the definition of `net income' in section 102M;

  (iv)  section 272; and

  (b)  section 136AF applies as if:

  (i)  the reference in subsection 136AF (1) to the application of section

136AD in relation to a taxpayer were a reference both to:

  (A)  the application of that section in relation to any trust estate in

calculating its attributable income or in relation to any CFC in calculating

its attributable income under Division 7 of Part X; and

  (B)  the actual application of that section in relation to any taxpayer in

calculating the taxable income of the taxpayer apart from this Division; and

  (ii)  the references in paragraphs 136AF (1) (a) and (b) to assessable

income or allowable deductions in relation to the relevant taxpayer were

references to assessable income, or to allowable deductions, taken into

account in calculating the attributable income of the trust estate.

Modified application of Part IIIA

  &quot;102AAZB. For the purposes of applying this Act in calculating the

attributable income of a trust estate, Part IIIA applies as if:

  (a)  the following provisions were disregarded:

  (i)  subsections 160M (13) and (14);

  (ii) subsection 160Z (6) and paragraph 160Z (9) (c); and

  (b)  the trust estate were a resident trust estate, or a resident unit

trust, as the case may be.

Modified application of loss provisions - pre-1990-91 losses

  &quot;102AAZC. (1) In calculating the attributable income of a trust estate of a

year of income, no deductions are allowable under section 79E, 79F, 80, 80AAA

or 80AA in respect of losses of a year of income earlier than the year of

income commencing on 1 July 1990.

  &quot;(2) In calculating the attributable income of a trust estate of a year of

income, section 160AFD does not apply to an overall foreign loss incurred in a

year of income earlier than the year of income commencing on 1 July 1990.

Assessable income of attributable taxpayer to include attributable income of

trust estate to which taxpayer has transferred property or services

  &quot;102AAZD. (1) Subject to section 102AAZE and to this section, if:

  (a)  an entity is an attributable taxpayer:

  (i)  in relation to the year of income of the taxpayer commencing on 1 July

1990 (which year of income is in this section called the `taxpayer's current

year of income') or in relation to a subsequent year of income of the taxpayer

(which year of income is in this section also called the `taxpayer's current

year of income'); and

  (ii)  in relation to a trust estate; and

  (b)  any part of a non-resident year of income of the trust estate occurs

during the taxpayer's current year of income; and

  (c)  the taxpayer is a resident at any time during the taxpayer's current

year of income; the assessable income of the taxpayer of the taxpayer's

current year of income includes:

  (d)  if the taxpayer is a resident at all times during the taxpayer's

current year of income - the whole of the notional attributable income of the

trust estate of the taxpayer's current year of income; or

  (e)  if the taxpayer is a resident for only part of the taxpayer's current

year of income - the amount calculated using the formula:

     Notional attributable income  x  Days in residency

period

     Notional attributable income  x   Days in year of

income

    where:

    Notional attributable income means the notional

attributable income of the trust estate of the taxpayer's current year of

income;

    Days in residency period means the number of whole

days during the taxpayer's current year of income when the taxpayer was a

resident;

    Days in year of income means the number of whole

days in the taxpayer's current year of income.

  &quot;(2) A reference in subsection (1) to the notional attributable income of

the trust estate of the taxpayer's current year of income is a reference to:

  (a)  if there is a year of income of the trust estate that begins at the

same time as the beginning of the taxpayer's current year of income - the

attributable income of the trust estate of that year of income; or

  (b)  in any other case - the amount obtained:

  (i)  by calculating, for each year of income of the trust estate (in this

paragraph called the `trust's year of income') any part of which occurs during

the taxpayer's current year of income, the amount calculated using the

formula:

       Attributable income      Days in overlapping period

                            X

                                Days in trust's year of income

       where:

Attributable income means the attributable income of the trust estate of the

trust's year of income;

Days in overlapping period means the number of whole days in the trust's year

of income that occurred during the taxpayer's current year of income;

Days in trust's year of income means the number of whole days in the trust's

year of income; and

  (ii)  by adding together the amounts calculated under subparagraph (i).

  &quot;(3) If:

  (a)  an amount is included in the assessable income of an attributable

taxpayer of the taxpayer's current year of income under subsection (1); and

  (b)  before or during the taxpayer's current year of income, one or more

entities other than the taxpayer have transferred property or services to the

trust estate concerned; and

  (c)  the taxpayer gives to the Commissioner, in accordance with the approved

form, such information in connection with the operation of this Division as is

required by the form to be set out;

the Commissioner may reduce the amount included in the taxpayer's assessable

income of the taxpayer's current year of income under subsection (1) having

regard to:

  (d)  the extent to which the attributable income of the trust estate is, in

the opinion of the Commissioner, attributable to property or services

transferred by the taxpayer; and

  (e)  such other matters as the Commissioner considers relevant.

  &quot;(4) If:

  (a)  apart from this subsection, an amount would be included in the

assessable income of an attributable taxpayer of the taxpayer's current year

of income under subsection (1) in relation to a particular trust estate; and

  (b)  the taxpayer could not reasonably be expected to obtain the information

required to determine the attributable income of the trust estate;

the following provisions have effect:

  (c)  no amount is to be included in the assessable income of the taxpayer of

the taxpayer's current year of income under subsection (1) in relation to the

trust estate;

  (d)  the assessable income of the taxpayer of the taxpayer's current year of

income includes the amount obtained:

      (i)  if any of the transfers that were taken into

account in determining whether the taxpayer was an attributable taxpayer in

relation to the taxpayer's current year of income and in relation to the trust

estate were made by the taxpayer to the trust estate after the IP time - by

calculating, for each such transfer, the amount calculated using the formula:

    Adjusted value        (      Weighted    )

    of the transfer       (statutory interest)

                          (      rate + 5%   )

where:

Adjusted value of the transfer has the meaning given by subsection (5);

Weighted statutory interest rate means the weighted statutory interest rate in

relation to the taxpayer's current year of income; and

     (ii)  if any of the transfers that were taken into

account in determining whether the taxpayer was an attributable taxpayer in

relation to the taxpayer's current year of income and in relation to the trust

estate were made by the taxpayer to the trust estate before the IP time - the

amount calculated using the formula:

      Adjusted net           (      Weighted    )

     worth of trust          (statutory interest)

        estate               (      rate + 5%   )

where:

Adjusted net worth of trust estate has the meaning given by subsection (6);

Weighted statutory interest rate means the weighted statutory interest rate in

relation to the taxpayer's current year of income; and

     (iii)  by adding together the amounts calculated

under subparagraphs (i) and (ii).

  &quot;(5) For the purposes of subsection (4), the adjusted value of a transfer of

property or services made by an attributable taxpayer to a trust estate is:

  (a)  if the transfer occurred during the taxpayer's current year of income -

the amount calculated using the formula:

   Market value of transferred   X     Days after transfer

   property or services                Days in year of income

where:

Market value of transferred property or services means the market value,

immediately before the transfer, of the property or services;

Days after transfer means the number of whole days in the taxpayer's current

year of income after the day on which the transfer took place;

Days in year of income means the number of whole days in the taxpayer's

current year of income; or

  (b)  if the transfer of the property or services occurred before the

taxpayer's current year of income - the sum of:

      (i)  the market value, immediately before the

transfer, of the property or services; and

     (ii)  the amount obtained:

        (A) by calculating, in respect of the transfer,

for each year of income preceding the taxpayer's current year of income, the

amount ascertained using the formula in subparagraph (4) (d) (i); and

        (B) by adding together the amounts calculated

under sub-subparagraph (A).

  &quot;(6) For the purposes of the application of subsection (4) in relation to a

transfer of property or services made by an attributable taxpayer to a trust

estate, the adjusted net worth of the trust estate is:

  (a)  if the taxpayer's current year of income is the year of income

commencing on 1 July 1990 - the 1 July 1990 net worth of the trust estate; or

  (b)  in any other case - the sum of:

      (i)  the 1 July 1990 net worth of the trust

estate; and

     (ii)  the amount obtained:

        (A) by calculating, in respect of the transfer,

for each year of income preceding the taxpayer's current year of income, the

amount ascertained using the formula in subparagraph (4) (d) (ii); and

        (B) by adding together the amounts calculated

under sub-subparagraph (A).

  &quot;(7) If:

  (a)  subsection (4) applies to an attributable taxpayer in relation to the

taxpayer's current year of income; and

  (b)  any of the transfers taken into account in determining whether the

taxpayer was an attributable taxpayer in relation to the taxpayer's year of

income and in relation to the trust estate concerned were made before the IP

time; and

  (c)  the taxpayer gives to the Commissioner, in accordance with the approved

form, such information in connection with the operation of this Division as is

required by the form to be set out;

the Commissioner may reduce the amount included in the taxpayer's assessable

income of the taxpayer's current year of income under subsection (4) having

regard to:

  (d)  the extent to which the market value, as at the beginning of the

taxpayer's current year of income, of the assets of the trust estate is, in

the opinion of the Commissioner, attributable to property or services

transferred by the taxpayer before the IP time; and

  (e)  such other matters as the Commissioner considers relevant.

Accruals system of taxation does not apply to small amounts

  &quot;102AAZE. An amount is not to be included in the assessable income of the

taxpayer of a year of income under section 102AAZD in relation to a trust

estate that is a listed country trust estate in relation to the year of income

if the amount obtained by:

  (a)  identifying each trust estate in relation to which the taxpayer is an

attributable taxpayer in relation to the year of income; and

  (b)  calculating the attributable income of the year of income of each such

trust estate; and

  (c)  adding the amounts calculated under paragraph (b);

does not exceed the lesser of the following amounts:

  (d)  $20,000;

  (e)  10% of the total of the net incomes of each of those trust estates of

the year of income.

Only resident partners, beneficiaries etc. liable to be assessed as a result

of attribution

  &quot;102AAZF. Section 460 applies to an amount included in the assessable income

of a taxpayer under section 102AAZD in a corresponding way to the way in which

section 460 applies to an amount included in the assessable income of a

taxpayer under section 456, 457, 458 or 459 and, for the purposes of that

corresponding application, references in sections 336, 338 and 460 to a Part X

Australian resident are to be read as references to a resident within the

meaning of section 6.

Keeping of records

  &quot;102AAZG. (1) Subject to this section, a person who is an attributable

taxpayer:

  (a)  in relation to the year of income of the person commencing on 1 July

1990 or in relation to a subsequent year of income of the person; and

  (b)  in relation to a particular trust estate;

must keep records (in Australia or elsewhere) containing particulars of:

  (c)  the acts, transactions and other circumstances that resulted in the

person being an attributable taxpayer in relation to that year of income and

in relation to that trust estate; and

  (d)  except where subsection 102AAZD (4) applies in relation to the trust

estate and in relation to the year of income of the person - the basis of the

calculation of the attributable income of the trust estate for each year of

income of the trust estate any part of which occurred during the year of

income of the person; and

  (e)  the basis of the calculation of the amounts (including nil amounts)

  (b)  any losses under the same subsection are to be taken into account in

the order in which they were incurred.

  &quot;(4) Where the amount of a taxpayer's assessable foreign income of a

particular class of a year of income is reduced under subsection (1) or (2),

any foreign tax paid by the taxpayer in respect of the amount is, for the

purposes of this Act, to be calculated as if the amount were so reduced.

  &quot;(5) This section has effect whether or not the law of the foreign country

concerned allows the income of a taxpayer of a particular year to be reduced

because of losses incurred in previous years.

  &quot;(6) Where:

  (a)  apart from this subsection, an overall foreign loss in respect of a

class of assessable foreign income incurred by a taxpayer in respect of a year

of income would be taken into account for the purpose of applying subsection

(1) or (2) in relation to the particular year of income referred to in that

subsection; and

  (b)  if that loss were a loss incurred by the taxpayer within the meaning of

section 80, it would not, because of section 80A or 80DA, be taken into

account for the purpose of applying section 80 in relation to the particular

year of income;

then the overall foreign loss is not to be taken into account for the purpose

of applying subsection (1) or (2) of this section in relation to the

particular year of income.

  &quot;(7) Where:

  (a) there are one or more foreign income deductions of a taxpayer in

relation to a class of assessable foreign income in relation to a year of

income; and

  (b)  either:

      (i)  the taxpayer did not derive any assessable foreign

income of that class during the year of income; or

     (ii)  the taxpayer derived assessable foreign income of that

class during the year of income and its amount is exceeded by the sum of the

foreign income deductions;

the taxpayer is taken, for the purposes of this section, to have incurred an

overall foreign loss in respect of the class of assessable foreign income for

the year of income equal to:

  (c) where subparagraph (b) (i) applies - the amount of the deductions; or

  (d) where subparagraph (b) (ii) applies - the amount of the excess referred

to in that subparagraph.

  &quot;(8) For the purposes of this section, each of the following kinds of

assessable foreign income constitutes a single class:

  (a)  interest income;

  (b)  modified passive income;

  (c)  offshore banking income;

  (d)  all other assessable foreign income.

  &quot;(9) In this section:

`assessable foreign income', in relation to a taxpayer in relation to a year

of income, means:

  (a)  foreign income that is included in the assessable income of the

taxpayer of the year of income; or

  (b)  where:

  (i)  during the year of income, the taxpayer derives a profit or gain of a

capital nature from sources in a foreign country; and

  (ii)  the whole or part of the profit or gain is included in the assessable

income of the taxpayer of the year of income other than under Part IIIA;

the whole or the part of the profit or gain;

`foreign income deduction', in relation to a taxpayer in relation to a class

of assessable foreign income in relation to a year of income, means any

deduction that, disregarding section 79D, is allowed or allowable from the

assessable income of the taxpayer of the year of income, to the extent that

the deduction relates to assessable foreign income of that class of any year

of income;

`post-1989 year of income' means the year of income commencing on 1 July 1989

or any later year of income;

`pre-1990 year of income' means any year of income before the year of income

commencing on 1 July 1989.&quot;.

- SECT 35

Carry-forward and transfer of excess credits

  35\. Section 160AFE of the Principal Act is amended:

  (a)  by omitting subsection (1) and substituting the following subsections:

     &quot;(1) If:

     (a)  there is an initial credit shortfall for a

class of income of a taxpayer in relation to a year of income (in this

subsection called the `current year of income'); and

     (b)  either or both of the following conditions are

satisfied:

         (i)  there is a post-transfer excess credit

balance for the class of income of the taxpayer in relation to one or more

earlier years of income that is available for the current year of income;

        (ii)  one or more amounts that relate to that

class of income have been transferred to the taxpayer under subsection (1D)

for utilisation in the current year of income;

the taxpayer is to be taken to have utilised the following amounts, in the

following order, in the current year of income, to successively increase the

amount ascertained under paragraph 160AF (1) (c) (in the application of that

paragraph to the class of income of the taxpayer in relation to the current

year of income) to an amount not exceeding the Australian tax upper limit for

the class of income of the taxpayer in relation to the current year of

income:

     (c)  the post-transfer excess credit balance for

the class of income of the taxpayer in relation to the fifth year of income

before the current year of income, being the balance that is available for the

current year of income;

     (d)  the post-transfer excess credit balance for

the class of income of the taxpayer in relation to the fourth year of income

before the current year of income, being the balance that is available for the

current year of income;

     (e)  the post-transfer excess credit balance for

the class of income of the taxpayer in relation to the third year of income

before the current year of income, being the balance that is available for the

current year of income;

the class of income of the taxpayer in relation to the second year of income

before the current year of income, being the balance that is available for the

current year of income;

     (g)  the post-transfer excess credit balance for

the class of income of the taxpayer in relation to the year of income before

the current year of income, being the balance that is available for the

current year of income;

     (h)  any amounts that relate to that class of

income and that have been transferred to the taxpayer under subsection (1D)

for utilisation in the current year of income.

     &quot;(1A) For the purposes of the application of this

section in relation to a taxpayer, if:

     (a)  all of the foreign income derived by the

taxpayer in a year of income consists of income of a single class (within the

meaning of subsection 160AF (7)); and

     (b)  section 160AF applies in relation to the

taxpayer in relation to the year of income;

    section 160AF is to be taken to apply in relation to

that income as if the income were income of a particular class.

     &quot;(1B) For the purposes of the application of this

section in relation to a taxpayer, if section 160AF applies in relation to a

particular class of income of the taxpayer in relation to a year of income:

     (a)  the amount ascertained under paragraph 160AF

(1) (c) in that application (apart from this section) is the original foreign

tax upper limit for the class of income of the taxpayer in relation to the

year of income; and

     (b)  the amount ascertained under paragraph 160AF

(1) (d) in that application is the Australian tax upper limit for the class of

income of the taxpayer in relation to the year of income; and

     (c)  if the original foreign tax upper limit for

the class of income of the taxpayer in relation to the year of income exceeds

the Australian tax upper limit for the class of income of the taxpayer in

relation to the year of income - the amount of the excess is the initial

excess credit for the class of income of the taxpayer in relation to the year

of income; and

     (d)  if the original foreign tax upper limit for

the class of income of the taxpayer in relation to the year of income falls

short of the Australian tax upper limit for the class of income of the

taxpayer in relation to the year of income - the amount of the shortfall is

the initial credit shortfall for the class of income of the taxpayer in

relation to the year of income.

     &quot;(1C) For the purposes of the application of this

section in relation to a taxpayer, if there is an initial excess credit for a

class of income of the taxpayer in relation to a year of income (in this

subsection called the `original year of income'):

     (a)  the opening excess credit balance for the

class of income of the taxpayer in relation to the original year of income

that is available for a later year of income (in this paragraph called the

`current year of income'), being one of the 5 years of income after the

original year of income, is:

         (i)  if the current year of income is the first

year of income after the original year of income - the initial excess credit,

reduced by so much of the initial excess credit as is transferred by the

taxpayer under subsection (1D) for utilisation in the original year of income;

or

        (ii)  if the current year of income is a later

year of income - the closing excess credit balance for the class of income of

the taxpayer in relation to the original year of income that is available for

the previous year of income; and

     (b) the post-transfer excess credit balance for the

class of income of the taxpayer in relation to the original year of income

that is available for a later year of income (in this paragraph called the

`current year of income'), being one of the 5 years of income after the

original year of income, is the opening excess credit balance for the class of

income of the taxpayer in relation to the original year of income that is

available for the current year of income, reduced by so much of that opening

excess credit balance as is transferred by the taxpayer under subsection (1D)

for utilisation in the current year of income; and

     (c) the closing excess credit balance for the class

of income of the taxpayer in relation to the original year of income that is

available for a later year of income (in this paragraph called the `current

year of income'), being one of the 5 years of income after the original year

of income, is the post-transfer excess credit balance for the class of income

of the taxpayer in relation to the original year of income that is available

for the current year of income, reduced by so much of that post-transfer

excess credit balance as is taken to have been utilised in the current year of

income under subsection (1).

     &quot;(1D) For the purposes of this section, if:

     (a)  either of the following conditions are

satisfied in relation to an Australian company (in this section called the

`credit company') in relation to a year of income (in this subsection called

the `current year of income'):

         (i)  the credit company has an initial excess

credit in relation to a class of income of the Australian company in relation

to the current year of income;

        (ii)  the credit company has an opening excess

credit balance for a class of income of the credit company in relation to a

year of income earlier than the current year of income, being a balance that

is available for the current year of income; and

     (b)  section 160AF applies in relation to that

class of income of an Australian company (in this section called the `income

company') of the current year of income, being a company that is a group

company in relation to the credit company in relation to the current year of

income; and

     (c)  the credit company and the income company give

the Commissioner, on or before the date of lodgment of the return of income of

the income company for the current year of income or within such further time

as the Commissioner allows, a notice in writing signed by the public officer

of each of those companies, stating that the whole or a specified part of:

         (i)  the initial excess credit; or

        (ii)  the opening excess credit balance;

       as the case may be, should be transferred to the

income company for utilisation in the current year of income;

    the notice gives effect to the transfer concerned.

     &quot;(1E) Subsection (1D) applies only to the

following 2 classes of income:

     (a)  passive income;

     (b)  all other income other than offshore banking

income.&quot;;

  (b)  section 47A applies in relation to the disposal of the asset to deem

the transferor to have paid a dividend to the transferee; and

Offshore information notices

  &quot;264A. (1) Where the Commissioner has reason to believe that:

  (a)  information relevant to the assessment of a taxpayer is:

  (i)  within the knowledge (whether exclusive or otherwise) of a person

outside Australia; or

  (ii)  recorded (whether exclusively or otherwise) in a document outside

Australia; or

  (iii)  kept (whether exclusively or otherwise) by means of a mechanical,

electronic or other device outside Australia; or

  (b)  documents relevant to the assessment of a taxpayer are outside

Australia (whether or not copies are in Australia or, if the documents are

copies of other documents, whether or not those other documents are in

Australia);

the Commissioner may, by notice in writing served on the taxpayer (which

notice is in this section called the `offshore information notice'), request

the taxpayer:

  (c)  to give to the Commissioner, within the period and in the manner

specified in the offshore information notice, any such information; or

  (d)  to produce to the Commissioner, within the period and in the manner

specified in the offshore information notice, any such documents; or

  (e)  to make copies of any such documents and to produce to the

Commissioner, within the period and in the manner specified in the offshore

information notice, those copies.

  &quot;(2) The period specified in the offshore information notice must end 90

days after the date of service of the notice.

  &quot;(3) Upon written application made by the taxpayer within the period

specified in the offshore information notice, the Commissioner may, by notice

in writing served on the taxpayer, extend the period specified in the offshore

information notice.

  &quot;(4) Where:

  (a)  an application under subsection (3) is made before the end of the

period specified in the offshore information notice; and

  (b)  at the end of the period, the Commissioner has not notified the

taxpayer of the Commissioner's decision on the application;

the following provisions have effect:

  (c)  the Commissioner is taken to have extended the period under subsection

(3) to the end of the day (in this subsection called the `decision day') on

which the Commissioner's decision is notified to the taxpayer;

  (d)  if the Commissioner decides to extend the period - the extended period

must end after the decision day.

  &quot;(5) A reference in this section (other than subsection (3)) to the period

specified in the offshore information notice is a reference to the period as

extended under subsection (3).

  &quot;(6) Where:

  (a)  an offshore information notice (in this subsection called the `first

notice') was served on a taxpayer; and

  (b)  during the period specified in the first notice (including a period

specified by virtue of one or more previous applications of this subsection),

another offshore information notice (which other notice is in this subsection

called the `subsequent notice') is served on the taxpayer; and

  (c)  the subsequent notice is expressed to be by way of variation of the

first notice;

the following provisions have effect:

  (d)  the request, or each of the requests, set out in the subsequent notice

is taken, for the purposes of subsections (10), (11) and (14), to have been

set out in the first notice;

  (e)  if the period specified in the first notice would, apart from this

subsection, end before the end of the period specified in the subsequent

notice - the period specified in the first notice is taken to have been

extended under subsection (3) to the end of the period specified in the

subsequent notice.

  &quot;(7) The Commissioner may, by notice in writing served on the taxpayer, vary

the offshore information notice by:

  (a)  reducing its scope; or

  (b)  correcting a clerical error or obvious mistake;

and, if the Commissioner does so, a reference in this section to the offshore

information notice is to be read as a reference to the notice as so varied.

  &quot;(8) The Commissioner may withdraw an offshore information notice.

  &quot;(9) If the Commissioner withdraws an offshore information notice, nothing

in this section prevents the Commissioner giving another offshore information

notice in substitution, in whole or in part, for the withdrawn notice.

  &quot;(10) If the taxpayer refuses or fails to comply with the request or

requests set out in the offshore information notice, then, except with the

consent of the Commissioner:

  (a)  if the information or documents to which the request or requests apply

are only relevant to one issue concerning the assessment of the taxpayer:

  (i)  where the request, or any of the requests, apply to information - the

information is not admissible in proceedings disputing the taxpayer's

assessment; or

  (ii)  where the request, or any of the requests, apply to documents -

neither the documents, nor any secondary evidence of the documents, are

admissible in proceedings disputing the taxpayer's assessment; or

  (b)  if:

  (i)  the information or documents to which the request or requests apply are

relevant to 2 or more issues concerning the assessment of the taxpayer; and

  (ii)  the refusal or failure of the taxpayer relates to information or

documents that are relevant to any or all of those issues;

the following provisions have effect:

  (iii)  where the request, or any of the requests, apply to information - the

information, to the extent to which it is relevant to the issue or issues

mentioned in subparagraph (ii), is not admissible in proceedings disputing the

taxpayer's assessment;

  (iv)  where the request, or any of the requests, apply to documents -

neither:

  (A)  the documents, to the extent to which they are relevant to the issue or

issues mentioned in subparagraph (ii); nor

  (B)  secondary evidence of the documents, to the extent to which the

secondary evidence is relevant to the issue or issues mentioned in

subparagraph (ii);

are admissible in proceedings disputing the taxpayer's assessment.

  &quot;(11) Without limiting the power conferred by subsection (10), where:

  (a)  the taxpayer refuses or fails to comply with the request or requests

set out in the offshore information notice; and

  (b)  the refusal or failure of the taxpayer relates to some, but not all, of

the information or documents to which the request or requests apply and that

are relevant to a particular issue concerning the assessment of the taxpayer;

the Commissioner, in exercising that power, must have regard to whether there

is reason to believe that, because of the absence of that information or those

documents, the remaining information or documents that are relevant to that

far as that obligation relates to the secrecy of information or documents.

  &quot;(13) In spite of anything in this section, the Commissioner must give a

the taxpayer's assessment, the Commissioner forms both of the following

views:

subsection (10) in relation to that request or those requests and in relation

to those proceedings;

the Commissioner must serve on the taxpayer a notice in writing setting out

those views.

  &quot;(15) A failure to comply with subsection (14) does not affect the validity

of a decision under subsection (10).

  &quot;(16) A reference in this section to a refusal or failure of a taxpayer to

comply with a request includes a reference to a refusal or failure resulting

from the taxpayer being incapable of complying with the request.

  &quot;(17) A reference in this section to proceedings disputing the taxpayer's

assessment is a reference to proceedings before a court or the Tribunal

arising out of, or relating to, an objection against the assessment.

  &quot;(18) Nothing in this Act precludes an offshore information notice from

being set out in the same document as a notice under section 264.

  &quot;(19) An offshore information notice must set out the effect of subsection

(10).

  &quot;(20) A failure to comply with subsection (19) does not affect the validity

of the offshore information notice.

  &quot;(21) A request under this section is not taken to be a requirement for the

purposes of any other provision of this Act or of any provision of the

Taxation Administration Act 1953.

  &quot;(22) A refusal or failure to comply with a request set out in an offshore

information notice is not an offence.

  &quot;(23) The express references in this section to documents do not imply that

references to documents in any other provision of this Act, or in a provision

of the Taxation Administration Act 1953, do not have the meaning given by

section 25 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.

     &quot;Subdivision C - Eligible Transferors in relation to Trusts

Interpretation

  &quot;343\. In this Subdivision, unless the contrary intention appears:

`actual transfer', in relation to property or services, means a transfer of

the property or services other than a transfer that is taken to have been made

because of subsection 345 (1), (2), (5), (6), (8), (10) or (11);

`property' includes money;

`scheme' has the same meaning as in Division 6AAA of Part III;

`services' has the same meaning as in Division 6AAA of Part III;

`transfer' has the same meaning as in Division 6AAA of Part III;

`underlying transfer', in relation to a transfer of property or services to a

trust, means:

  (a)  if that transfer was an actual transfer - the actual transfer; or

  (b)  if that transfer was taken to have been made because of subsection 345

(1) - the actual transfer referred to in that subsection; or

  (c)  if that transfer was taken to have been made because of subsection 345

(2) - the actual transfer referred to in paragraph 345 (2) (d); or

  (d)  if that transfer was taken to have been made because of subsection 345

(5) - the actual transfer referred to in paragraph 345 (5) (b); or

  (e)  if that transfer was taken to have been made because of the application

of subsection 345 (6) or (8) to an actual transfer - the actual transfer; or

  (f)  if that transfer was taken to have been made because of the application

of subsection 345 (6) or (8) to a transfer that was taken to have been made

because of subsection 345 (1) - the actual transfer referred to in subsection

345 (1); or

  (g)  if that transfer was taken to have been made because of the application

of subsection 345 (6) or (8) to a transfer that was taken to have been made

because of subsection 345 (5) - the actual transfer referred to in paragraph

345 (5) (b); or

  (h)  if that transfer was taken to have been made because of subsection 345

(10) - the actual transfer referred to in paragraph 345 (10) (b); or

  (j)  if that transfer was taken to have been made because of one or more

applications of subsection 345 (11) to an actual transfer - the actual

transfer; or

  (k)  if that transfer was taken to have been made because of one or more

applications of subsection 345 (11) to a transfer (in this paragraph called

the `deemed transfer') that was taken to have been made because of subsection

345 (1), (2), (5), (6), (8) or (10) - the actual transfer that, under a

preceding paragraph of this definition, is the underlying transfer in relation

to the deemed transfer.

References to transfer of property or services

  &quot;344\. (1) A reference in this Subdivision to the transfer of property or

services to a trust includes a reference to the transfer of property or

services by way of the creation of the trust.

  &quot;(2) For the purposes of this Subdivision, where an entity acquires property

that did not previously exist, the property is taken to have existed

immediately before the acquisition and to have been acquired from the entity

who created the property.

  &quot;(3) For the purposes of this Subdivision, property or services are to be

taken to have been transferred to an entity if the property or services have

been applied for the benefit of, or in accordance with the directions of, the

entity.

  &quot;(4) Without limiting the generality of subsection (3), a reference in that

subsection to the application of property or services for the benefit of an

entity includes a reference to the application of property or services in the

discharge, in whole or in part, of a debt due by the entity.

  &quot;(5) A reference in this Subdivision to a transfer of property or services

to an entity includes a reference to a transfer made before the commencement

of this Subdivision.

  &quot;(6) A reference in this Subdivision to the transfer of property or services

to a trust does not include a reference to a transfer made by the trustee of

the estate of a deceased person under:

  (a)  the terms of the deceased person's will or codicil; or

  (b)  an order of a court that varied or modified the provisions of a

deceased person's will or codicil; unless:

  (c)  the transfer was made in or as a result of the exercise (by the trustee

or any other person) of a power of appointment or any other discretion; or

  (d)  under subsection 345 (1), the property or services are taken to have

been transferred by an entity other than the trustee, instead of by the

trustee; or

  (e)  under subsection 345 (5), the Commissioner treats the property or

services as having been (to any extent) transferred by an entity other than

the trustee, instead of by the trustee.

Deemed transfers of property or services

  &quot;345\. (1) For the purposes of this Subdivision, where an entity (in this

subsection called the `prime entity') causes another entity to actually

transfer property or services to a trust, the prime entity (instead of the

other entity) is to be taken to have transferred the property or services to

the trust.

  &quot;(2) For the purposes of this Subdivision, where:

  (a)  the trustee of a trust issues units in the trust to an entity (in this

subsection called the `first entity') in the first entity's capacity as a

manager, underwriter or dealer in relation to the marketing or placement of

the units; and

  (b)  in the course of the marketing or placement of the units, the units are

disposed of by the first entity to another entity (in this subsection called

the `second entity'); and

  (c)  at a particular time (in this subsection called the `second entity's

transfer time'), the second entity transfers property or services to the first

entity as consideration for the acquisition of the units; and

  (d)  the first entity has actually transferred, or actually transfers,

property or services (in this subsection called the `original property or

services') to the trust for the sole purpose of acquiring the units;

the second entity is taken to have transferred the original property or

services (instead of the first entity) at the second entity's transfer time.

  &quot;(3) A reference in subsection (2) to a unit in a trust is a reference to an

interest (however described) in any of the income or property of the trust.

  &quot;(4) Subsections (1) and (2) do not limit the operation of subsection (5).

  &quot;(5) Where, under a scheme:

  (a)  an entity (in this subsection called the `scheme entity') actually

transfers property or services to another entity; and

  (b)  property or services are actually transferred to a trust at a

particular time otherwise than by the scheme entity;

the Commissioner may, for the purposes of this Subdivision, treat the property

or services mentioned in paragraph (b) as having been transferred by the

scheme entity (instead of by any other entity) to the trust at that time.

  &quot;(6) Where:

  (a)  apart from subsections (8), (10) and (11), a partnership transfers

property or services to a trust at a particular time (in this subsection

called the `transfer time'); and

  (b)  at a later time (in this subsection called the `cessation time'), the

partnership ceases to exist for the purposes of this Act;

then, for the purpose of determining whether an entity that was a partner in

the partnership immediately before the cessation time is an eligible

transferor in relation to the trust at a time after the cessation time, each

such partner is to be taken to have transferred the original property or

services to the trust at the transfer time.

  &quot;(7) Nothing in subsection (6) affects the application of this Subdivision

to the transfer made by the partnership concerned.

  &quot;(8) For the purposes of this Subdivision, if:

  (a)  apart from this subsection and subsections (6), (10) and (11), a

discretionary trust (in this subsection called the `transferor trust')

transfers property or services (in this subsection called the `original

property or services') to another trust (in this subsection called the

`transferee trust') at a particular time (in this subsection called the

`transfer time'); and

  (b)  at a later time (in this subsection called the `cessation time'), the

transferor trust commences to be wound up or ceases to exist for the purposes

of this Act; and

  (c)  apart from this subsection and subsections (6), (10) and (11), one or

more other entities transferred property or services to the transferor trust

at or before the transfer time;

each of those other entities is to be taken to have transferred the original

property or services to the transferee trust at the transfer time.

  &quot;(9) Nothing in subsection (8) affects the application of this Subdivision

to the transfer mentioned in paragraph (8) (a).

  &quot;(10) For the purposes of this Subdivision, where:

  (a)  any of the following subparagraphs applies:

  (i)  any of the following events occurs in relation to a company (which

company is in this subsection called the `transferor'):

  (A)  the company passes a resolution for its winding-up;

  (B)  an order is made for the winding-up of the company;

  (C)  any similar event;

  (ii)  a partnership (in this subsection also called the `transferor') ceases

to exist for the purposes of this Act;

  (iii)  either of the following sub-subparagraphs applies in relation to the

trustee of a trust (in this subsection also called the `transferor'):

  (A)  the trust commences to be wound-up;

  (B)  the trust estate ceases to exist for the purposes of this Act; and

  (b)  an actual transfer of property or services is made to a trust (in this

subsection called the `transferee') as a consequence of the transferor being

wound-up or ceasing to exist;

the transferor is taken to have transferred to the transferee the property or

services concerned.

  &quot;(11) Where:

  (a)  the following subparagraphs apply to an entity (in this subsection

called the `defunct entity'):

  (i)  the defunct entity is a company, partnership or trust;

  (ii)  the defunct entity transferred property or services (in this

subsection called the `original property or services') to a trust (including a

transfer that was taken to have been made because of another application or

applications of this subsection) at a particular time (in this subsection

called the `transfer time');

  (iii)  if the defunct entity is a company - the company passes a resolution

for its winding-up, an order is made for the winding-up of the company or a

similar event occurs;

  (iv)  if the defunct entity is a partnership - the partnership ceases to

exist for the purposes of this Act;

  (v)  if the defunct entity is a trust - the trust commences to be wound up

or ceases to exist for the purposes of this Act; and

  (b)  the Commissioner is satisfied that an entity (in this subsection called

the `successor entity') has benefited or is capable (whether by the exercise

of a power of appointment or otherwise) of benefiting (either directly or

indirectly through one or more interposed companies, partnerships or trusts)

as a result of a transfer of property or services made by the defunct entity

or a transfer of property or services made as a consequence of the defunct

entity being wound up or ceasing to exist; and

  (c)  the Commissioner is of the opinion that it is appropriate to apply this

subsection to the successor entity;

then, for the purpose of determining whether the successor entity is an

eligible transferor in relation to the trust referred to in subparagraph (a)

        (ii) at a time after the transfer time, the successor entity is to be 

taken to have transferred the original property or services to that trust.

Circumstances in which a transfer of property or services is an eligible

business transaction

  &quot;346\. An underlying transfer of property or services to a trust is an

eligible business transaction if, and only if, at or about the time of the

transfer, identical or similar property or services were transferred by the

transferor in the ordinary course of business to ordinary clients or customers

under arm's length transactions in similar circumstances and subject to

identical or similar terms and conditions as those that applied in relation to

the underlying transfer of the property or services concerned.

Eligible transferor in relation to a discretionary trust

  &quot;347\. (1) An entity (in this section called the `transferor entity') is an

eligible transferor in relation to a discretionary trust at a particular time

(in this section called the `test time') if the trust is not a public unit

trust at the test time and:

  (a)  all of the following subparagraphs apply:

  (i)  the transferor entity transferred property or services to the trust at

a time (in this subparagraph called the `transfer time') at or after the IP

time and before the test time;

  (ii)  if the underlying transfer was made in the course of carrying on a

business - the underlying transfer was not an eligible business transaction;

  (iii)  if the underlying transfer was made under an arm's length transaction

otherwise than in the course of carrying on a business - the transferor entity

was in a position, at any time after the transfer time and before the test

time, to control the trust; or

  (b)  all of the following subparagraphs apply:

  (i)  the transferor entity transferred property or services to the trust at

any time before the IP time;

  (ii)  the underlying transfer was not an eligible business transaction;

  (iii)  at any time after the IP time and before the test time, the entity

was in a position to control the trust;

and, at the test time, the transferor entity is an Australian entity or a

CFE.

  &quot;(2) For the purposes of this section, an entity is taken to be in a

position to control a trust if, and only if:

  (a)  a group in relation to the entity had the power by means of the

exercise by the group of any power of appointment or revocation or otherwise,

to obtain, with or without the consent of any other entity, the beneficial

enjoyment of the corpus or income of the trust; or

  (b)  a group in relation to the entity was able in any manner whatsoever,

whether directly or indirectly, to control the application of the corpus or

income of the trust; or

  (c)  a group in relation to the entity was capable under a scheme of gaining

the enjoyment or the control referred to in paragraph (a) or (b); or

  (d)  a trustee of the trust was accustomed or under an obligation (whether

formally or informally) or might reasonably be expected to act in accordance

with the directions, instructions or wishes of a group in relation to the

entity; or

  (e)  a group in relation to the entity was able to remove or appoint the

trustee, or any of the trustees, of the trust.

  &quot;(3) A reference in subsection (2) to a group in relation to an entity is a

reference to any of the following:

  (a)  the entity acting alone;

  (b)  an associate of the entity acting alone;

  (c)  the entity and one or more associates of the entity acting together;

  (d)  2 or more associates of the entity acting together.

Eligible transferor in relation to a non-discretionary trust or a public unit

trust

  &quot;348\. (1) An entity is an eligible transferor in relation to a

non-discretionary trust or a public unit trust at a particular time (in this

section called the `test time') if:

  (a)  the transferor entity transferred property or services to the trust at

or after the IP time and before the test time; and

  (b)  the underlying transfer was made for no consideration or for a

consideration less than the arm's length amount in relation to the underlying

transfer; and

  (c)  it is not the case that the sole purpose of the underlying transfer was

the acquisition of units in the trust where the parties to the underlying

transfer were at arm's length with each other in relation to the underlying

transfer and the trust was a public unit trust at the test time;

and, at the test time, the transferor entity is an Australian entity or a

CFE.

  &quot;(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), the arm's length amount in relation

to a transfer of property or services to a trust is the amount that the

trustee could reasonably be expected to have been required to pay to obtain

the property or services concerned from the transferor under a transaction

where the parties were dealing with each other at arm's length in relation to

the transaction.

     &quot;Division 3 - Control Interests, Attribution Interests,

         Attributable Taxpayers and Attribution Percentages

              &quot;Subdivision A - Control Interests

Associate-inclusive control interest in a company or trusts

  &quot;349\. (1) Subject to this section, the associate-inclusive control interest

that an entity (in this section called the `lower entity') holds in a company

or trust at a particular time is the aggregate of:

  (a)  the direct control interest in the company or trust that the lower

entity holds at that time; and

  (b)  the indirect control interests in the company or trust that the lower

entity holds at that time; and

  (c)  the direct control interests in the company or trust held at that time

by associates of the lower entity; and

  (d)  the indirect control interests in the company or trust held at that

time by associates of the lower entity.

  &quot;(2) In calculating the associate-inclusive control interest that the lower

entity holds in the company or trust:

  (a)  an indirect control interest of the lower entity is not to be counted

under paragraph (1) (b) to the extent to which it is calculated by reference

to:

  (i)  a direct control interest in the company or trust that is taken into

account under paragraph (1) (c); or

  (ii)  an indirect control interest in the company or trust that is taken

into account under paragraph (1) (d); and

  (b)  an indirect control interest of an associate of the lower entity is not

to be counted under paragraph (1) (d) to the extent to which it is calculated

by reference to:

  (i)  a direct control interest in the company or trust that is taken into

account under paragraph (1) (a) or (c); or

  (ii)  an indirect control interest in the company or trust that is taken

into account under paragraph (1) (b) or (d).

  &quot;(3) If, apart from this subsection, both of the following things would be

counted in calculating the associate-inclusive control interest that the lower

entity holds in the company or trust:

  (a)  the holding of a direct control interest by the lower entity or any

other entity;

  (b)  an entitlement to acquire that direct control interest;

only one of those things is to be taken into account.

  &quot;(4) For the purpose of determining any of the following matters:

  (a)  whether the aggregate of the associate-inclusive control interests that

a group of entities holds in a company is not less than 50%;

  (b)  whether a single Australian entity has an associate-inclusive control

interest in a company of not less than 40%;

  (c)  whether the aggregate of the associate-inclusive control interests that

a group of entities holds in a trust is not less than 50%;

  (d)  whether the associate-inclusive control interest that an Australian

entity holds in a CFC is not less than 10%;

  (e)  whether the associate-inclusive control interest that an Australian

entity holds in a company is not less than 1%;

if, apart from this subsection, an entity, or each of 2 or more entities,

would hold a direct control interest, or control tracing interest, in another

entity (in this subsection called the `higher entity') equal to 100%:

  (f)  only one of those entities is to be taken to hold a direct control

interest, or control tracing interest, as the case may be, in the higher

entity equal to 100%; and

  (g)  no other entity (whether or not the entity would, apart from this

subsection hold a direct control interest, or control tracing interest, of

100%) is to be taken to hold any direct control interest, or control tracing

interest, as the case may be, in the higher entity.

  &quot;(5) For the purpose of calculating the aggregate of the associate-inclusive

control interests that a group of entities holds in a company or trust:

  (a)  if a particular direct control interest or indirect control interest

that an entity holds in another entity would be counted more than once because

the entity is an associate of one or more other entities in the group, that

interest is to be counted only once; and

  (b)  if both of the following things would, but for this subsection, be

counted in calculating the aggregate of the associate-inclusive control

interests that a group of entities holds in a company or trust:

  (i)  the holding of a direct control interest by an entity;

  (ii)  an entitlement to acquire that direct control interest;

    only one of those things is to be counted.

  &quot;(6) If it is necessary for the purposes of this section to decide:

  (a)  which one of 2 things is to be taken into account for the purposes of

subsection (3) or (5); or

  (b)  which one of 2 or more entities is to be chosen for the purposes of

paragraph (4) (f); the Commissioner may make that decision. Direct control

interest in a company

  &quot;350\. (1) Subject to subsection (7), an entity holds a direct control

interest in a company at a particular time equal to the percentage that the

entity holds, or is entitled to acquire, at that time of:

  (a)  the total paid-up share capital of the company; or

  (b)  the total rights of shareholders to vote, or participate in any

decision-making, concerning any of the following:

      (i)  the making of distributions of capital or

profits of the company to its shareholders;

     (ii)  the constituent document of the company;

     (iii)  any variation of the share capital of the

company; or

  (c)  the total rights to distributions of capital or profits of the company

to its shareholders on winding-up; or

  (d)  the total rights to distributions of capital or profits of the company

to its shareholders, otherwise than on winding-up;

or, if different percentages are applicable under the preceding paragraphs,

the greater or greatest of those percentages.

  &quot;(2) If the percentage of total rights to vote or participate in

decision-making differs as between differing types of decision-making, the

highest of those percentages applies for the purposes of paragraph (1)(b).

  &quot;(3) For the purposes of the application of subsection (1) to a company, the

percentage that an entity holds, or is entitled to acquire, at a particular

time (in this subsection called the `test time') in a statutory accounting

period of the company, of the total rights to distributions of capital or

profits of the company to its shareholders on winding-up is to be worked out

by:

  (a)  ascertaining whichever of the following is applicable:

  (i)  the capital of the company as at the end of the statutory accounting

period;

  (ii)  the profits of the company for the statutory accounting period; and

  (b)  assuming that the rights to such distributions that the entity holds,

or is entitled to acquire, at the test time were the same at all other times

during the statutory accounting period; and

  (c)  ascertaining the percentage concerned:

  (i)  at the end of the statutory accounting period instead of at the test

time; and

  (ii)  on that assumption.

  &quot;(4) For the purposes of the application of subsection (1) to a company, the

percentage that an entity holds, or is entitled to acquire, at a particular

time (in this subsection called the `test time') in a statutory accounting

period of the company, of the total rights to distributions of capital or

profits of the company to its shareholders, otherwise than on winding-up, is

to be worked out by:

  (a)  ascertaining whichever of the following is applicable:

  (i)  the capital of the company as at the end of the statutory accounting

period;

  (ii)  the profits of the company for the statutory accounting period; and

  (b)  assuming that the rights to such distributions that the entity holds,

or is entitled to acquire, at the test time were the same at all other times

during the statutory accounting period; and

  (c)  ascertaining the percentage concerned:

  (i)  at the end of the statutory accounting period instead of at the test

time; and

  (ii)  on that assumption.

   &quot;(5) Eligible finance shares in a company are to be

ignored for the purposes of the application of subsection (1) to the company.

  &quot;(6) If, at a particular time, a company is controlled by a group of 5 or

fewer Australian entities, either alone or together with associates (whether

or not any associate is also an Australian entity), each Australian entity in

that group of 5 or fewer holds a direct control interest in the company equal

to 100%.

  &quot;(7) An entity that holds a direct control interest in a company at a

particular time because of subsection (6) is not to be taken to hold any

direct control interest in the company at that time because of subsection

(1).

Direct control interest in a trust

  &quot;351\. (1) An entity that is a beneficiary in a trust holds a direct control

interest in the trust at a particular time equal to:

  (a)  the percentage of the income of the trust represented by the share of

the income to which the beneficiary is entitled, or that the beneficiary is

entitled to acquire; or

  (b)  the percentage of the corpus of the trust represented by the share of

the corpus to which the beneficiary is entitled, or that the beneficiary is

entitled to acquire;

or, if those percentages differ, the greater of those percentages.

  &quot;(2) For the purposes of the application of subsection (1) to a trust:

  (a)  the percentage of the income of the trust represented by the share of

the income to which the beneficiary is entitled, or that the beneficiary is

entitled to acquire; or

  (b)  the percentage of the corpus of the trust represented by the share of

the corpus to which the beneficiary is entitled, or that the beneficiary is

entitled to acquire;

at a particular time (in this subsection called the `test time') in a year of

income of the trust, is to be worked out by:

  (c)  ascertaining whichever of the following is applicable:

  (i)  the income of the trust for the year of income;

  (ii)  the corpus of the trust as at the end of the year of income; and

  (d)  assuming that the share to which the entity is entitled, or that the

entity is entitled to acquire, at the test time was the same at all other

times during the year of income; and

  (e)  ascertaining the percentage concerned:

  (i)  at the end of the year of income instead of at the test time; and

  (ii)  on that assumption.

  &quot;(3)   Each entity that is an eligible transferor in relation to a trust at

a particular time holds a direct control interest in the trust at that time

equal to 100%.

  &quot;(4)   An entity that holds a direct control interest in a trust at a

particular time because of subsection (3) is not to be taken to hold any

direct control interest in the trust at that time because of subsection (1).

Indirect control interest in a company or trust

  &quot;352\. (1) An indirect control interest that an entity (in this section

called the `bottom entity') holds in a company or trust at a particular time

is calculated in accordance with this section.

  &quot;(2) An interposed entity is not to be taken into account in calculating an

indirect control interest unless the entity is a CFE.

  &quot;(3) If there is only one entity interposed between the bottom entity and

the company or trust, the indirect control interest is calculated by

multiplying the control tracing interest that the bottom entity holds in the

interposed entity by the control tracing interest that the interposed entity

holds in the company or trust.

  &quot;(4) If there are 2 entities interposed between the bottom entity and the

company or trust, the indirect control interest is calculated:

  (a)  by multiplying the control tracing interest that the bottom entity

holds in the first interposed entity by the control tracing interest that the

first interposed entity holds in the second interposed entity; and

  (b)  by multiplying the result of the calculation referred to in paragraph

        (a) by the control tracing interest that the second interposed entity 

holds in the company or trust.

  &quot;(5) If there are 3 or more entities interposed between the bottom entity

and the company or trust, the indirect control interest is calculated:

  (a)  by multiplying the control tracing interest that the bottom entity

holds in the first interposed entity by the control tracing interest that the

first interposed entity holds in the second interposed entity; and

  (b)  by multiplying the result of the calculation referred to in paragraph

        (a) by the control tracing interest that the second interposed entity

  &quot;357\. (1) An indirect attribution interest that an entity (in this section

called the `bottom entity') holds in a CFC or CFT (in this section called the

`top entity') at a particular time is calculated in accordance with this

section.

  &quot;(2) An interposed entity is not to be taken into account in calculating an

indirect attribution interest unless the entity is a CFE.

  &quot;(3) If there is only one entity interposed between the bottom entity and

the top entity, the indirect attribution interest is calculated by multiplying

the attribution tracing interest that the bottom entity holds in the

interposed entity by the attribution tracing interest that the interposed

entity holds in the top entity.

income to which the lower entity is entitled, or that the lower entity is

entitled to acquire; or

  (b)  the percentage of the corpus of the CFT represented by the share of the

corpus to which the lower entity is entitled, or that the lower entity is

entitled to acquire;

or, if those percentages differ, the greater of those percentages.

time, the test entity is an Australian entity whose associate-inclusive

control interest in the CFT is at least 10%.

Attribution percentage of an attributable taxpayer

  &quot;362\. (1) Subject to this section, the attribution percentage of an

attributable taxpayer in relation to a CFC or CFT at a particular time is the

sum of:

  (a)  the direct attribution interest in the CFC or CFT held by the taxpayer

at that time; and

  (b)  the aggregate of the indirect attribution interests in the CFC or CFT

held by the taxpayer at that time.

  &quot;(2) If, apart from this subsection, both of the following things would be

counted in calculating the attribution percentage of an attributable taxpayer

in relation to a CFC or CFT at a particular time:

  (a)  the holding of a direct attribution interest in an entity by any other

entity;

  (b)  an entitlement to acquire that direct attribution interest;

only one of those things is to be taken into account.

  &quot;(3) If:

  (a)  in calculating the percentage that would be the attribution percentage

of an attributable taxpayer (apart from this subsection and subsection (5)) in

relation to a CFC at a particular time (in this subsection called the `test

time') regard was had to an attribution tracing interest of an eligible

transferor in relation to a CFT, being an attribution tracing interest

determined under subsection 360 (1); and

  (b)  the attribution percentage referred to in paragraph (a) is greater than

it would have been apart from subsection 360 (1); and

  (c)  there are other eligible transferors in relation to the CFT at the test

time; and

  (d)  the attributable taxpayer gives to the Commissioner, in accordance with

a form approved, in writing, by the Commissioner, such information as is

required by the form to be given;

the Commissioner may reduce the attribution percentage referred to in

paragraph (a) by such amount as the Commissioner considers reasonable in the

circumstances.

  &quot;(4) If:

  (a)  in calculating the percentage that would be the attribution percentage

of an attributable taxpayer (apart from this subsection and subsection (5)) in

relation to a CFT (in this subsection called the `attributing CFT') at a

particular time (in this subsection called the `test time') regard was had

to:

      (i)  a direct attribution interest of the

attributable taxpayer in relation to the attributing CFT, being direct

attribution interest determined under subsection 356 (2); or

     (ii)  an attribution tracing interest of an

eligible transferor in relation to another CFT (in this subsection called the

`interposed CFT'); and

  (b)  the attribution percentage referred to in paragraph (a) is greater than

it would have been apart from subsection 356 (2) or 360 (1), as the case may

be; and

  (c)  at the test time, there are other eligible transferors in relation to

the attributing CFT or the interposed CFT, as the case may be; and

  (d)  the attributable taxpayer gives to the Commissioner such information,

and produces to the Commissioner such documents, as the Commissioner requires

in connection with the operation of this subsection;

the Commissioner may reduce the attribution percentage referred to in

paragraph (a) by such amount as the Commissioner considers reasonable in the

circumstances.

  &quot;(5) If, apart from this subsection, the aggregate of the attribution

percentages of all the attributable taxpayers in relation to a CFC or CFT at a

particular time would exceed 100%, the attribution percentage of each of those

attributable taxpayers is the percentage calculated using the formula:

          Individual percentage

          -----------------------    x  100

          Total percentage

where:

Individual percentage means the percentage that would, apart from this

subsection, be the attribution percentage of the attributable taxpayer

concerned;

frankable dividend, within the meaning of Part IIIAA, that has been franked in

accordance with section 160AQF; and

  (c)  immediately before the attribution account payment is made, there is an

attribution surplus for the company in relation to the taxpayer that is

attributable to the attribution credit;

then, for the purposes of applying section 23AI and Divisions 4 and 5 of this

Part in relation to the taxpayer, the attribution account payment is taken to

be reduced to the extent that it is franked.

Direct attribution account interest in a company

  &quot;366\. (1) An entity holds a direct attribution account interest in a company

at a particular time equal to the percentage that the entity holds, or is

entitled to acquire, at that time of:

particular time holds a direct attribution account interest in the trust at

that time equal to:

  (a)  if paragraph (b) does not apply - 100%; or

  (b)  if, because there are 2 or more eligible transferors in relation to the

trust, the Commissioner reduces an attribution percentage under subsection 362

(3) or (4) or subsection 362 (5) applies - such lower percentage as the

Commissioner considers reasonable in the circumstances.

  &quot;(4) An entity that holds a direct attribution account interest in a trust

at a particular time because of subsection (3) is not taken to hold any direct

attribution account interest in the trust at that particular time because of

subsection (1).

Indirect attribution account interest in an entity

  &quot;369\. (1) The indirect attribution account interest that an entity (in this

section called the `bottom entity') holds in another entity (in this section

called the `top entity') is calculated in accordance with this section.

  &quot;(2) An interposed entity is not to be taken into account in calculating the

indirect attribution account interest unless the entity is an attribution

account entity.

  &quot;(3) If there is only one entity interposed between the bottom entity and

the top entity, the indirect attribution account interest is calculated by

multiplying the direct attribution account interest that the bottom entity

holds in the interposed entity by the direct attribution account interest that

the interposed entity holds in the top entity.

  &quot;(4) If there are 2 entities interposed between the bottom entity and the

top entity, the indirect attribution account interest is calculated:

  (a)  by multiplying the direct attribution account interest that the bottom

entity holds in the first interposed entity by the direct attribution account

interest that the first interposed entity holds in the second interposed

entity; and

  (b)  by multiplying the result of the calculation in paragraph (a) by the

direct attribution account interest that the second interposed entity holds in

the top entity.

  &quot;(5) If there are 3 or more entities interposed between the bottom entity

and the top entity, the indirect attribution account interest is calculated:

  (a)  by multiplying the direct attribution account interest that the bottom

entity holds in the first interposed entity by the direct attribution account

interest that the first interposed entity holds in the second interposed

entity; and

  (b)  by multiplying the result of the multiplication referred to in

paragraph (a) by the direct attribution account interest that the second

interposed entity holds in the third interposed entity;

and so on, ending with a multiplication by the direct attribution account

interest that the last interposed entity holds in the top entity.

  &quot;(6) For the purposes of this section, an entity (in this subsection called

the `second entity') is interposed between 2 other entities (in this

subsection called the `first entity' and the `third entity' respectively) if,

and only if:

  (a)  the first entity has a direct attribution account interest in the

second entity; and

  (b)  the second entity has a direct attribution account interest in the

third entity.

Attribution surplus

  &quot;370\. An attribution surplus for an attribution account entity in relation

to a taxpayer exists at a particular time if the entity's total attribution

credits arising before that time in relation to the taxpayer exceed its total

attribution debits arising before that time in relation to the taxpayer.

Attribution credit

  &quot;371\. (1) An attribution credit arises for an attribution account entity (in

this section called the `eligible entity') in relation to a taxpayer if:

  (a)  an amount is included in the taxpayer's assessable income under section

456 in respect of the attributable income of the eligible entity for a

statutory accounting period; or

  (b)  an amount is included in the taxpayer's assessable income under section

457 as a result of a change of residence by the eligible entity; or

  (c)  an amount is included in the taxpayer's assessable income under section

458 in respect of a dividend and the eligible entity is:

  (i)  the CFC referred to in subsection 458 (1) that receives the dividend;

or

  (ii)  the CFT referred to in subsection 458 (3); or

  (iii)  the ultimate recipient referred to in subsection 458 (4) or (5);  or

  (d)  an attribution account payment that requires an attribution debit for

another entity in relation to the taxpayer is made to the eligible entity.

  &quot;(2) Subject to subsections (3) and (4), the amount of the attribution

credit is equal to the amount included in assessable income or to the amount

of the attribution debit, as the case may be.

  &quot;(3) Where:

  (a)  the attribution credit arises under subparagraph (1) (c) (i) as a

result of an amount being included in the taxpayer's assessable income under

subsection 458 (1) in respect of a dividend paid to a CFC; and

  (b)  the CFC is or will be liable to pay an amount of foreign tax on the

dividend or on amounts that include the dividend;

then the amount of the attribution credit is reduced by the amount of foreign

tax, to the extent that it is attributable to so much of the dividend as

equals the amount included in the taxpayer's assessable income.

  &quot;(4) Where:

  (a)  the attribution credit arises under paragraph (1) (d) in relation to an

attribution account payment consisting of a non-portfolio dividend paid to the

eligible entity, where the eligible entity is a company; and

  (b)  the eligible entity is or will be liable to pay an amount of foreign

tax on the attribution account payment or on amounts that include the

attribution account payment;

then the amount of the attribution credit is reduced by the amount calculated

using the formula:

Attribution account percentage  x  Foreign tax where:

Attribution account percentage means the taxpayer's attribution account

percentage for the attribution account entity; Foreign tax means the amount of

foreign tax, to the extent that it is attributable to the attribution account

payment.

  &quot;(5) The attribution credit arises:

  (a)  in a paragraph (1) (a) case - at the end of the statutory accounting

period referred to in that paragraph; or

  (b)  in a paragraph (1) (b) case - at the time of the change of residence

referred to in that paragraph; or

  (c)  in a paragraph (1) (c) case - when the dividend referred to in that

paragraph is paid; or

  (d)  in a paragraph (1) (d) case - when the attribution account payment

referred to in that paragraph is made.

  &quot;(6) Where, apart from this subsection, an attribution credit would arise in

relation to an attribution account entity for an Australian partnership or an

Australian trust in respect of an amount included in the assessable income of

the partnership or trust of a year of income under section 456, 457 or 458,

then, subject to subsection (7):

  (a)  the attribution credit does not arise for the partnership or trust;

and

  (b)  an attribution credit arises in relation to the attribution account

entity for:

  (i)  any taxpayer for whom, as a result of the amount being so included, a

tax detriment would arise in circumstances referred to in paragraphs 460 (2)

        (a) and (b) or paragraphs 460 (3) (a) and (b); and

  (ii)  any taxpayer where, as a result of the amount being so included, a tax

detriment would arise for the trustee of a trust in which the taxpayer is a

beneficiary, in respect of an amount assessable to the trustee under section

98 in respect of the taxpayer's share of the net income of the trust, in

circumstances referred to in paragraph 460 (4) (a); and

  (iii)  any taxpayer in the capacity of trustee of a trust, where, as a

result of the amount being so included, a tax detriment would arise for the

taxpayer in respect of an amount assessable to the taxpayer under section 99

or 99A, in circumstances referred to in paragraph 460 (4) (a); and

  (c)  the amount of the attribution credit referred to in paragraph (b)

equals the amount of the tax detriment, as reduced by any application of

section 460; and

  (d)  the attribution credit referred to in paragraph (b) arises at the time

when the attribution credit referred to in paragraph (a) would, but for this

subsection, have arisen.

  &quot;(7) Subsection (6) does not apply to an Australian trust that is, in

relation to the year of income referred to in that subsection:

  (a)  a corporate unit trust within the meaning of Division 6B of Part III;

or

  (b)  a public trading trust within the meaning of Division 6C of that Part;

or

  (c)  an eligible entity within the meaning of Part IX.

Attribution debit

  &quot;372\. (1) An attribution debit arises for an attribution account entity (in

this section called the `eligible entity') in relation to a taxpayer if:

  (a)  the eligible entity makes an attribution account payment to the

taxpayer or to another attribution account entity; and

  (b)  immediately before the eligible entity makes the attribution account

payment, there is an attribution surplus for the eligible entity in relation

to the taxpayer.

  &quot;(2) Subject to subsections (3) and (4), the amount of the debit is the

lesser of:

  (a)  the attribution surplus; and

  (b)  whichever of the following is applicable:

      (i)  if the attribution account payment is made to

the taxpayer - the attribution account payment;

     (ii)  in any other case - the taxpayer's

attribution account percentage (for the attribution account entity to which

the payment is made) of the attribution account payment.

  &quot;(3) Where:

  (a)  the attribution account payment is a non-portfolio dividend; and

  (b)  the eligible entity, the taxpayer and the entity to which the payment

is made (if the payment is not made to the taxpayer) are members of a

non-portfolio company group when the payment is made;

subsection (2) applies as if the attribution account payment were reduced by

the exempting profits percentage of the payment in relation to the taxpayer.

  &quot;(4) Where:

  (a)  the attribution account payment is made to an attribution account

entity that is a trust; and

  (b)  the attribution surplus, for the eligible entity, is in relation to the

taxpayer in the capacity of trustee of the trust (because it is a surplus that

resulted from an attribution credit or credits that arose under subparagraph

371 (6) (b) (iii));

then the amount of the attribution debit is the lesser of:

  (c)  the attribution surplus; and

  (d)  any amount assessable to the taxpayer under section 99 or 99A in

relation to the net income of the trust of the year of income in which the

attribution account payment is made.

  &quot;(5) The attribution debit arises when the attribution account payment is

made.

Grossed-up amount of an attribution debit

  &quot;373\. The grossed-up amount in relation to an attribution debit is:

  (a)  where subparagraph 372 (2) (b) (i) applied in relation to the debit -

the amount of the debit; or

  (b)  where subparagraph 372 (2) (b) (ii) applied in relation to the debit -

the amount of the debit, divided by the attribution account percentage

referred to in that subparagraph.

            &quot;Division 5 - Attributed Tax Accounts

Attributed tax account surplus

  &quot;374\. An attributed tax account surplus for an attribution account entity in

relation to a taxpayer exists at a particular time if the entity's total

attributed tax account credits arising before that time in relation to the

taxpayer exceed its total attributed tax account debits arising before that

time in relation to the taxpayer.

Attributed tax account credit

  &quot;375\. (1) An attributed tax account credit arises for an attribution account

entity in relation to a taxpayer if:

  (a)  on the assumption that the reference in section 160AFCA to notional

allowable deductions under section 393 did not include a reference to

deductions in respect of Australian tax, the taxpayer would be taken by that

section to have paid, and to have been personally liable for, an amount of

foreign tax in respect of an amount included in the taxpayer's assessable

income under section 456 in respect of a statutory accounting period of the

entity; or

  (b)  on the assumption that the reference to Australian tax were omitted

from paragraph 160AFCB (c), the taxpayer would be taken by that paragraph to

have paid, and to have been personally liable for, an amount of foreign tax as

a result of a change of residence by a CFC to which section 457 applies; or

  (c)  the taxpayer is taken by paragraph 160AFCB (d) to have paid, and to

have been personally liable for, an amount of foreign tax as a result of a

change of residence by a CFC to which section 457 applies; or

  (d)  disregarding subparagraph 160AFCC (d) (iii), the taxpayer would be

taken by section 160AFCC to have paid, and to have been personally liable for,

an amount of foreign tax in respect of a dividend paid by the entity; or

  (e)  the entity receives an attribution account payment that requires an

attributed tax account debit for another entity in relation to the taxpayer.

  &quot;(2) The amount of the credit is equal to the amount of the foreign tax, or

to the amount of the debit, as the case may be.

  &quot;(3) The attributed tax account credit arises:

  (a)  in a paragraph (1) (a) case - at the end of the statutory accounting

period referred to in that paragraph; or

  (b)  in a paragraph (1) (b) or (c) case - at the time of the change of

residence referred to in that paragraph; or

  (c)  in a paragraph (1) (d) case - when the dividend referred to in that

paragraph is paid; or

  (d)  in a paragraph (1) (e) case - when the attribution account payment

referred to in that paragraph is made.

Attributed tax account debit

  &quot;376\. (1) An attributed tax account debit arises for an attribution account

entity in relation to a taxpayer if:

  (a)  the entity makes an attribution account payment to another attribution

account entity or to the taxpayer; and

  (b)  the attribution account payment requires an attribution debit for the

entity in relation to the taxpayer; and

  (c)  immediately before the entity makes the attribution account payment,

there is an attributed tax account surplus for the entity in relation to the

taxpayer.

  &quot;(2) The amount of the attributed tax account debit is the amount calculated

using the formula:

      Attribution debit    x    Attributed tax account surplus

      Attribution surplus

where:

Attribution debit means the amount of the attribution debit;

Attribution surplus means the amount of the attribution surplus, for the

entity making the attribution account payment, in relation to the taxpayer

immediately before the attribution debit arose;

Attributed tax account surplus means the amount of the attributed tax account

surplus.

  &quot;(3) The attributed tax account debit arises when the attribution account

payment is made.

            &quot;Division 6 - Exempting Receipts etc.

Exempting receipt of an unlisted country company

  &quot;377\. (1) Where a company is a resident of an unlisted country during the

whole or part of an accounting period (which whole or part is in this

subsection called the `qualifying period') of the company, each of the

following is an exempting receipt of the company in relation to the qualifying

period in relation to a taxpayer:

  (a)  income or profits derived by the company in the qualifying period in or

in connection with carrying on business in a listed country at or through a

permanent establishment of the company in that listed country, where:

  (i)  the income or profits are not eligible designated concession income in

relation to any listed country in relation to the qualifying period; and

  (ii)  the income or profits are subject to tax in any listed country in a

tax accounting period:

  (A)  ending before the end of the qualifying period; or

  (B)  commencing during the qualifying period;

  (b)  income derived by the company in the qualifying period that is included

in the assessable income of the company of a year of income;

  (c)  a profit of a capital nature derived by the company in the qualifying

period in respect of the disposal of a taxable Australian asset to which Part

IIIA applies, to the extent that an amount is included in the assessable

income of the company of a year of income under Part IIIA in respect of the

disposal;

  (d)  if a non-portfolio dividend is paid to the company in the qualifying

period by a company that is a resident of a listed country:

  (i)  where, on the making of the payment, an attribution debit arises for

the company in relation to the taxpayer - so much (if any) of the dividend as

exceeds thegrossed-up amount of the attribution debit; or

  (ii)  in any other case - the whole of the dividend;

  (e)  so much of a frankable dividend, within the meaning of Part IIIAA, paid

to the company in the qualifying period as has been franked in accordance with

section 160AQF;

  (f)  the exempting profits percentage, in relation to the taxpayer, of a

non-portfolio dividend paid to the company in the qualifying period by a

company that is a resident of an unlisted country;

  (g)  an amount that is an exempting receipt of the company in relation to

the qualifying period in relation to the taxpayer under subsection (2).

  &quot;(2) Where:

  (a)  a partnership (in this subsection called the `main partnership') or

trust (in this subsection called the `main trust') derives income or profits

(in this subsection called the `notional exempting receipt') that, if the main

partnership or main trust were a company, would be an exempting receipt of the

company in relation to an accounting period, in relation to a taxpayer, under

paragraph (1) (a), (b) or (c); and

  (b)  either:

  (i)  a company is entitled to:

  (A)  a share of after-tax profits of the main partnership that is

attributable to the notional exempting receipt; or

  (B)  a share of after-tax profits of another partnership that is

attributable to the notional exempting receipt because of a distribution of

the profits of the main partnership, or income of the main trust, either

directly or indirectly through one or more such distributions by interposed

partnerships or trusts;

or

  (ii)  a company receives a distribution of:

  (A)  income of the main trust that is attributable to the notional exempting

receipt; or

  (B)  income of another trust that is attributable to the notional exempting

receipt because of a distribution of profits of the main partnership, or

income of the main trust, either directly or indirectly through one or more

such distributions by interposed partnerships or trusts;

then the share or distribution is an exempting receipt of the company in

relation to the accounting period in relation to the taxpayer.

Exempting profits

  &quot;378\. (1) The exempting profits in relation to a taxpayer, at a particular

time, of a company resident in an unlisted country are so much of the

distributable profits, at that time, of the company as are attributable to

exempting receipts of the company in relation to any accounting period in

relation to the taxpayer.

  &quot;(2) For the purpose of determining under subsection (1) the amount of the

exempting profits of a company in relation to a taxpayer where a dividend has

been previously paid, that dividend is taken to have been paid out of

exempting profits and other distributable profits in proportion to the

respective amounts of those profits.

Exempting profits percentage

  &quot;379\. The exempting profits percentage, in relation to a taxpayer, of a

dividend paid by a company resident in an unlisted country is the percentage

calculated using the formula:

           Exempting profits

          --------------------     x   100

          Distributable profits

where:

Exempting profits means the amount of the exempting profits of the company in

relation to the taxpayer immediately before the dividend is paid;

Distributable profits means the amount of the distributable profits of the

company immediately before the dividend is paid.

Exempting receipt of a section 6 resident company

  &quot;380\. Each of the following is an exempting receipt of a company (in this

section called the `Australian company') that is a resident within the meaning

of section 6:

  (a)  if a non-portfolio dividend is paid to the Australian company by

another company that is a resident of a listed country:

  (i)  where, on the making of the payment, an attribution debit arises for

the other company in relation to the Australian company - so much (if any) of

the dividend as exceeds the amount of the attribution debit; or

  (ii)  in any other case - the whole of the dividend;

  (b)  the exempting profits percentage, in relation to the Australian

company, of a non-portfolio dividend paid to the Australian company by another

company that is a resident of an unlisted country.

      &quot;Division 7 - Calculation of Attributable Income of CFC

                 &quot;Subdivision A - Basic Principles

Separate attributable income for each attributable taxpayer

  &quot;381\. Where, at the end of a statutory accounting period (in this Division

called the `eligible period') of a company:

  (a)  the company is a CFC; and

  (b)  there are one or more attributable taxpayers in relation to the

company;

the attributable income of the company (in this Division called the `eligible

CFC') for the eligible period is calculated separately for each such

attributable taxpayer (in this Division called the `eligible taxpayer') in

accordance with this Division.

Attributable income is taxable income calculated on certain assumptions

  &quot;382\. (1) The attributable income is the amount that would be the eligible

CFC's taxable income for the eligible period if certain assumptions were

made.

  &quot;(2) For the purposes of describing those assumptions, amounts of assessable

income, allowable deductions and exempt income that are to be taken into

account in calculating the taxable income are referred to respectively as

notional assessable income, notional allowable deductions and notional exempt

income.

Basic assumptions

  &quot;383\. The assumptions are:

  (a)  that the eligible CFC is a taxpayer and a resident, within the meaning

of section 6, during the whole of the eligible period; and

  (b)  that the eligible period is a year of income, being the year of income

of the eligible taxpayer in which the eligible period ends; and

  (c)  that this Act is modified in accordance with Subdivisions B to D; and

  (d)  whichever of the assumptions in section 384 or 385 applies.

Additional assumption for unlisted country CFC

  &quot;384\. (1) Where the eligible CFC is a resident of an unlisted country at the

end of the eligible period, it is to be assumed:

  (a)  that the only amounts of notional assessable income are those to which

subsection (2) applies; and

  (b)  that all other income is notional exempt income.

  &quot;(2) The amounts of notional assessable income are:

  (a)  where the eligible CFC does not pass the active income test for the

eligible period in relation to the eligible taxpayer - amounts that would be

included in its notional assessable income for the eligible period under this

Act as modified in accordance with Subdivisions B to D if the only income or

other amounts derived by it during the eligible period, and any earlier

statutory accounting period, were adjusted tainted income (within the meaning

of section 386); and

  (b)  amounts included in the notional assessable income of the eligible CFC

for the eligible period under section 102AAZD of this Act as modified in

accordance with Subdivisions B to D; and

  (c)  amounts included in the notional assessable income of the eligible CFC

for the eligible period under Division 6 of Part III of this Act as so

modified; and

  (d)  amounts that would be included in the notional assessable income of the

eligible CFC for the eligible period under Division 5 of Part III of this Act,

as modified in accordance with Subdivisions B to D of this Division, in

relation to any partnership if its net income included only:

  (i)  where the eligible CFC does not pass the active income test for the

eligible period in relation to the eligible taxpayer - amounts that would be

included if the partnership derived only adjusted tainted income (within the

meaning of section 386); and

  (ii)  amounts included under section 102AAZD of this Act as modified in

accordance with Subdivisions B to D of this Division; and

  (iii)  amounts included under Division 6 of Part III of this Act as so

modified.

Additional assumption for listed country CFC

  &quot;385\. (1) Where the eligible CFC is a resident of a listed country at the

end of the eligible period, it is to be assumed:

  (a)  that the only amounts of notional assessable income are those to which

subsection (2) applies; and

  (b)  that all other income is notional exempt income.

  &quot;(2)   Subject to subsection (4), the amounts of notional assessable income

are:

  (a)  amounts that would be included in the notional assessable income of the

eligible CFC for the eligible period under this Act as modified in accordance

with Subdivisions B to D if the only income or other amounts derived during

the eligible period, and any earlier statutory accounting period, by the

eligible CFC were:

  (i)  where the eligible CFC does not pass the active income test for the

eligible period in relation to the eligible taxpayer - adjusted tainted income

(within the meaning of section 386) that is eligible designated concession

income in relation to the listed country or any other listed country; and

  (ii)  income or other amounts that:

  (A)  are not eligible designated concession income of the eligible CFC in

relation to the listed country or any other listed country; and

  (B)  are not treated as derived from sources in the listed country for the

purposes of the tax law of the listed country; and

  (C)  are not subject to tax in the listed country or any other listed

country in a tax accounting period ending before the end of the eligible

period or commencing during the eligible period; and

  (b)  amounts included in the notional assessable income of the eligible CFC

for the eligible period under section 102AAZD of this Act as modified in

accordance with Subdivisions B to D; and

  (c)  amounts included in the notional assessable income of the eligible CFC

for the eligible period under Division 6 of Part III of this Act as so

modified, where either of the following conditions (but not necessarily the

same condition) is satisfied in relation to the listed country and each other

listed country:

  (i)  the amounts are not subject to tax in that listed country in a tax

accounting period ending before the end of the eligible period or commencing

during the eligible period;

  (ii)  the amounts are subject to tax in that listed country in such a tax

accounting period and are designated concession income in relation to the

listed country; and

  (d)  amounts that would be included in the notional assessable income of the

eligible CFC for the eligible period under Division 5 of Part III of this Act,

as modified in accordance with Subdivisions B to D of this Division, in

relation to any partnership if its net income included only:

  (i)  where the eligible CFC does not pass the active income test for the

eligible period in relation to the eligible taxpayer - amounts that would be

included if the partnership derived only adjusted tainted income (within the

meaning of section 386) that is eligible designated concession income in

relation to the listed country or any other listed country; and

  (ii)  amounts that would be included if the partnership derived only income

or other amounts that:

  (A)  are not eligible designated concession income of the partnership in

relation to the listed country or any other listed country; and

  (B)  are not treated as derived from sources in the listed country for the

purposes of the tax law of the listed country; and

  (C)  are not subject to tax in the listed country or any other listed

country in a tax accounting period ending before the end of the eligible

period or commencing during the eligible period; and

  (iii)  amounts included under section 102AAZD of this Act as modified in

accordance with Subdivisions B to D of this Division; and

  (iv)  amounts included under Division 6 of Part III of this Act as so

modified, where either of the following conditions (but not necessarily the

same condition) is satisfied in relation to the listed country and each other

listed country:

  (A)  the amounts are not subject to tax in that listed country in a tax

accounting period ending before the end of the eligible period or commencing

during the eligible period;

  (B)  the amounts are subject to tax in that listed country in such a tax

accounting period and are designated concession income in relation to the

listed country.

  &quot;(3) For the purposes of paragraph (2) (c) or (d), a reference in that

paragraph to an amount being not subject to tax or subject to tax, as the case

may be, includes a reference to another amount included in the net income of a

partnership or trust, to which the first-mentioned amount is attributable,

being not subject to tax or subject to tax.

  &quot;(4) Where the sum of the amounts to which paragraph (2) (a) would otherwise

apply does not exceed the lesser of:

  (a)  $50,000; and

  (b)  5% of the gross turnover of the eligible CFC for the eligible period;

then that paragraph does not apply to those amounts.

Adjusted tainted income

  &quot;386\. (1) The references in sections 384 and 385 to adjusted tainted income

are references to amounts that would be passive income, tainted sales income

or tainted services income if certain modifications were made to the

provisions of Division 8.

  &quot;(2) The modifications are:

  (a)  that paragraphs 446 (1) (k), (m) and (n) are replaced with the

following:

  `(k)  amounts derived from the disposal of tainted assets;

  (m)  amounts derived from the disposal of tainted commodity investments;

  (n)  amounts derived that are attributable to currency exchange rate

fluctuations, except where under section 439 the amounts would, if they were

currency exchange gains, relate to an active income transaction;'; and

  (b)  that paragraph 446 (1) (k) as so replaced does not apply to an amount

derived from the disposal of a tainted asset in the circumstances referred to

in paragraphs 450 (2) (a) to (c) or(5) (a) to (c); and

  (c)  that paragraph 446 (1) (n) as so replaced does not apply to an amount

derived where, if it were a currency exchange gain, paragraphs 450 (3) (a) and

        (b) would apply to it; and

  (d)  that the reference in subsection 450 (7) to net gains that accrued to

the company in respect of the disposal of tainted assets is replaced with a

reference to amounts derived by the company from the disposal of tainted

assets.

Reduction of attributable income because of interim dividends

  &quot;387\. (1) Where:

  (a)  during the eligible period, the eligible CFC pays a dividend to the

eligible taxpayer or to another entity; and

  (b)  if the dividend is paid to the eligible taxpayer - the whole or part of

the dividend is included in the assessable income of the eligible taxpayer of

a year of income; and

  (c)  if the dividend is paid to another entity - an amount is included in

the assessable income of the eligible taxpayer of a year of income under

section 458 in respect of the dividend; and

  (d)  the whole or part of the grossed-up assessable component of the

dividend, or of the grossed-up 458 component of the dividend, as the case

requires, may reasonably be regarded as having been paid out of the

attributable income of the eligible CFC for the eligible period;

then, for the purposes of this Part, the attributable income of the eligible

CFC for the eligible period in relation to the eligible taxpayer is reduced by

an amount equal to the whole or the part of the grossed-up assessable

component of the dividend, or of the grossedup 458 component of the dividend,

as the case requires.

  &quot;(2) In this section:

`grossed-up assessable component', in relation to a dividend the whole or part

of which is included in the assessable income of the eligible taxpayer, means

the amount of the whole or the part divided by the eligible taxpayer's

attribution percentage for the eligible CFC at the time of payment of the

dividend;

`grossed-up 458 component', in relation to a dividend in respect of which an

amount is included in the assessable income of the eligible taxpayer under

section 458, means:

  (a)  where the amount is included under subsection 458 (1) or (3) - the

amount of the dividend, divided by the formula component AP referred to in

that subsection; or

  (b)  where the amount is included under subsection 458 (4) - the amount of

the dividend, divided by the formula component AP x IP referred to in that

subsection; or

  (c)  where the amount is included under subsection 458 (5) - the amount of

the dividend, divided by the formula component AP x IT referred to in that

subsection.

&quot;Subdivision B - General Modifications of Australian Tax Law

Double tax agreements to be disregarded

  &quot;388\. In calculating the attributable income of the eligible CFC, the Income

Tax (International Agreements) Act 1953 is to be disregarded, except for the

purpose of references in this Act to that Act.

Certain provisions to be disregarded in calculating attributable income

  &quot;389\. For the purpose of applying this Act in calculating the attributable

income of the eligible CFC, the following provisions are to be disregarded:

  (a)  except for the purposes of a reference in any other provision of this

Part - sections 6AC, 20, 23AH, 23AI, 23AJ, 38 to 43 (inclusive) and 128D,

subsection 136AF (1A)  and sections 136A, 456, 457, 458, 459 and 461;

  (b)  except for the purposes of a reference in Division 6AAA of Part III or

in any other provision of this Part - Part IIIAA.

Elections to be made by eligible taxpayer

  &quot;390\. (1) For the purpose of applying this Act in calculating the

attributable income of the eligible CFC, any declaration, election or

selection that may be made, any notice that may be given or any option that

may be exercised, by the eligible CFC apart from this section is not to be

made, given or exercised by the eligible CFC but instead may be made, given or

exercised by the eligible taxpayer.

  &quot;(2) The eligible taxpayer may make the declaration, election or selection,

give the notice or exercise the option in the eligible taxpayer's return of

income of the year of income in which the eligible period ends or within such

further period after the lodgment of the return as the Commissioner allows.

  &quot;(3) Subsection (1) does not apply to an election under the CGT roll-over

provisions.

Income and expenses to be expressed in Australian currency

  &quot;391\. (1) For the purpose of applying this Act in calculating the

attributable income of the eligible CFC, any amount (in this section called an

`eligible amount') of income wherever derived or of expenditure wherever

incurred is to be expressed in Australian currency.

  &quot;(2) Where, according to the accounts of the eligible CFC for the eligible

period, some or all of the eligible amounts of the eligible CFC are not

expressed in Australian currency, then any such eligible amount is to be

converted:

  (a)  if there is a single or predominant foreign currency in which eligible

amounts of the eligible CFC are expressed in the accounts and paragraph (b)

does not apply:

  (i)  where the eligible amount is expressed in that currency - to Australian

currency at a rate equal to:

  (A)  if sub-subparagraph (B) does not apply - the average of the exchange

rates applicable from time to time during the eligible period; or

  (B)  if the eligible taxpayer elects in accordance with subsection (3) - the

exchange rate applicable on the last day of the eligible period; or

  (ii)  in any other case - first to the single or predominant currency using

any reasonable method and then to Australian currency in accordance with

whichever of sub-subparagraph (i) (A) or (B) applies; or

  (b)  if the eligible amount is an amount of foreign tax paid by the eligible

CFC:

  (i)  if the foreign tax was paid by deduction from another amount - to

Australian currency, or to another currency and then to Australian currency,

according to the method applicable under paragraph (a) or (c) for the

conversion of the amount from which it was deducted; or

  (ii)  in any other case - to Australian currency at the rate of exchange

applicable at the time when the foreign tax was paid; or

  (c)  if neither paragraph (a) nor (b) applies - to Australian currency using

any reasonable method.

  &quot;(3) The eligible taxpayer may, in the eligible taxpayer's first return of

income in which an amount is required to be included in the assessable income

of the eligible taxpayer under section 456 in relation to the attributable

income of the eligible CFC for a statutory accounting period, or within such

further period after the lodgment of the return as the Commissioner allows,

elect that sub-subparagraph (2) (a) (i) (B) is to apply in relation to the

eligible CFC.

  &quot;(4) Where the taxpayer does so, that sub-subparagraph applies instead of

sub-subparagraph (2) (a) (i) (A) in calculating the attributable income of the

eligible CFC in relation to the eligible taxpayer for the statutory accounting

period and for all subsequent statutory accounting periods.

Notional assessable amounts are to be pre-tax

  &quot;392\. (1) An amount included in the notional assessable income of the

eligible CFC is an amount before the payment of any foreign tax or Australian

tax in respect of the amount.

  &quot;(2) Where the eligible CFC is taken by subsection 393 (2) to have paid an

amount of foreign tax in respect of a dividend included in its notional

assessable income, the dividend is, for the purposes of this Division, taken

to be increased by the amount of that tax.

Notional allowable deduction for taxes paid

  &quot;393\. (1) Foreign tax or Australian tax paid by the eligible CFC in respect

of amounts included in the notional assessable income of the eligible CFC for

the eligible period, whether paid before, during or after that period, is a

notional allowable deduction from the notional assessable income of the

eligible CFC for the eligible period.

  &quot;(2) Where:

  (a)  a non-portfolio dividend is included in the notional assessable income

of the  eligible CFC for the eligible period; and

  (b)  the eligible taxpayer is a company; and

  (c)  the eligible CFC would be taken by section 160AFC to have paid, and to

have been personally liable for, an amount of foreign tax in respect of the

dividend if it were a requirement of that section (in addition to the other

requirements of that section), for companies to be a pair of companies in a

dividend series, that each be related to the eligible taxpayer;

then, for the purposes of subsection (1) of this section, the eligible CFC is

taken to have paid that amount of foreign tax in respect of the dividend.

  &quot;(3) Except as mentioned in subsection (2), the eligible CFC is not taken by

section 160AFC to have paid an amount of foreign tax in respect of the

dividend for the purposes of subsection (1).

Notional allowable deduction for eligible finance share dividends

  &quot;394\. Where:

  (a)  the eligible CFC pays an eligible finance share dividend during or

after the eligible period; and

  (b)  if, on the assumption that the dividend were instead a payment of the

interest, referred to in paragraph 327 (d), to which it may reasonably be

regarded as equivalent, an amount (in this section called the `interest

equivalent') of that interest accruing during the eligible period would be a

notional allowable deduction for the eligible period;

then the interest equivalent is a notional allowable deduction for the

eligible period.

Expenditure incurred to produce income or profits in later statutory

accounting periods

  &quot;395\. In determining whether expenditure incurred by the eligible  CFC

during the eligible  period for the purpose of gaining or producing income or

profits in a later statutory accounting period is a notional allowable

deduction under a particular provision, it is to be assumed that:

  (a)  there will be a requirement under this Division to calculate the

attributable income of the  eligible CFC for that later statutory accounting

period; and

  (b)  for that purpose, the eligible CFC will always be a resident of the

listed country or unlisted country, as the case may be.

Modified application of sections 25A and 52

  &quot;396\. (1) For the purpose of applying this Act in calculating the

attributable income of an eligible CFC, sections 25A and 52 do not apply in

respect of the disposal of a non-taxable Australian asset of the eligible

CFC.

  &quot;(2) A reference in subsection (1) to a non-taxable Australian asset is a

reference to an asset other than a taxable Australian asset (within the

meaning of Part IIIA).

  &quot;(3) The residency assumption is to be ignored in determining whether an

asset is a taxable Australian asset for the purposes of this section.

Modified application of trading stock provisions

  &quot;397\. For the purpose of applying this Act in calculating the attributable

income of the  eligible CFC, Subdivision B of Division 2 of Part III has

effect as if the value of any article of trading stock to be taken into

account at the beginning or end of a year of income were its cost price.

Modified application of depreciation provisions

  &quot;398\. (1) Where property has been held by the eligible CFC in a

non-attributable income period in relation to the application of a

depreciation provision to the property (in relation to the eligible CFC and

the eligible taxpayer) prior to the eligible period, subsection (2) applies.

  &quot;(2) Such amount as the Commissioner considers appropriate to take account

of the holding of the property as mentioned in subsection (1) is, under the

depreciation provision:

  (a)  a notional allowable deduction to the eligible CFC; or

  (b)  included in the notional assessable income of the eligible CFC;

as the case requires, for the eligible period in relation to the eligible

taxpayer, in substitution for any amount that would otherwise be so included

or allowable.

  &quot;(3) For the purpose of exercising his or her power under subsection (2) to

determine a notional allowable deduction in relation to sections 54 to 62, the

Commissioner must assume that the property was used by the eligible CFC during

any non-attributable income period wholly and exclusively for the purpose of

producing notional assessable income.

Modifications of net income of partnerships and trusts

  &quot;399\. (1) If, in calculating the attributable income of the eligible CFC, it

is necessary to determine the net income of a partnership or trust under

section 90 or 95, it is to be assumed that:

  (a)  the modifications of this Act in this Division (other than excluded

modifications) apply to the partnership or the trust in the same way as they

apply to the eligible CFC (except where a provision modified only applies to

companies); and

  (b)  for the purpose of applying those modifications, the partnership or

trust is taken to be a resident of the same listed or unlisted country as the

eligible CFC; and

  (c)  the Act is further modified by disregarding subsections 160M (13) and

(14); and

  (d)  for the purpose of applying Part IIIA of the Act in accordance with the

preceding paragraphs, the trust is a resident trust estate, or a resident unit

trust, as the case may be.

  &quot;(2) In this section:

`excluded modifications' means modifications made by paragraphs 402 (2) (a)

and 403 (b) and sections 404 and 411 to 418 (inclusive).

Modified application of Division 13 of Part III

  &quot;400\. In calculating the attributable income of the eligible CFC:

  (a)  for the purposes of section 136AC, the eligible CFC is to be treated as

a resident or a non-resident, within the meaning of that section,  without

regard to the residency assumption; and

  (b)  section 136AF applies as if:

  (i)  the reference in subsection 136AF (1) to the application of section

136ad in relation to a taxpayer were a reference both to:

  (A)  the application of that section in relation to any CFC in calculating

its attributable income or in relation to any trust estate in calculating its

attributable income under Division 6AAA of Part III; and

  (B)  the actual application of that section in relation to any taxpayer in

calculating the taxable income of the taxpayer apart from this Part; and

  (ii)  the references in paragraphs 136AF (1) (a) and (b) to assessable

income or allowable deductions in relation to the relevant taxpayer were

references to notional assessable income or notional allowable deductions in

relation to the eligible CFC.

Reduction of disposal consideration where attributed income not distributed

  &quot;401\. (1) Where:

  (a)  it is necessary, for the purposes of applying a provision of this Act

in calculating the attributable income of the eligible CFC in relation to the

eligible taxpayer, to take into account the amount of consideration received,

entitled to be received or taken to be received, by the eligible CFC in

respect of the disposal of an asset, being an interest in an attribution

account entity (in this section called the `disposal entity'); and

  (b)  immediately before the disposal takes place, either or both of the

following conditions are satisfied:

  (i)  there is an attribution surplus for the disposal entity in relation to

the eligible taxpayer;

  (ii)  there is an attribution surplus for one or more other attribution

account entities in relation to the eligible taxpayer, where each such entity

is one in which the eligible taxpayer has an indirect attribution account

interest held through the disposal entity; then:

  (c)  for the purpose of calculating the attributable income, the

consideration that, apart from this section, would be taken into account under

the provision referred to in paragraph (a) in respect of the disposal is,

subject to subsection (3), taken to be reduced by the grossed-up amount of the

attribution surplus, or the sum of the grossed-up amounts of the attribution

surpluses, as the case requires; and

  (d)  for the purposes of this Act, attribution  debits and credits arise in

accordance with subsection (5); and

  (e)  for the purposes of this Act, attributed tax account debits and credits

arise in accordance with subsection (6).

  &quot;(2) For the purposes of this section, where the provision referred to in

paragraph (1) (a) is in Part IIIA of this Act, as applied in accordance with

this Division, references in this section to the disposal of an asset are

references to the disposal of an asset within the meaning of Part IIIA of this

Act as so applied.

  &quot;(3) For the purposes of paragraph (1) (c):

  (a)  a reference to the grossed-up amount of an attribution surplus is a

reference to the amount of the surplus divided by the eligible taxpayer's

attribution account percentage for the eligible CFC; and

  (b)  where the disposal of the asset causes the eligible taxpayer's

attribution account percentage for an attribution account entity in relation

to which there is an attribution surplus to be reduced by a proportion, then

only that proportion of the attribution surplus is, subject to this

subsection, to be taken into account under that paragraph; and

  (c)  where there is only one attribution surplus referred to in that

paragraph and (after any application of paragraph (b) of this subsection) its

grossed-up amount exceeds the consideration in respect of the disposal, then

the surplus is only to be taken into account to the extent that its grossed-up

amount equals the consideration; and

  (d)  where there are 2 or more attribution surpluses referred to in

paragraph (1) (c) and (after any application of paragraph (b) of this

subsection) the sum of their grossed-up amounts exceeds the consideration in

respect of the disposal, then:

  (i)  if the taxpayer specifies, in an election for the purposes of this

paragraph, a part of each surplus (after any application of paragraph (b))

such that the sum of the grossed-up amounts of the parts specified equals the

consideration - only the specified part of each surplus is to be taken into

account under paragraph (1) (c); or

  (ii)  if subparagraph (i) does not apply - only a proportion of each surplus

(after any application of paragraph (b)) is to be taken into account under

paragraph (1) (c), being the proportion calculated using the formula:

                    Consideration

               Total grossed-up surplus

where:

Consideration means the amount of the consideration;

Total grossed-up surplus means the sum of the grossed-up amounts of the

attribution surpluses (after any application of paragraph (b)).

  &quot;(4) An election for the purposes of paragraph (3) (d) must be made in the

eligible taxpayer's return of income for the year of income in which the

eligible period ends or within such further period after the lodgment of the

return as the Commissioner allows.

  &quot;(5) For the purposes of this Act:

  (a)  an attribution debit is taken to arise at the time of the disposal

under section 372, in relation to the eligible taxpayer, for each attribution

account entity (in this section called a `surplus entity') in relation to

which there is an attribution surplus to which paragraph (1) (c) applies; and

  (b)  the amount of the attribution debit is equal to so much of the surplus

as is taken into account under paragraph (1) (c); and

  (c)  there is no grossed-up amount in relation to the attribution debit

under section 373; and

  (d)  an attribution credit equal to the debit is taken to arise, at the time

of the disposal, under section 371 for the eligible CFC in relation to the

eligible taxpayer.

  &quot;(6) For the purposes of this Act, sections 375 and 376 have effect as if:

  (a)  an attribution account payment were made, by the surplus entity

referred to in paragraph (5) (a) of this section, that required the

attribution debit under that paragraph to arise; and

  (b)  the payment were made to the eligible CFC; and

  (c)  the payment were made at the time at which the attribution debit and

credit arise.

  &quot;(7) In this section:

`interest', in relation to an attribution account entity, means:

  (a)  if the entity is a company - an interest in shares in the company, or

an entitlement to acquire such an interest; or

  (b)  if the entity is a partnership - an interest of a partner in the

profits or property of the  partnership, or an entitlement of a partner to

acquire such an interest; or

  (c)  if the entity is a trust - an entitlement of a beneficiary to a share

of the income or corpus of the trust, or an entitlement of a beneficiary to

acquire such an entitlement.

Additional notional exempt income - unlisted or listed country CFC

  &quot;402\. (1) This section applies where the eligible CFC is a resident of

either a listed country or an unlisted country at the end of the eligible

period.

  &quot;(2) Each of the following is notional exempt income of the eligible CFC in

relation to the eligible period:

  (a)  income or other amounts derived by the eligible CFC in the eligible

period that are included in the assessable income of the eligible CFC of any

year of income for the purposes of this Act apart from this Part;

  (b)  so much of a frankable dividend, within the meaning of Part IIIAA, paid

to the eligible CFC in the eligible period as has been franked in accordance

with section 160AQF;

  (c)  the exempting profits percentage, in relation to the eligible taxpayer,

of a non-portfolio dividend paid to the eligible CFC in the eligible period by

a company that is a resident of an unlisted country;

  (d)  a non-portfolio dividend paid to the eligible CFC in the eligible

period by another CFC that is a resident of an unlisted country, where the

eligible taxpayer is an attributable taxpayer in relation to that other CFC

when the dividend is paid.

  &quot;(3) Where:

  (a)  a company pays a dividend to the eligible CFC in the eligible period;

and

  (b)  apart from this subsection, the whole or part of the dividend would be

included in the notional assessable income of the eligible CFC in relation to

the eligible taxpayer for the eligible period; and

  (c)  on the payment of the dividend by the other company, an attribution

debit arises for that other company in relation to the eligible taxpayer;

then so much (if any) of the whole or the part of the dividend as does not

exceed the grossed-up amount of the attribution debit is notional exempt

income of the eligible CFC for the eligible period.

Additional notional exempt income - unlisted country CFC

  &quot;403\. Where the eligible CFC is a resident of an unlisted country at the end

of the eligible period, each of the following is notional exempt income of the

eligible CFC in relation to the eligible period:

  (a)  income or profits derived by the eligible CFC in the eligible period in

or in connection with carrying on business in a listed country at or through a

permanent establishment of the eligible CFC in that listed country, where:

  (i)  the income or profits are not eligible designated concession income in

relation to any listed country in relation to the eligible period; and

  (ii)  the income or profits are subject to tax in any listed country in a

tax accounting period:

  (A)  ending before the end of the eligible period; or

  (B)  commencing during the eligible period;

  (b)  a non-portfolio dividend paid to the CFC in the eligible period by a

company that is a resident of a listed country.

Additional notional exempt income - listed country CFC

  &quot;404\. Where the eligible CFC is a resident of a listed country at the end of

the eligible period, a dividend paid to it in the eligible period by a company

that is a resident of a listed country is notional exempt income.

        &quot;Subdivision C - Modifications relating to Australian

                         Capital Gains Tax

Interpretation

  &quot;405\. (1) In this Subdivision:

`30 June 1990 non-taxable Australian asset' has the meaning given by section

406.

  &quot;(2) An expression used in this Subdivision and in Part IIIA has the same

meaning in this Subdivision as it has in that Part.

  &quot;(3) The residency assumption is to be ignored in determining whether an

asset is a taxable Australian asset for the purposes of this Subdivision.

Meaning of `30 June 1990 non-taxable Australian asset'

  &quot;406\. For the purposes of applying this Act in calculating the attributable

income of the eligible CFC, a reference in this Subdivision to a 30 June 1990

non-taxable Australian asset of the eligible CFC is a reference to an asset

(other than a taxable Australian asset) owned by the eligible CFC at the end

of 30 June 1990\. Certain provisions of this Subdivision to be treated as

provisions of Part IIIA

  &quot;407\. For the purposes of the application of Part IIIA in calculating the

attributable income of the eligible CFC, where the expression `provision of

this Part' or `provisions of this Part' is used in that Part, the expression

is taken to include a reference to any of the provisions of this Subdivision.

Part IIIA not to apply to disposals of taxable Australian assets

  &quot;408\. For the purposes of applying this Act in calculating the attributable

income of an eligible CFC, Part IIIA does not apply to a disposal of a taxable

Australian asset of the eligible CFC.

Losses on disposals before end of 30 June 1990 to be disregarded

  &quot;409\. For the purposes of applying this Act in calculating the attributable

income of the eligible CFC, capital losses in respect of disposals of assets

before the end of 30 June 1990 are to be disregarded.

Modified application of Part IIIA - general modifications

  &quot;410\. For the purposes of applying this Act in calculating the attributable

income of the eligible CFC, Part IIIA applies as if the following provisions

were disregarded:

  (a)  subsection 160M (12);

  (b)  subsection 160Z (6) and paragraph 160Z (9) (c);

  (c)  section 160ZFA;

  (d)  section 160ZP.

30 June 1990 non-taxable Australian assets taken to have been acquired on that

date

  &quot;411\. (1) Subject to this section, for the purposes of applying this Act in

calculating the attributable income of the eligible CFC, a 30 June 1990

non-taxable Australian asset of the eligible CFC is taken, for the purposes of

Part IIIA, to have been acquired by the eligible CFC on 30 June 1990.

  &quot;(2) Where a provision of Part IIIA provides that, if a disposal of an asset

occurs within 12 months after the day (in this subsection called the

`acquisition day') on which the asset was acquired by a taxpayer, a reference

in another provision of that Part to the indexed cost base to the taxpayer in

respect of the asset is to be construed as a reference to the cost base to the

taxpayer in respect of the asset, subsection (1) of this section does not

apply for the purposes of determining the acquisition day for the purposes of

the first-mentioned provision.

  &quot;(3) Subsection (1) does not apply for the purposes of determining the cost

base to the eligible CFC of an asset.

Cost base of 30 June 1990 non-taxable Australian asset

  &quot;412\. (1) For the purposes of applying this Act in calculating the

attributable income of the eligible CFC, the following provisions have

effect.

  &quot;(2) The eligible CFC is taken, for the purposes of Part IIIA:

  (a)  to have paid or given as consideration in respect of the acquisition of

a 30 June 1990 non-taxable Australian asset of the eligible CFC an amount

equal to:

  (i)  for the purpose of ascertaining whether a capital gain accrued to the

eligible CFC in respect of the disposal of the asset by the eligible CFC:

  (A)  the market value of the asset as at the end of 30 June 1990; or

  (B)  if the cost base to the eligible CFC of the asset as at 30 June 1990 is

greater than that market value - that cost base; or

  (ii)  for the purpose of ascertaining whether the eligible CFC incurred a

capital loss in respect of the disposal of the asset by the eligible CFC:

  (A)  the market value of the asset as at the end of 30 June 1990; or

  (B)  if that market value is greater than the amount of the cost base to the

eligible CFC of the asset as at 30 June 1990 - that cost base; and

  (b)  to have paid or given that consideration on 30 June 1990.

  &quot;(3) In determining the cost base, indexed cost base or reduced cost base to

the eligible CFC of an asset, no account is to be taken of any liability that

arose before 1 July 1990 or any costs or expenditure that were incurred before

1 July 1990 unless the liability, costs or expenditure consists of

consideration that, under subsection (2), is taken to have been paid or given

on 30 June 1990.

Adjustment of cost base as at 30 June 1990 - return of capital

  &quot;413\. (1) For the purposes of applying this Act in calculating the

attributable income of the eligible CFC, the following provisions have

CFC acquired the shares and ending at the end of 30 June 1990, the company

paid an amount that was not a dividend to the eligible CFC in respect of the

shares;

the cost base to the eligible CFC of the shares as at 30 June 1990 is to be

reduced by that amount.

  &quot;(3) Where:

  (a)  a 30 June 1990 non-taxable Australian asset of the eligible CFC

consists of an interest or unit in a trust; and

  (b)  at any time during the period commencing at the time when the eligible

CFC acquired the interest or unit and ending at the end of 30 June 1990, the

trustee of the trust paid an amount to the eligible CFC in respect of the

interest or unit, being an amount that would not have been notional assessable

income of the eligible CFC;

the cost base to the eligible CFC of the interest or unit as at 30 June 1990

is to be reduced by so much of the amount as is not attributable to a

deduction allowed under Division 10C or 10D of Part III.

Rights to acquire shares or share options

  &quot;414\. (1) For the purposes of applying this Act in calculating the

attributable income of the eligible CFC, the following provisions have

amount paid in respect of the exercise of the rights and:

  (i)  the market value of the rights as at the end of 30 June 1990; or

amount paid in respect of the exercise of the rights and:

  (i)  the market value of the rights as at the end of 30 June 1990; or

  (ii) if that market value is greater than the amount of the cost base to the

eligible CFC of the rights as at 30 June 1990 - that cost base.

  &quot;(3) So much of that consideration as is covered by subparagraph (2) (a) (i)

or (ii) or (b) (i) or (ii), as the case requires, is taken to have been paid

or given on 30 June 1990.

Rights to acquire units or unit options

given as consideration in respect of the acquisition of the new units or the

option concerned an amount equal to:

paid in respect of the exercise of the rights and:

  (i)  the market value of the rights as at the end of 30 June 1990; or

  (ii)  if the cost base to the eligible CFC of the rights as at30 June 1990

is greater than that market value - that cost base; or

  (b)  for the purpose of ascertaining whether the eligible CFC incurred a

capital loss in respect of the disposal by the eligible CFC of the new units

or the option or the units to which the option relates - the sum of the amount

paid in respect of the exercise of the rights and:

  (i)  the market value of the rights as at the end of 30 June 1990; or

  (ii)  if that market value is greater than the amount of the cost base to

the eligible CFC of the rights as at 30 June 1990 - that cost base.

  &quot;(3) So much of that consideration as is covered by subparagraph (2) (a) (i)

or (ii) or (b) (i) or (ii), as the case requires, is taken to have been paid

or given on 30 June 1990.

Company-issued options to acquire unissued shares

  &quot;416\. (1) For the purposes of applying this Act in calculating the

attributable income of the eligible CFC, the following provisions have

effect.

  &quot;(2) Notwithstanding section 160ZYV, where the eligible CFC, as a

shareholder, exercises an option as mentioned in subsection 160ZYV (2) and

that option is a 30 June 1990 non-taxable Australian asset of the eligible

CFC, the eligible CFC is taken, for the purposes of Part IIIA, to have paid or

given as consideration in respect of the acquisition of the new shares

concerned an amount equal to:

  (a)  for the purpose of ascertaining whether a capital gain accrued to the

eligible CFC in respect of the disposal by the eligible CFC of the new shares

- the sum of the amount paid in respect of the exercise of the option and:

  (i)  the market value of the option as at the end of 30 June 1990; or

  (ii)  if the cost base to the eligible CFC of the option as at 30 June 1990

is greater than that market value - that cost base; or

  (b)  for the purpose of ascertaining whether the eligible CFC incurred a

capital loss in respect of the disposal by the eligible CFC of the new shares

- the sum of the amount paid in respect of the exercise of the option and:

  (i)  the market value of the option as at the end of 30 June 1990; or

  (ii)  if that market value is greater than the amount of the cost base to

the eligible CFC of the option as at 30 June 1990 - that cost base.

  &quot;(3) So much of that consideration as is covered by subparagraph (2) (a) (i)

or (ii) or (b) (i) or (ii), as the case requires, is taken to have been paid

or given on 30 June 1990.

  (a)  for the purpose of ascertaining whether a capital gain accrued to the

eligible CFC in respect of the disposal by the eligible CFC of the new units -

the sum of the amount paid in respect of the exercise of the option and:

  (i)  the market value of the option as at the end of 30 June 1990; or

  (ii)  if the cost base to the eligible CFC of the option as at 30 June 1990

is greater than that market value - that cost base; or

  (b)  for the purpose of ascertaining whether the eligible CFC incurred a

capital loss in respect of the disposal by the eligible CFC of the new units -

the sum of the amount paid in respect of the exercise of the option and:

  (i)  the market value of the option as at the end of 30 June 1990; or

  (ii)  if that market value is greater than the amount of the cost base to

the eligible CFC of the option as at 30 June 1990 - that cost base.

  &quot;(3) So much of that consideration as is covered by subparagraph (2) (a) (i)

or (ii) or (b) (i) or (ii), as the case requires, is taken to have been paid

or given on 30 June 1990.

Adjustment of disposal consideration where change of residence by eligible CFC

from unlisted to listed country

  &quot;422\. (1) For the purposes of applying this Act in calculating the

attributable income of the eligible CFC, in relation to the eligible period in

relation to the eligible taxpayer, the following provisions have effect.

  &quot;(2) Where:

  (a)  because the eligible CFC has changed residence at a particular time (in

this section called the `residence-change time'), during the eligible period

or an earlier statutory accounting period, from an unlisted country to a

listed country, an amount is or has been included in the eligible taxpayer's

assessable income under section 457 (including under that section because of

paragraph 58 (1) (d) of the Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign Income) Act

1990); and

  (b)  during the eligible period, the eligible CFC disposes (which disposal

is in this section called the `actual disposal') of an asset (in this section

called the `eligible asset') that it has held since the residence-change

time;

then the consideration in respect of the actual disposal of the eligible asset

is, for the purposes of Part IIIA, adjusted in accordance with this section.

  &quot;(3) Where:

  (a)  the result of making the assumption, in subparagraph 457 (2) (a) (i) of

this Act or in paragraph 58 (2) (a) of the Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign

Income) Act 1990, that all of the eligible CFC's assets were disposed of at

the residence-change time for a consideration equal to their market value

was:

  (i)  to increase, by a particular amount (in this section called the `DP

creation/increase amount'), the amount that would otherwise be the

distributable profits referred to in that subparagraph or paragraph; or

  (ii)  to create distributable profits of a particular amount (in this

section also called the `DP creation/increase amount') where there would

otherwise not be distributable profits; and

  (b)  if the eligible asset had been disposed of by the eligible CFC at the

residence-change time for its market value at that time, the eligible CFC

would have made a profit (in this section called the `eligible asset profit')

on the disposal;

then the consideration in respect of the actual disposal of the eligible asset

by the eligible CFC is reduced by the amount calculated using the formula:

      Eligible asset profit

      Total asset profits    x    DP creation/increase amount

where:

Eligible asset profit means the amount of the eligible asset profit;

Total asset profits means the amount that would result if:

  (c)  the eligible CFC disposed of all of its assets at the residence-change

time for their market value; and

  (d)  the total of the profits from only those disposals that would have

resulted in a profit to the eligible CFC were calculated;

DP creation/increase amount means the DP creation/increase amount.

  &quot;(4) Where:

  (a)  the result of making the assumption, in subparagraph 457 (2) (a) (i) of

this Act or in paragraph 58 (2) (a) of the Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign

Income) Act 1990, that all of the eligible CFC's assets were disposed of at

the residence-change time for a consideration equal to their market value was

to reduce (including to nil), by an amount (in this section called the `DP

reduction amount'), the amount that would otherwise be the distributable

profits referred to in that subparagraph or paragraph; and

  (b)  if the eligible asset had been disposed of by the eligible CFC at the

residence-change time for its market value at that time, the eligible CFC

would have made a loss (in this section called the `eligible asset loss') on

the disposal;

then the consideration in respect of the actual disposal of the eligible asset

by the eligible CFC is increased by the amount calculated using the formula:

         Eligible asset loss  x  DP reduction amount

         Total asset losses

where:

Eligible asset loss means the amount of the eligible asset loss;

Total asset losses means the amount that would result if:

  (c)  the eligible CFC disposed of all of its assets at the residence-change

time for their market value; and

  (d)  the total of the losses from only those disposals that would have

resulted in a loss to the eligible CFC were calculated;

DP reduction amount means the DP reduction amount.

Adjustment of disposal consideration where section 47A applies to rolled-over

assets

  &quot;423\. (1) For the purposes of applying this Act in calculating the

attributable income of the eligible CFC, in relation to the eligible period in

relation to the eligible taxpayer, the following provision has effect.

  &quot;(2) Where:

  (a)  because of Division 17, Part IIIA does not or did not apply to the

disposal of an asset by a CFC to the eligible CFC during the eligible period

or an earlier statutory accounting period; and

  (b)  the eligible taxpayer was an attributable taxpayer in relation to both

CFCs at the time of the disposal; and

  (c)  section 47A applies or applied in relation to the disposal of the asset

to deem the other CFC to have paid a dividend to the eligible CFC; and

  (d)  an amount in respect of the deemed dividend is included in the

assessable income of the attributable taxpayer under section 458 or 459; and

  (e)  the eligible CFC disposes of the asset during the eligible period;

then the consideration in respect of the disposal referred to in paragraph (e)

is taken to be reduced by the lesser of:

  (f)  the amount of the deemed dividend; and

  (g)  the amount of any capital gain that, disregarding Division 17, would

have accrued to the other CFC in respect of the disposal referred to in

paragraph (a) if the consideration in respect of that disposal had been equal

to the market value of the asset at the time of that disposal.

        &quot;Subdivision D - Modifications Relating to Losses

Classes of notional assessable income

  &quot;424\. (1) For the purposes of this Subdivision but subject to subsection

(2), each of the following amounts included in notional assessable income

constitutes a single class:

  (a)  interest income (within the meaning of subsection 160AE (3));

  (b)  modified passive income (within the meaning of subsection 160AEA (2));

  (c)  offshore banking income (within the meaning of subsection 160AE (4));

  (d)  all other amounts.

  &quot;(2) Subsection (1) does not apply to an amount included in notional

assessable income under Part IIIA of this Act as modified in accordance with

Subdivision C.

Sometimes-exempt income etc.

  &quot;425\. (1) Where an amount is not included in the eligible CFC's notional

assessable income of a particular class for a statutory accounting period

(being the eligible period or an earlier period) in relation to the eligible

taxpayer because:

  (a)  the eligible CFC passes the active income test for the period in

relation to the eligible taxpayer; or

  (b)  subsection 385 (4) applies;

then the amount is sometimes-exempt income of the eligible CFC of that class

for the period in relation to the eligible taxpayer.

  &quot;(2) Where an amount would, disregarding sections 430 and 431, only be a

notional allowable deduction, in relation to notional assessable income of a

particular class, of the eligible CFC for a statutory accounting period (being

the eligible period or an earlier period) in relation to the eligible taxpayer

if the eligible CFC's sometimes-exempt income of that class for the period in

relation to the eligible taxpayer were instead notional assessable income,

then the amount is a sometimes-exempt deduction of the eligible CFC of that

class for the period in relation to the eligible taxpayer.

  &quot;(3) Where, in relation to notional assessable income of a particular class,

the eligible CFC's sometimes exempt deductions for a statutory accounting

period (being the eligible period or an earlier period) in relation to the

eligible taxpayer exceed its sometimes exempt income for the period in

relation to the taxpayer, the excess is, in relation to notional assessable

income of that class, a (sometimes-exempt income) loss of the eligible CFC for

the period in relation to the eligible taxpayer.

  &quot;(4) Where, in relation to notional assessable income of a particular class,

an eligible CFC's sometimes exempt income for a statutory accounting period

(being the eligible period or an earlier period) in relation to the eligible

taxpayer exceeds its sometimes-exempt deductions for the period in relation to

the taxpayer, the excess is, in relation to notional assessable income of that

class, a (sometimes-exempt income) gain of the eligible CFC for the period in

relation to the eligible taxpayer.

Creation of loss in relation to a class of notional assessable income

  &quot;426\. For the purposes of this Subdivision, if:

  (a)  disregarding section 430, the amount of the eligible CFC's notional

allowable deductions (other than under section 431) for a statutory accounting

period (being the eligible period or an earlier period) in relation to

notional assessable income of a particular class are applied as follows:

  (i)  they are applied first against any notional assessable income of the

eligible CFC of that class for the period;

  (ii)  any excess is then applied against any (sometimes-exempt income) gain

of that class for the period; and

  (b)  there is any amount remaining;

then the amount remaining is a loss of the eligible CFC for the period in

relation to notional assessable income of that class.

Certain provisions to be disregarded

  &quot;427\. For the purposes of applying this Act in calculating the attributable

income of the eligible CFC, paragraph 23 (q) and sections 79D, 79E, 79F, 80 to

80G (except for the purposes of a reference to any of those sections in any

other provision of this Act, as applied in accordance with this Division) and

160AFD are to be disregarded.

  &quot;428\. For the purposes of applying this Subdivision in calculating the

attributable income of the eligible CFC for the eligible period, it is to be

assumed that, for any earlier statutory accounting period (when the eligible

CFC existed) for which there was no requirement to calculate its attributable

income in relation to the eligible taxpayer, there were such a requirement

(except for the purpose of applying section 398).

Notional allowable deduction for (sometimes-exempt income) loss of a

particular class

  &quot;429\. The amount of any (sometimes-exempt income) loss of the eligible CFC

for the eligible period in relation to notional assessable income of a

particular class is a notional allowable deduction for the period from the

notional assessable income of the eligible CFC of that class.

Limitation on deductions for classes of notional assessable income

  &quot;430\. Where:

  (a)  apart from this section, there are one or more notional allowable

deductions (other than under section 431) of the eligible CFC for the eligible

period in relation to notional assessable income of a particular class; and

  (b)  either:

  (i)  the eligible CFC did not derive any notional assessable income of that

class in the eligible period; or

  (ii)  the eligible CFC derived notional assessable income of that class in

the eligible period and its amount is exceeded by the sum of the deductions;

then, for the purposes of this Division, those deductions are to be reduced

respectively:

  (c)  where subparagraph (b) (i) applies - to nil; or

  (d)  where subparagraph (b) (ii) applies - by amounts proportionate to those

deductions and equal in total to the amount of the excess referred to in that

subparagraph.

Deduction etc. for previous period loss in relation to a class of notional

assessable income

  &quot;431\. (1) Where there are one or more losses of the eligible CFC, in

relation to notional assessable income of a particular class, of any statutory

accounting period before the eligible period, the losses, to the extent they

have not been previously taken into account under this section in respect of

any such period, are to be taken into account in accordance with this

section.

  &quot;(2) The losses are to be taken into account as follows:

  (a)  they are to be applied first against any (sometimes-exempt income) gain

of the class for the eligible period, to the extent that the gain has not

already been applied under section 426 in determining whether there is a loss

for the eligible period;

  (b)  any excess is then a notional allowable deduction in respect of

notional assessable income of that class for the eligible period, but only to

the extent that the deduction does not exceed the amount of that notional

assessable income as reduced by notional allowable deductions of that class

other than under this section;

  (c)  where there are 2 or more losses, they are to be taken into account in

the order in which they arose.

  &quot;(3) A loss for a statutory accounting period is only to be taken into

account under subsection (2) if the eligible CFC was a CFC at the end of that

statutory accounting period and each following statutory accounting period

before the eligible period.

  &quot;(4) A loss for a statutory accounting period is not to be taken into

account under subsection (2):

  (a)  where the eligible CFC is a resident of a listed country at the end of

the eligible period - if the statutory accounting period is one at whose end

the CFC was not a resident of a listed country or is any statutory accounting

period before such a period; or

  (b)  where the eligible CFC is a resident of an unlisted country at the end

of the eligible period - if the statutory accounting period is one at whose

end the CFC was not a resident of an unlisted country or is any statutory

accounting period before such a period.

  &quot;(5) A loss for a statutory accounting period is not to be taken into

account under subsection (2) if, assuming that it were a loss within the

meaning of section 80 that had been incurred by the eligible CFC, it would

not, because of section 80A or 80DA, be taken into account for the purpose of

applying section 80 in relation to the eligible period.

          &quot;Division 8 - Active Income Test

    &quot;Subdivision A - Basic Conditions for Passing the Active Income Test

Active income test

  &quot;432\. (1) Subject to sections 437 and 453, for the purposes of this Part, a

accounting period if, and only if:

  (a)  the company was in existence at the end of the statutory accounting

period; and

  (b)  there was no time during the statutory accounting period when the

company was in existence when the company was neither a resident of a

particular listed country nor of a particular unlisted country; and

  (c)  the company has kept accounts for the statutory accounting period and:

  (i)  the accounts are prepared in accordance with commercially accepted

accounting principles; and

particular unlisted country, the company carried on business in that country

at or through a permanent establishment of the company in that country; and

  (f)  the tainted income ratio of the company for the statutory accounting

period is less than 0.05.

  &quot;(2) Subject to subsection (3), for the purposes of this section, a company

is to be taken to be in existence if it has been incorporated and has not been

dissolved.

  &quot;(3) For the purposes of this section, if a company was dormant, within the

meaning of Part VI of the Companies Act 1981, throughout a particular period

(in this subsection called the `dormant period') commencing on the day on

which the company was incorporated, the company is to be taken not to have

been in existence during the dormant period.

         &quot;Subdivision B - Tainted Income Ratio

Tainted income ratio

  &quot;433\. (1) For the purposes of this Part, if a company is a resident of a

particular unlisted country at the end of a statutory accounting period, the

tainted income ratio of the company for the statutory accounting period is

calculated using the formula:

              Gross tainted turnover

                   Gross turnover

where:

Gross tainted turnover means the gross tainted turnover of the company of the

statutory accounting period;

Gross turnover means the gross turnover of the company of the statutory

accounting period.

  &quot;(2) For the purposes of this Part, if a company is a resident of a

particular listed country at the end of a statutory accounting period, the

tainted income ratio of the company for the statutory accounting period is

calculated using the formula:

Tainted eligible designated concession income Eligible designated concession

income where:

Tainted eligible designated concession income means so much of the gross

tainted turnover of the company of the statutory accounting period as

represents eligible designated concession income in relation to any listed

country in relation to the statutory accounting period;

Eligible designated concession income means so much of the gross turnover of

the company of the statutory accounting period as represents eligible

designated concession income in relation to any listed country in relation to

the statutory accounting period.

  &quot;(3) For the purposes of this Part, the tainted income ratio of a company

for a statutory accounting period is taken to be less than 0.05 if both the

numerator and the denominator in the applicable fraction are 0.

  &quot;(4) For the purposes of this Part, the tainted income ratio of a company

for a statutory accounting period is to be calculated in the currency in which

the profit and loss accounts and the balance-sheet of the company for the

statutory accounting period are prepared.

Gross turnover

  &quot;434\. (1) Subject to section 437, for the purposes of this Part, the gross

turnover of a company of a statutory accounting period is the sum of:

  (a)  the amount that is shown in the recognised accounts of the company for

the statutory accounting period as the gross revenue derived by the company,

but not including:

  (i)  amounts that are shown in those recognised accounts as amounts covered

by section 436; or

  (ii)  amounts that are shown in those recognised accounts as revenue in

respect of the disposal of assets (other than trading stock or commodity

futures contracts, commodity forward contracts or rights or options in respect

of such contracts); or

  (iii)  amounts that are shown in those recognised accounts as revenue from

disposing of commodity futures contracts, commodity forward contracts or

rights or options in respect of such contracts; or

  (iv)  amounts that are shown in those recognised accounts as revenue from

currency exchange rate fluctuations; and

  (b)  the amount that is shown in the recognised accounts of the company for

the statutory accounting period as the amount (if any) by which the sum of the

gains derived by the company in the statutory accounting period in respect of

the disposal of assets (other than trading stock or commodity futures

contracts, commodity forward contracts or rights or options in respect of such

contracts) exceeds the losses incurred by the company in the statutory

accounting period in respect of the disposal of such assets, but not including

amounts that are shown in those recognised accounts as amounts covered by

section 436; and

  (c)  the amount that is shown in the recognised accounts of the company for

the statutory accounting period as the amount (if any) by which the gains

derived by the company in the statutory accounting period from disposing of

commodity futures contracts, commodity forward contracts or rights or options

in respect of such contracts exceeds the losses incurred by the company in the

statutory accounting period from disposing of commodity futures contracts,

commodity forward contracts or rights or options in respect of such contracts,

but not including amounts that are shown in those recognised accounts as

amounts covered by section 436; and

  (d)  the amount that is shown in the recognised accounts of the company for

the statutory accounting period as the amount (if any) by which the sum of the

gains derived by the company in the statutory accounting period from currency

exchange rate fluctuations exceeds the losses incurred by the company in the

statutory accounting period from currency exchange rate fluctuations, but not

including amounts that are shown in those recognised accounts as amounts

covered by section 436.

  &quot;(2) Subject only to sections 437, 438 and 440, for the purposes of this

section, where a company has prepared recognised accounts for a statutory

accounting period in accordance with commercially accepted accounting

principles, then, in determining whether a particular amount shown in those

accounts is covered by an expression used in subsection (1) (other than an

exclusion of amounts shown in those recognised accounts as amounts covered by

section 436), the expression concerned is taken to have the same meaning that

it has under those accounting principles.

Gross tainted turnover

  &quot;435\. For the purposes of this Part, the gross tainted turnover of a company

of a statutory accounting period is so much of the gross turnover of the

company of the statutory accounting period as consists of:

  (a)  passive income of the company of the statutory accounting period; or

  (b)  tainted sales income of the company of the statutory accounting period;

or

  (c)  tainted services income of the company of the statutory accounting

period.

accounting period:

  (A)  ending before the end of the statutory accounting period; or

  (B)  commencing during the statutory accounting period;

  (c)  an amount that, if the company were a resident within the meaning of

section 6, would, or would apart from paragraphs 99B (2) (d) and (e), have

been included in the assessable income of the company under Division 6 of Part

III;

  (d)  so much of a frankable dividend, within the meaning of Part IIIAA, as

has been franked in accordance with section 160AQF;

payment of the dividend;

  (f)  the exempting profits percentage of a non-portfolio dividend paid to

the company by a company, other than a CFC, that is a resident of an unlisted

the attribution account payment is not excluded from the active income test,

in relation to the company in relation to the statutory accounting period,

under subsection (1); and

  (c)  on the making of the attribution account payment by the other entity,

an attribution debit arises for that entity in relation to a taxpayer;

then, for the purposes of this Part, so much of the eligible amount as does

not exceed the grossed-up amount of the attribution debit is, in accordance

with subparagraph 434 (1) (a) (i), excluded (in addition to any other amount

that is excluded under subsection (1)) from the active income test in relation

to the company in relation to the taxpayer.

        &quot;Subdivision C - Treatment of Partnership Income

Treatment of partnership income

  &quot;437\. (1) For each partnership in which a company is a partner at any time

during a statutory accounting period, the following modifications apply for

the purposes of determining the effect of that partnership on the question

whether the company is taken to pass the active income test in relation to the

statutory accounting period:

  (a)  the partnership is to be treated as an entity separate from the

company;

  (b)  in spite of anything in section 432, the company is not taken to pass

the active income test in relation to the statutory accounting period unless:

  (i)  the partnership has kept accounts for the statutory accounting period

and:

  (ii)  the partnership has complied with the substantiation requirements set

out in section 452 in relation to the statutory accounting period;

  (c)  for the purposes of this Division, the notional gross tainted turnover

of the partnership of the statutory accounting period, or the notional gross

turnover of the partnership of the statutory accounting period, is the amount

that would be the gross tainted turnover, or the gross turnover, as the case

requires, of the partnership of the statutory accounting period if:

expenditure is to be taken to be equal to the arm's length amount.

the assessable income of the taxpayer of the year of income in which the end

of the statutory accounting period occurs.

  &quot;(2) Where section 457 applies in relation to the attributable taxpayer in

relation to one or more changes of residence by the CFC during the statutory

accounting period, then only so much of the attributable income of the CFC as

relates to:

period:

  (i)  any part of the period when the CFC was a resident of a listed country;

or

  (ii)  the part of the period, since the change of residence or last change

of residence, as the case requires, when the CFC was a resident of the

distributable profits at the residence-change time if:

  (A)  all the CFC's assets were disposed of at that time for a consideration

equal to their market value; and

  (B)  exempting profits of the CFC in relation to the attributable taxpayer

were not taken into account; or

  (ii)  if paragraph (1) (d) applies - the amount that would be the CFC's

distributable profits at the residence-change time if exempting profits of the

CFC in relation to the attributable taxpayer were not taken into account; and

  (b)  in any other case:

  (i)  if paragraph (1) (c) applies - so much of the amount that would be the

CFC's distributable profits at the residence-change time on the assumptions in

the residence-change time referred to in  the previous application of

subsection (1) in relation to the CFC and the attributable taxpayer; or

  (ii)  if paragraph (1) (d) applies - so much of the amount that would be the

CFC's distributable profits at the residence-change time on the assumption in

subparagraph (a) (ii) of this subsection as is attributable to the period

since the residence-change time referred to in the previous application of

subsection (1) in relation to the CFC and the attributable taxpayer;

Attribution surplus means:

  (c)  where the application of subsection (1) is the first or only

application of the subsection in relation to the CFC and the attributable

taxpayer - the amount of any attribution surplus for the CFC in relation to

the attributable taxpayer immediately before the residence-change time; and

  (d)  in any other case - so much of any attribution surplus, for the CFC in

relation to the attributable taxpayer immediately before the residence-change

time, as has not been taken into account in any previous application of

subsection (1).

`ultimate trust'), where the tax detriment occurred because there were one or

more partnerships or trusts (but not companies) interposed between the

beneficiary and the Australian partnership or the Australian trust; and

  (b)  the beneficiary is not a partnership and is not, in respect of his or

her share of the net income of the Australian trust or the ultimate trust, in

the capacity of trustee of another trust; and

  (c)  the tax detriment would be reduced by an amount if it were recalculated

on the assumption that sections 97, 98A and 100 applied only to so much of the

beneficiary's share of the net income of the Australian trust or the ultimate

trust as is attributable to periods when the beneficiary was a Part X

Australian resident;

then, for the purposes of this Act, the tax detriment is taken to be reduced

by that amount.

  &quot;(4)   Where:

  (a)  as a result of the amount being included as mentioned in subsection

(1), there is, apart from this subsection, a tax detriment for:

  (i)  the trustee of the Australian trust; or

  (ii)  the trustee of another trust (in this subsection called the `ultimate

trust'), where the tax detriment occurred because there were one or more

partnerships or trusts (but not companies) interposed between the trustee and

the Australian partnership or the Australian trust; and

  (b)  the tax detriment would be reduced by an amount if it were recalculated

on the assumption that:

  (i)  section 98 applied only to so much of a beneficiary's share of the net

income of the Australian trust or the ultimate trust as is attributable to

periods when the beneficiary was a Part X Australian resident; and

  (ii)  sections 99 and 99A applied only to the Australian trust or the

ultimate trust if it were a resident trust estate within the meaning of

Division 6 of Part III;

then, for the purposes of this Act, the tax detriment is taken to be reduced

by that amount.

  &quot;(5) Where the partner referred to in paragraph (2) (a), the beneficiary

referred to in paragraph (3) (a) or any beneficiary referred to in

subparagraph (4) (b) (i) is a CFC, then subsection (2), (3) or (4), as the

case requires, does not apply in relation to the partner or beneficiary.

      &quot;Division 10 - Post-attribution Asset Disposals

Reduction of disposal consideration where attributed income not distributed

  &quot;461\. (1) Where:

  (a)  it is necessary, for the purposes of applying a provision of this Act

in the assessment of a taxpayer for a year of income, to take into account the

amount of consideration received, entitled to be received or taken to have

been received, by the taxpayer in respect of the disposal of an asset, being

an interest in an attribution account entity (in this section called the

`disposal entity'); and

  (b)  immediately before the disposal takes place, either or both of the

following conditions are satisfied:

      (i)  there is an attribution surplus for the

disposal entity in relation to the taxpayer;

     (ii)  there is an attribution surplus for one or

more other attribution account entities in relation to the taxpayer, where

each such entity is one in which the taxpayer has an indirect attribution

account interest held through the disposal entity;

then, for the purposes of this Act:

  (c)  the consideration that, apart from this section, would be taken into

account under the provision referred to in paragraph (a) in respect of the

disposal is, subject to subsection (3), taken to be reduced by the amount of

the attribution surplus, or the sum of the attribution surpluses, as the case

requires; and

  (d)  an attribution debit is taken to arise at the time of the disposal

under section 372, in relation to the taxpayer, for each attribution account

entity (in this section called a `surplus entity') in relation to which there

is an attribution surplus to which paragraph (1) (c) applies; and

  (e)  the amount of the attribution debit is equal to so much of the surplus

as is taken into account under paragraph (1) (c); and

  (f)  there is no grossed-up amount in relation to the attribution debit

under section 373; and

  (g)  section 376 has effect as if an attribution account payment were made

by the surplus entity, at the time of the disposal, that required the

attribution debit under paragraph (1) (d) of this section to arise.

  &quot;(2) For the purposes of this section, where the provision referred to in

paragraph (1) (a) is in Part IIIA, references in this section to the disposal

of an asset are references to the disposal of an asset within the meaning of

that Part.

  &quot;(3) For the purposes of paragraph (1) (c):

  (a)  where the disposal of the asset causes the taxpayer's attribution

account percentage for a surplus entity to be reduced by a proportion, then

only that proportion of the attribution surplus for the entity is, subject to

this subsection, to be taken into account under that paragraph; and

  (b)  where there is only one attribution surplus referred to in that

paragraph and (after any application of paragraph (a) of this subsection) it

exceeds the consideration in respect of the disposal, then only so much of the

surplus as does not exceed the consideration is to be taken into account under

paragraph (1) (c); and

  (c)  where there are 2 or more attribution surpluses referred to in

paragraph (1) (c) and (after any application of paragraph (a) of this

subsection) their sum exceeds the consideration in respect of the disposal,

then:

      (i)  if the taxpayer specifies, in an election for

the purposes of this paragraph, a part of each surplus (after any application

of paragraph (a)) such that the sum of the amounts specified equals the

consideration - only the specified part of each surplus is to be taken into

account under paragraph (1) (c); or

     (ii)  if subparagraph (i) does not apply - only a

proportion of each surplus (after any application of paragraph (a)) is to be

taken into account under paragraph (1) (c), being the proportion calculated

using the formula:

             Consideration

             Total surplus

where:

Consideration means the amount of the consideration;

Total surplus means the sum of the attribution surpluses (after any

application of paragraph (a)).

  &quot;(4) An election for the purposes of paragraph (3) (c) must be made in the

taxpayer's return of income for the year of income referred to in paragraph

(1) (a) or within such further period after the lodgment of the return as the

Commissioner allows.

  &quot;(5) In this section:

`interest', in relation to an attribution account entity, means:

  (a)  if the entity is a company - an interest in shares in the company, or

an entitlement to acquire such an interest; or

  (b)  if the entity is a partnership - an interest of a partner in the

profits or property of the partnership, or an entitlement of a partner to

acquire such an interest; or

  (c)  if the entity is a trust - an entitlement of a beneficiary to a share

of the income or corpus of the trust, or an entitlement of a beneficiary to

acquire such an entitlement.

that it would have if:

  (a)  the following subsections were inserted before section (1):

     &quot;(1A) Subject to subsection (1B), if:

  (a)  a company:

  (i)  pays an amount to an associated person by way of an advance or loan;

or

  (ii)  pays or credits an amount on behalf of, or for the individual benefit

TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (FOREIGN INCOME) ACT 1990 No. 5 of 1991

- SECT 53

Transitional - section 160AFD of the amended Act

  53\. (1) Section 160AFD of the amended Act applies as if the only overall

foreign loss in respect of each class of assessable foreign income in any of

the 7 years of income before the 1990-91 income year were a loss of an amount

calculated in accordance with this section.

  (2) The amount of the overall foreign loss for each class for the year of

income is calculated by:

  (a)  working out, by making the following assumptions:

  (i)  that section 160AFD of the Principal Act had not been repealed and

replaced by this Act;

  (ii)  that, subject to subsection (3) of this section, references in that

section to income of a class of a year of income derived from a foreign source

did not include references to income that would have been exempt from tax if

sections 23AH and 23AJ of the amended Act, and any other provision of the

amended Act relevant to the operation of those sections, had been included in

the Principal Act at all previous times;

what would have been, for the year of income, the overall foreign loss (if

any) in respect of each class of income derived from a foreign source that

would have been available to reduce foreign income of that class of the

1990-91 income year derived from that source; and

  (b)  treating:

  (i)  each overall foreign loss in respect of interest income or offshore

banking income derived from a foreign source as an overall foreign loss in

respect of assessable foreign income that is respectively interest income, or

offshore banking income, within the meaning of section 160AFD of the amended

Act; and

  (ii)  each overall foreign loss in respect of other income derived from a

foreign source that consists of a business (other than one carried on at or

through one or more permanent establishments), commercial or investment

activity as an overall foreign loss in respect of assessable foreign income

that is modified passive income within the meaning of section 160AFD of the 

amended Act; and

  (iii)  each overall foreign loss in respect of other income derived from any

other foreign source as an overall foreign loss in respect of assessable

foreign income that is not interest income, offshore banking income or modified 

passive income, within the meaning of section 160AFD of the amended Act; and

  (c)  adding together all of the amounts worked out under paragraph (b) for

each class of assessable foreign income for the year of income.

  (3) Where the overall foreign loss in respect of a class of income for the

year of income worked out under paragraph (2) (a) would be less if the

assumption in subparagraph (2) (a) (ii) were not made, then the assumption is

not to be made in working out that loss.
