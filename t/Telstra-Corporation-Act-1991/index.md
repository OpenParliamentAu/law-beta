             (2)  The service of a transferred employee as an employee of Telstra is taken for all purposes to have been continuous with the service of the employee, immediately before the succession day, as an employee of the former corporation.

             (3)  A transferred employee is not entitled to receive any payment or other benefit merely because he or she ceased to be an employee of the former corporation by virtue of this Act or the repeal of the _Australian Telecommunications Corporation Act 1989_ or of the _OTC Act 1946_, as the case may be.

                     (b)  a person’s appointment as a director of the company follows necessarily from that person being a director or other officer of the first-mentioned person.

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Meaning of entitled to acquire

                   For the purposes of the ownership provisions, a person is **_entitled to acquire_** any thing if the person is absolutely or contingently entitled to acquire it, whether because of any constituent document of a company, the exercise of any right or option or for any other reason.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Meaning of interest in a share

                     (e)  the person holds the share for a continuous period (the **_holding period_**) beginning at the time when the security was enforced;

the person’s interest in the share must be disregarded at all times during so much of the holding period as occurs during whichever of the following periods is applicable:

##### <a id="10"></a>10  Voting power

             (1)  A reference in the ownership provisions to the **_voting power_** in a company is a reference to the total rights of shareholders to vote, or participate in any decision-making, concerning any of the following:

                     (a)  is limited both by shares and by guarantee; or

                     (b)  does not have a share capital;

this clause has effect as if the members or policy holders of the company were shareholders in the company.

##### <a id="11"></a>11  Stake in a company

             (1)  A particular type of **_stake_** that a person holds in a company at a particular time is the aggregate of:

                     (b)  the direct control interests in the company of that type held at that time by associates of the person.

             (2)  In calculating the stake that a person holds in a company, a direct control interest held because of subclause 12(5) is not to be counted under paragraph (1)(a) to the extent to which it is calculated by reference to a direct control interest in the company that is taken into account under paragraph (1)(b).

             (3)  For the purpose of calculating the total of the stakes of a particular type that a group of persons holds in a company, if a particular stake that a person holds in a company would be counted more than once because the person is an associate of one or more other persons in the group, that interest is to be counted only once.

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Direct control interests in a company

             (1)  A person holds a **_direct control interest_** in a company at a particular time equal to the percentage of the total paid-up share capital of the company in which the person holds an interest at that time.

             (2)  A person also holds a **_direct control interest_** in a company at a particular time equal to the percentage of the voting power in the company that the person is in a position to control at that time.

             (3)  A person also holds a **_direct control interest_** in a company at a particular time equal to the percentage that the person holds, or is entitled to acquire, at that time of the total rights to distributions of capital or profits of the company to its shareholders on winding-up.

             (4)  A person also holds a **_direct control interest_** in a company at a particular time equal to the percentage that the person holds, or is entitled to acquire, at that time of the total rights to distributions of capital or profits of the company to its shareholders, otherwise than on winding-up.

          (4A)  In determining the direct control interest of a particular type that a person holds in Telstra, it is to be assumed that the only shares in Telstra are the shares held by persons other than the Commonwealth.

       (4AA)  For the purposes of subclause (4A), if a share in Telstra is an investment of the Future Fund, the share is taken to be held by a person other than the Commonwealth.

        (4AB)  For the purposes of subclause (4A), if:

                     (a)  a share in Telstra is held by the Commonwealth; and

                     (b)  the share is specified in a written declaration made by the Minister for Finance under this paragraph;

the share is taken to be held by a person other than the Commonwealth.

Note:   For specification by class, see subsection 13(3) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_.

          (4B)  For the purposes of subclauses (4A), (4AA) and (4AB), **_share_** does not include an interest in a share.

             (5)  Subject to subclause (6), if:

                     (a)  a person holds a particular type of direct control interest (including a direct control interest that is taken to be held because of one or more previous applications of this subclause) in a company (the **_first level company_**); and

                     (b)  the first level company holds the same type of direct control interest in another company (the **_second level company_**);

the person is taken to hold that type of direct control interest in the second level company equal to the percentage worked out using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00848/Html/TelstraCorpn1991WD02_image003.gif)

where:

                    <a name="first-level-percentag"></a>**_first level percentage_** means the percentage of the direct control interest held by the person in the first level company.

                    <a name="second-level-percentag"></a>**_second level percentage_** means the percentage of the direct control interest held by the first level company in the second level company.

             (6)  In determining, for the purposes of paragraph 8BG(a) or subparagraph 8BH(b)(ii), the total of the stakes of a particular type that a group of foreign persons holds in Telstra, if:

                     (a)  a foreign company (the **_first company_**) holds that type of direct control interest in Telstra; and

                     (b)  in a case where that interest is held because of subclause (5)—that interest was not worked out under that subclause on the basis that one or more foreign companies were interposed between the first company and Telstra; and

                     (c)  apart from this subclause, a foreign person other than the first company would be taken under subclause (5) to hold that type of direct control interest in Telstra equal to a particular percentage; and

                     (d)  the direct control interest mentioned in paragraph (c) was worked out under subclause (5) directly or indirectly by reference to the direct control interest mentioned in paragraph (a);

the direct control interest mentioned in paragraph (c) is not to be counted.

             (7)  For the purposes of subclause (6), a **_foreign company_** is a company that is a foreign person.

             (8)  A declaration under paragraph (4AB)(b) is a legislative instrument for the purposes of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_, but section 42 of that Act does not apply to the declaration.

             (1)  For the purposes of the ownership provisions:

                     (a)  a person is taken to hold a **_substantial interest_** in a trust estate if the person, alone or together with an associate or associates, holds a beneficial interest in not less than 15% of the corpus or income of the trust estate; and

                     (b)  2 or more persons are taken to hold an **_aggregate substantial interest_** in a trust estate if the persons, together with an associate or associates, hold, in the aggregate, beneficial interests in not less than 40% of the corpus or income of the trust estate.

             (2)  For the purposes of subclause (1), if, under the terms of a trust, a trustee has a power or discretion as to the distribution of the income or corpus of the trust estate to beneficiaries, each beneficiary is taken to hold a beneficial interest in the maximum percentage of income or corpus of the trust estate that the trustee is empowered to distribute to that beneficiary.
