**Notes** 

 

## An Act to impose a termination payments tax and to declare the rate of the tax

##### <a id="1"></a>1  Short title [_see_ Note 1]

                   This Act may be cited as the _Termination Payments Tax Imposition Act 1997_.

##### <a id="2"></a>2  Commencement [_see_ Note 1]

                   This Act commences on the day on which it receives the Royal Assent.

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Interpretation

                   Expressions used in this Act that are defined by the _Termination Payments Tax (Assessment and Collection) Act 1997_ have the same meanings as in that Act.

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Imposition of termination payments surcharge

                   The termination payments surcharge that is payable on a termination payment made to or for a taxpayer under the _Termination Payments Tax (Assessment and Collection) Act 1997_ is imposed by this Act.

Note:          Surcharge is not payable on a termination payment made on or after 1 July 2005—see subsection 7(2) of the _Termination Payments Tax (Assessment and Collection) Act 1997_.

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Rate of termination payments surcharge

       (1AA)  In this section:

                    <a name="higher-incom-amount"></a>**_higher income amount_** means:

                     (a)  for the 2003‑2004 financial year—$114,981; and

                     (b)  for the 2004‑2005 financial year—that amount as indexed under section 6.

                    <a name="lower-incom-amount"></a>**_lower income amount_** means:

                     (a)  for the 2003‑2004 financial year—$94,691; and

                     (b)  for the 2004‑2005 financial year—that amount as indexed under section 6.

                    <a name="maximum-surcharg-percentag"></a>**_maximum surcharge percentage_** means:

                     (a)  for the 2003‑2004 financial year—14.5%; and

                     (b)  for the 2004‑2005 financial year—12.5%.

             (1)  If the taxpayer’s adjusted taxable income for a financial year (**_relevant adjusted taxable income_**) is not less than the lower income amount but is less than the higher income amount, the rate of the termination payments surcharge payable on a termination payment made to or for the taxpayer in that year is the percentage (calculated to 5 decimal places) of the amount of the payment worked out using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2005C00532/Html/855687b1-8b31-456d-9353-949dd5d31432_files/image002.gif)

where:

                    <a name=""></a>**_A_** is:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2005C00532/Html/855687b1-8b31-456d-9353-949dd5d31432_files/image003.gif)

          (1A)  If the percentage calculated under subsection (1) for a financial year would, if it were worked out to 6 decimal places, end with a number greater than 4, the number so calculated is increased by 0.00001.

             (2)  If the taxpayer’s adjusted taxable income for a financial year is equal to, or greater than, the higher income amount, the rate of the termination payments surcharge payable in respect of a termination payment made to or for the taxpayer in that year is the maximum surcharge percentage of the amount of the payment.

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Indexation

Indexation of certain amounts for 2004‑05 financial year

             (1)  Section 5 applies in relation to an indexing financial year as if each indexable amount were replaced by the amount worked out using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2005C00532/Html/855687b1-8b31-456d-9353-949dd5d31432_files/image004.gif)

where:

                    <a name="previou-index-amount"></a>**_previous indexable amount_** means the indexable amount for the financial year immediately before the indexing financial year.

                    <a name="relev-index-factor"></a>**_relevant indexation factor_** means the indexation factor for the indexing financial year.

Rounding off of indexed amounts

             (2)  If an amount worked out under subsection (1) is an amount of dollars and cents:

                     (a)  if the number of cents is less than 50—the amount is to be rounded down to the nearest whole dollar; or

                     (b)  otherwise—the amount is to be rounded up to the nearest whole dollar.

Indexation factor

             (3)  The **_indexation factor_** for an indexing financial year is the number calculated, to 3 decimal places, using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2005C00532/Html/855687b1-8b31-456d-9353-949dd5d31432_files/image005.gif)

where:

                    <a name="current-march-year"></a>**_current March year_** means the period of 12 months ending on 31 March immediately before the indexing financial year.

                    <a name="previou-march-year"></a>**_previous March year_** means the period of 12 months immediately before the current March year.

Rounding up of indexation factor

             (4)  If the number calculated under subsection (3) for a financial year would, if it were worked out to 4 decimal places, end with a number greater than 4, the number so calculated is increased by 0.001.

Change in index numbers

             (5)  If, at any time, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, the Australian Statistician has published or publishes an index number for a quarter in substitution for an index number previously published for the quarter, the publication of the later index number is to be disregarded.

Indexable amounts to be published

             (6)  The Commissioner must publish before, or as soon as practicable after, the start of the 2004‑05 financial year the indexable amounts as replaced under subsection (1) for that year.

Definitions

             (7)  In this section:

                    <a name="index-amount"></a>**_indexable amount_** means:

                     (a)  an amount stated in section 5; or

                     (b)  if that amount has previously been altered under this section—the altered amount.

                    <a name="indexing-financi-year"></a>**_indexing financial year_** means the 2004‑05 financial year.

                    <a name="index-number"></a>**_index number_**, for a quarter, means the estimate of full‑time adult average weekly ordinary time earnings for the middle month of the quarter published by the Australian Statistician.

Note:          For the purposes of this section, **_Australian Statistician_** means the Australian Statistician referred to in subsection 5(2) of the _Australian Bureau of Statistics Act 1975_.
