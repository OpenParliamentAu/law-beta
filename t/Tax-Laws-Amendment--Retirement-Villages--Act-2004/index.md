<h7 class="ActHead7">Part 2—Application provisions</h7>

## 13  Definition

In this Part:

**_GST Act_** means the _A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999._

## 14  General application

(1)        The amendments made by this Schedule (other than items 4 to 6) apply, and are taken to have applied, in relation to net amounts for tax periods starting, or that started, on or after 1 July 2000.

(2)        However, to avoid doubt, a determination made for the purposes of paragraph 38-25(3B)(a) of the GST Act (as amended by this Act) does not apply in relation to any supplies made before the commencement of this item.

(3)        The amendments made by items 4 to 6 of this Schedule apply to supplies made on or after the day on which this Act receives the Royal Assent.

## 15  Attributing input tax credits

(1)        If:

                     (a)  you are entitled to an input tax credit for an acquisition or importation made before the commencement of this item; and

                     (b)  you would not be entitled to the input tax credit if the amendments made by this Schedule had not been made;

to the extent that you would, apart from this item, attribute that input tax credit to a tax period ending before the commencement of this item, you may instead attribute it to the first tax period ending after that commencement.

(2)        This item does not apply for the purpose of working out adjustment periods for the purposes of Division 129 of the GST Act (which is about adjustments for changes to the extent of creditable purposes).

(3)        This item has effect despite:

                     (a)  sections 29-10 and 29-15 of the GST Act (which are about attributing input tax credits); and

                     (b)  section 105-55 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ (which is about the time limit on refunds and credits).

## 16  Application of section 105-55 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_

Section 105-55 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ does not apply to a refund under section 35-5 of the GST Act in respect of a tax period to the extent that:

                     (a)  before the commencement of this item, GST on a taxable supply was attributable to that tax period; and

                     (b)  because of the amendments of the GST Act made by this Act, the supply is no longer a taxable supply.

## 17  Application of section 78-50 of the GST Act

Section 78-50 of the GST Act does not apply to a payment or supply made in settlement of a claim under an insurance policy if:

                     (a)  the entity that paid all or a part of the premium for the insurance policy had, at or before the time referred to in subparagraph 78-50(1)(c)(i) of the GST Act, informed the insurer of the entitlement to an input tax credit for the premium it paid; and

                     (b)  in so informing the insurer, the entity did not, at that time, understate the extent of the entitlement; and

                     (c)  because of the amendments of the GST Act made by this Act, the statement of the extent of the entitlement is now an understatement of the entitlement.

## 18  Application of Aged Care Minister’s determinations relating to paragraph 38-25(3)(b) of the GST Act

Any requirement in a determination made for the purposes of paragraph 38-25(3)(b) of the GST Act that accommodation be included in a package of services, or that charges for accommodation be payable to the entity to which charges for services are payable, does not apply in relation to a supply that:

                     (a)  is made to a resident of a serviced apartment in a retirement village; and

                     (b)  is connected with a supply of a kind referred to in subparagraph 38-25(4A)(b)(i), (ii) or (iii) to the resident.
