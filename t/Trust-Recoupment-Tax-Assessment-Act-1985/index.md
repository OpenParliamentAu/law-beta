	(c)	a person in the capacity of trustee of a trust estate, being a trust estate that is a provident, benefit, superannuation or retirement fund; or
	(d)	a company that is, by virtue of the application of paragraph 103A(2)(c) or subparagraph 103A(2)(d)(i), (iii) or (iv) of the Assessment Act, a public company for the purposes of Division 7 of Part III of that Act in relation to the year of income to which the taxable amount relates.

	(a)	if the company or trust estate did not exist immediately before the tax avoidance scheme to which the taxable amount relates was entered into—the time when the company or trust estate commenced to exist; or
	(b)	in any other case—the time immediately before the time when the tax avoidance scheme to which the taxable amount relates was entered into;
or, if the Commissioner is of the opinion that that time is inappropriate, such later time as the Commissioner determines.
relevant exempting provision has the same meaning as in Division 9C of Part III of the Assessment Act.

	(2)	The reference in the definition of scheme in subsection (1) to a scheme, plan, proposal, action, course of action or course of conduct shall be read as including a reference to a unilateral scheme, plan, proposal, action, course of action or course of conduct, as the case may be.
	(3)	In this Act, a reference to the time of entry into a scheme is a reference to:
	(a)	if the scheme is a unilateral scheme—the time when the scheme is commenced to be carried out; and
	(b)	in any other case—the time when the scheme is entered into.
	(4)	For the purposes of this Act, a scheme shall be taken to be a tax avoidance scheme if and only if, having regard to:
	(a)	the manner in which the scheme was entered into or carried out;
	(b)	the form and substance of the scheme;
	(c)	the time at which the scheme was entered into and the length of the period during which the scheme was carried out;

	(e)	any change in the financial position of any person that has resulted, will result or may reasonably be expected to result from the scheme; and
	(f)	any other consequence for any person of the scheme having been entered into or carried out;
it would be concluded that the person, or any of the persons, who entered into or carried out the scheme or any part of the scheme did so for the purpose of securing that a person or persons (whether or not a particular person or particular persons) who, if the scheme had not been entered into or carried out, would have been liable to pay income tax in respect of a year of income would not be liable to pay income tax in respect of that year of income or would be liable to pay less income tax in respect of that year of income than the person or persons would have been liable to pay if the scheme had not been entered into or carried out.
	(5)	In subsection (4):
	(a)	a reference to the carrying out of a scheme or a part of a scheme by a person shall be read as including a reference to the carrying out of a scheme or a part of a scheme by a person together with another person or other persons; and
	(b)	a reference to a scheme or a part of a scheme being entered into or carried out by a person for a particular purpose shall be read as including a reference to a scheme or a part of a scheme being entered into or carried out by the person for 2 or more purposes of which that particular purpose is the dominant purpose.
	(6)	For the purposes of this Act, trust recoupment tax that has been assessed shall be deemed to be payable notwithstanding that it has not become due and payable.
4  Application of Assessment Act
	(1)	Unless the contrary intention appears in this Act, sections 6 and 7A, Part II, section 21, Part IV, Division 1 of Part VI, and Parts VII and VIII of the Assessment Act, and regulations made under that Act, apply for the purposes of the assessment and collection of trust recoupment tax and penalty tax, in like manner, mutatis mutandis, as those provisions apply for the purposes of the assessment and collection of income tax under the Assessment Act.
	(2)	A reference in this Act to a provision of the Assessment Act shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be read as a reference to that provision in its application, in accordance with subsection (1), for the purposes of this Act.
	(3)	For the purposes of section 14 of the Assessment Act, this Act shall be deemed to be part of the Assessment Act.
	(4)	Nothing in section 16 of the Assessment Act prevents:
	(a)	the disclosure, to a person who is, or in the opinion of the Commissioner is likely to become, liable to pay trust recoupment tax, or to pay income tax by virtue of the operation of section 7 of this Act, of information relating to the affairs of another person where that information was, or in the opinion of the Commissioner is likely to be, taken into account in the assessment of the liability of the first-mentioned person to pay trust recoupment tax, or to pay income tax by virtue of the operation of section 7 of this Act, as the case may be; or
	(b)	the disclosure, to a person who is, or in the opinion of the Commissioner is likely to become, jointly and severally liable with other persons to pay trust recoupment tax, of the identity of, and particulars of the liability of, any of the other persons liable to pay that trust recoupment tax.
	(5)	Nothing in section 170 of the Assessment Act prevents the amendment, at any time, of an assessment for the purpose of giving effect to subsection 6(2) or section 7 of this Act.
	(6)	Proceedings shall not be instituted against a person under section 209 of the Assessment Act for the recovery of any trust recoupment tax, or penalty tax, payable on a secondary taxable amount unless:
	(a)	the notice of assessment in respect of that tax was served on the person; or
	(b)	the Commissioner has served on the person a notice in writing to the effect that it is intended to commence proceedings for recovery of that tax and a period of 30 days has expired after the date of service of the notice.
	(7)	Unless the contrary intention appears, a reference in section 215 of the Assessment Act to tax shall be deemed to include a reference to:
	(a)	trust recoupment tax;
	(b)	late payment tax;
	(c)	applied penalty tax; and
	(d)	penalty tax.
	(8)	Where a person dies after an assessment is made of trust recoupment tax, applied penalty tax or penalty tax payable by the person, the Commissioner has the same powers and remedies against the trustee of the deceased person’s estate in respect of the collection of that tax, and of late payment tax on that tax, as the Commissioner would have had against the deceased person if the deceased person were alive.
	(9)	For the purposes of the application of any of the provisions of the Assessment Act in accordance with subsection (1), where 2 or more persons are jointly and severally liable to pay trust recoupment tax, or penalty tax, on a secondary taxable amount, service of a notice of assessment or any other notice in respect of that liability on any of those persons shall be deemed to be service of the notice on each of those persons.
	(10)	The validity of an assessment of the trust recoupment tax or penalty tax payable on a secondary taxable amount by the persons included in an eligible beneficiaries class in relation to that secondary taxable amount is not affected by reason that the notice of assessment identifies only one or some of the persons included in that eligible beneficiaries class.
5  Primary taxable amounts
	(1)	Subject to subsections (2) and (3), where:
	(a)	at any time, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, a beneficiary of a trust estate had a vested and indefeasible interest in any of the income of the trust estate of a year of income (in this subsection referred to as the relevant year of income);
	(b)	the beneficiary was not presently entitled to that income but would, apart from this section and subsection 100A(1) of the Assessment Act, have been deemed for the purposes of that Act to be presently entitled to that income;
	(c)	the vested and indefeasible interest of the beneficiary in the whole or a part of that income (which whole or part is in this subsection referred to as the relevant trust income) arose out of a tax avoidance scheme, or by reason of any act, transaction or circumstance that occurred as part of, in connection with or as a result of a tax avoidance scheme, entered into on or after 12 May 1982;
	(d)	by reason of, as a result of or as part of the tax avoidance scheme or by reason of any act, transaction or circumstance that has occurred, will occur, or may reasonably be expected to occur, being an act, transaction or circumstance occurring as part of, in connection with or as a result of the tax avoidance scheme, the present value of the benefit, or the sum of the present values of each of the benefits, that has or have been, will be, or may reasonably be expected to be, derived by the beneficiary as a consequence of the vested and indefeasible interest of the beneficiary in the relevant trust income is less than 50% of the amount of the relevant trust income; and
	(e)	by reason that the beneficiary would, apart from this section and subsection 100A(1) of the Assessment Act, have been deemed for the purposes of that Act to be presently entitled to the relevant trust income, the trustee of the trust estate would not have been liable to be assessed and to pay tax under section 99 or 99A of that Act in respect of the net income or a part of the net income (which net income or part is in this subsection referred to as the relevant amount) of the trust estate of the relevant year of income;
the following provisions have effect:
	(f)	the beneficiary shall, for the purposes of the Assessment Act other than sections 99 and 99A, be deemed not to be, and never to have been, presently entitled to the relevant trust income;

	(b)	apart from this section and section 100A of the Assessment Act, the trustee of the sub-trust:
	(i)	was presently entitled to a share of the income of another trust estate (in this subsection referred to as the head trust) of the relevant year of income;
	(ii)	would, by reason that income of another trust estate (in this subsection also referred to as the head trust) of the relevant year of income was paid to, or applied for the benefit of, the trustee of the sub-trust, have been deemed, for the purposes of the Assessment Act, to be presently entitled to income of the head trust; or
	(iii)	would, by reason that the trustee of the sub-trust had a vested and indefeasible interest in any of the income of another trust estate (in this subsection also referred to as the head trust) of the relevant year of income, have been deemed, for the purposes of the Assessment Act, to be presently entitled to that income of the head trust;
	(c)	in a case to which subparagraph (b)(i) applies—the present entitlement of the trustee of the sub-trust to the share or to a part of the share (which share or part is in this subsection referred to as the relevant head trust income) of the income of the head trust referred to in that subparagraph arose out of the relevant scheme or arose by reason of any act, transaction or circumstance that occurred as part of, in connection with or as a result of the relevant scheme;
	(d)	in a case to which subparagraph (b)(ii) applies—the whole or a part (which whole or part is in this subsection also referred to as the relevant head trust income) of the income of the head trust referred to in that subparagraph was paid or applied as mentioned in that subparagraph as a result of the relevant scheme or as a result of any act, transaction or circumstance that occurred as part of, in connection with or as a result of the relevant scheme; and
	(e)	in a case to which subparagraph (b)(iii) applies—the vested and indefeasible interest of the trustee of the sub-trust in the whole or a part (which whole or part is in this subsection also referred to as the relevant head trust income) of the income of the head trust referred to in that subparagraph arose out of the relevant scheme or arose by reason of any act, transaction or circumstance that occurred as part of, in connection with or as a result of the relevant scheme;
the following provisions have effect:
	(f)	the primary taxable amount referred to in paragraph (a) shall be reduced by so much of that amount as is attributable to the relevant head trust income;
	(g)	a primary taxable amount equal to the amount of the reduction referred to in paragraph (f) shall be taken to exist in relation to the trustee of the head trust in relation to the relevant year of income.
	(3)	Where, but for this subsection, 2 or more primary taxable amounts (in this subsection referred to as the original taxable amounts) would be taken to exist in relation to the trustee of a trust estate in relation to a year of income in relation to a tax avoidance scheme by reason of the application of subsection (1) or (2):
	(a)	the original taxable amounts shall not be taken to exist; and
	(b)	a primary taxable amount equal to the aggregate of the original taxable amounts shall be taken to exist in relation to the trustee of the trust estate in relation to the year of income.

	(b)	the amount (in this subsection referred to as the increased amount) of the income of the trust estate in which the beneficiary had a vested and indefeasible interest exceeds the amount (in this subsection referred to as the original amount) of the income of the trust estate in which the beneficiary would have had, or could reasonably be expected to have had, a vested and indefeasible interest if the tax avoidance scheme had not been entered into or if an act, transaction or circumstance that occurred as part of, in connection with or as a result of the tax avoidance scheme had not occurred;
the vested and indefeasible interest of the beneficiary in so much of the increased amount as exceeds the original amount shall be taken to have arisen out of the tax avoidance scheme.
	(5)	In paragraph (1)(d) a reference to the present value of a benefit that has been, will be, or may reasonably be expected to be, derived by a beneficiary of a trust estate as a consequence of a vested and indefeasible interest of the beneficiary in the relevant trust income referred to in that paragraph is a reference to:
	(a)	where the benefit was derived before the end of the year of income in which the relevant trust income was derived—the amount or value of the benefit at the time at which it was derived; or
	(b)	in any other case—an amount ascertained in accordance with the formula , where:
		A	is the amount or value of the benefit at the time at which it was, will be, or may reasonably be expected to be, derived; and
		n	is the number of years between the end of the year of income in which the relevant trust income was derived and the time referred to in component A.

	(a)	a tax avoidance scheme was entered into at or after the time when a person became a beneficiary of a trust estate; and
	(b)	the amount (in this subsection referred to as the increased amount) of the share of the income of the trust estate to which the beneficiary was presently entitled exceeds the amount (in this subsection referred to as the original amount) of the income of the trust estate to which the beneficiary would have been, or could reasonably be expected to have been, presently entitled if the tax avoidance scheme had not been entered into or if an act, transaction or circumstance that occurred as part of, in connection with or as a result of the tax avoidance scheme had not occurred;
the present entitlement of the beneficiary to so much of the increased amount as exceeds the original amount shall be taken to have arisen out of the tax avoidance scheme.
	(7)	For the purposes of paragraph (2)(d), but without limiting the generality of that paragraph, where:
	(a)	a tax avoidance scheme was entered into at or after the time when a person became a beneficiary of a trust estate; and
	(b)	income of the trust estate was paid to, or applied for the benefit of, the beneficiary and the amount (in this subsection referred to as the increased amount) of that income exceeds the amount (in this subsection referred to as the original amount) that would have been, or could reasonably be expected to have been, paid to, or applied for the benefit of, the beneficiary if the tax avoidance scheme had not been entered into or if an act, transaction or circumstance that occurred as part of, in connection with or as a result of the tax avoidance scheme had not occurred;
so much of the increased amount as exceeds the original amount shall be taken to be income of the trust estate that was paid to, or applied for the benefit of, the beneficiary as a result of the tax avoidance scheme.
	(8)	A primary taxable amount may be taken to exist in relation to the trustee of a trust estate notwithstanding that the trust estate has ceased to exist.

	(i)	any beneficial interest in the relevant trust estate was sold; or
	(ii)	any beneficial interest in another trust estate that at any time during the relevant period was a holding trust estate in relation to the relevant trust estate was sold; and
	(c)	the Commissioner is of the opinion that, by reason of a circumstance mentioned in paragraph (b), it would be unreasonable that the trustee of the relevant trust estate be liable to pay trust recoupment tax on the primary taxable amount;

	(3)	Where:
	(a)	there remains unpaid an amount of trust recoupment tax payable by the trustee of a trust estate on a primary taxable amount that exists in relation to the trustee in relation to a year of income and the Commissioner is of the opinion that the trust recoupment tax, or part of the trust recoupment tax, is unlikely to be paid; or
	(b)	a trust estate ceases to exist at a time when there remains unpaid an amount of trust recoupment tax payable by the trustee on a primary taxable amount that exists in relation to the trustee in relation to a year of income;

	(5)	In subsection (4), a reference to a benefit shall be read as not including a reference to:
	(a)	a benefit referred to in paragraph 5(1)(d) derived by a beneficiary to whom paragraph 5(1)(f) applies; and
	(b)	a benefit derived by a person (not being a person who at any time after the time when the tax avoidance scheme to which the primary taxable amount relates was entered into was an associate of the trustee of the trust estate in relation to which the primary taxable amount exists) from a transaction the parties to which were dealing with each other at arm’s length in relation to the transaction.
	(6)	For the purposes of the application of this Act in relation to trust recoupment tax payable or paid on a secondary taxable amount, the eligible beneficiaries class in relation to the secondary taxable amount shall not be taken to include any person who was not included in that class at the time when the notice of assessment in respect of the trust recoupment tax was served.
	(7)	For the purposes of this section, a trust estate is a holding trust estate in relation to another trust estate at a particular time if the trustee of the first-mentioned trust estate has a beneficial interest in the other trust estate at that time.
	(8)	For the purposes of subsection (7), where the trustee of a trust estate has a beneficial interest in a second trust estate and the trustee of the second trust estate has a beneficial interest in a third trust estate (including a beneficial interest that the trustee of the second trust estate has in the third trust estate by another application or other applications of this subsection), the trustee of the first-mentioned trust estate shall be deemed to have a beneficial interest in the third trust estate.
