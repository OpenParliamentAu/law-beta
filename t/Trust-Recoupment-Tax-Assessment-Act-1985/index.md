             (3)  In this Act, a reference to the time of entry into a scheme is a reference to:

                     (a)  if the scheme is a unilateral scheme—the time when the scheme is commenced to be carried out; and

                     (b)  in any other case—the time when the scheme is entered into.

             (4)  For the purposes of this Act, a scheme shall be taken to be a tax avoidance scheme if and only if, having regard to:

                     (a)  the manner in which the scheme was entered into or carried out;

                     (b)  the form and substance of the scheme;

                      (f)  any other consequence for any person of the scheme having been entered into or carried out;

it would be concluded that the person, or any of the persons, who entered into or carried out the scheme or any part of the scheme did so for the purpose of securing that a person or persons (whether or not a particular person or particular persons) who, if the scheme had not been entered into or carried out, would have been liable to pay income tax in respect of a year of income would not be liable to pay income tax in respect of that year of income or would be liable to pay less income tax in respect of that year of income than the person or persons would have been liable to pay if the scheme had not been entered into or carried out.

             (5)  In subsection (4):

                     (a)  a reference to the carrying out of a scheme or a part of a scheme by a person shall be read as including a reference to the carrying out of a scheme or a part of a scheme by a person together with another person or other persons; and

                     (b)  a reference to a scheme or a part of a scheme being entered into or carried out by a person for a particular purpose shall be read as including a reference to a scheme or a part of a scheme being entered into or carried out by the person for 2 or more purposes of which that particular purpose is the dominant purpose.

             (6)  For the purposes of this Act, trust recoupment tax that has been assessed shall be deemed to be payable notwithstanding that it has not become due and payable.

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Application of tax legislation

             (1)  Unless the contrary intention appears in this Act, sections 6 and 7A, Part II, section 21, Part IV, section 204, and Parts VII and VIII of the Assessment Act, Part IIA of, and Part 4-15 in Schedule 1 to, the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_, and regulations made under those Acts, apply for the purposes of the assessment and collection of trust recoupment tax and penalty tax, in like manner, _mutatis mutandis_, as those provisions apply for the purposes of the assessment and collection of income tax under the Assessment Act.

             (2)  A reference in this Act to a provision of the Assessment Act or of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be read as a reference to that provision in its application, in accordance with subsection (1), for the purposes of this Act.

             (3)  For the purposes of section 14 of the Assessment Act, this Act shall be deemed to be part of the Assessment Act.

             (4)  Nothing in section 16 of the Assessment Act or section 3C of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ prevents:

                     (a)  the disclosure, to a person who is, or in the opinion of the Commissioner is likely to become, liable to pay trust recoupment tax, or to pay income tax by virtue of the operation of section 7 of this Act, of information relating to the affairs of another person where that information was, or in the opinion of the Commissioner is likely to be, taken into account in the assessment of the liability of the first-mentioned person to pay trust recoupment tax, or to pay income tax by virtue of the operation of section 7 of this Act, as the case may be; or

                     (b)  the disclosure, to a person who is, or in the opinion of the Commissioner is likely to become, jointly and severally liable with other persons to pay trust recoupment tax, of the identity of, and particulars of the liability of, any of the other persons liable to pay that trust recoupment tax.

             (5)  Nothing in section 170 of the Assessment Act prevents the amendment, at any time, of an assessment for the purpose of giving effect to subsection 6(2) or section 7 of this Act.

             (7)  Unless the contrary intention appears, a reference in section 215 of the Assessment Act to tax shall be deemed to include a reference to:

                     (a)  trust recoupment tax;

                     (b)  late payment tax;

                     (c)  applied penalty tax; and

                     (d)  penalty tax.

             (9)  For the purposes of the application of any of the provisions of the Assessment Act  or of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ in accordance with subsection (1), where 2 or more persons are jointly and severally liable to pay trust recoupment tax, or penalty tax, on a secondary taxable amount, service of a notice of assessment or any other notice in respect of that liability on any of those persons shall be deemed to be service of the notice on each of those persons.

           (10)  The validity of an assessment of the trust recoupment tax or penalty tax payable on a secondary taxable amount by the persons included in an eligible beneficiaries class in relation to that secondary taxable amount is not affected by reason that the notice of assessment identifies only one or some of the persons included in that eligible beneficiaries class.

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Primary taxable amounts

             (1)  Subject to subsections (2) and (3), where:

                     (a)  at any time, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, a beneficiary of a trust estate had a vested and indefeasible interest in any of the income of the trust estate of a year of income (in this subsection referred to as the **_relevant year of income_**);

                     (b)  the beneficiary was not presently entitled to that income but would, apart from this section and subsection 100A(1) of the Assessment Act, have been deemed for the purposes of that Act to be presently entitled to that income;

                     (c)  the vested and indefeasible interest of the beneficiary in the whole or a part of that income (which whole or part is in this subsection referred to as the **_relevant trust income_**) arose out of a tax avoidance scheme, or by reason of any act, transaction or circumstance that occurred as part of, in connection with or as a result of a tax avoidance scheme, entered into on or after 12 May 1982;

                     (d)  by reason of, as a result of or as part of the tax avoidance scheme or by reason of any act, transaction or circumstance that has occurred, will occur, or may reasonably be expected to occur, being an act, transaction or circumstance occurring as part of, in connection with or as a result of the tax avoidance scheme, the present value of the benefit, or the sum of the present values of each of the benefits, that has or have been, will be, or may reasonably be expected to be, derived by the beneficiary as a consequence of the vested and indefeasible interest of the beneficiary in the relevant trust income is less than 50% of the amount of the relevant trust income; and

                     (e)  by reason that the beneficiary would, apart from this section and subsection 100A(1) of the Assessment Act, have been deemed for the purposes of that Act to be presently entitled to the relevant trust income, the trustee of the trust estate would not have been liable to be assessed and to pay tax under section 99 or 99A of that Act in respect of the net income or a part of the net income (which net income or part is in this subsection referred to as the **_relevant amount_**) of the trust estate of the relevant year of income;

the following provisions have effect:

                      (f)  the beneficiary shall, for the purposes of the Assessment Act other than sections 99 and 99A, be deemed not to be, and never to have been, presently entitled to the relevant trust income;

                     (g)  a primary taxable amount equal to the relevant amount shall be taken to exist in relation to the trustee of the trust estate in relation to the relevant year of income.

             (2)  Subject to subsection (3), where:

                     (a)  by reason of the application of subsection (1) or of this subsection, a primary taxable amount exists in relation to the trustee of a trust estate (in this subsection referred to as the **_sub-trust_**) in relation to a year of income (in this subsection referred to as the **_relevant year of income_**) in relation to a tax avoidance scheme (in this subsection referred to as the **_relevant scheme_**);

                     (b)  apart from this section and section 100A of the Assessment Act, the trustee of the sub-trust:

                              (i)  was presently entitled to a share of the income of another trust estate (in this subsection referred to as the **_head trust_**) of the relevant year of income;

                             (ii)  would, by reason that income of another trust estate (in this subsection also referred to as the **_head trust_**) of the relevant year of income was paid to, or applied for the benefit of, the trustee of the sub-trust, have been deemed, for the purposes of the Assessment Act, to be presently entitled to income of the head trust; or

                            (iii)  would, by reason that the trustee of the sub-trust had a vested and indefeasible interest in any of the income of another trust estate (in this subsection also referred to as the **_head trust_**) of the relevant year of income, have been deemed, for the purposes of the Assessment Act, to be presently entitled to that income of the head trust;

                     (c)  in a case to which subparagraph (b)(i) applies—the present entitlement of the trustee of the sub-trust to the share or to a part of the share (which share or part is in this subsection referred to as the **_relevant head trust income_**) of the income of the head trust referred to in that subparagraph arose out of the relevant scheme or arose by reason of any act, transaction or circumstance that occurred as part of, in connection with or as a result of the relevant scheme;

                     (d)  in a case to which subparagraph (b)(ii) applies—the whole or a part (which whole or part is in this subsection also referred to as the **_relevant head trust income_**) of the income of the head trust referred to in that subparagraph was paid or applied as mentioned in that subparagraph as a result of the relevant scheme or as a result of any act, transaction or circumstance that occurred as part of, in connection with or as a result of the relevant scheme; and

                     (e)  in a case to which subparagraph (b)(iii) applies—the vested and indefeasible interest of the trustee of the sub-trust in the whole or a part (which whole or part is in this subsection also referred to as the **_relevant head trust income_**) of the income of the head trust referred to in that subparagraph arose out of the relevant scheme or arose by reason of any act, transaction or circumstance that occurred as part of, in connection with or as a result of the relevant scheme;

the following provisions have effect:

                      (f)  the primary taxable amount referred to in paragraph (a) shall be reduced by so much of that amount as is attributable to the relevant head trust income;

                     (g)  a primary taxable amount equal to the amount of the reduction referred to in paragraph (f) shall be taken to exist in relation to the trustee of the head trust in relation to the relevant year of income.

             (3)  Where, but for this subsection, 2 or more primary taxable amounts (in this subsection referred to as the **_original taxable amounts_**) would be taken to exist in relation to the trustee of a trust estate in relation to a year of income in relation to a tax avoidance scheme by reason of the application of subsection (1) or (2):

                     (a)  the original taxable amounts shall not be taken to exist; and

                     (b)  a primary taxable amount equal to the aggregate of the original taxable amounts shall be taken to exist in relation to the trustee of the trust estate in relation to the year of income.

             (4)  For the purposes of paragraphs (1)(c) and (2)(e), but without limiting the generality of those paragraphs, where:

                     (a)  a tax avoidance scheme was entered into at or after the time when a person became a beneficiary of a trust estate; and

                     (b)  the amount (in this subsection referred to as the **_increased amount_**) of the income of the trust estate in which the beneficiary had a vested and indefeasible interest exceeds the amount (in this subsection referred to as the **_original amount_**) of the income of the trust estate in which the beneficiary would have had, or could reasonably be expected to have had, a vested and indefeasible interest if the tax avoidance scheme had not been entered into or if an act, transaction or circumstance that occurred as part of, in connection with or as a result of the tax avoidance scheme had not occurred;

the vested and indefeasible interest of the beneficiary in so much of the increased amount as exceeds the original amount shall be taken to have arisen out of the tax avoidance scheme.

             (5)  In paragraph (1)(d) a reference to the present value of a benefit that has been, will be, or may reasonably be expected to be, derived by a beneficiary of a trust estate as a consequence of a vested and indefeasible interest of the beneficiary in the relevant trust income referred to in that paragraph is a reference to:

                     (a)  where the benefit was derived before the end of the year of income in which the relevant trust income was derived—the amount or value of the benefit at the time at which it was derived; or

                     (b)  in any other case—an amount ascertained in accordance with the formula ![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2006C00555/Html/TrustRecTaxAssAct85_WD02_image002.gif) where:

                            **_A_**     is the amount or value of the benefit at the time at which it was, will be, or may reasonably be expected to be, derived; and

                            **_n_**     is the number of years between the end of the year of income in which the relevant trust income was derived and the time referred to in component A.

             (6)  For the purposes of paragraph (2)(c), but without limiting the generality of that paragraph, where:

                     (a)  a tax avoidance scheme was entered into at or after the time when a person became a beneficiary of a trust estate; and

                     (b)  the amount (in this subsection referred to as the **_increased amount_**) of the share of the income of the trust estate to which the beneficiary was presently entitled exceeds the amount (in this subsection referred to as the **_original amount_**) of the income of the trust estate to which the beneficiary would have been, or could reasonably be expected to have been, presently entitled if the tax avoidance scheme had not been entered into or if an act, transaction or circumstance that occurred as part of, in connection with or as a result of the tax avoidance scheme had not occurred;

the present entitlement of the beneficiary to so much of the increased amount as exceeds the original amount shall be taken to have arisen out of the tax avoidance scheme.

             (7)  For the purposes of paragraph (2)(d), but without limiting the generality of that paragraph, where:

                     (a)  a tax avoidance scheme was entered into at or after the time when a person became a beneficiary of a trust estate; and

                     (b)  income of the trust estate was paid to, or applied for the benefit of, the beneficiary and the amount (in this subsection referred to as the **_increased amount_**) of that income exceeds the amount (in this subsection referred to as the **_original amount_**) that would have been, or could reasonably be expected to have been, paid to, or applied for the benefit of, the beneficiary if the tax avoidance scheme had not been entered into or if an act, transaction or circumstance that occurred as part of, in connection with or as a result of the tax avoidance scheme had not occurred;

so much of the increased amount as exceeds the original amount shall be taken to be income of the trust estate that was paid to, or applied for the benefit of, the beneficiary as a result of the tax avoidance scheme.

             (8)  A primary taxable amount may be taken to exist in relation to the trustee of a trust estate notwithstanding that the trust estate has ceased to exist.

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Secondary taxable amounts

             (1)  Where:

                     (a)  a primary taxable amount exists in relation to the trustee of a trust estate in relation to a year of income; and

                     (b)  either of the following conditions is satisfied:

                              (i)  the trust estate ceased to exist before the commencement of this Act;

                             (ii)  the trust estate has ceased to exist after the commencement of this Act and an assessment of the trust recoupment tax payable on the primary taxable amount was not made before the trust estate ceased to exist;

a secondary taxable amount of an amount equal to the primary taxable amount shall be taken to exist in relation to the eligible beneficiaries class in relation to the year of income.

             (2)  Where:

                     (a)  a primary taxable amount exists in relation to the trustee of a trust estate (in this subsection referred to as the **_relevant trust estate_**) in relation to a year of income;

                     (b)  during the period (in this subsection referred to as the **_relevant period_**) after the time when the tax avoidance scheme to which the primary taxable amount relates was entered into and before the time of service of any notice of assessment in respect of trust recoupment tax payable on the primary taxable amount:

                              (i)  any beneficial interest in the relevant trust estate was sold; or

                             (ii)  any beneficial interest in another trust estate that at any time during the relevant period was a holding trust estate in relation to the relevant trust estate was sold; and

                     (c)  the Commissioner is of the opinion that, by reason of a circumstance mentioned in paragraph (b), it would be unreasonable that the trustee of the relevant trust estate be liable to pay trust recoupment tax on the primary taxable amount;

the following provisions have effect:

                     (a)  there remains unpaid an amount of trust recoupment tax payable by the trustee of a trust estate on a primary taxable amount that exists in relation to the trustee in relation to a year of income and the Commissioner is of the opinion that the trust recoupment tax, or part of the trust recoupment tax, is unlikely to be paid; or

                     (b)  a trust estate ceases to exist at a time when there remains unpaid an amount of trust recoupment tax payable by the trustee on a primary taxable amount that exists in relation to the trustee in relation to a year of income;

a secondary taxable amount shall be taken to exist in relation to the eligible beneficiaries class in relation to the year of income of an amount equal to the amount of the unpaid trust recoupment tax multiplied by 2.22.

             (4)  Subject to subsection (5), for the purposes of the application of subsection (1), (2) or (3) in relation to a primary taxable amount, the eligible beneficiaries class includes each person who has derived, or might reasonably be expected to derive, a benefit that would not have been derived, or might reasonably be expected not to have been derived, if the primary trust income in relation to the primary taxable amount had not been derived.

             (6)  If at any time, whether before or after the commencement of this section, the Australian Statistician has changed or changes the reference base for the Consumer Price Index, then, for the purposes of the application of this section after the change took place or takes place, regard shall be had only to the index numbers published in terms of the new reference base.

             (7)  The Commissioner shall make an assessment of the additional tax payable by a person or persons under a provision of this section.

             (8)  Notice of an assessment made in respect of a person or persons under subsection (7) may be incorporated in notice of any other assessment made in respect of the person or persons under this Act or the Assessment Act.

             (9)  The Commissioner may, in the Commissioner’s discretion, remit the whole or any part of the additional tax payable by a person or persons under a provision of this section, but, for the purposes of the application of subsection 33(1) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ to the power of remission conferred by this subsection, nothing in this Act shall be taken to preclude the exercise of the power at a time before an assessment is made under subsection (7) of the additional tax.

           (10)  In this section, **_index number_**, in relation to a quarter, means the All Groups Consumer Price Index number, being the weighted average of the 8 capital cities, published by the Australian Statistician in respect of the quarter.

##### <a id="13"></a>13  Arrangements etc. to avoid operation of Act

             (1)  Where:

                     (a)  a scheme entered into or carried out by a person after 28 April 1983 would, but for this section, have the effect of in any way, directly or indirectly, defeating, evading or avoiding any liability of the person to pay trust recoupment tax; and

                     (b)  it would be reasonable to conclude or infer that the person entered into or carried out the scheme for the purpose of in any way, directly or indirectly, defeating, evading or avoiding any liability of the person to pay trust recoupment tax or future trust recoupment tax;

then, in any prescribed recovery proceedings, the scheme shall be treated as being void in so far as it would, but for this section, have the effect mentioned in paragraph (a) but without prejudice to such validity as the scheme may have for any other purpose.

             (2)  Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), where:

                     (a)  a person (in this subsection referred to as the **_taxpayer_**) is liable to pay an amount of trust recoupment tax to the Commissioner;

                     (b)  after 28 April 1983, the taxpayer has transferred or transfers property to another person;

                     (c)  the transfer would, but for this section, have the effect of rendering the taxpayer unable to pay the trust recoupment tax, or any part of the trust recoupment tax;

                     (d)  having regard to:

                              (i)  the manner and circumstances in which the transfer was made;

                             (ii)  the nature of any connection (whether of a business, family or other nature) between the taxpayer and the other person referred to in paragraph (b); and

                            (iii)  any other relevant circumstances;

                            it would be reasonable to conclude or infer that the transfer was made by the taxpayer for the purpose of rendering the taxpayer unable to pay the trust recoupment tax, a part of the trust recoupment tax or any future trust recoupment tax; and

                     (e)  either of the following conditions is satisfied:

                              (i)  the transfer was made by way of gift; or

                             (ii)  having regard to the circumstances referred to in paragraph (d), it would be reasonable to conclude or infer that the person to whom the property was transferred believed or suspected that the transfer was made by the taxpayer for the purpose referred to in paragraph (d);

then, in any prescribed recovery proceedings, the transfer shall be treated as being void in so far as it would, but for this section, have the effect mentioned in paragraph (c) but without prejudice to such validity as the transfer may have for any other purpose.

             (3)  A reference in this section to a scheme being entered into or carried out or a transfer of property being made by a person for a particular purpose shall be read as including a reference to the scheme being entered into or carried out or the transfer being made, as the case may be, by the person for 2 or more purposes of which that particular purpose is the dominant purpose.

             (4)  In this section:

                     (a)  a reference to a transfer of property by a person includes a reference to:

                              (i)  the execution by the person of a charge on property of the person in favour of another person;

                             (ii)  the incurring by the person of an obligation in favour of another person; and

                            (iii)  any scheme that has the effect, directly or indirectly, of diminishing the value of any property of the person and increasing the value of the property of another person or persons; and

                     (b)  a reference, in relation to a transfer of property to which paragraph (a) applies, to the person to whom the property was transferred is a reference to:

                              (i)  in a case to which subparagraph (a)(i) applies—the person in whose favour the charge referred to in that subparagraph was executed;

                             (ii)  in a case to which subparagraph (a)(ii) applies—the person in whose favour the obligation referred to in that subparagraph was incurred; and

                            (iii)  in a case to which subparagraph (a)(iii) applies—the person, or any of the persons, referred to in that paragraph the value of whose property was increased by reason of the transfer.

             (5)  A reference in subsection (4) to a scheme that has the effect, directly or indirectly, of increasing the value of the property of a person includes a reference to a scheme that has the effect, directly or indirectly, that the person becomes the owner of property of which the person would not have been the owner but for the scheme, whether or not the property would have existed but for the scheme.

             (6)  A reference in this section to trust recoupment tax shall be read as including a reference to income tax payable by virtue of the operation of section 7 and a reference to future trust recoupment tax shall be read as including a reference to income tax that could reasonably have been expected by the person at the time when the scheme was entered into or carried out to become payable by the person after that time by virtue of the operation of section 7.

             (7)  In this section:

                    <a name="futur-trust-recoup-tax"></a>**_future trust recoupment tax_**, in relation to a person in relation to a scheme, means trust recoupment tax that could reasonably have been expected by the person at the time when the scheme was entered into or carried out to become payable by the person after that time.

                    <a name="prescrib-recoveri-proceing"></a>**_prescribed recovery proceedings_**, in relation to trust recoupment tax, means:

                     (a)  proceedings by the Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner for recovery of the trust recoupment tax or part of the trust recoupment tax or of an amount that includes the trust recoupment tax or part of the trust recoupment tax;

                     (b)  proceedings for enforcement of a judgment given in proceedings referred to in paragraph (a); or

                     (c)  proceedings by a trustee within the meaning of the _Bankruptcy Act 1966_ or by a liquidator, being proceedings for the benefit of the Crown, the Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner or for the benefit of persons including the Crown, the Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner.

                    <a name="trust-recoup-tax"></a>**_trust recoupment tax_** includes applied penalty tax, late payment tax and penalty tax.

##### <a id="14"></a>14  Regulations

                   The Governor-General may make regulations, not inconsistent with this Act, prescribing matters:

                     (a)  required or permitted by this Act to be prescribed; or

                     (b)  necessary or convenient to be prescribed for carrying out or giving effect to this Act;

* * *

_Tax Laws Amendment (Repeal of Inoperative Provisions) Act 2006 
 (No. 101, 2006)_

## Schedule 6

## 1  Application of Schedule 1 and 2 amendments

Except as mentioned in items 2 and 3, the repeals and amendments made by Schedules 1 and 2 apply:

                     (a)  so far as they affect assessments—to assessments for the 2006-07 income year and all later income years; and

                     (b)  otherwise—to acts done or omitted to be done, or states of affairs existing, after the commencement of the repeals and amendments.

## 6  Object

The object of this Part is to ensure that, despite the repeals and amendments made by this Act, the full legal and administrative consequences of:

                     (a)  any act done or omitted to be done; or

                     (b)  any state of affairs existing; or

                     (c)  any period ending;

before such a repeal or amendment applies, can continue to arise and be carried out, directly or indirectly through an indefinite number of steps, even if some or all of those steps are taken after the repeal or amendment applies.

## 7  Making and amending assessments, and doing other things, in relation to past matters

Even though an Act is repealed or amended by this Act, the repeal or amendment is disregarded for the purpose of doing any of the following under any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_):

                     (a)  making or amending an assessment (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

                     (b)  exercising any right or power, performing any obligation or duty or doing any other thing (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

Example 1: On 31 July 1999, Greg Ltd lodged its annual return under former section 160ARE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The return stated that the company had a credit on its franking account and that no franking deficit tax was payable for the 1998-99 franking year. Under former section 160ARH of that Act, the Commissioner was taken to have made an assessment consistent with the return.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of Part IIIAA of that Act, the Commissioner concludes that Greg Ltd fraudulently overfranked dividends it paid during the 1998-99 franking year, and had a franking account deficit for that franking year. As a result, the Commissioner considers that franking deficit tax and a penalty by way of additional tax are payable.

                   The Commissioner can amend the assessment under former section 160ARN of that Act, because item 7 of this Schedule disregards the repeal of that section for the purposes of making an assessment in relation to the 1998-99 franking year. Item 7 will also disregard the repeal of Division 11 of former Part IIIAA to the extent necessary for the Commissioner to assess Greg Ltd’s liability to a penalty by way of additional tax.

                   Despite the repeal of sections 160ARU and 160ARV, item 9 will ensure that the general interest charge will accrue on the unpaid franking deficit tax and penalty until they are paid.

                   Item 7 will also preserve Greg Ltd’s right, under former section 160ART of that Act, to object against the Commissioner’s amended assessment (including the penalty), since the objection is the exercise of a right in relation to a franking year that ended before the repeal of Part IIIAA.

Example 2: During the 1997-98 income year, Duffy Property Ltd withheld amounts from its employees’ wages as required by former Divisions 1AAA and 2 of Part VI of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The company failed to notify the Commissioner of those amounts, and failed to remit them to the Commissioner.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of those Divisions, the Commissioner discovers that the withheld amounts have not been remitted. The company’s records are incomplete and the Commissioner is unable to completely ascertain the extent of its liability for the withheld amounts. Under section 222AGA of that Act, the Commissioner makes an estimate of the liability.

                   Item 7 will disregard the repeal of section 220AAZA of that Act (which empowered the Commissioner to recover the amount of the estimate). Even though the estimate is made after the repeal, it relates to amounts withheld before the repeal.

## 8  Saving of provisions about effect of assessments

If a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act deals with the effect of an assessment, the repeal or amendment is disregarded in relation to assessments made, before or after the repeal or amendment applies, in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

## 9  Saving of provisions about general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty

If:

                     (a)  a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act provides for the payment of:

                              (i)  general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty (all within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_); or

                             (ii)  interest under the _Taxation (Interest on Overpayments and Early Payments) Act 1983_; and

                     (b)  in a particular case, the period in respect of which the charge, penalty or interest is payable (whether under the provision or under the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_) has not begun, or has begun but not ended, when the provision is repealed or amended;

then, despite the repeal or amendment, the provision or part continues to apply in the particular case until the end of the period.

## 10  Repeals disregarded for the purposes of dependent provisions

If the operation of a provision (the **_subject provision_**) of any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_) made under any Act depends to any extent on an Act, or a provision of an Act, that is repealed by this Act, the repeal is disregarded so far as it affects the operation of the subject provision.

## 11  Schedule does not limit operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_

This Schedule does not limit the operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.
