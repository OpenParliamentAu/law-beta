</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

it would be concluded that the person, or any of the persons, who entered into or carried out the scheme or any part of the scheme did so for the purpose of securing that a person or persons (whether or not a particular person or particular persons) who, if the scheme had not been entered into or carried out, would have been liable to pay income tax in respect of a year of income would not be liable to pay income tax in respect of that year of income or would be liable to pay less income tax in respect of that year of income than the person or persons would have been liable to pay if the scheme had not been entered into or carried out.
