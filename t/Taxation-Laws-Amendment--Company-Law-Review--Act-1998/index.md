<dt>(b)</dt><dd>some or all of the shareholders who do not receive the shares receive or

will receive minimally franked dividends.

</dd>

</dl></dl>
<dt>(2)</dt><dd>The value of the share at the time that the shareholder is provided with

the share is taken, for the purposes of this Act, to be an unfranked dividend

that is paid by the company, out of profits of the company, to the shareholder

at that time. No entitlement to a rebate arises under section 46 or 46A in

respect of the dividend.</dd> <dt>(3)</dt><dd>A dividend is _minimally franked_ if it is not franked, or is franked to less than 10%, in accordance with section 160AQF or 160AQFA. </dd>

8  Application

The amendments made by this Schedule apply where, after the commencement of this item, an amount is transferred to the share capital account of a company with shares with no par value.

9  Transitional&#151;merging of share capital account and share premium account

A company's share capital account does not become tainted under Division 7B of Part IIIAA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ merely because an amount standing to the credit of the company's share premium account (within the meaning of that Act) or capital redemption reserve becomes part of the company's share capital under Schedule 5 to the _Company Law Review Act 1998_.

9  Transitional&#151;merging tainted share premium accounts

(1)	This item applies if, apart from this item, a company's share capital account would become tainted under Division 7B of Part IIIAA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ because the amount (the _tainted amount_) standing to the credit of a tainted share premium account becomes part of the company's share capital under Schedule 5 to the _Company Law Review Act 1998_.
 (2)	The share capital account is only tainted as a result of the tainted amount becoming part of the share capital account when the balance of the share capital account is equal to the net tainted amount.

Note:	This does not prevent the share capital account from becoming tainted under section 160ARDM of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ as a result of other amounts being transferred to it.

(3)	No franking debit arises under section 160ARDQ of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ as a result of the share capital account becoming 
<center>Back to Top</center>
 tainted under subitem (2).
 (4)	Where:

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>before a distribution that consists of one or more amounts the share

capital account is not tainted; but</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>after the distribution the share capital account is tainted;

the following proportion of each of the amounts is taken to have been paid from a tainted share account:

where:
 _tainted amount of distribution_ is the difference between the net tainted amount immediately before the distribution and the net tainted amount immediately after the distribution.

Note:	Certain distributions from tainted share capital accounts will be unfranked dividends for which no section 46 or 46A rebate is available.

(5)	In this item:

_net tainted amount_, in relation to an account, means the lesser of:

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>the tainted amount;</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>the lowest balance of the share capital account at any time after the

commencement of this item.

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>to which the company has, in respect of premiums received by the company

on shares issued by it, credited amounts, being the respective amounts of the

a premium.
