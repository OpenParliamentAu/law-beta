regard to the following matters:

  (a) if the ETP relates to employment in which the taxpayer was engaged on 30

June 1983 - the amount of an ETP that could, in the opinion of the

Commissioner, reasonably be expected to have been made in relation to the

taxpayer in consequence of the termination of that employment if that

employment had been terminated on that date;

  (b) if the ETP relates to membership of the taxpayer of a superannuation

fund on 30 June 1983 - the amount of an ETP that could, in the opinion of the

Commissioner, reasonably be expected to have been made in relation to the

                                                                attributable

to

                                                                the taxed

                                                                element of

the

                                                                post-June 83

                                                                component of

the earlier ETP

  &quot;(2) For the purposes of the table above:

  (a) paragraph references indicate an ETP that is covered by the paragraph

concerned of the definition of 'eligible termination payment' in subsection

27A (1); and

  (b) an ETP is attributable to a taxed element if, and only if, the ETP is

(in whole or in part) attributable to the taxed element of the post-June 1983

component of an earlier ETP.

  &quot;(3) The taxed element of the post-June 83 component of an ETP covered by

item 3, 4, 6 or 8 in the table in subsection (1) is determined as follows:

  (a) if both of the following subparagraphs apply in relation to the

post-June 83 component:

    (i) no deduction is or was allowable under section 279 to the

trustee of the taxed superannuation fund concerned in any year of income in

relation to a current or contingent liability to provide death or disability

benefits (within the meaning of Part IX) for the deceased person concerned;

    (ii) no deduction is or was allowable under section 279B to the

trustee of the taxed superannuation fund concerned in any year of income in

relation to a death or disability ETP (within the meaning of that section)

paid in relation to the deceased person concerned;

the taxed element is the whole of the component;

  (b) if paragraph (a) does not apply:

    (i) in the case of an ETP covered by item 6 or 8 in the table

in subsection (1) that was calculated by taking into account the amount, or

the amount that would have been the amount, of the unused undeducted purchase

price in relation to a pension or annuity (which amount is in this subsection

called the 'UUPP amount'), the taxed element of the post-June 83 component of

the ETP is the amount that would have been the amount of the post-June 83

component if the ETP had been equal to the amount calculated using the

following formula and had been reduced by the UUPP amount:

                                 Days in eligible service period

                Grossed-up ETP x -------------------------------

                                   Days in total service period

      where:

        Grossed-up ETP is the amount of the ETP increased by

        Days in eligible service period is the number of whole

        Days in total service period is the sum of:

the UUPP amount;

days in the eligible service period in relation to the ETP;

          (A) Days in eligible service period; and

          (B) the number of whole days in the period commencing on the

date of the death of the member of the fund and ending on the last retirement

date; or

    (ii) in any other case - the amount that would have been the

amount of the post-June 83 component if the ETP had been equal to the amount

calculated using the following formula:

                           Days in eligible service period

                     ETP x -------------------------------

                             Days in total service period

      where:

        ETP is the amount of the ETP;

        Days in eligible service period has the same meaning as in

subparagraph (i);

        Days in total service period has the same meaning as in

subparagraph (i).

  &quot;(4) In spite of anything in subsection (1), where:

  (a) an ETP is paid from a taxed superannuation fund;

  (b) apart from this subsection, the post-June 83 component of the ETP

consists wholly or partly of a taxed element (which taxed element is in this

subsection called the 'otherwise taxed element'); and

  (c) the trustee of the fund gives to the person to whom the ETP is paid,

within the time and in the manner approved by the Commissioner in writing, a

written notice nominating the whole or a specified part of the otherwise taxed

element as an untaxed element of the post-June 83 component of the ETP;

so much of the otherwise taxed element of the post-June 83 component of the

ETP as is covered by the notice shall be treated as, or as an additional part

of, the untaxed element of the post-June 83 component of the ETP.

  &quot;(5) The trustee of the fund is not allowed to give more than one notice

under subsection (4) in relation to a particular ETP.

  &quot;(6) Where, because of subsection 27A (17):

  (a) a particular part of an ETP is taken to have been paid from a taxed

superannuation fund; and

  (b) the remaining part of the ETP is not taken to have been paid from a

taxed superannuation fund;

the following provisions have effect:

  (c) the taxed element of the post-June 83 component of the ETP is the amount

obtained by:

    (i) treating each of the parts referred to in paragraph (a) and

        (b) of this subsection as separate ETPs;

    (ii) calculating the taxed element of the post-June 83 component

of each of those separate ETPs in accordance with the preceding provisions of

this section; and

    (iii) adding together those taxed elements;

  (d) to the extent to which the post-June 83 component of the ETP does not

consist of a taxed element, it consists of an untaxed element.

Assessable income to include certain superannuation and kindred

payments

  &quot;27B. (1) Where an ETP is made in relation to a taxpayer in a year of

income, the assessable income of the taxpayer of the year of income includes:

  (a) the taxed element of the post-June 83 component reduced by so much of

that element as has been rolled-over; and

  (b) the untaxed element of the post-June 83 component reduced by so much of

that element as has been rolled-over.

  &quot;(2) Where an ETP is made in relation to a taxpayer in a year of income, the

assessable income of the taxpayer of the year of income includes the

non-qualifying component.

Assessable income to include 5% of certain amounts

  &quot;27C. (1) Subject to subsection (2), if an ETP made in relation to a

taxpayer in a year of income includes a pre-July 83 component, the assessable

income of the taxpayer of the year of income shall include 5% of so much of

that component as has not been rolled-over.

  &quot;(1A) If the Commissioner, having regard to the extent to which the ETP

would have been included in the assessable income of the taxpayer if the

amendments made by the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Act (No. 3) 1984 had

not been made, considers that it is appropriate that a lesser amount be

included instead in the taxpayer's assessable income, that lesser amount shall

be included.

  &quot;(2) If an ETP made in relation to a taxpayer in a year of income includes a

concessional component, the assessable income of the taxpayer of the year of

income shall include 5% of so much of that component as has not been

rolled-over.

Anti-detriment provision for service mismatch cases

  &quot;27CA. (1) This section applies to an ETP (in this section called the

'actual ETP') if:

  (a) the ETP is made in relation to the taxpayer on or after the taxpayer's

55th birthday; and

  (b) the ETP:

    (i) is paid by a continuously complying superannuation fund or

continuously complying ADF; or

    (ii) is made in relation to the commutation of, or is the residual

capital value of, a rebatable ETP annuity (within the meaning of Subdivision

AAB of Division 17).

  &quot;(2) If the Commissioner is satisfied in respect of the actual ETP that:

  (a) the old system net benefit for the equivalent old system ETP would have

exceeded the actual net benefit for the actual ETP; and

  (b) the whole or part (which whole or part is in this section called the

'detriment amount') of the excess referred to in paragraph (a) is attributable

to the fact that an amount or amounts were included in the assessable income

of any taxpayer in relation to taxable contributions made to a complying

superannuation fund;

the Commissioner shall take such steps as are necessary to compensate the

taxpayer for the detriment amount.

  &quot;(3) The steps that the Commissioner may take include:

  (a) reducing the amount of tax payable by the taxpayer in respect of the

year of income in which the actual ETP was received (including a reduction by

way of a rebate of tax or increased rebate of tax); or

  (b) granting to the taxpayer an entitlement to a credit of tax.

  &quot;(4) Sections 160AI to 160AL (inclusive) apply in relation to a decision of

the Commissioner granting an entitlement to a credit under this section in

like manner as those sections apply to a determination of a credit within the

meaning of those sections.

  &quot;(5) The Commissioner shall apply a credit of tax to which the taxpayer is

entitled under this section in payment successively of:

  (a) any tax payable by the taxpayer in respect of the year of income in

which the ETP is made (whether or not that tax is due for payment); and

  (b) any other liability of the taxpayer to the Commonwealth arising under,

or by virtue of, this Act or any other Act of which the Commissioner has the

general administration;

and shall refund to the taxpayer so much of the credit as is not so applied.&quot;.

purchase the annuity was entered into;

  (b) for a superannuation-related ETP or a part of a superannuation-related

ETP:

    (i) if the ETP is covered by paragraph (b), (ba), (da), (db),

(ga) or (gb) of the definition of 'eligible termination payment' in subsection

27A (1) and the ETP was made because a person was a member of a superannuation

fund - the date on which that person last became a member of the fund before

the ETP was paid; or

    (ii) if the ETP is covered by paragraph (d), (e) or (f) of the

definition of 'eligible termination payment' in subsection 27A (1) and the

superannuation pension concerned was payable from a superannuation fund

because a person was a member of the superannuation fund - the date on which

that person last became a member of the fund before the ETP was paid.

Rebatable amounts

  &quot;159SE. (1) The rebatable amounts specified in Tables 1 and 2 are determined

as follows:

  (a) the 'derived amount' is so much of the taxable part of the taxable

income as is attributable to the corresponding class of eligible assessable

income;

  (b) subject to subsection (2), the 'low rate part' is so much of the derived

amount for the class of eligible assessable income concerned as does not

exceed the residual amount for the current year;

  (c) the 'remaining part' is so much of the derived amount for the class of

eligible assessable income concerned as is left over after deducting the low

rate part.

  &quot;(2) The total of the low rate parts for the current year shall not exceed

the residual amount for the current year.

Residual amount

  &quot;159SF. (1) The residual amount for a year of income (in this subsection

called the 'reference year') is:

  (a) for the year of income in which 1 July 1983 occurred - $50,000; or

  (b) for a later year of income - the sum of:

    (i) the closing balance for the previous year of income; and

    (ii) the amount (if any) by which the upper limit for the

reference year exceeds the upper limit for the previous year of income.

  &quot;(2) The closing balance for a year of income is the residual amount for the

year of income, reduced (but not below 0) by the total of any s.27B (1)

amounts included in the assessable income of the year of income in respect of

age 55 ETPs.

Upper limit for purpose of determining residual amount

  &quot;159SG. (1) For the purposes of this Subdivision, the upper limit is:

  (a) in relation to a year of income before the year of income commencing on

1 July 1985 - $50,000;

  (b) in relation to the year of income commencing on 1 July 1985, the year of

income commencing on 1 July 1986 or the year of income commencing on 1 July

1987 - $55,000;

  (c) in relation to the year of income commencing on 1 July 1988 - $60,000;

or

  (d) in relation to a later year of income - the amount calculated by

multiplying the upper limit for the immediately preceding year of income by

the indexation factor calculated under subsection (2) for the later year of

income.

  &quot;(2) The indexation factor for a year of income is whichever is the greater

of the following:

  (a) 1;

  (b) the factor (calculated to 3 decimal places) ascertained by dividing the

index number (defined in subsection (3)) for the March quarter immediately

preceding 1 July in the year of income by the index number for the March

quarter immediately preceding that first-mentioned March quarter.

  &quot;(3) The index number for a quarter is the estimate of full-time adult

average weekly ordinary time earnings for the middle month of the quarter

published by the Australian Statistician in respect of that month.

  &quot;(4) If at any time, whether before or after the commencement of this

subsection, the Australian Statistician has published or publishes an index

number in respect of a quarter in substitution for an index number previously

published by the Australian Statistician in respect of that quarter, the

publication of the later index number shall be disregarded for the purposes of

this section.

  &quot;(5) If the factor ascertained under paragraph (2) (b) in relation to a year

of income would, if it were calculated to 4 decimal places, end with a number

greater than 4, the factor ascertained under that paragraph in relation to

that year of income shall be taken to be that factor calculated to 3 decimal

places and increased by 0.001.

Treatment of s.27B (1) amounts assessed under section 101A

  &quot;159SH. The following provisions have effect if an amount (in this section

called the 'notional 27B (1) amount') is included in the assessable income of

a trust estate of the current year under subsection 101A (3) in respect of a

s.27B (1) amount that was included in the assessable income of a deceased

taxpayer:

  (a) for the purposes of this Subdivision, the trustee shall be taken to be a

taxpayer who has attained the age that the deceased taxpayer had attained at

the date of death and who has had the notional 27B (1) amount included in

assessable income of the current year under subsection 27B (1);

  (b) for the purposes of determining the residual amount under section 159SF,

any age 55 ETP made in respect of the deceased taxpayer during the deceased

taxpayer's lifetime:

    (i) shall be taken to have been made in relation to the trustee;

and

    (ii) shall be taken to have been included in the assessable income

of the estate of the deceased taxpayer of the year of income of the deceased

taxpayer in which the ETP was made.

  &quot;159SM. (1) Subject to subsection (2), for each rebatable 27H amount

included in the assessable income of a taxpayer of a year of income in respect

of a rebatable superannuation pension, the taxpayer is entitled to a rebate of

tax in the taxpayer's assessment for the year of income of an amount

calculated using the formula:

                     Reduced 27H amount x Final percentage

where:

death or disability benefit is calculated using the formula:

                                                 Accrual days

             Normal percentage x ----------------------------------

                                 Accrual days + Future service days

the first payment date and ending on the last retirement date in relation to

the employment to which the pension relates;

  Accrual days is the number of whole days in the accrual period for the

pension.

Intermediate percentages for components in respect of superannuation

pensions

  &quot;159SQ. (1) The intermediate percentage for a commutation component in

respect of a rebatable superannuation pension (in this subsection called the

'current pension') is calculated using the formula:

superannuation pension or a rebatable ETP annuity - the final percentage for

the underlying pension or annuity; or

    (b) in any other case - 0%;

  Component is the number of dollars in the component;

  Notional purchase price is the number of dollars in the notional purchase

price of the current pension.

  &quot;(2) The intermediate percentage for the ordinary component in respect of a

rebatable superannuation pension is calculated using the formula:

                                  Component          Post-June 83 days

          Base percentage x ---------------------- x -----------------

                            Notional purchase price      Accrual days

where:

  Base percentage is the base percentage for the component;

  Component is the number of dollars in the component;

  Notional purchase price is the number of dollars in the notional purchase

price of the superannuation pension;

  Post-June 83 days is the number of days after 30 June 1983 in the accrual

period for the superannuation pension;

  Accrual days is the number of days in the accrual period for the

Final percentage for rebatable ETP annuity

  &quot;159SW. The final percentage for a rebatable ETP annuity is the sum of the

intermediate percentages for the components in respect of the annuity.

Intermediate percentages for components in respect of rebatable ETP

annuities

  &quot;159SX. (1) The intermediate percentage for a commutation component in

respect of a rebatable ETP annuity (in this subsection called the 'current

annuity') is calculated using the formula:

                                                Component

                     Underlying percentage x --------------

                                             Purchase price

where:

  Underlying percentage is:

    (a) if the underlying pension or annuity is a rebatable

superannuation pension or a rebatable ETP annuity - the final percentage for

the underlying pension or annuity; or

    (b) in any other case - 0%;

  Component is the number of dollars in the component;

  Purchase price is the number of dollars in the purchase price of the current

annuity.

  &quot;(2) The intermediate percentage for an ordinary component in respect of a

rebatable ETP annuity is calculated using the formula:

                                   Component     Post-June 83 days

              Base percentage x -------------- x -----------------

                                  Purchase price    Accrual days

where:

  Base percentage is the base percentage for the component;

  Component is the number of dollars in the component;

  Purchase price is the number of dollars in the purchase price of the

annuity;

  Post-June 83 days is so much of Accrual days as represents days after 30

June 1983;

  Accrual days is the aggregate of the number of days in:

    (a) the accrual period for the underlying ETP; and

    (b) the period from the time the annuity was purchased to the

first payment date.

  &quot;(3) The intermediate percentage for a specified component in respect of a

rebatable ETP annuity is calculated using the formula:

                                      Component

                              15% x --------------

                                    Purchase price

where:

  Component is the number of dollars in the component;

  Purchase price is the number of dollars in the purchase price of the

annuity.

Base percentages for ordinary component in respect of rebatable ETP annuities

  &quot;159SY. The base percentage for an ordinary component in respect of a

rebatable ETP annuity depends as follows on the year of income in which the

first payment date occurs:

    1988-89 . . . . . . .   3%

    1989-90 . . . . . . .   6%

    1990-91 . . . . . . .   9%

    1991-92 . . . . . . .  12%

    1992-93 or later . . . 15%.&quot;.

are substituted:

Transfer of taxable contributions

  &quot;275\. (1) Subject to this section, the trustee of a complying superannuation

fund or complying ADF (in this section called the 'transferor') may, with the

consent of a particular life assurance company, registered organization or PST

(in this section called the 'transferee'), give a notice to the Commissioner

in relation to a year of income (in this section called the 'transferor's year

of income) stating that this section applies to the transferor and transferee

in relation to an amount specified in the notice.

  &quot;(2) Subject to subsection (3), the effect of the notice is that the amount

to which the notice relates shall be taken, for the purposes of this Act:

  (a) to be included in the assessable income of the transferee of the year of

income of the transferee in which the end of the transferor's year of income

occurs; and

  (b) not to be included in the assessable income of the transferor of the

transferor's year of income.

  &quot;(3) The total amount excluded from the transferor's assessable income of a

year of income under this section shall not exceed the total of the taxable

contributions paid to the transferor in that year of income.

  &quot;(4) The amount specified in the notice shall not exceed the amount

calculated using the formula:

                              Highest equity value

                              --------------------

                                      Tax rate

where:

  Highest equity value is the highest value, at any time during the

transferor's year of income, of the transferor's investment in the

transferee;

  Tax rate is the rate of tax imposed on the standard component of the taxable

income of the transferor of the transferor's year of income.

  &quot;(5) A reference in subsection (4) to the transferor's investment in the

transferee is a reference to investments consisting of:

  (a) if the transferee is a PST - units in the PST; or

  (b) if the transferee is a life assurance company or registered

organization:

    (i) life assurance policies issued by the transferee; or

    (ii) an interest in an interposed trust whose assets consist wholly

of life assurance policies issued by the transferee.

  &quot;(6) The transferor is allowed to give only one notice in relation to a year

of income in relation to a particular transferee.

  &quot;(7) The notice:

  (a) shall be in the approved form;

  (b) shall be given in the approved manner;

  (c) shall be given on or before the date of lodgment of the return of income

of the transferor for the transferor's year of income; and

Pre-1 July 88 funding credit balance

  &quot;275A. (1) For the purposes of this Division, the pre-1 July 88 funding

credit balance of a fund at a particular time in a year of income is the

amount (if any) by which the total of the pre-1 July 88 funding credits of the

fund arising in the year of income and before that time exceeds the total of

the pre-1 July 88 funding debits arising in the year of income and before that

time.

  &quot;(2) If the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner has given a notice

under subsection 15D (2) of the OSS Act granting the trustee of a fund a pre-1

July 88 funding credit, there shall be taken to have arisen, at the beginning

of the year of income in which 1 July 1988 occurs, a pre-1 July 88 funding

credit of the fund as specified in the notice.

  &quot;(3) If the trustee of a fund makes an election under subsection 275B (1)

for a year of income in relation to a particular amount, there shall be taken

to have arisen, immediately before the end of the year of income, a pre-1 July

88 funding debit equal to that amount.

  &quot;(4) If the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner has given a notice

under subsection 15D (4) of the OSS Act in relation to an event that has

occurred (within the meaning of that subsection) in relation to a fund, there

shall be taken to have arisen, at the end of the second-last day of the year

of income in which the event occurred, a pre-1 July 88 funding debit equal to

the pre-1 July 88 funding credit balance (if any) of the fund immediately

before the end of that day.

  &quot;(5) If the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner has given a notice

under subsection 15D (6) of the OSS Act granting the trustee of a fund a pre-1

July 88 funding debit, in relation to an event that has occurred (within the

meaning of that subsection) in relation to a fund, there shall be taken to

have arisen, immediately after the beginning of the second-last day of the

year of income in which the event occurred, a pre-1 July 88 funding debit

equal to the amount specified in the notice.

  &quot;(6) If the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner gives a notice under

regulations made for the purposes of subsection 15D (7) of the OSS Act

approving the transfer of a pre-1 July 88 funding credit of a fund (in this

subsection called the 'transferor') to another fund (in this subsection called

the 'transferee'):

  (a) there shall be taken to have arisen, immediately after the beginning of

the second-last day of the year of income in which the time that the transfer

has effect under those regulation occurs, a pre-1 July 88 funding debit of the

transferor equal to the amount transferred; and

  (b) there shall be taken to have arisen, at the beginning of the secondlast

day of the year of income in which the time the transfer has effect under

those regulations occurs, a pre-1 July 88 funding credit of the transferee

equal to the amount transferred.

  &quot;(7) If a fund has a pre-1 July 88 funding credit balance at the end of a

year of income, there shall be taken to have arisen, at the beginning of the

next year of income, a pre-1 July 88 funding credit equal to the amount

calculated by multiplying that pre-1 July 88 credit balance by the indexation

factor calculated under subsection 159SG (2) for the next year of income.

Application of pre-1 July 88 funding credits

  &quot;275B. (1) If there is a pre-1 July 88 funding credit balance of a complying

superannuation fund as at the beginning of the last day of a year of income,

the trustee of the fund may elect that this subsection shall apply for the

year of income in relation to a specified amount of taxable contributions made

to the fund.

  &quot;(2) The amount specified in the election shall not exceed whichever of the

following is the lesser:

  (a) the pre-1 July 88 funding credit balance of the fund as at the beginning

of the last day of the year of income;

  (b) the total of the amounts covered by subparagraph 274 (1) (a) (i), (ii)

or (iii) paid to the fund in the year of income, reduced by amounts covered by

subsection 274 (7) and by the amount calculated using the formula:

      R x (Taxed ETP components + Total pension components)

where:

      R is the number determined in accordance with the following table:

    Total pension components is the aggregate of the pension

components calculated under subsection (3) for each rebatable superannuation

pension that is payable from the fund and has a first payment date in the year

of income.

  &quot;(3) The pension component for a rebatable superannuation pension is

calculated using the formula:

                                                Post-June 83 days

              (Notional purchase price - UPP) x -----------------

                                                    Accrual days

where:

  Notional purchase price is the notional purchase price of the pension for

the purposes of Subdivision AAB of Division 17 of Part III;

  UPP is the amount that applies to the pension under paragraph (b) of the

definition of 'undeducted purchase price' in subsection 27A (1);

  Post-June 83 days is the number of days after 30 June 1983 in the accrual

period for the pension;

  Accrual days is the number of days in the accrual period for the pension.

  &quot;(4) The assessable income of the fund of the year of income shall not

include the amount specified in the election.

  &quot;(5) An election by a trustee under subsection (1):

  (a) shall be made by notice in writing to the Commissioner; and

  (b) shall be lodged with the Commissioner on or before the date of lodgment

of the return of income of the trustee for the year of income to which the

election relates, or before such later date as the Commissioner allows.

  &quot;(6) In this section:

  '1988-89' means the year of income commencing on 1 July 1988 and so on for

other years of income.

  &quot;(7) In this section:

  'accrual period' has the same meaning as in Subdivision AAB of Division 17

of Part III;

  'first payment date' has the same meaning as in Subdivision AAB of Division

17 of Part III;

  'rebatable superannuation pension' has the same meaning as in Subdivision

AAB of Division 17 of Part III.&quot;.

Contribution notices or eligible person notices given after return

lodgment date

  50\. Section 276 of the Principal Act is amended by omitting subsections (1),

(2) and (3) and substituting the following subsections:

  &quot;(1) Subject to this section, if:

  (a) a notice under subsection 82AAT (1A) in relation to a contribution made

to a fund in a year of income (in this section called the 'contribution year')

is given to the trustee of the fund in a later year of income (in this section

called the 'notice year') and on or after the date specified in subsection 274

(2); or

  (b) a notice under subsection 274 (4) in relation to a year of income (in

this section also called the 'contribution year') is given to the trustee of a

fund in a later year of income (in this section also called the 'notice year')

and on or after the date specified in subsection 274 (3);

and, apart from this section and section 275, the assessable income of the

fund of the contribution year would include an amount (in this section called

the 'clawback amount') that would not have been included if the notice had

been given to the trustee before that date, the clawback amount is allowable

as a deduction from the assessable income of the fund of the notice year.

  &quot;(3) If the Commissioner is satisfied, having regard to the matters

specified in subsection (4), that it would be appropriate for the clawback

amount not to be included in the assessable income of the fund of the

contribution year:

  (a) if paragraph (1) (a) applies:

    (i) so much of the contribution referred to in paragraph (1) (a)

as is equal to the clawback amount shall be taken for the purposes of this

Part (other than this section) never to have been a taxable contribution; and

    (ii) the clawback amount is not allowable as a deduction under

subsection (1); or

  (b) if paragraph (1) (b) applies:

    (i) contributions made to the fund in the contribution year by

the contributor concerned shall be taken for the purposes of this Part (other

than this section) never to have been taxable contributions; and

    (ii) the clawback amount is not allowable as a deduction under

subsection (1).&quot;.

  (a) under subsection (1) in respect of a premium for an insurance policy

that is only partly in respect of a liability of the kind mentioned in that

subsection; or

  (b) under subsection (2);

unless the return of the fund of the year of income is accompanied by a

certificate by an actuary, in the approved form, with respect to the operation

of this section.

  &quot;(4) A deduction is not allowable under this section in relation to a year

of income if the trustee of the fund concerned elects that this section does

not apply to the trustee in relation to that year of income.

  &quot;(5) If the trustee of a fund makes an election under subsection (4) in

relation to a year of income then, unless the Commissioner otherwise

determines, the trustee shall be taken, for the purposes of this Part, to have

made an election under subsection (4) in respect of the next succeeding year

of income.

  &quot;(6) An election by a trustee under subsection (4):

  (a) shall be made by notice in writing to the Commissioner; and

  (b) shall be lodged with the Commissioner on or before the date of lodgment

of the return of income of the trustee for the year of income to which the

TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (SUPERANNUATION) ACT 1989No. 105, 1989

- SECT 52

  52\. After section 279 of the Principal Act the following sections are

inserted:

Clawback of rebates or refunds of deductible premiums

  &quot;279A. (1) Where the trustee of a complying superannuation fund receives in

a year of income a rebate or refund of a premium which has, in whole or in

part, been allowed or is allowable as a deduction under subsection 279 (1), so

much of that rebate or refund as is attributable to that deduction shall be

included in the assessable income of the trustee of the year of income.

  &quot;(2) Nothing in subsection (1) limits the circumstances in which other

rebates or refunds are included in the assessable income.

Deduction for future service element of death or disability benefits

  &quot;279B. (1) If:

  (a) the trustee of a complying superannuation fund makes an election under

subsection 279 (4) in relation to a year of income; and

  (b) in the year of income, the trustee pays a death or disability ETP in

relation to a member of the fund in consequence of the termination of any

employment of the member;

there is allowable as a deduction in respect of the year of income an amount

calculated using the following formula:

                                      Days in future service period

            Death or disability ETP x -----------------------------

                                       Days in total service period

where:

  Death or disability ETP is the amount of the death or disability ETP;

  Days in future service period is the number of whole days in the period

commencing on the day the termination occurred and ending on the last

retirement date;

  Days in total service period is the sum of:

  (c) the number of whole days in the eligible service period in relation to

the death or disability ETP; and

  (d) Days in future service period.

  &quot;(2) For the purposes of this section, where:

  (a) in a year of income, the trustee of a complying superannuation fund

commences to pay an annuity (within the meaning of section 27H);

  (b) the annuity consists of a death or disability benefit in relation to a

member of the fund; and

  (c) the annuity was paid in consequence of the termination of any employment

of the member;

the following provisions have effect:

  (d) the trustee shall be treated as if the trustee had paid a death or

disability ETP covered by paragraph (b) of the definition of 'eligible

termination payment' in subsection 27A (1) in lieu of that annuity;

  (e) the amount of that eligible termination payment shall be taken to be the

net present value of the annuity as at the date of commencement of payment of

the annuity.

  &quot;(3) A reference in this section to a death or disability ETP is a reference

to a payment:

  (a) that consists of a death or disability benefit paid in relation to a

member of a complying superannuation fund; and

  (b) that is an ETP or would be an ETP if:

    (i) a reference in the definition of 'eligible termination payment'

in subsection 27A (1) to a payment made in respect of a taxpayer included a

reference to a payment (within the meaning of Subdivision AA of Division 2 of

Part III) made (whether voluntarily, by agreement or by a compulsion of law)

after the death of the taxpayer to or for the benefit of a dependant of the

taxpayer; and

    (ii) subsection 27A (4) had not been enacted.

  &quot;(4) For the purposes of this section, where, in a year of income, the

trustee of a complying superannuation fund pays a benefit covered by paragraph

(c) of the definition of 'death or disability benefit' in subsection 267 (1)

during a period when a member of the fund was unable to perform the normal

duties of the member's employment, the following provisions have effect:

  (a) the trustee shall be treated as if the trustee had paid a death or

disability ETP covered by paragraph (b) of the definition of 'eligible

termination payment' in subsection 27A (1) in lieu of that benefit;

  (b) the amount of that eligible termination payment shall be taken to be the

total amount of the benefit paid in that year of income;

  (c) that eligible termination payment shall be taken to have been paid in

consequence of the termination of that employment;

  (d) that employment shall be taken to have been terminated on the day on

which the member became unable to perform the normal duties of that

employment.

Deduction for section 82AAQ assessable amounts

  &quot;279C. Where, under section 82AAQ, the assessable income of a taxpayer of a

year of income includes an amount of a payment, or equal to the value of a

benefit, received from a complying superannuation fund, that amount is also

allowable as a deduction to the fund in respect of the year of income.

Deduction for certain potential detriment payments made after the death

of a fund member

  &quot;279D. (1) Where:   (a) after the death of a person (in this section called

the 'deceased person'):

    (i) the trustee of a continuously complying superannuation fund

or continuously complying ADF (in this section called the 'paying entity')

makes a payment to another person (in this section called the 'recipient') by

reason that the deceased person was a member of the fund; or

    (ii) a life assurance company or registered organization (in this

section also called the 'paying entity') makes a payment to another person (in

this section also called the 'recipient') in relation to the commutation of,

or of the residual capital value of, an exempt policy (within the meaning of

Division 8 of Part III) or RA policy (within the meaning of Division 8 of Part

III) by reason that the deceased person would have been entitled to receive

the annuity concerned;

  (b) the recipient is the trustee of the estate of the deceased person or is

a person who:

    (i) was a dependant of the deceased person immediately before

the deceased person's death; or

    (ii) was a dependant of the deceased person immediately before

the time of payment; and

  (c) the Commissioner is satisfied that the paying entity has passed on to

the recipient the whole of the benefit that would accrue to the paying entity

if a deduction were allowed under this section in respect of the payment;

an amount calculated under subsection (2) is allowable as a deduction from the

assessable income of the paying entity of the year of income in which the

payment is made.

  &quot;(2) The deduction under subsection (1) in respect of a payment (in this

subsection called the 'actual payment') in respect of a year of income is

calculated using the formula:

              Notional payment reduction due to contributions tax

              ---------------------------------------------------

                       Complying superannuation tax rate

where:

  Notional payment reduction due to contributions tax is the difference

between:

    (a) the amount that would have been the amount of the actual

payment if:

      (i) no amounts were included in assessable income in

relation to taxable contributions made to a complying superannuation fund;

and

      (ii) it had been expected that no deduction would be

allowable under this section in respect of the actual payment; and

    (b) the amount that would have been the amount of the actual

payment if it had been expected that no deduction would be allowable under

this section in respect of the payment;

  Complying superannuation tax rate is the rate of tax imposed on the standard

component of the taxable incomes of complying superannuation funds of the year

of income.

  &quot;(3) If the recipient is the trustee of the estate of the deceased person,

the deduction allowable is only so much of the amount calculated under

subsection (2) as the Commissioner considers appropriate having regard to the

extent to which the dependants of the deceased person may reasonably be

expected to benefit from the estate.

  &quot;(4) In this section:

  'dependant' has the meaning given by paragraph (a) of the definition of

'dependant' in subsection 27A (1).&quot;.

Exclusion from assessable income of non-reversionary bonuses on policies

of life assurance

  &quot;282A. The assessable income of a complying superannuation fund of a year of

income shall not include a non-reversionary bonus on a policy of life

assurance.

Exemption of income derived from segregated current pension assets

  &quot;282B. Any amount of normal assessable income derived by a complying

superannuation fund from assets that, when the income is derived, are

segregated current pension assets, is exempt from tax.

Exemption of proportion of income attributable to current pension

liabilities

  &quot;283\. (1) For each amount of normal assessable income of a complying

superannuation fund of a year of income other than:

  (a) income exempt from tax under section 282B; or

  (b) income derived from assets that, when the income is derived, are

segregated non-current pension assets of the fund;

the proportion (if any) calculated under subsection (2) is exempt from tax.

  &quot;(2) The proportion is calculated using the formula:

                    Unsegregated current pension liabilities

                    ----------------------------------------

                    Unsegregated superannuation liabilities

where:

  Unsegregated current pension liabilities is the average value during the

year of income of the current pension liabilities of the fund, other than

liabilities in respect of which any segregated current pension assets are

held;

  Unsegregated superannuation liabilities is the average value during the year

of income of the superannuation liabilities of the fund, other than

liabilities in respect of which any segregated current pension assets or

segregated non-current pension assets are held.

  &quot;(3) Subject to subsection (4), for the purposes of subsection (2) the value

at a particular time in the year of income of the fund's liabilities of a

particular kind is the amount that, in accordance with an actuary's

certificate in the approved form that accompanies the fund's return of income

of the year of income, together with any future contributions in respect of

the superannuation benefits concerned, if accumulated after the particular

time at the rate of the fund's earnings on assets (other than segregated

current pension assets or segregated non-current pension assets) during the

preceding year of income, would provide the amount required to discharge in

full the liabilities as they fall due.

  &quot;(4) Where:

  (a) the fund has neither segregated current pension assets nor segregated

non-current pension assets at any time during the year of income; and

  (b) an actuary's certificate in respect of the value at the particular time

of the fund's superannuation liabilities referred to in the definition of

Unsegregated superannuation liabilities in subsection (2) does not accompany

the fund's return;

the value of those liabilities at the particular time is an amount calculated

using the formula:

             Last value of liabilities

             ------------------------- x Current value of assets

               Last value of assets

where:

  Last value of liabilities is the most recent value of the liabilities before

the particular time, as shown in an actuary's certificate in the approved form

accompanying the fund's return;

  Last value of assets is the value, at the time of that most recent valuation

of the liabilities, of all of the assets of the fund, as shown in an actuary's

certificate in the approved form accompanying the fund's return;

  Current value of assets is the value of all of the assets of the fund at the

particular time, as shown in an actuary's certificate in the approved form

accompanying the fund's return.&quot;.

Fixed interest complying ADFs - exemption of income attributable to certain 25

May 1988 deposits

  &quot;290A (1) For each amount that, apart from this section, would be

normal assessable income of a continuously complying fixed interest ADF

of a year of income, the proportion (if any) calculated under subsection (2)

is exempt from tax.

                              Aggregate current balance

where:

  'continuously complying fixed interest ADF', in relation to a year of

income (in this definition called the 'current year of income'), means

a fund that is a fixed interest complying ADF in relation to each of

the following years of income:

  (a) the current year of income;

  (b) the year of income in which 1 July 1988 occurred;

reckoning time, is the balance as at that time determined by varying

the original 25 May balance, in accordance with the following rules,

by the depositor before 1 July 1989 is to be added to the

balance;

inserted:

     &quot;Division 10 - Tax Treatment of Gains or Losses on Disposal of Assets

        Owned by Complying Superannuation Funds, Complying ADFs and PSTs

Division applies to trustees of complying superannuation funds, complying ADFs

and PSTs

  &quot;302\. This Division applies to a taxpayer in relation to a year of income if

the taxpayer is the trustee of:

  (a) a complying superannuation fund;

  (b) a complying ADF; or

  (c) a PST.

Interpretation

&quot;303\. (1) In this Division, unless the contrary intention appears:

  'security' means:

    (a) debenture stock, a bond, debenture, certificate of entitlement,

bill of exchange, promissory note or other security;

    (b) a deposit with a bank, building society or other financial

institution;

    (c) a secured or unsecured loan; or

    (d) any other contract, whether or not in writing, under which

a person is liable to pay an amount or amounts, whether or

not the liability is secured;

  '30 June 1988 asset', in relation to a taxpayer, means an asset owned by

the taxpayer at the end of 30 June 1988.

  &quot;(2) For the purposes of the application of this Division to a taxpayer

in relation to a year of income, a reference in this Division to the

taxpayer,

in relation to a time before the beginning of the year of income, includes a

reference to the taxpayer concerned even if the fund or unit trust was not

a complying superannuation fund, a complying ADF or a PST, as the case

may be, in relation to the year of income in which that time occurred.

  &quot;(3) An expression used in this Division and in Part IIIA has the same

meaning in this Division as it has in that Part.

Part IIIA to be primary code for taxation of gains and losses

  &quot;304\. Where Part IIIA applies or would, apart from section 160ZZF and

Divisions 5A, 7A and 17 of that Part, apply, in respect of the disposal of an

asset that, immediately before the disposal, was owned by a taxpayer:

  (a) an amount shall not be included in the assessable income of the

taxpayer under section 25 in respect of the disposal unless:

    (i) the asset is a security; or

    (ii) the amount is a gain attributable to currency exchange rate

fluctuations;

  (b) sections 25A and 52 do not apply in respect of the disposal of the

asset; and

  (c) an amount shall not be allowed as a deduction under section 51 to

the taxpayer in respect of the disposal unless:

    (i) the asset is a security; or

    (ii) the amount is a loss attributable to currency exchange rate

fluctuations.

Division to be treated as a provision of Part IIIA

  &quot;305\. For the purposes of the application of Part IIIA to a taxpayer,

where the expression 'provision of this Part' or 'provisions of this Part' is

used in that Part, the expression shall be taken to include a reference to

any of the provisions of this Division.

30 June 1988 assets deemed to have been acquired on that date

  &quot;306\. (1) Subject to this section, a 30 June 1988 asset of a taxpayer

shall be taken, for the purposes of Part IIIA, to have been acquired by the

taxpayer on 30 June 1988.

  &quot;(2) Where a provision of Part IIIA provides that, if a disposal of an

asset occurs within 12 months after the day (in this subsection called the

'acquisition day') on which the asset was acquired by a taxpayer, a reference

in another provision of that Part to the indexed cost base to the taxpayer

in respect of the asset shall be construed as a reference to the cost base to

the taxpayer in respect of the asset, subsection (1) of this section does not

apply for the purposes of determining the acquisition day for the purposes

of the first-mentioned provision.

  &quot;(3) Subsection (1) does not apply for the purposes of determining the

cost base to a taxpayer of an asset.

Disposal of taxable Australian assets

  &quot;307\. Section 160T applies in relation to a taxpayer as if a reference

      (B) if the cost base to the taxpayer of the asset as at 30

June 1988 is greater than that market value - that

cost base; or

the cost base to the taxpayer of the asset as at 30

June 1988 - that cost base; and

  (b) to have paid or given that consideration on 30 June 1988.

  &quot;(2) In determining the cost base, indexed cost base or reduced cost

base to the taxpayer of an asset, no account shall be taken of any liability

that arose before 1 July 1988 or any costs or expenditure that were incurred

    (i) a life assurance company; or

  (b) any part of the taxpayer's 1 July 1988 year occurred before 1 July

1988;

the following provisions have effect:

  (d) a reference in the definition of &quot;notional Part IIIA disposal&quot; in

by the taxpayer does not include a reference to a disposal of an asset that

took place before 1 July 1988;

  (e) where a particular amount (in this paragraph called the &quot;deductible

amount&quot;):

    (i) is allowable, or would be allowable but for paragraph (c),

as a deduction in calculating the taxable income of the taxpayer of the 1 July

1988 year; and

    (ii) if the LAC/RO amendments had not been made, would not

have been allowable as a deduction to the taxpayer in respect of the 1 July

1988 year;

is allowable as a deduction in calculating the taxable income of the taxpayer

of the 1 July 1988 year;

  (f) where a particular amount (in this paragraph called the &quot;deductible

amount&quot;):

    (i) is allowable, or would be allowable but for paragraph (c),

definitions of &quot;current year deduction&quot; and &quot;prior year loss deduction&quot; in

  (g) for the purposes of this section and the Income Tax Rates Act 1986, the

pre-1 July 1988 component of taxable income of the taxpayer's 1 July 1988 year

is the amount (if any) that is left over after the assessable income derived

by the taxpayer in that year and before 1 July 1988 has been reduced by the

pre-1 July 1988 deductions;

  (h) the taxable income of the taxpayer's 1 July 1988 year is the sum of:

    (i) the pre-1 July 1988 component; and

    (ii) the components ascertained under section 116CJ or 116HE

of the amended Act for that year;

  (j) if a net capital loss would have been incurred by a taxpayer under Part

IIIA of the amended Act in respect of the taxpayer's 1 July 1988 year if that

year had ended on 30 June 1988, the amount of that net capital loss shall be

applied by the Commissioner in reduction of the overall 160Z gain (within the

meaning of Division 8 or 8A of Part III of the amended Act) for a particular

class or classes of assessable income of the taxpayer by such amount, or by

such amounts and in such proportions, as the Commissioner considers

reasonable.

  (3) In determining, for the purposes of subsection (2), whether income was

derived by a taxpayer before 1 July 1988, income that:

  (a) is included in the assessable income of the taxpayer under subsection 92

(1) or Division 6 of Part III of the amended Act; or

  (b) is derived by the taxpayer during, but not at a particular time during,

a year of income;

shall be taken to have been derived by the taxpayer at such time, or at such

times and in such proportions, as the Commissioner considers reasonable having

regard to:

  (c) where paragraph (a) applies in respect of a partnership or a trust

estate - the time, or the times, when income was derived by the partnership or

by the trustee of the trust estate, as the case may be; and

  (d) in any case - any relevant matters.

  (4) In determining, for the purposes of subsection (2), the income derived

by a taxpayer before 1 July 1988 under Part IIIA of the amended Act, a

disposal of an asset on or after that date shall be disregarded.

  (5) In the case of a life assurance company, sections 57AH and 57AL of the

Principal Act (as those sections continue to apply in spite of their repeal by

the Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No. 4) 1988) do not apply to a unit of

property that:

  (a) is first used, or installed ready for use and held in reserve, by the

company before 1 July 1988; and

  (b) is first used for the purpose of producing assessable income, or is

first installed ready for use for that purpose and held in reserve, by the

company on or after 1 July 1988.

  (6) In the case of a life assurance company or registered organization whose

1 July 1988 year commenced on 1 July 1988, any net capital loss incurred by

the company or organization under Part IIIA of the Principal Act in respect of

the preceding year of income shall be taken to be a prior year Part IIIA loss

in relation to that preceding year for the purposes of Division 8 or 8A, as

the case requires, of Part III of the amended Act.
