                     (c)  at the time of the withdrawal, or within 3 months after the end of the year of income in which the withdrawal is made, an exceptional circumstances certificate (within the meaning of subsection 8A(2) of the _Farm Household Support Act 1992_) is issued in respect of that owner.

             (4)  Any subsequent deposit that is made by, or on behalf of, that owner in the year of income in which the withdrawal referred to in subsection (3) is made is not, and is taken never to have been, a **_farm management deposit_**.

Withdrawal in the case of death, bankruptcy or loss of primary producer status

Transfers to other financial institutions

             (6)  A transfer of a deposit to another financial institution, in accordance with a requirement of the agreement concerned, as mentioned in subsection 393-40(5) is not a withdrawal to which subsections (1) and (2) apply.
