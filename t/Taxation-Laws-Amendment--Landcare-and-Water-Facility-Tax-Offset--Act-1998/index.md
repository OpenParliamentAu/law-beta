65-10  What this Division is about

 This Division sets out the rules about carrying forward excess tax offsets to later years of income.
 You can only carry forward certain tax offsets.
 Before you can apply a tax offset to reduce the amount of income tax that you will pay in a later year, you must apply it to reduce certain amounts of net exempt income.
 The same rules that prevent companies from using certain losses that are carried forward prevent companies from applying tax offsets that they have carried forward.

		The amount of the <sup>*</sup>tax offset that is carried forward is the

amount of the excess worked out under subsection 65-25(1). However, if you have

a taxable income for the income year, reduce the tax offset by the following

amount:

65-35  How to apply carried forward tax offsets

 <dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>A <sup>*</sup>tax offset that you have carried forward decreases the

amount of income tax that you would otherwise have to pay under section 4-10 in

a later income year.</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>You must apply <sup>*</sup>tax offsets that are carried forward in the priority order, applying the lowest priority tax offset first, and you must apply tax offsets of a particular type in the order in which you became entitled to them.</dd> <dt>(3)</dt><dd>Before you apply a <sup>*</sup>tax offset to reduce the amount of income tax that you pay in a later income year in which you have a taxable income, you must apply it to reduce to nil any <sup>*</sup>exempt income for: </dd> </dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>that later income year; or</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>any income year after the year in which the tax offset arose and before

the later income year in which you had a taxable income but did not apply the

tax offset to reduce the amount of income tax you had to pay.

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

In reducing exempt income, each 34 cents of tax offset reduces the exempt income by $1.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note:	Paragraph (b) would apply to cases such as where your

taxable income was below your tax-free threshold or where you had other tax

offsets that reduced your income tax to nil.

 </dl></dl>

<dl compact="">

<dt>(4)</dt><dd>You can only apply a <sup>*</sup>tax offset that you have carried forward

to the extent that it has not already been applied.

</dd> </dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note:	Section 65-40 contains special restrictions on applying

carried forward tax offsets.

 </dl></dl>

65-40  When a company cannot apply a tax offset

 <dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>In working out its <sup>*</sup>tax offset for the <sup>*</sup>current

year, a company cannot apply a <sup>*</sup>tax offset it has carried forward

if, assuming:

</dd> </dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>the tax offset were a <sup>*</sup>tax loss of the company for the income

year in which it became entitled to the tax offset; and</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>section 165-20 (deducting part of a tax loss) were disregarded;

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

Subdivision 165-A would prevent the company from deducting it for the current year.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note:	Subdivision 165-A deals with the deductibility of a

company's tax loss for an earlier income year if there has been a change in the

ownership or control of the company in the loss year or the income year.

 </dl></dl>

<dl compact="">

<dt>(2)</dt><dd>If subsection (1) prevents the company from applying the <sup>*</sup>tax

offset, it can apply the _part_ of the tax offset that it is reasonable to

entitled to the tax offset, but only if, assuming that part of that income year

had been treated as the whole of it, the company would have been entitled to

apply the tax offset.
