Definitions

             (7)  In this section:

                    <a name="aggreg-research-develop-amount"></a>**_aggregate research and development amount_** has the same meaning as in section 73B.

                    <a name="elig-compani"></a>**_eligible company_** has the same meaning as in section 73B.

                    <a name="notion-division-42-duction"></a>**_notional Division 42 deduction_** has the meaning given by section 73BJ.

                    <a name="section-73bh-plant"></a>**_section 73BH plant_** has the meaning given by section 73BI.

##### <a id="73BI"></a>73BI  Meaning of _section 73BH plant_

             (1)  A unit of **_section 73BH plant_** of an eligible company is a thing for which the eligible company could (ignoring section 73BH) deduct an amount under section 42-15 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ if the following assumptions were made:

                     (b)  the definition of **_plant_** in section 42-18 of that Act included capital works (other than buildings) to which Division 43 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies, or to which that Division would apply but for expenditure being incurred, or capital works being started, before a particular day;

                     (c)  the eligible company satisfied any relevant requirement for deductibility under that Division.

             (2)  However, subsection (1) does not apply to a thing:

                     (b)  that the company commenced to construct at or before 12 pm, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 29 January 2001.

             (3)  In this section:

##### <a id="73BJ"></a>73BJ  Meaning of _notional Division 42 deduction_

Notional Division 42 deduction

             (1)  An eligible company has a **_notional Division 42 deduction_** for a year of income for a unit of section 73BH plant if it would be entitled to a deduction for the plant under section 42-15 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ for the year of income assuming the changes set out in this section were made.

First change: replacement of references to use or installation ready for use for purpose of producing assessable income

             (2)  The first change is that references in Division 42 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ to using the unit, or having it installed ready for use, for the purpose of producing assessable income are instead references to using the unit for the purpose of the carrying on by or on behalf of the eligible company of research and development activities.

Second change: method for calculating deduction where previous Division 42 deduction

             (3)  The second change is that, if the eligible company was actually entitled to a deduction under Division 42 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ for the unit of section 73BH plant for any period before the start of the first period for which the company will be entitled to a deduction for the plant under this subsection, the same method for calculating the deduction as the company was using for the unit for the earlier period is used.

Third change: treatment of expenditure to which section 73BK or 73BL applies

             (4)  The third change is that, in working out the cost of the unit of section 73BH plant, any amount of expenditure (**_section 73BH plant expenditure_**) that would otherwise form part of that cost is to be ignored or treated in some other way if section 73BK or 73BL so provides for the purposes of this section.

Fourth change: certain provisions to be ignored

             (5)  The fourth change is that Division 42 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies as if section 73BH of this Act and Subdivisions 42-L and 42-M of that Act had not been enacted.

Definition

             (6)  In this section:

                    <a name="section-73bh-plant"></a>**_section 73BH plant_** has the meaning given by section 73BI.

##### <a id="73BK"></a>73BK  Treatment of certain expenditure for the purposes of section 73BJ etc.

Requirement for registration under Industry Research and Development Act

             (1)  Section 73BH plant expenditure incurred by an eligible company in a year of income in relation to research and development activities is ignored for the purposes of section 73BJ unless:

                     (a)  the company is registered, in relation to the year of income and in relation to those activities, under section 39J of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_; or

                     (b)  the company is registered, in relation to the year of income and in relation to a project comprising or including those activities, under section 39P of that Act.

Non-arm’s length expenditure

                     (a)  an eligible company has incurred an amount of section 73BH plant expenditure; and

                     (b)  the Commissioner is satisfied that:

                              (i)  having regard to any connection between the company and the person to whom the expenditure was incurred and to any other relevant circumstances, the company and that other person were not dealing with each other at arm’s length in relation to the incurring of that expenditure; and

                             (ii)  the amount of that expenditure would have been less if the company and that other person had dealt with each other at arm’s length in relation to the incurring of that expenditure;

so much only of that expenditure is to be taken into account for the purposes of section 73BJ as the Commissioner considers reasonable having regard to:

                     (c)  the connection between the company and that other person; and

                     (d)  the amount of the expenditure that would, in the opinion of the Commissioner, have been incurred by the company if the company and that other person had dealt with each other at arm’s length in relation to the incurring of that expenditure; and

                     (e)  such other matters as the Commissioner considers relevant.

Effect of certificate under section 39M or 39MA of Industry Research and Development Act

                     (b)  if section 73EB of that Act applied to the disposal to you of the plant—any further amounts the transferor, and any earlier successive transferor, could have deducted for the plant under section 73BH of that Act for any period assuming that person was its owner or <sup>* </sup>quasi-owner and used it wholly for the purpose of the carrying on by or on behalf of that person of research and development activities.

Third change

             (5)  The third change is that the reference in section 42-195 to the extent to which you used the plant other than for the purpose of producing assessable income is instead a reference to the extent to which you used the plant other than for that purpose or the purpose of the carrying on by or on behalf of you of research and development activities.

##### <a id="73BA"></a>73BA  Deduction for certain assets etc. used for the purpose of carrying on research and development activities

Object

             (1)  The object of this section is to provide a tax incentive, in the form of a deduction, to make eligible companies more internationally competitive by:

                     (a)  encouraging the development by eligible companies of innovative products, processes and services; and

                     (b)  increasing investment by eligible companies in defined research and development activities; and

                     (c)  promoting the technological advancement of eligible companies through a focus on innovation and high technical risk in defined research and development activities; and

                     (d)  encouraging the use by eligible companies of strategic research and development planning; and

                     (e)  creating an environment that is conducive to increased commercialisation of new processes and product technologies developed by eligible companies.

The benefits of the tax incentive are targeted by being limited to particular expenditure on certain defined activities.

Entitlement to deduction

             (2)  If an eligible company has a notional Division 40 deduction for a section 73BA depreciating asset for a year of income, the company is entitled to a deduction under this section for the asset for the year of income.

Amount of deduction

             (3)  If the eligible company’s aggregate research and development amount for the year of income is more than $20,000, the deduction is equal to the notional Division 40 deduction multiplied by 1.25\. If not, it equals the notional Division 40 deduction.

No deduction if earlier STS or Division 40 low-value pool deductions allowable

             (4)  An eligible company is not entitled to a deduction under this section for a section 73BA depreciating asset for any period if the company was entitled to:

                     (a)  a deduction for the asset for any earlier period under Subdivision 328-D (about STS taxpayers) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; or

                     (b)  a deduction for the asset for any earlier period under Division 40 of that Act, in a case to which section 40-440 (about low-value pools) of that Act applied.

Expenditure deductible etc. under this section not deductible under other provisions

             (7)  If the whole or a part of an amount of expenditure incurred by an eligible company:

                     (a)  has been allowed or is or may become allowable as a deduction under this section; or

                     (b)  would have been so allowed or become so allowable if the company had not chosen a tax offset under section 73I;

that whole or part is not an allowable deduction, and is not to be taken into account in working out the amount of an allowable deduction, from the assessable income of the company of any year of income under any other provision of this Act.

##### <a id="73BB"></a>73BB  Meaning of _section 73BA depreciating asset_

             (1)  A **_section 73BA depreciating asset_** of an eligible company is an asset for which the eligible company could (ignoring section 73BA) deduct an amount under section 40-25 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ if the following assumptions were made:

                     (b)  contrary to paragraph 40-30(1)(c) and subsection 40-30(2) of that Act, all intangible assets were excluded from the definition of **_depreciating asset_** in section 40-30 of that Act;

                     (c)  subsection 40-45(2) of that Act did not, except in the case of buildings, prevent that Division from applying to capital works to which Division 43 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies, or to which that Division would apply but for expenditure being incurred, or capital works being started, before a particular day;

                     (d)  the eligible company satisfied any relevant requirement for deductibility under that Division.

             (2)  In this section:

                    <a name="elig-compani"></a>**_eligible company_** has the same meaning as in section 73B.

##### <a id="73BC"></a>73BC  Meaning of _notional Division 40 deduction_

             (1)  An eligible company has a **_notional Division 40 deduction_** for a section 73BA depreciating asset for a year of income if it would be entitled to a deduction under section 40-25  of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ for the asset for the year of income assuming the changes set out in this section were made.

First change: replacement of references to use or installation ready for use for purpose of producing assessable income or for taxable purpose

             (2)  The first change is that references in Division 40 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (other than for the purposes of sections 40-100, 40-105 and 40-110) to using the asset, or having it installed ready for use:

                     (a)  for the purpose of producing assessable income; or

                     (b)  for a taxable purpose;

are instead references to using the asset for the purpose of the carrying on by or on behalf of the eligible company of research and development activities.

Note:          Section 73BG modifies sections 40-100, 40-105 and 40-110 (about effective life) so that a reference to the research and development purpose is added to the existing references, rather than replacing them.

Second change: method for working out decline in value where previous Division 40 deduction

             (3)  The second change is that, if the eligible company was actually entitled to a deduction under Division 40 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ for the section 73BA depreciating asset for any period before the start of the first period for which the company will be entitled to a deduction for the asset under this subsection, the same method for working out the decline in value as the company was using for the asset for the earlier period is used.

Third change: treatment of expenditure to which section 73BD or 73BE applies

             (4)  The third change is that, in working out the cost of the section 73BA depreciating asset, any amount of expenditure (**_section 73BA depreciating asset expenditure_**) that would otherwise form part of that cost is to be ignored or treated in some other way if section 73BD or 73BE so provides for the purposes of this section.

Fourth change: certain provisions to be ignored

             (5)  The fourth change is that Division 40 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies as if section 73BA of this Act, and section 40-425 and Subdivision 328-D of that Act, had not been enacted.

             (6)  In this section:

                    <a name="elig-compani"></a>**_eligible company_** has the same meaning as in section 73B.

                             (ii)  the amount of that expenditure would have been less if the company and that other person had dealt with each other at arm’s length in relation to the incurring of that expenditure;

                     (c)  the connection between the company and that other person; and

                     (d)  the amount of the expenditure that would, in the opinion of the Commissioner, have been incurred by the company if the company and that other person had dealt with each other at arm’s length in relation to the incurring of that expenditure; and

                     (e)  such other matters as the Commissioner considers relevant.

Effect of certificate under section 39M or 39MA of Industry Research and Development Act

             (3)  Subject to subsection (8), if the Board gives to the Commissioner a certificate under section 39M or 39MA of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_ in respect of particular activities in respect of which section 73BA depreciating asset expenditure has been incurred by an eligible company, the expenditure is ignored for the purposes of section 73BC.

Roll-over relief where CGT roll-over relief allowed

             (1)  This section applies to the disposal of a section 73BA depreciating asset by an eligible company (the **_transferor_**) to another eligible company (the **_transferee_**) if:

                     (a)  the disposal involves a CGT event for which there is a roll-over under Subdivision 126-B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (or would be, disregarding the exemption in section 118-5 of that Act, so far as it relates to a car, motor cycle or similar vehicle, or to an interest in one); and

                             (ii)  Division 42 (depreciation of plant) of that Act as in force before its repeal by the _New Business Tax System (Capital Allowances) Act 2001_.

No balancing charges for transferor

             (2)  Section 73BF does not apply in respect of the disposal of the asset by the transferor.

Effect on transferee

             (3)  The transferee is entitled to a deduction under section 73BA worked out using the same effective life and method for working out decline in value as the transferor was using in respect of the asset under that section.

Additional consequences

             (4)  For the purposes of Division 45 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_:

                     (a)  if the transferor, or a partnership of which the transferor was a member, leased the asset to another entity for most of the time when the transferor or partnership held the asset—the transferee is taken also to have done so; and

                     (b)  if the transferor, or a partnership of which the transferor was a member, leased the asset to another entity—the transferee is taken also to have done so; and

                     (c)  if the main business of the transferor, or a partnership of which the transferor was a member, was to lease assets of that kind—the main business of the transferee is taken also to have been to lease assets of that kind.

Subsequent applications of roll-over relief—relief available even if no deduction for subsequent transferor

             (5)  If, apart from this subsection, this section has applied to the disposal of the section 73BA depreciating asset to the transferee, then, in working out whether it applies to a subsequent disposal of the asset by:

                     (b)  one or more subsequent successive transferees;

this section has effect as if paragraph (1)(c) (which deals with deductions) were ignored.

Notice to allow transferee to work out how this section applies

             (6)  The transferor must give the transferee a notice containing enough information about the transferor’s holding of the asset for the transferee to work out how this section applies to the transferee’s holding of it.

             (7)  The transferor must give the notice within 6 months after the end of the transferee’s year of income in which the disposal mentioned in subsection (1) occurred, or within a longer period allowed by the Commissioner.

             (8)  The transferee must keep the notice until the end of 5 years after the earlier of these events:

                     (a)  the transferee disposes of the asset;

                     (b)  the asset is lost or destroyed.

Section 40-290 to be applied as if use for carrying on research and development activities were use for a taxable purpose

             (2)  If this section applies, you must, in applying section 40-290 (including references in that section to the reduction of deductions under section 40-25) in relation to the <sup>* </sup>depreciating asset, assume that when you used it either for a taxable purpose or for the purpose of the carrying on by or on behalf of you of research and development activities, within the meaning of section 73B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, you used it for a taxable purpose.

##### <a id="73R"></a>73R  Group members

             (1)  This section sets out rules for determining whether an eligible company that has deducted or can deduct an amount under subsection 73B(13) or (14) is a **_group member_** in relation to another company that has deducted or can deduct such an amount. In applying this section, use section 73L to determine whether companies are grouped.

             (2)  Work out the **_group members_** of the eligible company and their **_group membership periods_** in this way:

<div style="BORDER-RIGHT: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-RIGHT: 5pt; BORDER-TOP: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-LEFT: 5pt; PADDING-BOTTOM: 5pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 2cm; BORDER-LEFT: windowtext 1pt solid; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0cm; PADDING-TOP: 5pt; BORDER-BOTTOM: windowtext 1pt solid">

_Method statement_

_Step 1._   Work out, as at the last day of the Y<sub>0</sub> year of income, which companies are grouped with the eligible company. The eligible company and these grouped companies are the **_primary group members_**.

_Step 2._   Work out the day before the last day of the Y<sub>0</sub> year of income, or the first day of the Y<sub>-3</sub> year of income, whichever is the later, when a company that is a primary group member:

               (a)     was controlled, as mentioned in section 73L, by a person other than a person who controlled it as at the last day of the Y<sub>0</sub> year of income; or

               (b)     acted, or could be expected to act, in accordance with the directions or wishes of a person other than a person in accordance with whose directions or wishes it acted, or could be expected to act, as at the last day of the Y<sub>0</sub> year of income.

              The period between this day and the last day of the Y<sub>0</sub> year of income is that company’s **_group membership period_**.

_Step 3._   Any other company that was grouped with a primary group member at a time during the member’s group membership period is a **_secondary group member_**.

_Step 4._   Work out the day before the last day of the Y<sub>0</sub> year of income when a secondary group member became grouped with the primary group member as mentioned in step 3, or the first day of the Y<sub>-3</sub> year of income, whichever is the later.

_Step 5._   Work out the day before the last day of the Y<sub>0</sub> year of income when the secondary group member was not so grouped with the primary group member. The period between that day and the day worked out under step 4 is the secondary group member’s **_group membership period_**.</div>

Exception: secondary member leaving with a viable business

             (3)  The period that would be a secondary group member’s group membership period is treated as never having existed if, at the end of that period when the secondary group member stops being grouped with a primary group member, the secondary group member has a viable business.

Exception: extending group membership period

             (4)  The group membership period of a group member of a particular group (the **_current group_**) is extended to include its history period with its former group (see subsection (5)) if, when the company became a group member of the current group, it did so with a viable business.

Viable business

             (5)  A company stops being or starts being a group member of a group with a **_viable business_** if:

                     (a)  sufficient assets (including assets that have been used in carrying on research and development activities) are transferred under the transactions involved in the change of control to allow the continued operation of a business; and

                     (b)  the person or persons that disposed of control of the company agree in writing with the person or persons that gain control that this subsection should apply; and

                     (c)  the person or persons that disposed of control of the company provide written details of incremental expenditure incurred by the company during the period (its **_history period_**) it was a group member of its former group.

Note:          The definition of **_person_** includes trusts, partnerships and other entities as well as companies: see section 73H.
