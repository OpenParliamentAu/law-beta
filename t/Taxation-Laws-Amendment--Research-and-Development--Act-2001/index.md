_First change: replacement of references to use or installation ready for use for purpose of producing assessable income or for taxable purpose_

73R  Group members

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>This section sets out rules for determining whether an eligible company

that has deducted or can deduct an amount under subsection 73B(13) or (14) is a

_group member_ in relation to another company that has deducted or

can deduct such an amount. In applying this section, use section&#160;73L to

determine whether companies are grouped.</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>Work out the _group members_ of the eligible company and their _group membership periods_ in this way: </dd> </dl></dl>

<center>Back to Top</center>

_Method statement_

_Step 1._	Work out, as at the last day of the Y<sub>0</sub> year of income, which companies are grouped with the eligible company. The eligible company and these grouped companies are the _primary group members_.
 _Step 2._	Work out the day before the last day of the Y<sub>0</sub> year of income, or the first day of the Y<sub>-3</sub> year of income, whichever is the later, when a company that is a primary group member:

	(a)	was controlled, as mentioned in section&#160;73L, by a person other than a person who controlled it as at the last day of the Y<sub>0</sub> year of income; or
 	(b)	acted, or could be expected to act, in accordance with the directions or wishes of a person other than a person in accordance with whose directions or wishes it acted, or could be expected to act, as at the last day of the Y<sub>0</sub> year of income.

	The period between this day and the last day of the Y<sub>0</sub> year of income is that company's _group membership period_.
 _Step 3._	Any other company that was grouped with a primary group member at a time during the member's group membership period is a _secondary group member_.
 _Step 4._	Work out the day before the last day of the Y<sub>0</sub> year of income when a secondary group member became grouped with the primary group member as mentioned in step 3, or the first day of the Y<sub>-3</sub> year of income, whichever is the later.
 _Step 5._	Work out the day before the last day of the Y<sub>0</sub> year of income when the secondary group member was not so grouped with the primary group member. The period between that day and the day worked out under step 4 is the secondary group member's _group membership period_.

_Exception: secondary member leaving with a viable business_

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(3)</dt><dd>The period that would be a secondary group member's group membership

period is treated as never having existed if, at the end of that period when

the secondary group member stops being grouped with a primary group member, the

secondary group member has a viable business.

</dd> </dl></dl>

_Exception: extending group membership period_

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(4)</dt><dd>The group membership period of a group member of a particular group (the

_current group_) is extended to include its history period with its

former group (see subsection&#160;(5)) if, when the company became a group

member of the current group, it did so with a viable business.

</dd> </dl></dl>

_Viable business_

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(5)</dt><dd>A company stops being or starts being a group member of a group with a
