##### <a id="2-5"></a>2-5  Object

                   The object of this Act is to ensure that * tax agent services are provided to the public in accordance with appropriate standards of professional and ethical conduct. This is to be achieved by (among other things):

                     (c)  providing for sanctions to discipline registered tax agents and BAS agents.

#### Subdivision 2-B—Guide

**Table of sections**

##### <a id="2-10"></a>2-10  General guide to each Part

             (6)  Part 7 contains miscellaneous provisions, mainly administrative and machinery provisions relating to the operation of this Act.

             (7)  Part 8 contains the Dictionary, which sets out a list of most of the terms that are defined in this Act. It also sets out the meanings of some important concepts and rules on how to interpret this Act.

### Division 3—Explanation of the use of defined terms

**Table of sections**

3-5            When defined terms are identified

3-10          When defined terms are not identified

##### <a id="3-5"></a>3-5  When defined terms are identified

             (1)  Many of the terms used in this Act are defined in the Dictionary, starting at section 995-1, to the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_. However, some terms used in this Act are only defined in this Act.

Note:          Expressions in the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (other than the expression “this Act”) have the same meaning in this Act as well, see subsection 90-1(2).

             (2)  Most defined terms in this Act and the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ are identified by an asterisk at the start of the term: as in “* BAS service”.

##### <a id="3-10"></a>3-10  When defined terms are _not_ identified

             (1)  Once a defined term has been identified by an asterisk, later occurrences of the term in the same subsection are not usually asterisked.

             (2)  Terms are not asterisked in the * Guides, headings or notes contained in this Act.

             (3)  The term “Board” is not identified with an asterisk.

             (4)  If a term used in the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ is used in this Act and the term is _not_ identified with an asterisk in that Act, the term is _not_ identified with an asterisk in this Act.

Note:          For expressions in the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ that are _not_ identified with an asterisk, see subsection 2-15(3) of that Act.
