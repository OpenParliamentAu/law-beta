Liability to franking deficit tax

  &quot;160AQJ. Where a company has a franking deficit at the end of a franking

year, the company is liable to pay tax equal to the amount calculated in

accordance with the formula:

                                      ( ---- )

                                      ( 1-CR )

where:

  CR is the applicable general company tax rate; and

  FD is the amount of the franking deficit.

          &quot;Subdivision C - Franking Deficit Tax to Offset Company Tax

Entitlement to offset

  &quot;160AQK. (1) Subject to this Subdivision, where:

  (a) a company has become liable to pay franking deficit tax for a franking

year; and

  (b) after the end of the franking year:

    (i) the Commissioner serves on the company a notice of an

original company tax assessment for an eligible year of income in which the

company was sufficiently resident; or

    (ii) the Commissioner serves on the company a notice of an

amended company tax assessment for an eligible year of income in which the

company was sufficiently resident, being an amendment that increases the

company tax of the company;

the Commissioner shall determine that the company is entitled to an offset in

relation to that company tax or increased company tax equal to the amount

specified in the determination, being the lesser of the following amounts:

  (c) the amount of the franking deficit tax, reduced by any part of it that

has been previously applied under this Subdivision;

  (d) the amount of the company tax, or increased company tax, reduced by any

foreign tax credits allowable in respect of tax paid or payable by the company

in respect of income derived in the eligible year of income.

  &quot;(2) Where a company becomes entitled to an offset in relation to company

tax or increased company tax, the company's liability to pay that company tax,

or increased company tax, shall be reduced by the amount of the offset.

Amendment of determination

  &quot;160AQL. (1) The Commissioner may at any time amend an offset determination

in such manner as the Commissioner thinks necessary.

  &quot;(2) For the purposes of this Act, an amended determination shall be treated

like a determination.

Notice of determination

  &quot;160AQM. (1) The Commissioner shall serve notice in writing of an offset

determination on the company to which it relates.

  &quot;(2) The notice may be included in a notice of assessment.

Determination not part of assessment

Commissioner purporting to be a copy of an offset determination;

is conclusive evidence of:

  (c) the due making of the determination; and

  (d) except in proceedings on appeal against the determination, that the

determination is correct.

Reviews and appeals

  &quot;160AQQ. (1) Division 2 of Part V applies, with appropriate changes, in

relation to offset determinations.

  &quot;(2) The fact that an appeal or reference in respect of an offset

determination is pending does not prevent recovery of any amount that may be

affected by the determination.

Recovery of excess offsets

  &quot;160AQR. Where, because of an amendment of an offset determination, the

amount, or the sum of the amounts, applied by the Commissioner as an offset to

which a company is entitled exceeds the amount of the offset to which the

company is entitled, the Commissioner may recover the amount of the excess as

if it were company tax due and payable by the company.

Refunds of amounts overpaid

  &quot;160AQS. Section 172 applies for the purposes of this Subdivision as if a

reference in that section to an assessment included a reference to an offset

determination.

to the shareholder:

double the amount of the excess.
