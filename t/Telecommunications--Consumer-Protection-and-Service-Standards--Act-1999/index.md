                     (a)  whether a carriage service for the purpose proposed to be declared by the regulations can be supplied using the same infrastructure as is, at that time, being used by universal service providers to supply a standard telephone service for the purpose referred to in paragraph (1)(a);

                     (b)  such other matters (if any) as the Minister considers relevant.

             (5)  This section does not prevent a characteristic declared by regulations made for the purposes of paragraph (1)(e), (f) or (g) from being a performance characteristic.

                     (b)  includes the relevant commencement date or dates.

##### <a id="21C"></a>21C  Levy distribution

             (1)  If a person has a levy credit balance for a claim period because of section 20T, an amount equal to the amount of that balance is payable to the person by the Commonwealth. The Universal Service Account is debited accordingly.

             (3)  If the total of the amounts payable to persons under subsection (1) is more than the balance of the Universal Service Account, after paying any refunds that are due under section 20ZE, the ACMA must:

                     (a)  work out the amount payable to each person as a proportion of the total amounts payable; and

                     (b)  ensure that any payments by the Commonwealth in respect of amounts standing to the credit of the Universal Service Account are made in accordance with those proportions (rounding amounts to whole dollars as the ACMA considers appropriate).

             (4)  However, if the Minister determines in writing a different method for making payments by the Commonwealth in respect of amounts standing to the credit of the Universal Service Account than the method provided in subsection (3), the ACMA must act in accordance with that determination.

             (6)  A person’s levy credit balance for the claim period is reduced by the amount (worked out under this section) that is paid to the person.

             (7)  This section continues to apply until each person’s levy credit balance for the period is reduced to nil.

             (1)  The ACMA may distribute to persons who are or were participating persons any balance standing to the credit of the Universal Service Account that remains after all payments payable by the Commonwealth in respect of debits from the Account for a claim period have been paid.

             (2)  The Minister may determine in writing rules for making those distributions. The ACMA must comply with those rules.

             (3)  A determination under subsection (2) is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

##### <a id="21E"></a>21E  Recovery of overpayments

             (1)  For the purposes of this section, an **_overpaid amount_** is so much of an amount paid under section 21C as represents an overpayment.

             (2)  An overpaid amount is a debt due to the Commonwealth.

             (3)  An overpaid amount may be recovered by the Commonwealth by action in a court of competent jurisdiction.

             (4)  If a person is liable to pay an overpaid amount, the overpaid amount may be deducted from one or more other amounts that are payable to the person under this Part, and if it is so deducted, the other amounts are taken to have been paid in full to the person.

##### <a id="135"></a>135  Scope of Part

             (1)  This Part applies to a carriage service provider if the provider supplies, or proposes to supply, a standard telephone service to residential customers.

             (2)  A carriage service provider is exempt from this Part if the provider was a carrier (within the meaning of the _Telecommunications Act 1991_) immediately before 1 July 1997.

             (3)  The ACMA may, by notice in the _Gazette_, declare that a specified provider is exempt from this Part. The declaration has effect accordingly.

Note:          Providers may be specified by name, by inclusion in a particular class or in any other way.

             (4)  In deciding whether a person should be exempt from this Part, the ACMA must have regard to the following matters:

                     (a)  the duration of the prior period (if any) during which the person carried on business in Australia as a carriage service provider;

                     (b)  the scale of the person’s prior operations in Australia as a carriage service provider;

                     (c)  the person’s business record;

                     (d)  if the person is a partnership—the business record of each of the partners;

                     (e)  if the person is an incorporated company—the business record of each individual, by whatever name called and whether or not a director of the company, who is concerned, or takes part, in the management of the company.

             (5)  Subsection (4) does not, by implication, limit the matters to which the ACMA may have regard.

##### <a id="136"></a>136  Standard residential customer

             (1)  For the purposes of this Part, if a residential customer, or a proposed residential customer, of a carriage service provider is supplied, or proposed to be supplied, with a standard telephone service by the provider, then:

                     (a)  the customer is a **_standard residential customer_** of the provider; and

                     (b)  the service is a **_standard carriage service_**.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply to a standard telephone service if:

                     (a)  the service is a public mobile telecommunications service; and

                     (b)  the service is neither supplied, nor proposed to be supplied, to the customer in fulfilment of the universal service obligation.

##### <a id="137"></a>137  Protected payments

             (1)  The ACMA may make a written determination that a specified payment made, or liable to be made, to a carriage service provider by a standard residential customer of that provider is a **_protected payment_** for the purposes of this Part. The determination has effect accordingly.

Note:          Payments may be specified by name, by inclusion in a particular class or in any other way.

             (2)  The payment must be received, or proposed to be received, by the provider directly or indirectly in connection with its business as a carriage service provider.

             (3)  The following are examples of payments that may be specified in the determination:

                     (a)  payments for line rental;

                     (b)  payments for equipment rental;

                     (c)  payments by way of connection fees;

                     (d)  a pre‑payment for a standard carriage service.

             (4)  For each protected payment, the determination must specify, or specify a means of ascertaining, a period for the purposes of this subsection. That period is called the **_minimum service period_** for the payment.

             (5)  The minimum service period for a protected payment:

                     (a)  must begin when the payment is made; and

                     (b)  must not run for longer than 2 years.

             (6)  A determination under this section is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

##### <a id="138"></a>138  Compliance with protection schemes for protected payments

             (1)  Before demanding or receiving a protected payment, a carriage service provider must give the ACMA a written election to be bound by a specified scheme formulated under this Part.

             (2)  If a carriage service provider gives the ACMA such an election, the provider is bound by, and must comply with, the scheme specified in the election.

             (3)  If an election under this section is in force in relation to a particular scheme (the **_original scheme_**), the provider may give the ACMA a written notice varying the election by omitting the original scheme and substituting another scheme formulated under this Part. The variation takes effect at the time specified in the notice.

             (4)  Despite the variation, the original scheme continues to apply, in relation to protected payments made before the variation took effect, as if the variation had not been made.

##### <a id="139"></a>139  Protection schemes for protected payments—alternative supply of standard carriage services

             (1)  The ACMA may, by written instrument, formulate a scheme that requires a carriage service provider bound by the scheme to enter into and maintain a legally enforceable arrangement aimed at ensuring that, if:

                     (a)  a residential customer of the provider makes a protected payment to the provider; and

                     (b)  at any time during the minimum service period for that payment, the provider fails to supply standard carriage services to the customer;

the customer:

                     (c)  is supplied, during the remainder of the period, with standard carriage services that are equivalent to the standard carriage services that the provider has not supplied; and

                     (d)  is not required to pay more for the supply of those equivalent services than the customer would have had to pay had the provider supplied them.

             (2)  A scheme formulated under subsection (1) is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

##### <a id="140"></a>140  Protection schemes for protected payments—third party guarantee

             (1)  The ACMA may, by written instrument, formulate a scheme that:

                     (a)  makes a carriage service provider that is bound by the scheme liable, in the event that:

                              (i)  a residential customer of the provider makes a protected payment to the provider; and

                             (ii)  at any time during the minimum service period for that payment, the provider fails to supply standard carriage services to the customer;

                            to reimburse the payment on a pro‑rata basis in proportion to that part or parts of the period during which the provider fails to supply the services to the customer; and

                     (b)  requires the provider to obtain a guarantee from a third person in respect of the provider’s discharge of that liability.

             (2)  An instrument under subsection (1) is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

##### <a id="141"></a>141  Protection schemes for protected payments—insurance cover

             (1)  The ACMA may, by written instrument, formulate a scheme that:

                     (a)  makes a carriage service provider that is bound by the scheme liable, in the event that:

                              (i)  a residential customer of the provider makes a protected payment to the provider; and

                             (ii)  at any time during the minimum service period for that payment, the provider fails to supply standard carriage services to the customer;

                            to reimburse the payment on a pro‑rata basis in proportion to that part or parts of the period during which the provider fails to supply the services to the customer; and

                     (b)  requires the provider to take out and maintain an insurance policy to indemnify residential customers against a total or partial failure to discharge that liability.

             (2)  An instrument under subsection (1) is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

##### <a id="142"></a>142  Protection schemes for protected payments—holding of payments in trust accounts

             (1)  The ACMA may, by written instrument, formulate a scheme that:

                     (a)  makes a carriage service provider that is bound by the scheme liable, in the event that:

                              (i)  a residential customer of the provider makes a protected payment to the provider; and

                             (ii)  at any time during the minimum service period for that payment, the provider fails to supply standard carriage services to the customer;

                            to reimburse the payment on a pro‑rata basis in proportion to that part or parts of the period during which the provider fails to supply the services to the customer; and

                     (b)  requires the provider to hold protected payments it receives in trust accounts; and

                     (c)  prohibits the provider from transferring any or all of the money in such an account to its beneficial ownership except in accordance with the draw‑down rules set out in the scheme.

             (2)  An instrument under subsection (1) is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

##### <a id="143"></a>143  Waiver of protection by customers

             (1)  A scheme formulated under this Part may provide for standard residential customers of a carriage service provider to waive their protection and rights under the scheme in relation to a particular protected payment made to the provider.

             (2)  If such a waiver is made, the provider is not bound by, and need not comply with, the scheme in relation to that payment.

             (3)  A waiver must be made in accordance with the rules set out in the scheme concerned.

             (4)  Rules mentioned in subsection (3) may require a carriage service provider to inform a customer about the consequences of a waiver.

             (5)  Subsection (4) does not, by implication, limit the matters that may be dealt with by:

                     (a)  a code registered under Part 6 of the _Telecommunications Act 1997_; or

                     (b)  a standard under Part 6 of the _Telecommunications Act 1997_.

##### <a id="144"></a>144  Incidental rules

             (1)  A scheme formulated under this Part may require carriage service providers to comply with such ancillary or incidental rules (if any) as are set out in the scheme.

             (2)  Those rules include (but are not limited to) requiring carriage service providers to inform their standard residential customers about matters relating to the implementation of the scheme.

##### <a id="145"></a>145  Enforcement of protection schemes

             (1)  This section applies if a carriage service provider is bound by a scheme formulated under this Part.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  the ACMA; or

                     (b)  a standard residential customer of the provider;

thinks that the provider has:

                     (c)  failed to discharge a liability of the provider under the scheme; or

                     (d)  otherwise breached the scheme;

the ACMA or the customer may apply to the Federal Court for an order under subsection (3).

             (3)  If the Federal Court is satisfied that the provider has:

                     (a)  failed to discharge a liability of the provider under the scheme; or

                     (b)  otherwise breached the scheme;

the Court may make all or any of the following orders:

                     (c)  an order directing the provider to discharge a liability under the scheme;

                     (d)  an order directing the provider to comply with the scheme;

                     (e)  an order directing the provider to compensate any person who has suffered loss or damage as a result of the breach;

                      (f)  any other order that the Court thinks appropriate.

             (4)  The Federal Court may discharge or vary an order granted under this section.

             (5)  This section does not, by implication, limit other remedies.

             (6)  A reference in this section to a **_carriage service provider_** includes a reference to:

                     (a)  in a case where the provider is an individual or a partnership—the provider’s trustee in bankruptcy; or

                     (b)  in a case where the provider is a body corporate or a partnership—each of the following:

                              (i)  a receiver, receiver and manager, or other controller, of property of the body or partnership;

                             (ii)  an administrator of the body or partnership;

                            (iii)  an administrator of a deed of arrangement entered into by the body or partnership;

                     (b)  carriage service providers;

                     (c)  emergency call persons;

in relation to emergency call services.

             (2)  In making a determination under this section, the ACMA must have regard to the following:

                     (a)  the objective that a carriage service provider who supplies a standard telephone service should provide each end‑user of that standard telephone service with access, free of charge, to an emergency call service, unless the ACMA considers that it would be unreasonable for such access to be provided;

                     (b)  the objective that, if a carriage service provider who supplies a standard telephone service is required to provide each end‑user of that standard telephone service with access to an emergency call service operated by a recognised person, the recognised person should:

                              (i)  receive and handle calls made by those end‑users to the relevant emergency service number; and

                             (ii)  if appropriate—transfer such calls to an appropriate emergency service organisation; and

                              (i)  receiving and handling calls to an emergency service number; or

                             (ii)  transferring such calls to an emergency service organisation; or

                            (iii)  giving information in relation to such calls to an emergency service organisation;

                     (h)  the objective that reasonable community expectations for the handling of calls to emergency service numbers are met;

                      (i)  the objective that carriage services used to make calls to an emergency service number should, as far as practicable, provide the emergency call person concerned with automatic information about:

                              (i)  the location of the caller; and

                             (ii)  the identity of the customer of the service being used by the caller;

                            in order that the providers can comply with their obligations under the determination;

                     (k)  the objective that carriage service providers should provide other carriage service providers with access to:

                              (i)  controlled carriage services of the first‑mentioned providers; and

                             (ii)  controlled networks of the first‑mentioned providers; and

## 9  Application

## Schedule 5

## 1  Meaning of _former law_

In this Schedule:

**_former law_** means the _Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999_ as in force immediately before the commencement of Schedule 1 to this Act.

## 2  Levy distribution for 1999‑2000 financial year

Items 3 to 6 of this Schedule apply if section 86 of the former law prevents a payment being made out of the Universal Service Account  for the 1999‑2000 financial year because of either or both of the following:

                     (a)  the ACA has not yet made a written assessment under section 64 of the former law for that year;

                     (b)  not all participating carriers in respect of which levy was assessed have paid the levy.

_Note:       The operation of the former law for the 1999‑2000 financial year is preserved by item 1 of Schedule 2 to this Act._

## 3  Assessment based on estimate of eligible revenue

(1)       If a participating carrier fails to give the ACA a return under section 62 of the former law for the 1999‑2000 financial year, the ACA may:

                     (a)  estimate the carrier’s eligible revenue for the year; and

                     (b)  make a written assessment under section 64 of the former law of the carrier’s eligible revenue for the year based on the estimate.

(2)       The ACA must give at least 14 days’ notice to the carrier of the ACA’s proposal to make the assessment based on the estimate, and of the amount of eligible return proposed to be assessed. The notice must be in writing.

(3)       The ACA must not make an assessment based on an estimate after receiving a return for the year from the carrier concerned.

(4)       However, if the ACA has made an assessment based on the estimate, the ACA is not required to change it if a return is later given to the ACA.

## 4  Nil assessments

The ACA may make an assessment under section 64 of the former law or item 3 of this Schedule that a participating carrier’s eligible revenue for the 1999‑2000 financial year is nil if, in the ACA’s opinion, without such an assessment:

                     (a)  it is unlikely that the carrier would be able to pay any levy that would be payable; or

                     (b)  the carrier is unlikely to pay the levy unless the Commonwealth takes action to recover it and the cost of doing so would exceed the amount of the levy.

_Note:       However, the ACA could later amend a nil assessment under section 66 of the former law._

## 5  Distributions before all levies have been paid

Despite paragraph 86(b) of the former law, an amount is payable from the Universal Service Account  for the 1999‑2000 financial year even if all of the participating carriers in respect of which the levy was assessed have not yet paid the levy.

## 6  Working out how much levy is payable

(1)       If the total of the amounts payable to carriers out of the Universal Service Account is more than the balance of the Universal Service Account, after paying any refunds that are due under section 79 of the former law, the ACA must:

                     (a)  work out the amount payable to each carrier as a proportion of the total amounts payable; and

                     (b)  ensure that any payments out of the Universal Service Account are made in accordance with those proportions (rounding amounts to whole dollars as the ACA considers appropriate).

(2)       However, if the Minister determines in writing a different method for making payments out of the Universal Service Account than the method provided in subitem (1), the ACA must act in accordance with that determination.

(3)       A determination under subitem (2) is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

(4)       A carrier’s levy credit balance for the 1999‑2000 financial year is reduced by the amount (worked out under this item) that is paid to the carrier.

(5)       This item continues to apply until each carrier’s levy credit balance for the year is reduced to nil.
