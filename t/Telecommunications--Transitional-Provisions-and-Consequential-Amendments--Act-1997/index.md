             (3)  For the purposes of subsection (2), the question whether a particular thing promotes the long-term interests of end-users of services is to be determined in the same manner as it is determined for the purposes of Part XIC of the _Trade Practices Act 1974_.

             (4)  Despite subsection (1), the ACCC must not specify a service if:

                     (a)  the service is supplied using an AMPS network; and

                     (b)  the ACCC is satisfied that the specification of the service would be inconsistent with the policies embodied in Part 19 of the _Telecommunications Act 1997_.

             (5)  The ACCC must also specify in the statement an eligible service that is:

                     (a)  necessary for the purposes of enabling the supply of a broadcasting service by means of line links that deliver signals to end-users; and

                     (b)  of a kind that was used for those purposes on 13 September 1996.

                     (b)  ending at the end of 30 June 1997;

the ACCC may also specify in the statement an eligible service that was covered by the access agreement or by the variation, as the case requires.

             (7)  The ACCC must consult AUSTEL about the preparation or variation of the statement.

             (8)  The ACCC must not prepare or vary the statement unless the ACCC has first:

                     (b)  considered any submissions that were received within the time limit specified by the ACCC when it published the draft.

             (9)  A copy of the statement, and of any variation of the statement, is to be published in the _Gazette_.

           (10)  Part XIC of the _Trade Practices Act 1974_ has effect, in relation to an eligible service specified in the statement, as if the ACCC had:

                     (b)  complied with the requirements set out in subsection 152AL(3) of that Act in relation to the instrument.

           (11)  This section does not prevent the instrument referred to in paragraph (10)(a) from being varied or revoked by the ACCC in accordance with section 152AO of the _Trade Practices Act 1974_.

           (12)  Despite anything in the _Telecommunications Act 1991_, the ACCC is entitled to inspect, make copies of, or take extracts from, any part of the register referred to in section 144 of that Act for a purpose relating to the exercise of the ACCC’s powers under this section.

                     (c)  during the transitional period, a service provider who wishes to supply an eligible service (the **_eligible carriage service_**) gives the existing carrier a request to connect the eligible carriage service to the network; and
