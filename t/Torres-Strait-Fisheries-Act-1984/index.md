                     (b)  in any other case—produce, for inspection by the person in charge of the vehicle, the officer’s identity card;

and, if the officer fails to do so, the officer is not authorised to enter and search, or to detain, the vehicle.

          (2B)  Where an officer (other than a prescribed person who is in uniform) makes a requirement of a person (in this subsection referred to as the **_relevant person_**) under subsection (1), the officer shall:

                     (a)  in the case of a prescribed person—produce, for inspection by the relevant person, written evidence of the fact that the officer is a prescribed person; or

                     (b)  in any other case—produce, for inspection by the relevant person, the officer’s identity card;

and, if the officer fails to do so, the relevant person is not obliged to comply with the requirement.

             (3)  Subject to subsection (4), the powers of an officer under paragraph (1)(ba) in respect of any vehicle or aircraft  must not be exercised without either:

                             (ii)  that the delay that would occur if an application for a warrant were made (either in person or under section 43P) would frustrate the effective execution of the warrant;

those powers may be exercised without a warrant but, if that is done, the officer must:

                     (c)  if it is practicable to do so, notify the owner or person in charge of a vehicle or aircraft that the officer will be exercising powers under paragraph (1)(ba) without a warrant and that the reasons for the exercise of those powers may be requested; and

                     (b)  be in the form approved by the Minister.

##### <a id="42AB"></a>42AB  Offence for failure to return identity card

             (1)  A person commits an offence if:

                     (a)  the person has been issued with an identity card under section 42AA; and

             (2)  An offence under subsection (1) is an offence of strict liability.

Note:          For **_strict liability_**, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

##### <a id="42A"></a>42A  Searches under paragraph 42(1)(aa)

             (1)  A search under paragraph 42(1)(aa) of a person (the **_subject_**) may only be conducted by an officer of the same sex as the subject.

             (2)  However, if an officer of the same sex as the subject is not available to conduct the search, it may be conducted by another person who:

                     (a)  is of the same sex as the subject; and

                     (b)  agrees, at the request of an officer, to conduct the search.

             (3)  Paragraph 42(1)(aa) and this section do not authorise the officer or other person:

                     (a)  to remove any of the subject’s clothing; or

                     (b)  to require the subject to remove any of his or her clothing; or

                     (a)  take possession of the weapon or thing; and

                     (b)  the subject is detained under Schedule 2;

the officer may continue to keep the weapon or thing for such time as he or she thinks necessary for the purposes of this Act or the _Migration Act 1958_.

Note:          Once the subject ceases to be detained under this Act, the subject will generally need to be detained under the _Migration Act 1958_ while he or she is in the migration zone (because his or her enforcement visa under that Act will cease to have effect). Subsection (6) ensures the officer can keep the weapon or thing while the subject is detained under this Act or that Act.

### Division 1A—Search warrants

##### <a id="43C"></a>43C  When search warrants can be issued

             (2)  If a magistrate issues a warrant, the magistrate is to set out in the warrant:

                     (a)  the offence to which the warrant relates; and

                     (b)  a description of the premises to which the warrant relates; and

                     (e)  the period for which the warrant remains in force, which must not be more than 7 days; and

                      (f)  whether the warrant may be executed at any time or only during particular hours.

             (3)  The magistrate is also to state that the warrant authorises the seizure of a thing (other than evidential material of the kind referred to in paragraph (2)(c)) found at the premises in the course of the search that the executing officer or a person helping believes on reasonable grounds to be:

                     (a)  evidential material in relation to an offence to which the warrant relates; or

                     (b)  a thing relevant to another offence against this Act or the regulations that is an indictable offence;

if the executing officer or a person helping believes on reasonable grounds that seizure of the thing is necessary to prevent its concealment, loss or destruction or its use in committing an offence against this Act or the regulations.

             (4)  Paragraph (2)(e) does not prevent the issue of successive warrants in relation to the same premises.

             (5)  If the application for the warrant is made under section 43P, this section applies as if:

                     (a)  subsection (1) referred to 48 hours rather than 72 hours; and

                     (d)  to seize other things found at the premises in the course of the search that the executing officer or a person helping believes on reasonable grounds to be:

                              (i)  evidential material in relation to an offence to which the warrant relates; or

                             (ii)  evidential material in relation to another offence against this Act or the regulations that is an indictable offence;

if the executing officer or a person helping believes on reasonable grounds that seizure of the things is necessary to prevent their concealment, loss or destruction or their use in committing an offence against this Act or the regulations.

             (2)  If the warrant states that it may be executed only during particular hours, the warrant must not be executed outside those hours.

             (3)  If things are seized under a warrant, the warrant authorises the executing officer to make the things available to officers of other agencies if it is necessary to do so for the purpose of investigating or prosecuting an offence to which the things relate.

##### <a id="43E"></a>43E  Availability of assistance and use of force in executing a warrant

             (3)  The copy of the warrant referred to in subsection (1) need not include the signature of the magistrate or the seal of the relevant court.

                     (b)  the occupier of the premises consents in writing;

                     (a)  seize the equipment and any disk, tape or other associated device; or

                     (b)  if the material can, by using facilities at the premises, be put in documentary form—operate the facilities to put the material in that form and seize the documentation so produced; or

                     (c)  if the material can be transferred to a disk, tape or other storage device that:

                              (i)  is brought to the premises; or

                             (ii)  is at the premises and the use of which for the purpose has been agreed to in writing by the occupier of the premises;

operate the equipment or other facilities to copy the material to the storage device and take the storage device from the premises.

             (8)  The executing officer or a person helping must give notice to the occupier of the premises of his or her intention to apply for an extension, and the occupier is entitled to be heard in relation to the application.

                             (ii)  the data recorded on the equipment is damaged; or

                            (iii)  programs associated with the use of the equipment, or with the use of the data, are damaged or corrupted; and

             (2)  The Commonwealth must pay the owner of the equipment, or the user of the data or programs, such reasonable compensation for the damage or corruption as the Commonwealth and the owner or user agree on.

             (3)  However, if the owner or user and the Commonwealth fail to agree, the owner or user may institute proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia for such reasonable amount of compensation as the Court determines.

             (4)  In determining the amount of compensation payable, regard is to be had to whether the occupier of the premises, or the occupier’s employees or agents, if they were available at the time, provided any appropriate warning or guidance on the operation of the equipment.

             (5)  Compensation is payable out of money appropriated by the Parliament.

             (6)  For the purposes of subsection (1):

                    <a name="damag"></a>**_damage_**, in relation to data, includes damage by erasure of data or addition of other data.

the person must, if requested to do so by the occupier of the premises or by another person who apparently represents the occupier and is present when the warrant is executed, give a copy of the thing or the information to the person who made the request as soon as practicable after the seizure.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply if:

             (2)  The right to observe the search being conducted ceases if the person impedes the search.

             (3)  This section does not prevent 2 or more areas of the premises being searched at the same time.

##### <a id="43N"></a>43N  Receipts for things seized under warrant

             (1)  An officer may make an application to a magistrate for a warrant by telephone, telex, fax or other electronic means:

                     (a)  in an urgent case; or

                     (b)  if the delay that would occur if an application were made in person would frustrate the effective execution of the warrant.

             (2)  The magistrate may require communication by voice to the extent that is practicable in the circumstances.

             (3)  An application under this section must include all information required to be provided in an ordinary application for a warrant, but the application may, if necessary, be made before the information is sworn.

             (4)  If an application is made to a magistrate under this section and the magistrate, after considering the information and having received and considered such further information (if any) as the magistrate required, is satisfied that:

                     (a)  a warrant in the terms of the application should be issued urgently; or

                     (b)  the delay that would occur if an application were made in person would frustrate the effective execution of the warrant;

the magistrate may complete and sign the same form of warrant as would be issued under section 43C.

             (5)  If the magistrate decides to issue the warrant, the magistrate is to tell the applicant, by telephone, telex, fax or other electronic means, of the terms of the warrant and the day on which and the time at which it was signed.

             (6)  The applicant must then complete a form of warrant in terms substantially corresponding to those given to the magistrate, stating on the form the magistrate’s name and the day on which and the time at which the warrant was signed.

             (7)  The applicant must, not later than the day after the day of expiry of the warrant or the day after the day on which the warrant was executed, whichever is the earlier, give or send to the magistrate the form of warrant completed by the applicant and, if the information referred to in subsection (3) was not sworn, that information duly sworn.

             (8)  The magistrate is to attach to the documents provided under subsection (7) the form of warrant completed by the magistrate.

             (9)  If:

                     (a)  it is material, in any proceedings, for a court to be satisfied that the exercise of a power under a warrant issued under this section was duly authorised; and

                     (b)  the form of warrant signed by the magistrate is not produced in evidence;

the court is to assume, unless the contrary is proved, that the exercise of the power was not duly authorised.

                     (b)  a boat that was, at the time of the commission of the offence, being used in the course of traditional fishing or community fishing.

##### <a id="52AAA"></a>52AAA  Forfeiture of additional things on forfeited boats

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a court orders a boat to be forfeited under section 52 because it was used in the commission of an offence (the **_relevant offence_**); and

                     (b)  at the time the court makes the order, there are nets, traps, equipment or fish (the **_additional things_**) on the boat that the court cannot order to be forfeited under section 52.

Forfeiture within 2 years

             (2)  If the order for the boat to be forfeited is made within 2 years after the commission of the relevant offence, the court may order the forfeiture of the additional things.

Things owned by the person who owned the boat

             (3)  If the additional things are owned by the person who owned the boat immediately before the relevant offence was committed, the court may order the forfeiture of the additional things.

             (4)  For the purposes of subsection (3), the additional things are taken, unless the contrary is proved, to be owned by the person who owned the boat immediately before the relevant offence was committed.

Things owned by persons who commit offences

##### <a id="52AAC"></a>52AAC  Rights and interests of the Commonwealth not limited

                   To avoid doubt, a provision of this Subdivision giving the Commonwealth rights or interests in relation to property does not limit any other right or interest the Commonwealth has or acquires otherwise than under this Subdivision.

#### Subdivision B—Automatic forfeiture of things

             (1)  The following things are forfeited to the Commonwealth:

anything on, in or attached to the boat that forms part of the boat is also the property of the Commonwealth.

##### <a id="52AE"></a>52AE  Rights and interests of the Commonwealth not limited

#### Subdivision C—Dealing with things seized

##### <a id="52B"></a>52B  Application of this Subdivision

                   This Subdivision sets out rules about the following:

                     (a)  a thing that an officer seizes under paragraph 42(1)(ea) or (eb):

                              (i)  because the thing is forfeited under Subdivision B; or

                             (ii)  because the officer has reasonable grounds to believe the thing is forfeited under Subdivision B;

                     (b)  a thing that an officer seizes under paragraph 42(1)(ec) or (ed):

                              (i)  because the thing is the property of the Commonwealth because of the operation of Subdivision BA; or

                             (ii)  because the officer has reasonable grounds to believe the thing is the property of the Commonwealth because of the operation of Subdivision BA.

##### <a id="52C"></a>52C  Notice of seizure

Giving notice

             (1)  The officer must give written notice of the seizure of the thing:

                     (a)  if the thing is, or was on, a boat, or was used in connection with a boat:

                              (i)  to the person who was the master of the boat immediately before the seizure; or

                             (ii)  to the person whom the officer has reasonable grounds to believe was the master of the boat immediately before the seizure; or

                     (b)  in a case not covered by paragraph (a):

                              (i)  to the owner of the thing; or

                             (ii)  to the person who had possession, custody or control of the thing immediately before it was seized.

          (1A)  However, if the officer cannot conveniently give the notice to the person in person, the officer may give written notice of the seizure of the thing by fixing the notice to a prominent part of the thing, unless the thing is a fish.

Content of notice

             (2)  The notice must:

                     (a)  identify the thing; and

                     (b)  state that the thing has been seized; and

                     (c)  state that the thing will be condemned as forfeited unless the owner of the thing or the person who had possession, custody or control of the thing immediately before it was seized gives the CEO within 30 days a written claim in English for the thing; and

                     (d)  specify the address of the CEO.

Note:          Section 52E condemns the thing if it is not claimed within 30 days. Section 52G condemns the thing if it is claimed but the claimant does not get a court order supporting the claim.

Status of notice

             (3)  A notice under subsection (1) is not a legislative instrument.

##### <a id="52D"></a>52D  Dealing with thing before it is condemned

             (1)  On behalf of the Commonwealth, AFMA may cause the thing to be disposed of or destroyed if it is a boat and AFMA is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the boat is unseaworthy; or

                     (b)  the boat poses a serious risk to safety, public health or quarantine; or

                     (c)  the boat poses a serious risk of damage to other property or the environment; or

                     (d)  the expenses of custody and maintenance of the boat between its seizure and condemnation are likely to be greater than its value.

             (2)  If AFMA causes the boat to be disposed of, it may cause the disposal to be made subject to specified conditions.

             (3)  The table lists some other provisions relevant to dealing with things before they are condemned as forfeited to the Commonwealth:

##### <a id="52E"></a>52E  Thing condemned if not claimed in time

             (1)  By force of this subsection, the thing is condemned as forfeited to the Commonwealth 30 days after notice of seizure of the thing has been given under section 52C, unless:

                     (a)  within the 30 days the owner of the thing or the person who had possession, custody or control of it immediately before it was seized gives the CEO a written claim for the thing; and

                     (b)  the claim is in English; and

                     (c)  the claim sets out an address for service on the person making the claim.

Note:          Section 52H requires things condemned as forfeited to be dealt with in accordance with the Minister’s directions.

             (2)  A person may claim the thing even if it is disposed of or destroyed before or after the claim.

##### <a id="52F"></a>52F  Dealing with claim for thing

             (1)  If the thing is claimed as described in section 52E:

                     (a)  an officer may retain possession of the thing without starting any proceedings for the condemnation of the goods; and

                     (b)  the CEO may give the claimant a written notice stating that the thing will be condemned if the claimant does not institute proceedings against the Commonwealth within 2 months:

                              (i)  to recover the thing; or

                             (ii)  for a declaration that the thing is not forfeited.

Note 1:       An officer may retain possession even if the CEO does not give notice. If so, the claimant will be able to recover the thing only if it is released under section 52I or a court orders its release to the claimant.

Note 2:       If the CEO does give the notice and the claimant institutes proceedings, whether the claimant recovers the thing will depend on the outcome of the proceedings.

             (2)  The CEO may give the notice to the claimant by posting it prepaid as a letter to the last address of the claimant that is known to the CEO. If the CEO does so, the letter is taken to be properly addressed for the purposes of section 29 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not limit the ways in which the notice may be given.

Note:          Sections 28A and 29 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ explain how a notice can be given, and when it is taken to be given.

             (4)  To avoid doubt, the CEO may give the notice even if the thing has been released under section 52I.

             (5)  A notice under paragraph (1)(b) is not a legislative instrument.

##### <a id="52G"></a>52G  Condemnation of thing if it is claimed

Application

             (1)  This section applies if the CEO gives the claimant a notice under section 52F about instituting proceedings:

                     (a)  to recover the thing; or

                     (b)  for a declaration that the thing is not forfeited.

Condemnation if proceedings not started within 2 months

             (2)  By force of this subsection, the thing is condemned as forfeited to the Commonwealth 2 months after the notice is given if the claimant does not institute the proceedings within that period.

Condemnation at end of proceedings started within 2 months

             (3)  By force of this subsection, the thing is condemned as forfeited to the Commonwealth at the end of the proceedings that are instituted by the claimant against the Commonwealth within 2 months of the claimant being given the notice if, at the end of the proceedings, there is not:

                     (a)  an order for the claimant to recover the thing; or

                     (b)  an order for the Commonwealth to pay the claimant the proceeds of the sale of the thing if it has been sold before the end of the proceedings; or

                     (c)  an order for the Commonwealth to pay the claimant the market value of the thing at the time it was disposed of (except by sale) or destroyed, if it has been disposed of (except by sale) or destroyed before the end of the proceedings; or

                     (d)  a declaration that the thing is not forfeited.

End of proceedings that go to judgment

             (4)  For the purposes of subsection (3), if the proceedings go to judgment, they end:

                     (a)  at the end of the period for lodging an appeal against the judgment, if no appeal is lodged within that period; or

                     (b)  when the appeal lapses or is finally determined, if an appeal is lodged against the judgment within that period.

Proceedings relating to thing that has been disposed of

             (5)  Proceedings relating to the thing may be instituted or continued even if it is disposed of or destroyed.

Order for payment if thing has been disposed of or destroyed

             (6)  If the court hearing the proceedings decides that it would have ordered that the thing be delivered to a person apart from the fact that the thing had been disposed of or destroyed, the court must order the Commonwealth to pay the person an amount equal to:

                     (a)  the proceeds of the sale of the thing, if it has been sold before the end of the proceedings; or

                     (b)  the market value of the thing at the time it was disposed of (except by sale) or destroyed, if it has been disposed of (except by sale) or destroyed before the end of the proceedings.

##### <a id="52H"></a>52H  Dealing with thing after it is condemned

                     (a)  to recover a thing forfeited under Subdivision B; or

if a person has been convicted of an offence mentioned in paragraph 52A(1)(a), the person is taken, unless the contrary is proved, to have committed the offence.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to a conviction:

                     (a)  in respect of which a review or appeal (however described) has been instituted but not finally determined; or

                     (b)  that has been quashed or set aside; or

### Division 4—Dealing with property that has been seized etc.

##### <a id="52I"></a>52I  Release of property that has been seized etc.

             (1)  If any property is under the control of an officer because of the exercise by an officer of powers under section 42, AFMA may direct that the property be released:

                     (a)  in the case of a boat—to the owner or the master of the boat; and

                     (b)  in any other case—to the owner of the property or to the person from whose possession the property was seized, or from whose control the property was removed;

on such conditions (if any) as AFMA thinks fit, including conditions as to the giving of security:

                     (c)  for payment of the value of the property if it is forfeited; and

                     (d)  for the payment of any fines that may be imposed under this Act in respect of offences that AFMA has reason to believe have been committed with the use of, or in relation to, that property.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  any property referred to in subsection (1):

                              (i)  is also property referred to in section 52; and

                             (ii)  was under the control of an officer because an offence referred to in that section is alleged to have been committed in respect of the property; and

                     (b)  were the person to be convicted of the offence an order could be made by the court directing the person to pay the costs of the prosecution;

the conditions on which the property may be released under subsection (1) include a condition as to the giving of security for payment of those costs if the person is convicted of the offence.

             (3)  For the purposes of this section:

                     (a)  a reference to property includes a reference to fish; and

                     (b)  property is taken to be under the control of an officer if any person is, in relation to that property, subject to the directions of the officer.

##### <a id="52J"></a>52J  Seizure or forfeiture has effect despite admiralty proceedings

             (1)  The seizure, detention or forfeiture of a boat under this Act has effect despite any or all of the following events:

                     (a)  the arrest of the boat under the _Admiralty Act 1988_;

                     (b)  the making of an order for the sale of the boat by a court in proceedings brought under the _Admiralty Act 1988_;

                     (c)  the sale of the boat under an order made by a court in proceedings brought under the _Admiralty Act 1988_.

             (2)  Subsection (1) has effect regardless of whether the seizure, detention or forfeiture, or the event that was the basis for the seizure, detention or forfeiture, occurred before or after the arrest, making of the order or sale (as appropriate).

### Division 5—Ancillary offences and provisions

##### <a id="53"></a>53  Liability of master of boat

             (1)  The master of a boat on which, or by the use of which, an offence against this Act (in this section referred to as the **_primary offence_**) is committed is guilty of an offence against this section and is punishable, on conviction, as if it were the primary offence.

             (2)  A person may be convicted of an offence against this section whether or not the identity of the person who committed the primary offence appears, or has appeared, from the evidence in the proceedings in respect of the offence against this section or in any other proceedings, but a person shall not be convicted both of an offence against this section and of the primary offence.

             (3)  The provisions of section 52 apply where a person is convicted of an offence against this section in like manner as they would apply if that person had been convicted of the primary offence.

##### <a id="53A"></a>53A  Conduct by directors, servants or agents of bodies corporate

             (1)  Where, in proceedings for an offence against this Act or the regulations in respect of conduct engaged in by a body corporate, it is necessary to establish the state of mind of the body corporate, it is sufficient to show that a director, servant or agent of the body corporate, being a director, servant or agent by whom the conduct was engaged in within the scope of his or her actual or apparent authority, had that state of mind.

             (2)  Any conduct engaged in on behalf of a body corporate:

     5.    Papua New Guinea shall have the sole entitlement to the allowable catch of the commercial barramundi fishery near the Papua New Guinea coast, except within the territorial seas of the islands of Aubusi, Boigu, Dauan, Kaumag, Moimi and Saibai where, in respect of that fishery, the provisions of paragraph 4 (a) of this Article shall not apply. 

     6.    In apportioning the allowable catch in relation to an individual fishery, the Parties shall normally consider the allowable catch expressed in terms of weight or volume. In calculating the apportionment of the total allowable catch of the Protected Zone commercial fisheries, the Parties shall have regard to the relative value of individual fisheries and shall, for this purpose, agree on a common value for production from each individual fishery for the period in question, such value being based on the value of the raw product at the processing facility or such other point as may be agreed, but prior to any enhancement of value through processing, including processing at a pearl culture farm, or further transportation or marketing. 

     7.    The Parties may agree to vary the apportionment of the allowable catch determined for individual fisheries as part of the subsidiary conservation and management arrangements referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 22 of this Treaty but so as to maintain in respect of the total allowable catch of the Protected Zone commercial fisheries the apportionment specified in paragraph 4 of this Article for each Party. 

     8.    In calculating the total allowable catch of the Protected Zone commercial fisheries, the allowable catch of the commercial barramundi fishery referred to in paragraph 5 of this Article shall be disregarded. 

<u>ARTICLE 24</u>

<u>Transitional Entitlement</u>

     1.    As part of the subsidiary conservation and management arrangements referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 22 of this Treaty, the level of the catch of each Protected Zone commercial fishery to which each Party is entitled, provided it remains within the allowable catch— 

     (a)     shall not, during the period of five years immediately after the entry into force of this Treaty, be reduced below the level of catch of that Party before the entry into force of this Treaty; but 

     (b)     may, during the second period of five years after the entry into force of this Treaty, be adjusted progressively so that at the end of that second five-year period it reaches the level of catch apportioned in each case in Article 23 of this Treaty. 

     2.    The entitlement of a Party under this Article shall, where the limitation of the allowable catch makes it necessary, take priority over the entitlement of the other Party under Article 23 of this Treaty, but shall be taken into account in calculating the entitlement of the first Party. 

<u>ARTICLE 25</u>

<u>Preferential Entitlement</u>

     If, in any relevant period, a Party does not itself propose to take all the allowable catch of a Protected Zone commercial fishery to which it is entitled, either in its own area of jurisdiction or that of the other Party, the other Party shall have a preferential entitlement to any of the allowable catch of that fishery not taken by the first Party. 

<u>ARTICLE 26 </u>

<u>Licensing Arrangements</u>

     1.    In the negotiation and implementation of the conservation and management arrangements referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 22 of this Treaty—

     (a)     the Parties shall consult and co-operate in the issue and endorsement of licences to permit commercial fishing in Protected Zone commercial fisheries;

     (b)     the responsible authorities of the Parties may issue licences to fish in any Protected Zone commercial fishery; and 

     (c)     persons or vessels which are licensed by the responsible authorities of one Party to fish in any relevant period in a Protected Zone commercial fishery shall, if nominated by the responsible authorities of that Party, be authorised by the responsible authorities of the other Party, wherever necessary, by the endorsement of licences or otherwise, to fish in those areas under the jurisdiction of the other Party in which the fishery concerned is located. 

     2.    The persons or vessels licensed by one Party which have been authorised, or are to be authorised, under the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article to fish in waters under the jurisdiction of the other Party shall comply with the relevant fisheries laws and regulations of the other Party except that they shall be exempt from licensing fees, levies and other charges imposed by the other Party in respect of such fishing activities. 

     3.    In issuing licences in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article, the responsible authorities of both Parties shall have regard to the desirability of promoting economic development in the Torres Strait area and employment opportunities for the traditional inhabitants. 

     4.    The responsible authorities of both parties shall ensure that the traditional inhabitants are consulted from time to time on the licensing arrangements in respect of Protected Zone commercial fisheries. 

<u>ARTICLE 27</u>

<u>Third</u><u> </u><u>State</u><u> Fishing in Protected Zone Commercial Fisheries</u>

     1.    The responsible authorities of the Parties shall inform one another and shall consult, at the request of either of them, concerning the proposed exploitation of the Protected Zone commercial fisheries—

     (a)     by a joint venture in which there is third-State equity participation; or 

     (b)     by a vessel of third-State registration or with a crew substantially of the nationality of a third State. 

     2.    Vessels the operations of which are under the control of nationals of a third State shall not be licensed to exploit the Protected Zone commercial fisheries without the concurrence of the responsible authorities of both Parties in the particular case or class of cases. 

<u>ARTICLE 28</u>

<u>Inspection and Enforcement</u>

     1.    The Parties shall co-operate, including by exchange of personnel, in inspection and enforcement to prevent violations of the Protected Zone commercial fisheries arrangements and in taking appropriate enforcement measures in the event of such violations. 

     2.    The Parties shall consult from time to time, as necessary, so as to ensure that legislation and regulations adopted by each Party pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article are, as far as practicable, consistent with the legislation and regulations of the other Party. 

     3.    Each Party shall make it an offence under its fisheries laws or regulations for a person to use a vessel of its nationality to fish in Protected Zone commercial fisheries for species of fisheries resources in areas over which the other Party has jurisdiction in respect of those species— 

     (a)     without being duly licensed or authorised by that other Party; or 

     (b)     in the case of a licensed or authorised vessel, in breach of the fisheries laws or regulations of the other Party applying within those areas. 

     4.    Each Party will, in relation to species of fisheries resources in areas where it has jurisdiction in respect of those species— 

     (a)     investigate suspected offences against its fisheries laws and regulations; and 

     (b)     except as provided in or under this article, take corrective action when necessary against offenders against those laws or regulations.

     5.    In this article, corrective action means the action normally taken in respect of a suspected offence, after due investigation, and includes, where appropriate, the apprehension of a suspected offender, the prosecution of an alleged offender, or the execution of a penalty imposed by a court or the cancellation or suspension of the licence of an offender. 

     6.    In accordance with the provisions of this Article, and in other appropriate cases as may be agreed between the Parties, corrective action in respect of offences or suspected offences against the fisheries laws or regulations of the Parties shall be taken by the authorities of the Party whose nationality is borne by the vessel or person concerned (called in this Article “the first Party”) and not by the Party in whose area of jurisdiction the offence or suspected offence occurs (called in this Article “the second Party”). 

     7.    The Parties acknowledge that the principle stated in paragraph 6 of this Article should not be applied so as to frustrate the enforcement of fisheries laws or regulations or to enable offenders against those laws or regulations to go unpunished. 

     8.    Where, in the case of a suspected offence alleged to have been committed in or in the vicinity of the Protected Zone, it appears that the offence was, or might reasonably be considered to have been, committed in the course of traditional fishing, corrective action or other measures shall be taken by the authorities of the first Party and not by the authorities of the second Party and, if being detained by the authorities of the second Party, the alleged offenders and their vessel shall be either released or handed over to the authorities of the first Party, in accordance with arrangements that will avoid undue expense or inconvenience to the authorities of the second Party. 

     9.    Where paragraph 8 of this Article applies, the authorities of the second Party may require assurance in a particular case that corrective action or other measures will be taken by the authorities of the first Party that will adequately ensure that the activity complained of will not be repeated. 

     10.   Where the provisions of paragraph 8 of this Article do not apply, and the person or vessel alleged to have been involved or used in the commission of a suspected offence in the Protected Zone is licensed to fish in the Protected Zone by the authorities of the first Party, corrective action shall be taken by the authorities of the first Party and not by the authorities of the second Party and, if being detained by the authorities of the second Party, the alleged offenders and their vessel shall be either released or handed over to the authorities of the first Party, in accordance with arrangements that will avoid undue expense or inconvenience to the authorities of the second Party, and the provisions of paragraphs 13 and 14 of this article shall apply. 

     11.   The provisions of paragraph 10 of this Article shall also apply in respect of a suspected offence by a person or vessel of the first Party in an area of jurisdiction of the second Party outside the Protected Zone where— 

     (a)     that person or vessel was authorised by the authorities of the second Party to fish in the area where the suspected offence was committed under the arrangements referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 22 of this Treaty; and 

     (b)     the suspected offence was committed in relation to the fishery the subject of that authorisation and did not involve the taking of other species or potential injury to another fishery. 

     12.   Persons or vessels of the first Party detained by the authorities of the Second Party in the circumstances described in paragraphs 8 and 10 of this Article may be detained for as long as necessary to enable those authorities to conduct an expeditious investigation into the offence and to obtain evidence. Thereafter, they shall not be detained other than for the purpose of the handing over of the persons or vessels in accordance with the provisions of those paragraphs unless they are lawfully detained on some other ground. 

     13.   If an alleged offender referred to in paragraph 10 of this Article is, in respect of conduct in waters under the jurisdiction of the second party— 

     (a)     convicted of an offence against the fisheries laws or regulations of the first Party; or 

     (b)     found by the authorities of the first Party, on the basis of sufficient available evidence, to have contravened or failed to comply with a condition of his licence or authorisation or that of his vessel; 

the authorities of the first Party shall, where appropriate and having regard to paragraph 7 of this Article, cancel or suspend the licence or authorisation of the person or his vessel so far as it relates to the Protected Zone commercial fisheries. 

     14.   Where a person or vessel involved or used in the commission of the alleged offence referred to in paragraph 10 of this Article is also currently licensed or authorised to fish in the area of the Protected Zone by the second Party, the authorities of the second Party may, after receiving a report and representations, if any, from the authorities of the first Party, cancel or suspend that licence or authorisation in accordance with its laws for such period as is warranted by the circumstances of the case. 

     15.   Each Party shall provide the other Party with any evidence obtained during investigations carried out in accordance with this Article into a suspected offence involving a person or vessel of the other Party. Each Party shall take appropriate measures to facilitate the admission of such evidence in proceedings taken in respect of the suspected offence. 

     16.   In this Article references to persons and vessels of, or of the nationality of, a Party include references to persons or vessels licensed by that Party under sub-paragraph 1 (b) of Article 26 of this Treaty, and the crews of vessels so licensed, except where such persons or vessels have a prior current licence from the other Party under that sub-paragraph.

# Schedule 2—Provisions relating to detention of suspected illegal foreign fishers

_Note:       See section 54A._

## Part 1—Preliminary

### Division 1—Objects of this Schedule

##### <a id="1"></a>1  Main objects of this Schedule

             (1)  This Schedule has 3 main objects.

             (2)  The first main object is to provide for the detention (**_fisheries detention_**) in Australia or a Territory of persons who:

                     (a)  are reasonably suspected by an officer of having committed an offence involving the use of a foreign boat or a   Papua New Guinea boat; and

                     (b)  are not Australian citizens or Australian residents;

for a limited period for the purposes of determining whether to charge them with the offence.

             (3)  The second main object is to provide for persons in fisheries detention to be searched, screened, given access to facilities for obtaining legal advice, and identified.

             (4)  The third main object is to facilitate the transition of persons from fisheries detention to immigration detention under the _Migration Act 1958_:

                     (a)  by providing for the things mentioned in subclause (3) to be done in a way corresponding to the way that Act provides for those things to be done to persons in immigration detention; and

                     (b)  by authorising the disclosure of personal information about individuals who are or have been in fisheries detention to persons, agencies and organisations responsible for holding the individuals in immigration detention, for the purpose of the immigration detention and welfare of the individuals.

Note:          The enforcement visa of a person who is neither an Australian citizen nor an Australian resident ceases to have effect under the _Migration Act 1958_ when the person ceases to be in fisheries detention, so that Act requires the person to be taken into immigration detention.

### Division 2—Definitions

##### <a id="2"></a>2  Definitions

                   In this Schedule, unless the contrary intention appears:

                    <a name="authorised-offic"></a>**_authorised officer_** means an officer, or detention officer, who is authorised under Division 4 for the purposes of the provision in which the expression occurs.

                    <a name="detaine"></a>**_detainee_** means a person detained under Part 2.

                    <a name="detent"></a>**_detention_** means detention under Part 2.

                    <a name="detent-offic"></a>**_detention officer_** means a person appointed under clause 3 to be a detention officer.

### Division 3—Appointment etc. of detention officers

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Minister may appoint persons to be detention officers

             (1)  The Minister may, by instrument, appoint one or more persons (except persons who are officers) to be detention officers.

Note:          Officers have the same powers as detention officers, as well as other powers, so there is no reason for officers to be appointed as detention officers.

             (2)  An instrument appointing persons to be detention officers:

                     (a)  may identify the persons by reference to a class; and

                     (b)  may provide for persons to be appointed when they become members of the class at or after a time specified in the instrument.

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Detention officers subject to directions

                   A detention officer is, in the exercise of his or her powers, and the performance of his or her duties, under this Schedule, subject to the directions given by the Minister or AFMA.

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Detention officer etc. not liable to certain actions

             (1)  A detention officer, or a person assisting a detention officer in the exercise of powers under this Act or the regulations, is not liable to an action, suit or proceeding for or in respect of anything done in good faith or omitted to be done in good faith in the exercise or purported exercise of any power conferred by this Act or the regulations.

Note:          Subsection 42(6AA) makes similar provision for officers and their assistants.

             (2)  However, subsection (1) does not affect a contractual liability of a detention officer or person assisting a detention officer.

### Division 4—Authorisation of officers and detention officers

##### <a id="6"></a>6  AFMA may authorise officers and detention officers

             (1)  AFMA may, by instrument, authorise one or more officers and/or detention officers for the purposes of a specified provision of this Schedule, from among officers and/or detention officers who have successfully completed minimum training prescribed by a legislative instrument.

             (2)  An instrument authorising officers and/or detention officers:

                     (a)  may identify them by reference to a class; and

                     (b)  may provide for them to be authorised when they become members of the class at or after a time specified in the instrument.

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Persons who are authorised officers for purposes of _Migration Act 1958_ are taken to be authorised for this Schedule

             (1)  A person who:

                     (a)  is an officer or detention officer; and

                     (b)  is an authorised officer (as defined in the _Migration Act 1958_) for a provision of that Act listed in column 2 of an item of the table;

is, while he or she meets the conditions in paragraphs (a) and (b), taken to be authorised under clause 6 for the purposes of the provision of this Schedule listed in column 3 of the item.

Limits on authorisation

             (2)  However, the person is not taken to be authorised to carry out an identification test in relation to which section 5D of the _Migration Act 1958_ provides that the person is not an authorised officer (for the purposes of that Act).

Note:          This is relevant to items 9 to 15 of the table in subclause (1).

Persons specified by AFMA not authorised

             (3)  AFMA may, by instrument, specify that the person is not taken to be authorised:

                     (a)  for the purposes of the provision of this Schedule; or

                     (b)  for the purposes of carrying out under this Schedule identification tests of a type specified under section 5D of the _Migration Act 1958_ in relation to the person.

The instrument has effect according to its terms, despite subclause (1).

             (4)  An instrument under subclause (3) may specify one or more persons by reference to their being members of a specified class at or after a time specified in the instrument.

             (5)  An instrument made under subclause (3) is not a legislative instrument.

## Part 2—Detaining suspected illegal foreign fishers

### Division 1—Initial detention by an officer

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Power to detain

             (1)  An officer may detain a person in Australia or a Territory for the purposes of investigating and determining, during the period of detention, whether or not the person committed an offence against section 45, 46A, 46B, 46C, 46D, 48, 49, 49A, 51 or 51A or an offence against section 6 of the _Crimes Act 1914_ relating to such an offence, if the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the person:

                     (a)  is not an Australian citizen or an Australian resident; and

                     (b)  was on a foreign boat, or a Papua   New Guinea boat, when it was used in the commission of such an offence.

             (2)  Subclause (1) does not authorise an officer to use more force in detaining a person than is reasonably necessary.

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Relationship with Part IC of the _Crimes Act 1914_

             (1)  Part IC of the _Crimes Act 1914_ applies in relation to the detainee while detained under this Part as if:

                     (a)  he or she were a protected suspect for a Commonwealth offence for the purposes of that Part; and

                     (b)  an officer were an investigating official for the purposes of that Part.

             (2)  Subclause (1) does not affect the operation of Division 2 of Part IC of the _Crimes Act 1914_ as it applies of its own force in relation to a person who is lawfully arrested.

### Division 2—Continued detention by a detention officer

##### <a id="10"></a>10  Detention officer may detain person already detained by officer

             (1)  For the purposes of facilitating an officer investigating and determining whether or not a person committed an offence against section 45, 46A, 46B, 46C, 46D, 48, 49, 49A, 51 or 51A or an offence against section 6 of the _Crimes Act 1914_ relating to such an offence, a detention officer may detain the person in Australia or a Territory if the detention officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the person:

                     (a)  has been detained by an officer under Division 1; and

                     (b)  has been presented, while detained by that officer, to a detention officer for detention by a detention officer.

             (2)  However, the detention officer may not detain the person if the detention officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the person has ceased to be in detention since the last time the person was detained by an officer under Division 1.

### Division 3—Detention on behalf of an officer or detention officer

##### <a id="11"></a>11  Detention on behalf of an officer or detention officer

             (1)  A person is taken to be detained by an officer or detention officer under this Part while the person is held, on behalf of the officer or detention officer, in any of the following:

                     (a)  a prison or remand centre of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory;

                     (b)  a police station or watch house;

                     (c)  a hospital or other place where the person is receiving medical treatment;

                     (d)  another place approved by the Minister in writing;

                     (e)  a boat.

             (2)  This clause has effect even while the officer or detention officer is not present where the person is held on behalf of the officer or detention officer.

             (3)  An approval of a place by the Minister is not a legislative instrument.

### Division 4—Moving detainees

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Power to move detainees

             (1)  An officer or a detention officer may:

                     (a)  take a detainee in Australia to another place in Australia or to a place in an external Territory; and

                     (b)  take a detainee in an external Territory to another place in the Territory or to a place in Australia or another Territory.

             (2)  Subclause (1) does not authorise an officer or detention officer to use more force than is reasonably necessary to take the detainee to the place.

             (3)  In exercising the power under subclause (1), the officer or detention officer must have regard to all matters that he or she considers relevant, including:

                     (a)  the administration of justice; and

                     (b)  the welfare of the detainee.

### Division 5—End of detention

##### <a id="13"></a>13  End of detention

Detainee who was on a foreign boat

             (1)  A detainee who was detained under subclause 8(1) because the officer mentioned in that subclause had reasonable grounds to believe that the detainee was on a foreign boat must be released from detention:

                     (a)  as soon as an officer or detention officer knows or reasonably believes that the detainee is an Australian citizen or an Australian resident; or

                     (b)  at the time the detainee is brought before a magistrate following a decision to charge the detainee with an offence referred to in subclause 8(1); or

                     (c)  at the time a decision is made not to charge the detainee with an offence referred to in that subclause; or

                     (d)  at the end of 168 hours after the detention began;

whichever occurs first.

Detainee who was on a Papua New Guinea boat

             (2)  A detainee who was detained under subclause 8(1) because the officer mentioned in that subclause had reasonable grounds to believe that the detainee was on a Papua New Guinea boat must be released from detention:

                     (a)  as soon as an officer or detention officer knows or reasonably believes that the detainee is an Australian citizen or an Australian resident; or

                     (b)  as soon as an officer believes that the detainee did not commit an offence described in that subclause; or

                     (c)  as soon as an officer finishes investigating whether the detainee committed an offence described in that subclause; or

                     (d)  at the end of 72 hours after the detention began;

whichever occurs first.

Papua New Guineans on foreign boats

             (3)  Subclause (1) ceases to apply to a detainee, and subclause (2) applies instead to the detainee (as if the officer mentioned in subclause 8(1) had reasonable grounds to believe that the detainee had been on a Papua New Guinea boat), if an officer or detention officer knows or reasonably believes that the detainee is:

                     (a)  a citizen of Papua New Guinea; or

                     (b)  a person who is usually resident in Papua New Guinea and whose continued presence there is not subject to a limitation as to time imposed by law.

Note:          The fact that subclause (2) applies as if the officer mentioned in subclause 8(1) had reasonable grounds to believe that the detainee had been on a Papua New Guinea boat does not affect whether the detainee was using a foreign boat in an offence against section 45, 46A, 46B, 46C, 46D or 48.

             (4)  To avoid doubt, subclause (3) does not affect the validity of the detention of a detainee before the first time (the **_recognition time_**) an officer or detention officer knew or reasonably believed that the detainee was:

                     (a)  a citizen of Papua New Guinea; or

                     (b)  a person who is usually resident in Papua New Guinea and whose continued presence there is not subject to a limitation as to time imposed by law.

This has effect even if the recognition time is more than 72 hours after the detention began.

Note:          If the recognition time was more than 72 hours after the detention began, the effect of subclause (3) applying subclause (2) is to require the release of the detainee at the recognition time. However, subclause (3) does not affect the validity of detention in the period starting 72 hours after the detention began and ending at the recognition time.

### Division 6—Offence of escaping from detention

##### <a id="14"></a>14  Escape from detention

             (1)  A person commits an offence if:

                     (a)  the person is in detention; and

                     (b)  the person escapes from that detention.

             (2)  The offence is punishable on conviction by imprisonment for up to 2 years.

## Part 3—Searching and screening detainees and screening their visitors

### Division 1—Searches of detainees

##### <a id="15"></a>15  Searches of detainees

             (1)  For the purposes set out in subclause (2), a detainee, and the detainee’s clothing and any property under the immediate control of the detainee, may, without warrant, be searched.

             (2)  The purposes for which a detainee, and the detainee’s clothing and any property under the immediate control of the detainee, may be searched under this clause are as follows:

                     (a)  to find out whether there is hidden on the detainee’s person, in the clothing or in the property, a weapon or other thing capable of being used to inflict bodily injury or to help the detainee to escape from detention;

                     (b)  to find out whether there is hidden on the detainee’s person, in the clothing or in the property, a document or other thing that is, or may be, evidence of:

                              (i)  an offence against section 45, 46A, 46B, 46C, 46D, 48, 49, 49A, 51 or 51A; or

                             (ii)  an offence against section 6 of the _Crimes Act 1914_ relating to an offence described in subparagraph (i).

             (3)  If, in the course of a search under this clause, a weapon or other thing referred to in paragraph (2)(a), or a document or other thing referred to in paragraph (2)(b), is found, an authorised officer:

                     (a)  may take possession of the weapon, document or other thing; and

                     (b)  may retain the weapon, document or other thing for such time as he or she thinks necessary for the purposes of this Act or the _Migration Act 1958_.

             (4)  This clause does not authorise an authorised officer, or another person conducting a search under subclause (5), to remove any of the detainee’s clothing, or to require a detainee to remove any of his or her clothing.

             (5)  A search under this clause of a detainee, and the detainee’s clothing, must be conducted by:

                     (a)  an authorised officer of the same sex as the detainee; or

                     (b)  in a case where an authorised officer of the same sex as the detainee is not available to conduct the search—any other person who is of the same sex and:

                              (i)  is requested by an authorised officer; and

                             (ii)  agrees;

                            to conduct the search.

             (6)  An action or proceeding, whether civil or criminal, does not lie against a person who, at the request of an authorised officer, conducts a search under this clause if the person acts in good faith and does not contravene subclause (7).

             (7)  An authorised officer or other person who conducts a search under this clause must not use more force, or subject a detainee to greater indignity, than is reasonably necessary in order to conduct the search.

             (8)  To avoid doubt, a search of a detainee may be conducted under this clause irrespective of whether a screening procedure is conducted in relation to the detainee under clause 16 or a strip search of the detainee is conducted under clause 17.

Note:          This clause corresponds closely to section 252 of the _Migration Act 1958_.

### Division 2—Screening of detainees

##### <a id="16"></a>16  Power to conduct a screening procedure

             (1)  A screening procedure in relation to a detainee, other than a detainee to whom clause 22 applies, may be conducted by an authorised officer, without warrant, to find out whether there is hidden on the detainee, in his or her clothing or in a thing in his or her possession, a weapon, or other thing, capable of being used:

                     (a)  to inflict bodily injury; or

                     (b)  to help the detainee, or any other detainee, to escape from detention.

             (2)  An authorised officer who conducts a screening procedure under this clause must not use greater force, or subject the detainee to greater indignity, than is reasonably necessary in order to conduct the screening procedure.

             (3)  This clause does not authorise an authorised officer to remove any of the detainee’s clothing, or to require a detainee to remove any of his or her clothing.

             (4)  To avoid doubt, a screening procedure may be conducted in relation to a detainee under this clause irrespective of whether a search of the detainee is conducted under clause 15 or 17.

             (5)  In this clause:

                    <a name="conduct-screen-procur"></a>**_conducting a screening procedure_**, in relation to a detainee, means:

                     (a)  causing the detainee to walk, or to be moved, through screening equipment; or

                     (b)  passing hand-held screening equipment over or around the detainee or around things in the detainee’s possession; or

                     (c)  passing things in the detainee’s possession through screening equipment or examining such things by X-ray.

                    <a name="screen-equip"></a>**_screening equipment_** means a metal detector or similar device for detecting objects or particular substances.

Note:          This clause corresponds closely to section 252AA of the _Migration Act 1958_.

### Division 3—Strip searches of detainees

##### <a id="17"></a>17  Power to conduct a strip search

             (1)  A strip search of a detainee, other than a detainee to whom clause 22 applies, may be conducted by an authorised officer, without warrant, to find out whether there is hidden on the detainee, in his or her clothing or in a thing in his or her possession a weapon, or other thing, capable of being used:

                     (a)  to inflict bodily injury; or

                     (b)  to help the detainee, or any other detainee, to escape from detention.

Note:          Clause 18 sets out rules for conducting a strip search under this clause.

             (2)  A **_strip search_** of a detainee means a search of the detainee, of his or her clothing or of a thing in his or her possession. It may include:

                     (a)  requiring the detainee to remove some or all of his or her clothing; and

                     (b)  an examination of that clothing and of the detainee’s body (but not of the detainee’s body cavities).

             (3)  A strip search of a detainee may be conducted by an authorised officer only if:

                     (a)  an officer or detention officer suspects on reasonable grounds that there is hidden on the detainee, in his or her clothing or in a thing in his or her possession a weapon or other thing described in subclause (1); and

                     (b)  the officer, or detention officer, referred to in paragraph (a) suspects on reasonable grounds that it is necessary to conduct a strip search of the detainee to recover that weapon or other thing; and

                     (c)  the strip search is authorised as follows:

                              (i)  if the detainee is at least 18—the CEO, the Secretary of the Department, or an SES Band 3 employee in the Department (who is not the officer referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) nor the authorised officer conducting the strip search), authorises the strip search because he or she is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for those suspicions;

                             (ii)  if the detainee is at least 10 but under 18—a magistrate orders the strip search because he or she is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for those suspicions.

             (4)  An officer or detention officer may form a suspicion on reasonable grounds for the purposes of paragraph (3)(a) on the basis of:

                     (a)  a search conducted under clause 15 (whether by that officer or detention officer or by another officer or detention officer); or

                     (b)  a screening procedure conducted under clause 16 (whether by that officer or detention officer or by another officer or detention officer); or

                     (c)  any other information that is available to the officer or detention officer.

             (5)  An authorisation of a strip search given for the purposes of paragraph (3)(c):

                     (a)  may be given by telephone, fax or other electronic means; and

                     (b)  must be recorded in writing, and signed by the person giving the authorisation, within one business day after it is given.

             (6)  A record made under paragraph (5)(b) is not a legislative instrument.

             (7)  A failure to comply with paragraph (5)(b) does not affect the validity of a strip search conducted on the basis of that authorisation.

             (8)  The power to authorise a strip search under paragraph (3)(c) cannot be delegated to any other person.

             (9)  A power conferred on a magistrate by this clause is conferred on the magistrate in a personal capacity and not as a court or a member of a court.

           (10)  The magistrate need not accept the power conferred.

           (11)  A magistrate exercising a power under this clause has the same protection and immunity as if he or she were exercising that power as, or as a member of, the court of which the magistrate is a member.

           (12)  To avoid doubt, a strip search of a detainee may be conducted under this clause irrespective of whether a search of the detainee is conducted under clause 15 or a screening procedure is conducted in relation to the detainee under clause 16.

           (13)  In this clause:

                    <a name="busi-dai"></a>**_business day_** means a day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday in the place where the authorisation is given.

                    <a name="se-band-employe"></a>**_SES Band 3 employee_** means an SES employee with a classification of Senior Executive Band 3, and includes an SES employee who has been temporarily assigned duties that have been allocated a classification of Senior Executive Band 3.

Note:          This clause corresponds closely to section 252A of the _Migration Act 1958_.

             (1)  A strip search of a detainee under clause 17:

                     (a)  must not subject the detainee to greater indignity than is reasonably necessary to conduct the strip search; and

                     (b)  must be conducted in a private area; and

                     (c)  must be conducted by an authorised officer of the same sex as the detainee; and

                     (d)  subject to subclauses (2), (3) and (5), must not be conducted in the presence or view of a person who is of the opposite sex to the detainee; and

                     (e)  subject to subclauses (2), (3) and (5), must not be conducted in the presence or view of a person whose presence is not necessary for the purposes of the strip search; and

                      (f)  must not be conducted on a detainee who is under 10; and

                     (g)  if the detainee is at least 10 but under 18, or is incapable of managing his or her affairs—must be conducted in the presence of:

                              (i)  the detainee’s parent or guardian if that person is in detention with the detainee and is readily available at the same place; or

                             (ii)  if that is not acceptable to the detainee or subparagraph (i) does not apply—another person (other than an authorised officer) who is capable of representing the detainee’s interests and who, as far as is practicable in the circumstances, is acceptable to the detainee; and

                     (h)  subject to subclause (4), if the detainee is at least 18, and is not incapable of managing his or her affairs—must be conducted in the presence of another person (if any) nominated by the detainee, if that other person is readily available at the same place as the detainee, and willing to attend the strip search within a reasonable time; and

                      (i)  must not involve a search of the detainee’s body cavities; and

                      (j)  must not involve the removal of more items of clothing, or more visual inspection, than the authorised officer conducting the search believes on reasonable grounds to be necessary to determine whether there is hidden on the detainee, in his or her clothing or in a thing in his or her possession a weapon or other thing described in subclause 17(1); and

                     (k)  must not be conducted with greater force than is reasonably necessary to conduct the strip search.

             (2)  Paragraphs (1)(d) and (e) do not apply to a parent or guardian, or a person present because of subparagraph (1)(g)(ii), if the detainee has no objection to that person being present.

             (3)  Paragraphs (1)(d) and (e) do not apply to a person nominated by the detainee under paragraph (1)(h) to attend the strip search.

             (4)  Neither:

                     (a)  a detainee’s refusal or failure to nominate a person under paragraph (1)(h) within a reasonable time; nor

                     (b)  a detainee’s inability to nominate a person under that paragraph who is readily available at the same place as the detainee and willing to attend the strip search within a reasonable time;

prevents a strip search being conducted.

             (5)  A strip search of a detainee may be conducted with the assistance of another person if the authorised officer conducting the strip search considers that to be necessary for the purposes of conducting it. That person must not be of the opposite sex to the detainee unless:

                     (a)  the person is a medical practitioner; and

                     (b)  a medical practitioner of the same sex as the detainee is not available within a reasonable time.

             (6)  An action or proceeding, whether civil or criminal, does not lie against a person who, at the request of an authorised officer, assists in conducting a strip search if the person acts in good faith and does not contravene this clause.

             (7)  A detainee must be provided with adequate clothing if during or as a result of a strip search any of his or her clothing is:

                     (a)  damaged or destroyed; or

                     (b)  retained under clause 19.

Note:          This clause corresponds closely to section 252B of the _Migration Act 1958_.

### Division 4—Keeping of things found by screening or strip search of detainees

##### <a id="19"></a>19  Possession and retention of certain things obtained during a screening procedure or strip search

             (1)  An authorised officer may take possession of and retain a thing found in the course of conducting a screening procedure under clause 16 or conducting a strip search under clause 17 if the thing:

                     (a)  might provide evidence of the commission of an offence against this Act; or

                     (b)  is forfeited or forfeitable to the Commonwealth.

             (2)  A weapon or other thing described in subclause 16(1) or 17(1) that is found in the course of conducting a screening procedure under clause 16 or a strip search under clause 17 is forfeited to the Commonwealth.

             (3)  An authorised officer must not return a thing that is forfeited or forfeitable to the Commonwealth. Instead, the authorised officer must, as soon as practicable, give a thing that is forfeited under subclause (2) to a constable (within the meaning of the _Crimes Act 1914_).

Note:          Subdivision C of Division 6 of Part 6 of this Act sets out the procedure for dealing with things seized as being forfeited under section 106A.

             (4)  An authorised officer must take reasonable steps to return anything that is not forfeited or forfeitable but is retained under subclause (1) to the person from whom it was taken, or to the owner if that person is not entitled to possess it, if one of the following happens:

                     (a)  it is decided that the thing is not to be used in evidence;

                     (b)  the period of 60 days after the authorised officer takes possession of the thing ends.

             (5)  However, the authorised officer does not have to take those steps if:

                     (a)  in a paragraph (4)(b) case:

                              (i)  proceedings in respect of which the thing might provide evidence have been instituted before the end of the 60 day period and have not been completed (including an appeal to a court in relation to those proceedings); or

                             (ii)  the authorised officer may retain the thing because of an order under clause 21; or

                     (b)  in any case—the authorised officer is otherwise authorised (by a law, or an order of a court or a tribunal, of the Commonwealth or a State or Territory) to retain, destroy or dispose of the thing.

Note:          This clause corresponds closely to section 252C of the _Migration Act 1958_.

             (1)  This clause applies if an authorised officer has taken possession of a thing referred to in subclause 19(4) and proceedings in respect of which the thing might provide evidence have not commenced before the end of:

                     (a)  60 days after the authorised officer takes possession of the thing; or

                     (b)  a period previously specified in an order of a magistrate under clause 21.

             (2)  The authorised officer may apply to a magistrate for an order that the officer may retain the thing for a further period.

             (3)  Before making the application, the authorised officer must:

                     (a)  take reasonable steps to discover which persons’ interests would be affected by the retention of the thing; and

                     (b)  if it is practicable to do so, notify each person who the authorised officer believes to be such a person of the proposed application.

Note:          This clause corresponds closely to section 252D of the _Migration Act 1958_.

             (4)  A notice under paragraph (3)(b) is not a legislative instrument.

##### <a id="21"></a>21  Magistrate may order that thing be retained

             (1)  The magistrate may order that the authorised officer who made an application under clause 20 may retain the thing if the magistrate is satisfied that it is necessary for the authorised officer to do so:

                     (a)  for the purposes of an investigation as to whether an offence has been committed; or

                     (b)  to enable evidence of an offence to be secured for the purposes of a prosecution.

             (2)  The order must specify the period for which the authorised officer may retain the thing.

             (3)  A power conferred on a magistrate by this clause is conferred on the magistrate in a personal capacity and not as a court or a member of a court.

                     (a)  he or she is held in detention in a prison or remand centre of a State or Territory; and

                     (b)  a law of that State or Territory confers a power to search persons, or things in the possession of persons, serving sentences or being held in the prison or remand centre.

             (2)  To the extent that the State or Territory law confers that power, or affects the exercise of that power, it applies to the detainee as though it were a law of the Commonwealth.

             (3)  Clauses 16 and 17 do not apply to a detainee to whom this clause applies.

Note:          This clause corresponds closely to section 252F of the _Migration Act 1958_.

                     (a)  endanger the safety of the detainees, staff or other persons on the premises; or

                     (b)  disrupt the order or security arrangements on the premises;

             (4)  An authorised officer may request that the person do one or more of the following:

                     (a)  allow the authorised officer to inspect the things in the person’s possession;

                             (ii)  disrupt the order or security arrangements on the premises.

             (5)  A person who leaves a thing (including any of its contents) in a place specified by an authorised officer is entitled to its return when the person leaves the premises.

             (6)  However, if possession of the thing, or any of those contents, by the person is unlawful under a Commonwealth, State or Territory law applying to the premises:

                     (a)  the thing or the contents must not be returned to the person; and

                     (b)  an authorised officer must, as soon as practicable, give the thing or the contents to a constable (within the meaning of the _Crimes Act 1914_).

             (7)  A person who is about to enter premises where a detainee is detained may be refused entry if the person does not comply with a request under this clause.

Note:          This clause corresponds closely to section 252G of the _Migration Act 1958_.

             (2)  Before the Governor-General makes regulations for the purposes of paragraph (1)(g) prescribing an identifier, the Minister must be satisfied that:

                     (a)  obtaining the identifier would not involve the carrying out of an intimate forensic procedure within the meaning of section 23WA of the _Crimes Act 1914_; and

                     (b)  the identifier is an image of, or a measurement or recording of, an external part of the body; and

Note:          This clause corresponds closely to section 5A of the _Migration Act 1958_.

##### <a id="27"></a>27  Limiting the types of identification tests that authorised officers may carry out

             (1)  AFMA may, in an instrument authorising an officer or detention officer as an authorised officer for the purposes of carrying out identification tests under this Part, specify the types of identification tests that the authorised officer may carry out.

             (2)  Such an authorised officer is not an authorised officer in relation to carrying out an identification test that is not of a type so specified.

Note:          This clause corresponds closely to section 5D of the _Migration Act 1958_.

### Division 2—Identification of detainees

#### Subdivision A—Provision of personal identifiers

##### <a id="28"></a>28  Detainees must provide personal identifiers

             (1)  A non-citizen in detention must (other than in the prescribed circumstances) provide to an authorised officer one or more personal identifiers.

Note:          A person who is an Australian citizen, or is a non-citizen but an Australian resident, may be in detention but must be released as soon as an officer or detention officer knows or reasonably believes the person is an Australian citizen or resident.

             (2)  An authorised officer must not require, for the purposes of subclause (1), a detainee to provide a personal identifier other than any of the following (including any of the following in digital form):

                     (a)  fingerprints or handprints of the detainee (including those taken using paper and ink or digital livescanning technologies);

                     (b)  a measurement of the detainee’s height and weight;

                     (c)  a photograph or other image of the detainee’s face and shoulders;

                     (d)  the detainee’s signature;

                     (e)  any other personal identifier of a type prescribed for the purposes of this paragraph.

Note:          Division 3 sets out further restrictions on the personal identifiers that minors and incapable persons can be required to provide.

             (3)  The one or more personal identifiers are to be provided by way of one or more identification tests carried out by the authorised officer in accordance with this Division.

Note 1:       Subject to certain restrictions, clause 32 allows reasonable force to be used to carry out identification tests under this Division.

Note 2:       This clause corresponds closely to section 261AA of the _Migration Act 1958_.

##### <a id="29"></a>29  Authorised officers must require and carry out identification tests

             (1)  The authorised officer must, other than in the circumstances prescribed for the purposes of subclause 28(1):

                     (a)  require the non-citizen to provide one or more personal identifiers, of the type or types prescribed, by way of one or more identification tests carried out by the authorised officer; and

                     (b)  carry out the one or more identification tests on the non-citizen.

             (2)  However:

                     (a)  if the types of identification tests that the authorised officer may carry out is specified under clause 27—each identification test must be of a type so specified; and

                     (b)  each identification test must be carried out in accordance with Subdivision B; and

                     (c)  unless the authorised officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the non-citizen is not a minor or an incapable person—each identification test must be carried out in accordance with the additional requirements of Division 3.

Note:          Subclauses (1) and (2) correspond closely to section 261AB of the _Migration Act 1958_.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  the authorised officer is authorised because of clause 7 (which effectively treats as authorised officers for the purposes of certain provisions of this Schedule certain persons who are authorised officers for the purposes of certain provisions of the _Migration Act 1958_); and

                     (b)  an instrument under section 5D of that Act specifies the types of identification test the authorised officer may carry out;

paragraph (2)(a) of this clause has effect as if the specified types (except any specified under subclause 7(3) in relation to the authorised officer) had been specified under clause 27.

##### <a id="30"></a>30  Information to be provided before carrying out identification tests

             (1)  Before carrying out an identification test, the authorised officer must:

                     (a)  inform the non-citizen that the non-citizen may ask that an independent person be present while the identification test is carried out and that the test be carried out by a person of the same sex as the non-citizen; and

                     (b)  inform the non-citizen of such other matters as are specified in the regulations.

             (2)  For the purposes of subclause (1), the authorised officer **_informs_** the non-citizen of a matter if the authorised officer informs the non-citizen of the matter, through an interpreter if necessary, in a language (including sign language or braille) in which the non-citizen is able to communicate with reasonable fluency.

             (3)  The authorised officer may comply with this clause by giving to the non-citizen, in accordance with the regulations, a form setting out the information specified in the regulations. However, the information must be in a language (including braille) in which the non-citizen is able to communicate with reasonable fluency.

Note:          This clause corresponds closely to section 261AC of the _Migration Act 1958_.

             (4)  A form mentioned in subclause (3) is not a legislative instrument.

#### Subdivision B—How identification tests are carried out

##### <a id="31"></a>31  General rules for carrying out identification tests

                   An identification test under this Division:

                     (a)  must be carried out in circumstances affording reasonable privacy to the non-citizen; and

                     (b)  if the non-citizen so requests and it is practicable to comply with the request—must not be carried out in the presence or view of a person who is of the opposite sex to the non-citizen; and

                     (c)  must not be carried out in the presence or view of a person whose presence is not necessary for the purposes of the identification test or is not required or permitted by another provision of this Act; and

                     (d)  must not involve the removal of more clothing than is necessary for carrying out the test; and

                     (e)  must not involve more visual inspection than is necessary for carrying out the test; and

                      (f)  if the test is one of 2 or more identification tests to be carried out on the non-citizen—must be carried out at the same time as the other identification tests, if it is practicable to do so.

Note:          This clause corresponds closely to section 261AD of the _Migration Act 1958_.

##### <a id="32"></a>32  Use of force in carrying out identification tests

When use of force is permitted

             (1)  Subject to subclause (2) and clause 33, an authorised officer, or a person authorised under clause 34 to help the authorised officer, may use reasonable force:

                     (a)  to enable the identification test to be carried out; or

                     (b)  to prevent the loss, destruction or contamination of any personal identifier or any meaningful identifier derived from the personal identifier.

However, this clause does not authorise the use of force against a minor or an incapable person, or if the personal identifier in question is a person’s signature.

             (2)  The authorised officer or person must not use force unless:

                     (a)  the non-citizen required to provide the personal identifier in question has refused to allow the identification test to be carried out; and

                     (b)  all reasonable measures to carry out the identification test without the use of force have been exhausted; and

                     (c)  use of force in carrying out the identification test is authorised under subclause (4).

Applications for authorisation to use force

             (3)  An authorised officer may apply to a senior authorising officer (who is not an authorised officer referred to in subclause (1)) for an authorisation to use force in carrying out the identification test.

Authorisation to use force

             (4)  The senior authorising officer may authorise the use of force in carrying out the identification test if he or she is reasonably satisfied that:

                     (a)  the non-citizen required to provide the personal identifier in question has refused to allow the identification test to be carried out; and

                     (b)  all reasonable measures to carry out the identification test without the use of force have been exhausted.

             (5)  An authorisation under subclause (4):

                     (a)  may be given by telephone, fax or other electronic means; and

                     (b)  must be recorded in writing, and signed by the person giving the authorisation, within one business day after it is given.

             (6)  A record made under paragraph (5)(b) is not a legislative instrument.

             (7)  A failure to comply with paragraph (5)(b) does not affect the validity of an identification test carried out on the basis of that authorisation.

             (8)  The power to give an authorisation under subclause (4) cannot be delegated to any other person.

Definition

             (9)  In this clause:

                    <a name="senior-authorising-offic"></a>**_senior authorising officer_** means an officer, or detention officer, whom AFMA has authorised, or who is included in a class of officers or detention officers whom AFMA has authorised, to perform the functions of a senior authorising officer under this clause.

Note:          This clause corresponds closely to section 261AE of the _Migration Act 1958_.

##### <a id="33"></a>33  Identification tests not to be carried out in cruel, inhuman or degrading manner etc.

                   For the purposes of this Act, the carrying out of the identification test is not of itself taken:

                     (a)  to be cruel, inhuman or degrading; or

                     (b)  to be a failure to treat a person with humanity and with respect for human dignity.

However, nothing in this Act authorises the carrying out of the identification test in a cruel, inhuman or degrading manner, or in a manner that fails to treat a person with humanity and with respect for human dignity.

Note:          This clause corresponds closely to section 261AF of the _Migration Act 1958_.

##### <a id="34"></a>34  Authorised officer may get help to carry out identification tests

                   An authorised officer may ask another authorised officer or an officer or detention officer to help him or her to carry out the identification test, and the other person may give that help.

Note:          This clause corresponds closely to section 261AG of the _Migration Act 1958_.

##### <a id="35"></a>35  Identification tests to be carried out by authorised officer of same sex as non-citizen

                   If the non-citizen requests that the identification test be carried out by an authorised officer of the same sex as the non-citizen, the test must only be carried out by an authorised officer of the same sex as the non-citizen.

Note:          This clause corresponds closely to section 261AH of the _Migration Act 1958_.

##### <a id="36"></a>36  Independent person to be present

                   The identification test must be carried out in the presence of an independent person if:

                     (a)  force is used in carrying out the identification test; or

                     (b)  both of the following apply:

                              (i)  the non-citizen requests that an independent person be present while the identification test is being carried out;

                             (ii)  an independent person is readily available at the same place as the non-citizen and is willing to attend the test within a reasonable time.

Note:          This clause corresponds closely to section 261AI of the _Migration Act 1958_.

##### <a id="37"></a>37  Recording of identification tests

             (1)  An authorised officer may video record the carrying out of the identification test.

             (2)  If the carrying out of the identification test is not video recorded, the authorised officer may decide that the identification test must be carried out in the presence of an independent person.

Note:          This clause corresponds closely to section 261AJ of the _Migration Act 1958_.

##### <a id="38"></a>38  Retesting

When retesting is permitted

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  an authorised officer has carried out an identification test (the **_earlier test_**) on a non-citizen in accordance with this Division (including a test authorised under subclause (4)); and

                     (b)  either:

                              (i)  a personal identifier that is provided as a result of the earlier test being carried out is unusable; or

                             (ii)  an authorised officer, officer or detention officer is not satisfied about the integrity of that personal identifier;

the authorised officer who carried out the earlier test or another authorised officer may require the non-citizen to provide the personal identifier again, and may carry out the test again in accordance with this Division, if:

                     (c)  the requirement is made while the earlier test is being carried out or immediately after it was carried out; or

                     (d)  carrying out the test again is authorised under subclause (4).

             (2)  If the non-citizen is required under subclause (1) to provide the personal identifier again, the non-citizen is taken, for the purposes of this Division, not to have provided the personal identifier as a result of the earlier test being carried out.

Applications for authorisation to retest

             (3)  An authorised officer may apply for an authorisation to carry out the test again. The application is to be made to:

                     (a)  if the earlier test was not a test authorised under subclause (4)—a senior authorising officer (who is not an authorised officer, officer or detention officer referred to in subclause (1)); or

                     (b)  if the earlier test was a test authorised under subclause (4) by a senior authorising officer—the CEO, the Secretary of the Department or an SES Band 3 employee in the Department (who is not an authorised officer, officer or detention officer referred to in subclause (1)).

Authorisation to retest

             (4)  The senior authorising officer, CEO, Secretary or SES Band 3 employee (as the case requires) may authorise the test to be carried out again if:

                     (a)  he or she is reasonably satisfied that the personal identifier that is provided as a result of the earlier test being carried out is unusable; or

                     (b)  he or she is not reasonably satisfied about the integrity of that personal identifier.

             (5)  An authorisation under subclause (4):

                     (a)  may be given by telephone, fax or other electronic means; and

                     (b)  must be recorded in writing, and signed by the person giving the authorisation, within one business day after it is given.

             (6)  A record made under paragraph (5)(b) is not a legislative instrument.

             (7)  A failure to comply with paragraph (5)(b) does not affect the validity of an identification test carried out on the basis of that authorisation.

             (8)  The power to give an authorisation under subclause (4) cannot be delegated to any other person.

Use of force

             (9)  An authorisation under subclause (4) does not authorise the use of force in carrying out an identification test.

Note:          See clause 32 on the use of force in carrying out identification tests.

Effect of refusing to authorise retesting

           (10)  If an application for an authorisation to carry out an identification test again on a non-citizen is refused, the non-citizen is taken, for the purposes of this Act, to have complied with any requirement under this Act to provide the personal identifier in question.
