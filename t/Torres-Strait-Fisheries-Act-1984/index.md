                     (b)  in any other case—produce, for inspection by the person in charge of the vehicle, the officer’s identity card;

and, if the officer fails to do so, the officer is not authorised to enter and search, or to detain, the vehicle.

          (2B)  Where an officer (other than a prescribed person who is in uniform) makes a requirement of a person (in this subsection referred to as the **_relevant person_**) under subsection (1), the officer shall:

                     (a)  in the case of a prescribed person—produce, for inspection by the relevant person, written evidence of the fact that the officer is a prescribed person; or

                     (b)  in any other case—produce, for inspection by the relevant person, the officer’s identity card;

and, if the officer fails to do so, the relevant person is not obliged to comply with the requirement.

             (3)  Subject to subsection (4), the powers of an officer under paragraph (1)(ba) in respect of any vehicle or aircraft  must not be exercised without either:

                             (ii)  that the delay that would occur if an application for a warrant were made (either in person or under section 43P) would frustrate the effective execution of the warrant;

those powers may be exercised without a warrant but, if that is done, the officer must:

                     (c)  if it is practicable to do so, notify the owner or person in charge of a vehicle or aircraft that the officer will be exercising powers under paragraph (1)(ba) without a warrant and that the reasons for the exercise of those powers may be requested; and

                     (b)  be in the form approved by the Minister.

##### <a id="42AB"></a>42AB  Offence for failure to return identity card

             (1)  A person commits an offence if:

                     (a)  the person has been issued with an identity card under section 42AA; and

             (2)  An offence under subsection (1) is an offence of strict liability.

Note:          For **_strict liability_**, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

##### <a id="42A"></a>42A  Searches under paragraph 42(1)(aa)

             (1)  A search under paragraph 42(1)(aa) of a person (the **_subject_**) may only be conducted by an officer of the same sex as the subject.

             (2)  However, if an officer of the same sex as the subject is not available to conduct the search, it may be conducted by another person who:

                     (a)  is of the same sex as the subject; and

                     (b)  agrees, at the request of an officer, to conduct the search.

             (3)  Paragraph 42(1)(aa) and this section do not authorise the officer or other person:

                     (a)  to remove any of the subject’s clothing; or

                     (b)  to require the subject to remove any of his or her clothing; or

                     (a)  take possession of the weapon or thing; and

                     (b)  the subject is detained under Schedule 2;

the officer may continue to keep the weapon or thing for such time as he or she thinks necessary for the purposes of this Act or the _Migration Act 1958_.

Note:          Once the subject ceases to be detained under this Act, the subject will generally need to be detained under the _Migration Act 1958_ while he or she is in the migration zone (because his or her enforcement visa under that Act will cease to have effect). Subsection (6) ensures the officer can keep the weapon or thing while the subject is detained under this Act or that Act.

### Division 1A—Search warrants

##### <a id="43C"></a>43C  When search warrants can be issued

             (2)  If a magistrate issues a warrant, the magistrate is to set out in the warrant:

                     (a)  the offence to which the warrant relates; and

                     (b)  a description of the premises to which the warrant relates; and

                     (e)  the period for which the warrant remains in force, which must not be more than 7 days; and

                      (f)  whether the warrant may be executed at any time or only during particular hours.

             (3)  The magistrate is also to state that the warrant authorises the seizure of a thing (other than evidential material of the kind referred to in paragraph (2)(c)) found at the premises in the course of the search that the executing officer or a person helping believes on reasonable grounds to be:

                     (a)  evidential material in relation to an offence to which the warrant relates; or

                     (b)  a thing relevant to another offence against this Act or the regulations that is an indictable offence;

if the executing officer or a person helping believes on reasonable grounds that seizure of the thing is necessary to prevent its concealment, loss or destruction or its use in committing an offence against this Act or the regulations.

             (4)  Paragraph (2)(e) does not prevent the issue of successive warrants in relation to the same premises.

             (5)  If the application for the warrant is made under section 43P, this section applies as if:

                     (a)  subsection (1) referred to 48 hours rather than 72 hours; and

                     (d)  to seize other things found at the premises in the course of the search that the executing officer or a person helping believes on reasonable grounds to be:

                              (i)  evidential material in relation to an offence to which the warrant relates; or

                             (ii)  evidential material in relation to another offence against this Act or the regulations that is an indictable offence;

if the executing officer or a person helping believes on reasonable grounds that seizure of the things is necessary to prevent their concealment, loss or destruction or their use in committing an offence against this Act or the regulations.

             (2)  If the warrant states that it may be executed only during particular hours, the warrant must not be executed outside those hours.

             (3)  If things are seized under a warrant, the warrant authorises the executing officer to make the things available to officers of other agencies if it is necessary to do so for the purpose of investigating or prosecuting an offence to which the things relate.

##### <a id="43E"></a>43E  Availability of assistance and use of force in executing a warrant

             (3)  The copy of the warrant referred to in subsection (1) need not include the signature of the magistrate or the seal of the relevant court.

                     (b)  the occupier of the premises consents in writing;

                     (a)  seize the equipment and any disk, tape or other associated device; or

                     (b)  if the material can, by using facilities at the premises, be put in documentary form—operate the facilities to put the material in that form and seize the documentation so produced; or

                     (c)  if the material can be transferred to a disk, tape or other storage device that:

                              (i)  is brought to the premises; or

                             (ii)  is at the premises and the use of which for the purpose has been agreed to in writing by the occupier of the premises;

operate the equipment or other facilities to copy the material to the storage device and take the storage device from the premises.

             (3)  A person may seize equipment under paragraph (2)(a) only if:

                     (a)  it is not practicable to put the material in documentary form as mentioned in paragraph (2)(b) or to copy the material as mentioned in paragraph (2)(c); or

                     (b)  possession by the occupier of the equipment could constitute an offence against this Act or the regulations.

             (4)  If the executing officer or a person helping believes on reasonable grounds that:

                     (a)  evidential material may be accessible by operating electronic equipment at the premises; and

                     (b)  expert assistance is required to operate the equipment; and

                     (c)  if he or she does not take action under this subsection, the material may be destroyed, altered or otherwise interfered with;

             (6)  The equipment may be secured until:

                     (a)  the end of a period of not more than 24 hours; or

                     (b)  the equipment has been operated by the expert;

whichever happens first.

             (7)  If the executing officer or a person helping believes on reasonable grounds that the expert assistance will not be available within 24 hours, he or she may apply to the magistrate for an extension of that period.

             (8)  The executing officer or a person helping must give notice to the occupier of the premises of his or her intention to apply for an extension, and the occupier is entitled to be heard in relation to the application.

                             (ii)  the data recorded on the equipment is damaged; or

                            (iii)  programs associated with the use of the equipment, or with the use of the data, are damaged or corrupted; and

                     (b)  the damage or corruption occurs because:

                              (i)  insufficient care was exercised in selecting the person who was to operate the equipment; or

                             (ii)  insufficient care was exercised by the person operating the equipment.

             (2)  The Commonwealth must pay the owner of the equipment, or the user of the data or programs, such reasonable compensation for the damage or corruption as the Commonwealth and the owner or user agree on.

             (3)  However, if the owner or user and the Commonwealth fail to agree, the owner or user may institute proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia for such reasonable amount of compensation as the Court determines.

             (4)  In determining the amount of compensation payable, regard is to be had to whether the occupier of the premises, or the occupier’s employees or agents, if they were available at the time, provided any appropriate warning or guidance on the operation of the equipment.

             (5)  Compensation is payable out of money appropriated by the Parliament.

             (6)  For the purposes of subsection (1):

                    <a name="damag"></a>**_damage_**, in relation to data, includes damage by erasure of data or addition of other data.

                     (b)  a storage device the information in which can be readily copied;

the person must, if requested to do so by the occupier of the premises or by another person who apparently represents the occupier and is present when the warrant is executed, give a copy of the thing or the information to the person who made the request as soon as practicable after the seizure.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply if:

                     (a)  the thing that has been seized was seized under paragraph 43J(2)(b) or (c); or

                     (b)  possession by the occupier of the document, film, computer file, thing or information could constitute an offence.

##### <a id="43M"></a>43M  Occupier entitled to be present during search

             (1)  If a warrant is being executed and the occupier of the premises or another person who apparently represents the occupier is present at the premises, the person is, subject to Part IC of the _Crimes Act 1914_, entitled to observe the search being conducted.

             (2)  The right to observe the search being conducted ceases if the person impedes the search.

             (3)  This section does not prevent 2 or more areas of the premises being searched at the same time.

##### <a id="43N"></a>43N  Receipts for things seized under warrant

             (1)  An officer may make an application to a magistrate for a warrant by telephone, telex, fax or other electronic means:

                     (a)  in an urgent case; or

                     (b)  if the delay that would occur if an application were made in person would frustrate the effective execution of the warrant.

             (2)  The magistrate may require communication by voice to the extent that is practicable in the circumstances.

             (3)  An application under this section must include all information required to be provided in an ordinary application for a warrant, but the application may, if necessary, be made before the information is sworn.

             (4)  If an application is made to a magistrate under this section and the magistrate, after considering the information and having received and considered such further information (if any) as the magistrate required, is satisfied that:

                     (a)  a warrant in the terms of the application should be issued urgently; or

                     (b)  the delay that would occur if an application were made in person would frustrate the effective execution of the warrant;

the magistrate may complete and sign the same form of warrant as would be issued under section 43C.

             (5)  If the magistrate decides to issue the warrant, the magistrate is to tell the applicant, by telephone, telex, fax or other electronic means, of the terms of the warrant and the day on which and the time at which it was signed.

             (6)  The applicant must then complete a form of warrant in terms substantially corresponding to those given to the magistrate, stating on the form the magistrate’s name and the day on which and the time at which the warrant was signed.

             (7)  The applicant must, not later than the day after the day of expiry of the warrant or the day after the day on which the warrant was executed, whichever is the earlier, give or send to the magistrate the form of warrant completed by the applicant and, if the information referred to in subsection (3) was not sworn, that information duly sworn.

             (8)  The magistrate is to attach to the documents provided under subsection (7) the form of warrant completed by the magistrate.

             (9)  If:

                     (a)  it is material, in any proceedings, for a court to be satisfied that the exercise of a power under a warrant issued under this section was duly authorised; and

                     (b)  the form of warrant signed by the magistrate is not produced in evidence;

the court is to assume, unless the contrary is proved, that the exercise of the power was not duly authorised.

                              (i)  in a case to which sub-subparagraph (b)(ii)(A) applies—if a licence under this Act had been in force at that time authorising the use of the boat for taking fish of that kind in that area in the course of commercial fishing, the licence would have been a leviable licence; or
