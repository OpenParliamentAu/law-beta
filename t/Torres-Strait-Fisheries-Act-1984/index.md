                     (b)  in any other case—produce, for inspection by the person in charge of the vehicle, the officer’s identity card;

and, if the officer fails to do so, the officer is not authorised to enter and search, or to detain, the vehicle.

          (2B)  Where an officer (other than a prescribed person who is in uniform) makes a requirement of a person (in this subsection referred to as the **_relevant person_**) under subsection (1), the officer shall:

                     (a)  in the case of a prescribed person—produce, for inspection by the relevant person, written evidence of the fact that the officer is a prescribed person; or

                     (b)  in any other case—produce, for inspection by the relevant person, the officer’s identity card;

and, if the officer fails to do so, the relevant person is not obliged to comply with the requirement.

             (3)  Subject to subsection (4), the powers of an officer under paragraph (1)(ba) in respect of any vehicle or aircraft  must not be exercised without either:

                             (ii)  that the delay that would occur if an application for a warrant were made (either in person or under section 43P) would frustrate the effective execution of the warrant;

those powers may be exercised without a warrant but, if that is done, the officer must:

                     (c)  if it is practicable to do so, notify the owner or person in charge of a vehicle or aircraft that the officer will be exercising powers under paragraph (1)(ba) without a warrant and that the reasons for the exercise of those powers may be requested; and

                     (b)  be in the form approved by the Minister.

##### <a id="42AB"></a>42AB  Offence for failure to return identity card

             (1)  A person commits an offence if:

                     (a)  the person has been issued with an identity card under section 42AA; and

             (2)  An offence under subsection (1) is an offence of strict liability.

Note:          For **_strict liability_**, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

##### <a id="42A"></a>42A  Searches under paragraph 42(1)(aa)

             (1)  A search under paragraph 42(1)(aa) of a person (the **_subject_**) may only be conducted by an officer of the same sex as the subject.

             (2)  However, if an officer of the same sex as the subject is not available to conduct the search, it may be conducted by another person who:

                     (a)  is of the same sex as the subject; and

                     (b)  agrees, at the request of an officer, to conduct the search.

             (3)  Paragraph 42(1)(aa) and this section do not authorise the officer or other person:

                     (a)  to remove any of the subject’s clothing; or

                     (b)  to require the subject to remove any of his or her clothing; or

                     (a)  take possession of the weapon or thing; and

                     (b)  the subject is detained under Schedule 2;

the officer may continue to keep the weapon or thing for such time as he or she thinks necessary for the purposes of this Act or the _Migration Act 1958_.

Note:          Once the subject ceases to be detained under this Act, the subject will generally need to be detained under the _Migration Act 1958_ while he or she is in the migration zone (because his or her enforcement visa under that Act will cease to have effect). Subsection (6) ensures the officer can keep the weapon or thing while the subject is detained under this Act or that Act.

### Division 1A—Search warrants

##### <a id="43C"></a>43C  When search warrants can be issued

             (2)  If a magistrate issues a warrant, the magistrate is to set out in the warrant:

                     (a)  the offence to which the warrant relates; and

                     (b)  a description of the premises to which the warrant relates; and

                     (e)  the period for which the warrant remains in force, which must not be more than 7 days; and

                      (f)  whether the warrant may be executed at any time or only during particular hours.

             (3)  The magistrate is also to state that the warrant authorises the seizure of a thing (other than evidential material of the kind referred to in paragraph (2)(c)) found at the premises in the course of the search that the executing officer or a person helping believes on reasonable grounds to be:

                     (a)  evidential material in relation to an offence to which the warrant relates; or

                     (b)  a thing relevant to another offence against this Act or the regulations that is an indictable offence;

if the executing officer or a person helping believes on reasonable grounds that seizure of the thing is necessary to prevent its concealment, loss or destruction or its use in committing an offence against this Act or the regulations.

             (4)  Paragraph (2)(e) does not prevent the issue of successive warrants in relation to the same premises.

             (5)  If the application for the warrant is made under section 43P, this section applies as if:

                     (a)  subsection (1) referred to 48 hours rather than 72 hours; and

                     (d)  to seize other things found at the premises in the course of the search that the executing officer or a person helping believes on reasonable grounds to be:

                              (i)  evidential material in relation to an offence to which the warrant relates; or

                             (ii)  evidential material in relation to another offence against this Act or the regulations that is an indictable offence;

if the executing officer or a person helping believes on reasonable grounds that seizure of the things is necessary to prevent their concealment, loss or destruction or their use in committing an offence against this Act or the regulations.

             (2)  If the warrant states that it may be executed only during particular hours, the warrant must not be executed outside those hours.

             (3)  If things are seized under a warrant, the warrant authorises the executing officer to make the things available to officers of other agencies if it is necessary to do so for the purpose of investigating or prosecuting an offence to which the things relate.

##### <a id="43E"></a>43E  Availability of assistance and use of force in executing a warrant

             (3)  The copy of the warrant referred to in subsection (1) need not include the signature of the magistrate or the seal of the relevant court.

                     (b)  the occupier of the premises consents in writing;

                     (a)  seize the equipment and any disk, tape or other associated device; or

                     (b)  if the material can, by using facilities at the premises, be put in documentary form—operate the facilities to put the material in that form and seize the documentation so produced; or

                     (c)  if the material can be transferred to a disk, tape or other storage device that:

                              (i)  is brought to the premises; or

                             (ii)  is at the premises and the use of which for the purpose has been agreed to in writing by the occupier of the premises;

operate the equipment or other facilities to copy the material to the storage device and take the storage device from the premises.

             (8)  The executing officer or a person helping must give notice to the occupier of the premises of his or her intention to apply for an extension, and the occupier is entitled to be heard in relation to the application.

                             (ii)  the data recorded on the equipment is damaged; or

                            (iii)  programs associated with the use of the equipment, or with the use of the data, are damaged or corrupted; and

             (2)  The Commonwealth must pay the owner of the equipment, or the user of the data or programs, such reasonable compensation for the damage or corruption as the Commonwealth and the owner or user agree on.

             (3)  However, if the owner or user and the Commonwealth fail to agree, the owner or user may institute proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia for such reasonable amount of compensation as the Court determines.

             (4)  In determining the amount of compensation payable, regard is to be had to whether the occupier of the premises, or the occupier’s employees or agents, if they were available at the time, provided any appropriate warning or guidance on the operation of the equipment.

             (5)  Compensation is payable out of money appropriated by the Parliament.

             (6)  For the purposes of subsection (1):

                    <a name="damag"></a>**_damage_**, in relation to data, includes damage by erasure of data or addition of other data.

the person must, if requested to do so by the occupier of the premises or by another person who apparently represents the occupier and is present when the warrant is executed, give a copy of the thing or the information to the person who made the request as soon as practicable after the seizure.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply if:

             (2)  The right to observe the search being conducted ceases if the person impedes the search.

             (3)  This section does not prevent 2 or more areas of the premises being searched at the same time.

##### <a id="43N"></a>43N  Receipts for things seized under warrant

             (1)  An officer may make an application to a magistrate for a warrant by telephone, telex, fax or other electronic means:

                     (a)  in an urgent case; or

                     (b)  if the delay that would occur if an application were made in person would frustrate the effective execution of the warrant.

             (2)  The magistrate may require communication by voice to the extent that is practicable in the circumstances.

             (3)  An application under this section must include all information required to be provided in an ordinary application for a warrant, but the application may, if necessary, be made before the information is sworn.

             (4)  If an application is made to a magistrate under this section and the magistrate, after considering the information and having received and considered such further information (if any) as the magistrate required, is satisfied that:

                     (a)  a warrant in the terms of the application should be issued urgently; or

                     (b)  the delay that would occur if an application were made in person would frustrate the effective execution of the warrant;

the magistrate may complete and sign the same form of warrant as would be issued under section 43C.

             (5)  If the magistrate decides to issue the warrant, the magistrate is to tell the applicant, by telephone, telex, fax or other electronic means, of the terms of the warrant and the day on which and the time at which it was signed.

             (6)  The applicant must then complete a form of warrant in terms substantially corresponding to those given to the magistrate, stating on the form the magistrate’s name and the day on which and the time at which the warrant was signed.

             (7)  The applicant must, not later than the day after the day of expiry of the warrant or the day after the day on which the warrant was executed, whichever is the earlier, give or send to the magistrate the form of warrant completed by the applicant and, if the information referred to in subsection (3) was not sworn, that information duly sworn.

             (8)  The magistrate is to attach to the documents provided under subsection (7) the form of warrant completed by the magistrate.

             (9)  If:

                     (a)  it is material, in any proceedings, for a court to be satisfied that the exercise of a power under a warrant issued under this section was duly authorised; and

                     (b)  the form of warrant signed by the magistrate is not produced in evidence;

the court is to assume, unless the contrary is proved, that the exercise of the power was not duly authorised.

                     (b)  a boat that was, at the time of the commission of the offence, being used in the course of traditional fishing or community fishing.

##### <a id="52AAA"></a>52AAA  Forfeiture of additional things on forfeited boats

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a court orders a boat to be forfeited under section 52 because it was used in the commission of an offence (the **_relevant offence_**); and

                     (b)  at the time the court makes the order, there are nets, traps, equipment or fish (the **_additional things_**) on the boat that the court cannot order to be forfeited under section 52.

Forfeiture within 2 years

             (2)  If the order for the boat to be forfeited is made within 2 years after the commission of the relevant offence, the court may order the forfeiture of the additional things.

Things owned by the person who owned the boat

             (3)  If the additional things are owned by the person who owned the boat immediately before the relevant offence was committed, the court may order the forfeiture of the additional things.

             (4)  For the purposes of subsection (3), the additional things are taken, unless the contrary is proved, to be owned by the person who owned the boat immediately before the relevant offence was committed.

Things owned by persons who commit offences

##### <a id="52AAC"></a>52AAC  Rights and interests of the Commonwealth not limited

                   To avoid doubt, a provision of this Subdivision giving the Commonwealth rights or interests in relation to property does not limit any other right or interest the Commonwealth has or acquires otherwise than under this Subdivision.

#### Subdivision B—Automatic forfeiture of things

             (1)  The following things are forfeited to the Commonwealth:

anything on, in or attached to the boat that forms part of the boat is also the property of the Commonwealth.

##### <a id="52AE"></a>52AE  Rights and interests of the Commonwealth not limited

#### Subdivision C—Dealing with things seized

##### <a id="52B"></a>52B  Application of this Subdivision

                   This Subdivision sets out rules about the following:

                     (a)  a thing that an officer seizes under paragraph 42(1)(ea) or (eb):

                              (i)  because the thing is forfeited under Subdivision B; or

                             (ii)  because the officer has reasonable grounds to believe the thing is forfeited under Subdivision B;

                     (b)  a thing that an officer seizes under paragraph 42(1)(ec) or (ed):

                              (i)  because the thing is the property of the Commonwealth because of the operation of Subdivision BA; or

                             (ii)  because the officer has reasonable grounds to believe the thing is the property of the Commonwealth because of the operation of Subdivision BA.

##### <a id="52C"></a>52C  Notice of seizure

Giving notice

             (1)  The officer must give written notice of the seizure of the thing:

                     (a)  if the thing is, or was on, a boat, or was used in connection with a boat:

                              (i)  to the person who was the master of the boat immediately before the seizure; or

                             (ii)  to the person whom the officer has reasonable grounds to believe was the master of the boat immediately before the seizure; or

                     (b)  in a case not covered by paragraph (a):

                              (i)  to the owner of the thing; or

                             (ii)  to the person who had possession, custody or control of the thing immediately before it was seized.

          (1A)  However, if the officer cannot conveniently give the notice to the person in person, the officer may give written notice of the seizure of the thing by fixing the notice to a prominent part of the thing, unless the thing is a fish.

Content of notice

             (2)  The notice must:

                     (a)  identify the thing; and

                     (b)  state that the thing has been seized; and

                     (c)  state that the thing will be condemned as forfeited unless the owner of the thing or the person who had possession, custody or control of the thing immediately before it was seized gives the CEO within 30 days a written claim in English for the thing; and

                     (d)  specify the address of the CEO.

Note:          Section 52E condemns the thing if it is not claimed within 30 days. Section 52G condemns the thing if it is claimed but the claimant does not get a court order supporting the claim.

Status of notice

             (3)  A notice under subsection (1) is not a legislative instrument.

##### <a id="52D"></a>52D  Dealing with thing before it is condemned

             (1)  On behalf of the Commonwealth, AFMA may cause the thing to be disposed of or destroyed if it is a boat and AFMA is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the boat is unseaworthy; or

                     (b)  the boat poses a serious risk to safety, public health or quarantine; or

                     (c)  the boat poses a serious risk of damage to other property or the environment; or

                     (d)  the expenses of custody and maintenance of the boat between its seizure and condemnation are likely to be greater than its value.

             (2)  If AFMA causes the boat to be disposed of, it may cause the disposal to be made subject to specified conditions.

             (3)  The table lists some other provisions relevant to dealing with things before they are condemned as forfeited to the Commonwealth:

##### <a id="52E"></a>52E  Thing condemned if not claimed in time

             (1)  By force of this subsection, the thing is condemned as forfeited to the Commonwealth 30 days after notice of seizure of the thing has been given under section 52C, unless:

                     (a)  within the 30 days the owner of the thing or the person who had possession, custody or control of it immediately before it was seized gives the CEO a written claim for the thing; and

                     (b)  the claim is in English; and

                     (c)  the claim sets out an address for service on the person making the claim.

Note:          Section 52H requires things condemned as forfeited to be dealt with in accordance with the Minister’s directions.

             (2)  A person may claim the thing even if it is disposed of or destroyed before or after the claim.

##### <a id="52F"></a>52F  Dealing with claim for thing

             (1)  If the thing is claimed as described in section 52E:

                     (a)  an officer may retain possession of the thing without starting any proceedings for the condemnation of the goods; and

                     (b)  the CEO may give the claimant a written notice stating that the thing will be condemned if the claimant does not institute proceedings against the Commonwealth within 2 months:

                              (i)  to recover the thing; or

                             (ii)  for a declaration that the thing is not forfeited.

Note 1:       An officer may retain possession even if the CEO does not give notice. If so, the claimant will be able to recover the thing only if it is released under section 52I or a court orders its release to the claimant.

Note 2:       If the CEO does give the notice and the claimant institutes proceedings, whether the claimant recovers the thing will depend on the outcome of the proceedings.

             (2)  The CEO may give the notice to the claimant by posting it prepaid as a letter to the last address of the claimant that is known to the CEO. If the CEO does so, the letter is taken to be properly addressed for the purposes of section 29 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not limit the ways in which the notice may be given.

Note:          Sections 28A and 29 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ explain how a notice can be given, and when it is taken to be given.

             (4)  To avoid doubt, the CEO may give the notice even if the thing has been released under section 52I.

             (5)  A notice under paragraph (1)(b) is not a legislative instrument.

##### <a id="52G"></a>52G  Condemnation of thing if it is claimed

Application

             (1)  This section applies if the CEO gives the claimant a notice under section 52F about instituting proceedings:

                     (a)  to recover the thing; or

                     (b)  for a declaration that the thing is not forfeited.

Condemnation if proceedings not started within 2 months

             (2)  By force of this subsection, the thing is condemned as forfeited to the Commonwealth 2 months after the notice is given if the claimant does not institute the proceedings within that period.

Condemnation at end of proceedings started within 2 months

             (3)  By force of this subsection, the thing is condemned as forfeited to the Commonwealth at the end of the proceedings that are instituted by the claimant against the Commonwealth within 2 months of the claimant being given the notice if, at the end of the proceedings, there is not:

                     (a)  an order for the claimant to recover the thing; or

                     (b)  an order for the Commonwealth to pay the claimant the proceeds of the sale of the thing if it has been sold before the end of the proceedings; or

                     (c)  an order for the Commonwealth to pay the claimant the market value of the thing at the time it was disposed of (except by sale) or destroyed, if it has been disposed of (except by sale) or destroyed before the end of the proceedings; or

                     (d)  a declaration that the thing is not forfeited.

End of proceedings that go to judgment

             (4)  For the purposes of subsection (3), if the proceedings go to judgment, they end:

                     (a)  at the end of the period for lodging an appeal against the judgment, if no appeal is lodged within that period; or

                     (b)  when the appeal lapses or is finally determined, if an appeal is lodged against the judgment within that period.

Proceedings relating to thing that has been disposed of

             (5)  Proceedings relating to the thing may be instituted or continued even if it is disposed of or destroyed.

Order for payment if thing has been disposed of or destroyed

             (6)  If the court hearing the proceedings decides that it would have ordered that the thing be delivered to a person apart from the fact that the thing had been disposed of or destroyed, the court must order the Commonwealth to pay the person an amount equal to:

                     (a)  the proceeds of the sale of the thing, if it has been sold before the end of the proceedings; or

                     (b)  the market value of the thing at the time it was disposed of (except by sale) or destroyed, if it has been disposed of (except by sale) or destroyed before the end of the proceedings.

##### <a id="52H"></a>52H  Dealing with thing after it is condemned

                     (a)  to recover a thing forfeited under Subdivision B; or

if a person has been convicted of an offence mentioned in paragraph 52A(1)(a), the person is taken, unless the contrary is proved, to have committed the offence.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to a conviction:

                     (a)  in respect of which a review or appeal (however described) has been instituted but not finally determined; or

                     (b)  that has been quashed or set aside; or

### Division 4—Dealing with property that has been seized etc.

##### <a id="52I"></a>52I  Release of property that has been seized etc.

             (1)  If any property is under the control of an officer because of the exercise by an officer of powers under section 42, AFMA may direct that the property be released:

                     (a)  in the case of a boat—to the owner or the master of the boat; and

                     (b)  in any other case—to the owner of the property or to the person from whose possession the property was seized, or from whose control the property was removed;

on such conditions (if any) as AFMA thinks fit, including conditions as to the giving of security:

                     (c)  for payment of the value of the property if it is forfeited; and

                     (d)  for the payment of any fines that may be imposed under this Act in respect of offences that AFMA has reason to believe have been committed with the use of, or in relation to, that property.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  any property referred to in subsection (1):

                              (i)  is also property referred to in section 52; and

                             (ii)  was under the control of an officer because an offence referred to in that section is alleged to have been committed in respect of the property; and

                     (b)  were the person to be convicted of the offence an order could be made by the court directing the person to pay the costs of the prosecution;

the conditions on which the property may be released under subsection (1) include a condition as to the giving of security for payment of those costs if the person is convicted of the offence.

             (3)  For the purposes of this section:

                     (a)  a reference to property includes a reference to fish; and

                     (b)  property is taken to be under the control of an officer if any person is, in relation to that property, subject to the directions of the officer.

##### <a id="52J"></a>52J  Seizure or forfeiture has effect despite admiralty proceedings

             (1)  The seizure, detention or forfeiture of a boat under this Act has effect despite any or all of the following events:

                     (a)  the arrest of the boat under the _Admiralty Act 1988_;

                     (b)  the making of an order for the sale of the boat by a court in proceedings brought under the _Admiralty Act 1988_;

                     (c)  the sale of the boat under an order made by a court in proceedings brought under the _Admiralty Act 1988_.

             (2)  Subsection (1) has effect regardless of whether the seizure, detention or forfeiture, or the event that was the basis for the seizure, detention or forfeiture, occurred before or after the arrest, making of the order or sale (as appropriate).

### Division 5—Ancillary offences and provisions

##### <a id="53"></a>53  Liability of master of boat

             (1)  The master of a boat on which, or by the use of which, an offence against this Act (in this section referred to as the **_primary offence_**) is committed is guilty of an offence against this section and is punishable, on conviction, as if it were the primary offence.

             (2)  A person may be convicted of an offence against this section whether or not the identity of the person who committed the primary offence appears, or has appeared, from the evidence in the proceedings in respect of the offence against this section or in any other proceedings, but a person shall not be convicted both of an offence against this section and of the primary offence.

             (3)  The provisions of section 52 apply where a person is convicted of an offence against this section in like manner as they would apply if that person had been convicted of the primary offence.

##### <a id="53A"></a>53A  Conduct by directors, servants or agents of bodies corporate

             (1)  Where, in proceedings for an offence against this Act or the regulations in respect of conduct engaged in by a body corporate, it is necessary to establish the state of mind of the body corporate, it is sufficient to show that a director, servant or agent of the body corporate, being a director, servant or agent by whom the conduct was engaged in within the scope of his or her actual or apparent authority, had that state of mind.

             (2)  Any conduct engaged in on behalf of a body corporate:

     5.    Papua New Guinea shall have the sole entitlement to the allowable catch of the commercial barramundi fishery near the Papua New Guinea coast, except within the territorial seas of the islands of Aubusi, Boigu, Dauan, Kaumag, Moimi and Saibai where, in respect of that fishery, the provisions of paragraph 4 (a) of this Article shall not apply. 

     6.    In apportioning the allowable catch in relation to an individual fishery, the Parties shall normally consider the allowable catch expressed in terms of weight or volume. In calculating the apportionment of the total allowable catch of the Protected Zone commercial fisheries, the Parties shall have regard to the relative value of individual fisheries and shall, for this purpose, agree on a common value for production from each individual fishery for the period in question, such value being based on the value of the raw product at the processing facility or such other point as may be agreed, but prior to any enhancement of value through processing, including processing at a pearl culture farm, or further transportation or marketing. 

     7.    The Parties may agree to vary the apportionment of the allowable catch determined for individual fisheries as part of the subsidiary conservation and management arrangements referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 22 of this Treaty but so as to maintain in respect of the total allowable catch of the Protected Zone commercial fisheries the apportionment specified in paragraph 4 of this Article for each Party. 

     8.    In calculating the total allowable catch of the Protected Zone commercial fisheries, the allowable catch of the commercial barramundi fishery referred to in paragraph 5 of this Article shall be disregarded. 

<u>ARTICLE 24</u>

<u>Transitional Entitlement</u>

     1.    As part of the subsidiary conservation and management arrangements referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 22 of this Treaty, the level of the catch of each Protected Zone commercial fishery to which each Party is entitled, provided it remains within the allowable catch— 

     (a)     shall not, during the period of five years immediately after the entry into force of this Treaty, be reduced below the level of catch of that Party before the entry into force of this Treaty; but 

     (b)     may, during the second period of five years after the entry into force of this Treaty, be adjusted progressively so that at the end of that second five-year period it reaches the level of catch apportioned in each case in Article 23 of this Treaty. 

     2.    The entitlement of a Party under this Article shall, where the limitation of the allowable catch makes it necessary, take priority over the entitlement of the other Party under Article 23 of this Treaty, but shall be taken into account in calculating the entitlement of the first Party. 

<u>ARTICLE 25</u>

<u>Preferential Entitlement</u>

     If, in any relevant period, a Party does not itself propose to take all the allowable catch of a Protected Zone commercial fishery to which it is entitled, either in its own area of jurisdiction or that of the other Party, the other Party shall have a preferential entitlement to any of the allowable catch of that fishery not taken by the first Party. 

<u>ARTICLE 26 </u>

<u>Licensing Arrangements</u>

     1.    In the negotiation and implementation of the conservation and management arrangements referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 22 of this Treaty—

     (a)     the Parties shall consult and co-operate in the issue and endorsement of licences to permit commercial fishing in Protected Zone commercial fisheries;

     (b)     the responsible authorities of the Parties may issue licences to fish in any Protected Zone commercial fishery; and 

     (c)     persons or vessels which are licensed by the responsible authorities of one Party to fish in any relevant period in a Protected Zone commercial fishery shall, if nominated by the responsible authorities of that Party, be authorised by the responsible authorities of the other Party, wherever necessary, by the endorsement of licences or otherwise, to fish in those areas under the jurisdiction of the other Party in which the fishery concerned is located. 

     2.    The persons or vessels licensed by one Party which have been authorised, or are to be authorised, under the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article to fish in waters under the jurisdiction of the other Party shall comply with the relevant fisheries laws and regulations of the other Party except that they shall be exempt from licensing fees, levies and other charges imposed by the other Party in respect of such fishing activities. 

     3.    In issuing licences in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article, the responsible authorities of both Parties shall have regard to the desirability of promoting economic development in the Torres Strait area and employment opportunities for the traditional inhabitants. 

     4.    The responsible authorities of both parties shall ensure that the traditional inhabitants are consulted from time to time on the licensing arrangements in respect of Protected Zone commercial fisheries. 

<u>ARTICLE 27</u>

<u>Third</u><u> </u><u>State</u><u> Fishing in Protected Zone Commercial Fisheries</u>

     1.    The responsible authorities of the Parties shall inform one another and shall consult, at the request of either of them, concerning the proposed exploitation of the Protected Zone commercial fisheries—

     (a)     by a joint venture in which there is third-State equity participation; or 

     (b)     by a vessel of third-State registration or with a crew substantially of the nationality of a third State. 

     2.    Vessels the operations of which are under the control of nationals of a third State shall not be licensed to exploit the Protected Zone commercial fisheries without the concurrence of the responsible authorities of both Parties in the particular case or class of cases. 

<u>ARTICLE 28</u>

<u>Inspection and Enforcement</u>

     1.    The Parties shall co-operate, including by exchange of personnel, in inspection and enforcement to prevent violations of the Protected Zone commercial fisheries arrangements and in taking appropriate enforcement measures in the event of such violations. 

     2.    The Parties shall consult from time to time, as necessary, so as to ensure that legislation and regulations adopted by each Party pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article are, as far as practicable, consistent with the legislation and regulations of the other Party. 

     3.    Each Party shall make it an offence under its fisheries laws or regulations for a person to use a vessel of its nationality to fish in Protected Zone commercial fisheries for species of fisheries resources in areas over which the other Party has jurisdiction in respect of those species— 

     (a)     without being duly licensed or authorised by that other Party; or 

     (b)     in the case of a licensed or authorised vessel, in breach of the fisheries laws or regulations of the other Party applying within those areas. 

     4.    Each Party will, in relation to species of fisheries resources in areas where it has jurisdiction in respect of those species— 

     (a)     investigate suspected offences against its fisheries laws and regulations; and 

     (b)     except as provided in or under this article, take corrective action when necessary against offenders against those laws or regulations.

     5.    In this article, corrective action means the action normally taken in respect of a suspected offence, after due investigation, and includes, where appropriate, the apprehension of a suspected offender, the prosecution of an alleged offender, or the execution of a penalty imposed by a court or the cancellation or suspension of the licence of an offender. 

     6.    In accordance with the provisions of this Article, and in other appropriate cases as may be agreed between the Parties, corrective action in respect of offences or suspected offences against the fisheries laws or regulations of the Parties shall be taken by the authorities of the Party whose nationality is borne by the vessel or person concerned (called in this Article “the first Party”) and not by the Party in whose area of jurisdiction the offence or suspected offence occurs (called in this Article “the second Party”). 

     7.    The Parties acknowledge that the principle stated in paragraph 6 of this Article should not be applied so as to frustrate the enforcement of fisheries laws or regulations or to enable offenders against those laws or regulations to go unpunished. 

     8.    Where, in the case of a suspected offence alleged to have been committed in or in the vicinity of the Protected Zone, it appears that the offence was, or might reasonably be considered to have been, committed in the course of traditional fishing, corrective action or other measures shall be taken by the authorities of the first Party and not by the authorities of the second Party and, if being detained by the authorities of the second Party, the alleged offenders and their vessel shall be either released or handed over to the authorities of the first Party, in accordance with arrangements that will avoid undue expense or inconvenience to the authorities of the second Party. 

     9.    Where paragraph 8 of this Article applies, the authorities of the second Party may require assurance in a particular case that corrective action or other measures will be taken by the authorities of the first Party that will adequately ensure that the activity complained of will not be repeated. 

     10.   Where the provisions of paragraph 8 of this Article do not apply, and the person or vessel alleged to have been involved or used in the commission of a suspected offence in the Protected Zone is licensed to fish in the Protected Zone by the authorities of the first Party, corrective action shall be taken by the authorities of the first Party and not by the authorities of the second Party and, if being detained by the authorities of the second Party, the alleged offenders and their vessel shall be either released or handed over to the authorities of the first Party, in accordance with arrangements that will avoid undue expense or inconvenience to the authorities of the second Party, and the provisions of paragraphs 13 and 14 of this article shall apply. 

     11.   The provisions of paragraph 10 of this Article shall also apply in respect of a suspected offence by a person or vessel of the first Party in an area of jurisdiction of the second Party outside the Protected Zone where— 

     (a)     that person or vessel was authorised by the authorities of the second Party to fish in the area where the suspected offence was committed under the arrangements referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 22 of this Treaty; and 

     (b)     the suspected offence was committed in relation to the fishery the subject of that authorisation and did not involve the taking of other species or potential injury to another fishery. 

     12.   Persons or vessels of the first Party detained by the authorities of the Second Party in the circumstances described in paragraphs 8 and 10 of this Article may be detained for as long as necessary to enable those authorities to conduct an expeditious inv
