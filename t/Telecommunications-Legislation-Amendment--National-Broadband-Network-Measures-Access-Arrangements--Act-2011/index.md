##### <a id="151DA"></a>151DA  Authorised conduct—subsection 51(1)

Objects

             (1)  The objects of this section are:

                     (a)  to promote the national interest in structural reform of the telecommunications industry; and

                     (b)  to promote uniform national pricing of eligible services supplied by NBN corporations by authorising, for the purposes of subsection 51(1), certain conduct engaged in by NBN corporations.

Note 1:       If conduct is authorised for the purposes of subsection 51(1), the conduct is disregarded in deciding whether a person has contravened Part IV.

Note 2:       See also subsection 151AJ(10).

Authorised conduct—points of interconnection

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  an NBN corporation is a carrier or carriage service provider; and

                     (b)  the NBN corporation:

                              (i)  owns or controls one or more facilities; or

                             (ii)  is a nominated carrier in relation to one or more facilities; and

                     (c)  the NBN corporation refuses to permit interconnection of those facilities at a particular location with one or more facilities of:

                              (i)  a service provider; or

                             (ii)  a utility; and

                     (d)  the location is not a listed point of interconnection; and

                     (e)  the refusal is reasonably necessary to achieve uniform national pricing of eligible services supplied by the NBN corporation to service providers and utilities;

the refusal is authorised for the purposes of subsection 51(1).

Note:          For **_listed point of interconnection_**, see section 151DB.

Authorised conduct—bundling of designated access services

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  an NBN corporation is a carrier or carriage service provider; and

                     (b)  the NBN corporation:

                              (i)  refuses to supply; or

                             (ii)  refuses to offer to supply;

                            a designated access service to a service provider or utility unless the service provider or utility acquires, or agrees to acquire, one or more other designated access services (other than voice telephony facilitation services) from the NBN corporation; and

                     (c)  the refusal is reasonably necessary to achieve uniform national pricing of eligible services supplied by the NBN corporation to service providers and utilities;

the refusal is authorised for the purposes of subsection 51(1).

Authorised conduct—uniform national pricing

             (4)  If an NBN corporation engages in conduct that is reasonably necessary to achieve uniform national pricing of eligible services supplied by the NBN corporation to service providers and utilities, that conduct is authorised for the purposes of subsection 51(1).

Uniform national pricing

             (5)  For the purposes of this section, uniform national pricing of an eligible service supplied, or offered to be supplied, by an NBN corporation to service providers and utilities is achieved, if, and only if, the price‑related terms and conditions on which the NBN corporation supplies, or offers to supply, the eligible service to service providers and utilities are the same throughout Australia.

             (6)  For the purposes of this section, in determining whether there is uniform national pricing of an eligible service supplied, or offered to be supplied, by an NBN corporation, disregard any discrimination by the NBN corporation against another person on the grounds that the NBN corporation has reasonable grounds to believe that the other person would fail, to a material extent, to comply with the terms and conditions on which the NBN corporation supplies, or on which the NBN corporation is reasonably likely to supply, the eligible service.

          (6A)  Examples of grounds for believing as mentioned in subsection (6) include:

                     (a)  evidence that the other person is not creditworthy; and

                     (b)  repeated failures by the other person to comply with the terms and conditions on which the same or a similar eligible service has been supplied (whether or not by the NBN corporation).

             (7)  For the purposes of this section, in determining whether eligible services are characterised as:

                     (a)  the same eligible service; or

                     (b)  different eligible services;

it is immaterial whether the services are supplied, or offered to be supplied, using:

                     (c)  the same facilities or kinds of facilities; or

                     (d)  different facilities or kinds of facilities.

             (8)  For example, the same eligible service could be supplied, or offered to be supplied, using:

                     (a)  an optical fibre line; or

                     (b)  terrestrial radiocommunications equipment; or

                     (c)  a satellite.

                     (d)  take all reasonable steps to ensure that, if a standard is in force under section 384 of the _Telecommunications Act 1997_, the interconnection complies with the standard.

          (4A)  Subsection (4) does not apply to an interconnection at a location that is not a listed point of interconnection (within the meaning of section 151DB).

Conditional‑access customer equipment

Exceptions

             (6)  This section does not impose an obligation on an NBN corporation if there are reasonable grounds to believe that:

                     (a)  the access seeker would fail, to a material extent, to comply with the terms and conditions on which the NBN corporation complies, or on which the NBN corporation is reasonably likely to comply, with that obligation; or

                     (b)  the access seeker would fail, in connection with that obligation, to protect:

                              (i)  the integrity of a telecommunications network; or

                             (ii)  the safety of individuals working on, or using services supplied by means of, a telecommunications network or a facility.

Examples—paragraph (6)(a) grounds

             (7)  Examples of grounds for believing as mentioned in paragraph (6)(a) include:
