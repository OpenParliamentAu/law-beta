## 47  After subsection 421(1)

Insert:

          (1A)  For the purposes of applying subsection (1) to an eligible CFC in relation to an eligible period, if:

                     (a)  an entity (the **_designated entity_**) is the only attributable taxpayer in relation to the eligible CFC at the end of the eligible period; and

                     (b)  the designated entity’s attribution percentage in relation to the company is 100% at the end of the eligible period;

then, instead of the election being given by the eligible CFC, or by the eligible CFC and another entity (which other entity may be the designated entity), the election may be given by:

                     (c)  the designated entity; or

                     (d)  if the designated entity is not the same as the other entity—the designated entity and the other entity;

as the case requires.

## 48  After paragraph 422(2)(a)

Insert:

                    (aa)  subsection 457(3) does not apply to the change of residence; and

## 49  Subsection 431(4)

Repeal the subsection, substitute:

             (4)  A loss for a statutory accounting period is not to be taken into account under subsection (2):

                     (a)  where the eligible CFC is a resident of a broad-exemption listed country at the end of the eligible period—if that statutory accounting period is one at whose end the CFC was:

                              (i)  if that statutory accounting period began on or after 1 July 1997—not a resident of a broad-exemption listed country; or

                             (ii)  if that statutory accounting period began before 1 July 1997—not a resident of a listed country (within the meaning of this Act as in force immediately before 1 July 1997);

                            or is any statutory accounting period before such a period; or

                     (b)  where the eligible CFC is a resident of a non-broad-exemption listed country at the end of the eligible period—if that statutory accounting period is one at whose end the CFC was:

                             (ii)  if that statutory accounting period began before 1 July 1997—not a resident of an unlisted country (within the meaning of this Act as in force immediately before 1 July 1997);

          (4A)  If:

          (4B)  If:

                     (a)  the eligible CFC is a resident of a non-broad-exemption listed country at the end of the eligible period; and

                             (ii)  if that statutory accounting period began before 1 July 1997—a listed country (within the meaning of this Act immediately before 1 July 1997) at the end of that statutory accounting period;

subsection (4) does not prevent a loss for that statutory accounting period, or an earlier statutory accounting period, from being taken into account under subsection (2).

          (4C)  If:

                     (a)  the eligible CFC is a resident of a non-broad-exemption listed country at the end of the eligible period; and

                     (b)  at the end of a prior statutory accounting period, the CFC was a resident of the same country; and

                              (i)  if that statutory accounting period began on or after 1 July 1997—a broad-exemption listed country; or

                             (ii)  if that statutory accounting period began before 1 July 1997—a listed country (within the meaning of this Act as in force immediately before 1 July 1997);

subsection (4) does not prevent a loss for that statutory accounting period, or an earlier statutory accounting period, from being taken into account under subsection (2).

          (4D)  If:

                     (a)  as a result of the operation of subsection (4), a loss of a CFC for a statutory accounting period was not taken into account under subsection (2) in calculating the attributable income of the CFC for a later statutory accounting period (the **_second statutory accounting period_**); and

                     (b)  the eligible period is later than the second statutory accounting period;

then, despite anything in subsection (4), (4A), (4B) or (4C), the loss is not to be taken into account under subsection (2) in calculating the attributable income of the CFC for the eligible period.

## 50  Subsection 433(1)

Before “unlisted country”, insert “listed country or a particular”.

## 51  Subsection 433(2)

Repeal the subsection.

## 52  At the end of subparagraph 436(1)(b)(i)

Add “(other than a broad-exemption listed country of which the company is a resident)”.

## 53  Paragraphs 438(3A)(c) and (d)

Repeal the paragraphs, substitute:

                     (c)  if there is only one attributable taxpayer in relation to the company at the end of the statutory accounting period—on or before the date of lodgment of the taxpayer’s return of income of the year of income in which the end of the statutory accounting period occurs; or

                     (d)  if there are 2 or more attributable taxpayers in relation to the company at the end of the statutory accounting period:

                              (i)  if the taxpayers’ returns of income of the year of income in which the end of the statutory accounting period occurs are lodged on different dates—on or before the later or latest of those dates; or

                             (ii)  if the taxpayers’ returns of income of the year of income in which the end of the statutory accounting period occurs are lodged on the same date—on or before that date; or

                     (e)  in any case—within such further period as the Commissioner allows.

## 54  After subsection 438(3A)

Insert:

          (3B)  For the purposes of applying subsection (3A) to a company in relation to a statutory accounting period, if:

                     (a)  the company is a CFC at the end of the statutory accounting period; and

                     (b)  an entity (the **_designated entity_**) is the only attributable taxpayer in relation to the company at the end of the statutory accounting period; and

                     (c)  the designated entity’s attribution percentage in relation to the company is 100% at the end of the statutory accounting period;

then, instead of the election being given by the company, or by the company and another entity (which other entity may be the designated entity), the election may be given by:

                     (d)  the designated entity; or

                     (e)  if the designated entity is not the same as the other entity—the designated entity and the other entity;

as the case requires.

## 55  After subsection 448(6)

Insert:

          (6A)  The tainted services income of a company of a statutory accounting period does not include income where:

                     (a)  the income was derived by the company from a CFC; and

                     (b)  at all times during the statutory accounting period when the income accrued:

                              (i)  the CFC was an associate of the company; and

                             (ii)  the company was a resident of a particular listed country or a particular unlisted country; and

                            (iii)  the CFC was also a resident of that listed country or that unlisted country, as the case may be; and

                     (c)  the income was taxed in the listed country or that unlisted country, as the case may be, at the country’s normal company tax rate (see section 325); and

                     (d)  the income would not have been, in whole or in part, a notional allowable deduction of the CFC if it were assumed that the CFC had failed to pass the active income test in relation to any statutory accounting period of the CFC.

## 56  At the end of section 457

Add:

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  at the residence-change time, regulations made for the purposes of section 320 come into effect; and

                     (b)  a result of those regulations coming into effect is that the company:

                              (i)  ceases to be a resident of an unlisted country; and

                             (ii)  becomes a resident of a listed country;

                            at the residence-change time;

then:

                     (c)  if the company was a resident of that unlisted country throughout the period of 3 years ending at the residence-change time—no amount is to be included in the attributable taxpayer’s assessable income under subsection (1) in relation to that change of residence; and

                     (d)  in any other case—sub-subparagraph (a)(i)(A) of the definition of **_Adjusted distributable profits_** in subsection (2) does not apply in relation to that change of residence.
