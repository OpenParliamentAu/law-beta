                     (d)  communicating those factors to relevant sectors of the transport industry and the public in any way, including in any one or more of the following ways:

                              (i)  by making safety action statements;

Application for warrant

             (1)  The Chief Commissioner may apply to a magistrate for a warrant under this section in relation to premises.

Issue of warrant

             (2)  The magistrate may issue the warrant if the magistrate is satisfied, by information on oath, that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that:

                     (a)  there is evidential material on the premises; or

                     (b)  there may be evidential material on the premises within the next 72 hours.

             (3)  However, the magistrate must not issue the warrant unless the Chief Commissioner or some other person has given to the magistrate, either orally or by affidavit, such further information (if any) as the magistrate requires concerning the grounds on which the issue of the warrant is being sought.

Content of warrant

             (4)  The warrant must:

                     (a)  authorise the Chief Commissioner, with such assistance and by such force as is necessary and reasonable:

                              (i)  to enter the premises; and

                             (ii)  to exercise the powers set out in section 36; and

                            (iii)  to seize evidential material to which the warrant relates; and

                     (b)  state whether the entry is authorised to be made at any time of the day or night or during specified hours of the day or night; and

                     (c)  specify the day (not more than one week after the issue of the warrant) on which the warrant ceases to have effect; and

                     (d)  state the purpose for which the warrant is issued.

##### <a id="41"></a>41  Investigation warrants by telephone, fax etc.

Application for warrant

             (1)  If, in an urgent case, the Chief Commissioner considers it necessary to do so, the Chief Commissioner may apply to a magistrate by telephone, fax or other electronic means for a warrant under section 40 in relation to premises.

             (2)  The magistrate may require communication by voice to the extent that it is practicable in the circumstances.

             (3)  Before applying for the warrant, the Chief Commissioner must prepare an information of the kind mentioned in subsection 40(2) in relation to the premises that sets out the grounds on which the warrant is sought.

             (4)  If it is necessary to do so, the Chief Commissioner may apply for the warrant before the information is sworn.

Issue of warrant

             (5)  If the magistrate is satisfied:

                     (a)  after having considered the terms of the information; and

                     (b)  after having received such further information (if any) as the magistrate requires concerning the grounds on which the issue of the warrant is being sought;

that there are reasonable grounds for issuing the warrant, the magistrate may complete and sign the same warrant that the magistrate would issue under section 40 if the application had been made under that section.

Obligations of magistrate and Chief Commissioner once warrant issued

             (6)  If the magistrate completes and signs the warrant:

                     (a)  the magistrate must:

                            (iv)  record on the warrant the reasons for issuing the warrant; and

                     (b)  the Chief Commissioner must:

                              (i)  complete a form of warrant in the same terms as the warrant completed and signed by the magistrate; and

                             (ii)  write on the form the name of the magistrate and the day on which and the time at which the warrant was signed.

             (7)  The Chief Commissioner must also, not later than the day after the day of expiry or execution of the warrant, whichever is the earlier, send to the magistrate:

                     (a)  the form of warrant completed by the Chief Commissioner; and

                     (b)  the information referred to in subsection (3), which must have been duly sworn.

             (8)  When the magistrate receives those documents, the magistrate must:

                     (a)  attach them to the warrant that the magistrate completed and signed; and

                     (b)  deal with them in the way in which the magistrate would have dealt with the information if the application had been made under section 40.

Authority of warrant

             (9)  A form of warrant duly completed under subsection (6) is authority for the same powers as are authorised by the warrant signed by the magistrate.

           (10)  If:

                     (a)  it is material, in any proceedings, for a court to be satisfied that an exercise of a power was authorised by this section; and

                     (b)  the warrant signed by the magistrate authorising the exercise of the power is not produced in evidence;

the court must assume, unless the contrary is proved, that the exercise of the power was not authorised by such a warrant.

Note:          Part 6 deals with the protection of OBR information and restricted information.

             (3)  However, if the owner or user and the Commonwealth fail to agree, the owner or user may institute proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia for such reasonable amount of compensation as the Court determines.

             (4)  In determining the amount of compensation payable, regard is to be had to whether the occupier of the premises, or the occupier’s employees and agents, if they were available at the time, provided any appropriate warning or guidance on the operation of the equipment.

             (6)  For the purposes of subsection (1):

                    <a name="damag"></a>**_damage_**, in relation to data, includes damage by erasure of data or addition of other data.

##### <a id="47"></a>47  Self‑incrimination not an excuse

             (1)  A person is not excused from answering a question or producing evidential material in response to a requirement under this Part on the ground that the answer, or the production of the material, might tend to incriminate the person or make the person liable to a penalty.

             (2)  However, if the person is an individual, then:

                     (a)  the answer or the production of the material; and

                     (b)  any information or thing (including any document) obtained as a direct or indirect result of the answer or the production of the material;

are not admissible in evidence against the person in any civil or criminal proceedings.

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not prevent an answer being admitted in evidence in criminal proceedings in respect of the falsity of the answer.
