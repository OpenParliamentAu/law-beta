of income, being a superannuation fund that was established after 11 March

1985, is not exempt from income tax by virtue of section 23F or 23FB unless,

at all times during the year of income, the cost of the in-house assets of the

fund did not exceed 10% of the cost of all the assets of the fund. &quot;(5) The

the in-house assets of the fund as at 11 March 1985 shall be deemed, for the

purposes of sub-paragraph (5) (a) (i), to be equal to 70% of the cost of all

the assets of the fund as at 11 March 1985.

  &quot;(7) For the purposes of this section, the Commissioner shall disregard any

failure of the assets of a superannuation fund to comply with the maximum

levels of in-house assets specified in sub-section (4) or (5) if the

Commissioner is satisfied -

  (a) that the trustee of the fund made a genuine and bona fide attempt to

ensure that the in-house assets of that fund did not exceed, at any time

during that year of income, the levels so specified; or

  (b) that the failure was by reason of a temporary delay in investment, and

that, in all the circumstances, it would be reasonable to disregard that

failure.

  &quot;(8) This section does not apply, in relation to a year of income, to a

superannuation fund where -

  (a) the terms and conditions applicable to the fund did not, at any time

during that year of income, make provision for benefits for residents; and

  (b) no deductions have been allowed or are allowable in the assessment of

the taxable income of any taxpayer in respect of contributions made to the

fund during that year of income.

  &quot;(9) For the purposes of this section, where, in relation to a year of

income, the investment income of a superannuation fund consists of, or

includes, a portion of the income arising from certain assets -

  (a) those assets shall be deemed to be assets of the fund; and

  (b) the cost of those assets shall, in relation to any time during that year

of income, be such amount as, in the opinion of the Commissioner, is

reasonable in the circumstances.

  &quot;(10) Where -

  (a) a particular asset of a superannuation fund was acquired without

consideration or for consideration other than the value of the asset when it

was acquired; or

  (b) the whole or a part of the consideration for which a particular asset of

a superannuation fund was acquired was other than money, the cost of that

asset shall, for the purposes of this section, be such amount as, in the

opinion of the Commissioner, is reasonable in the circumstances.

  &quot;(11) Where -

  (a) but for this sub-section, an asset of a superannuation fund consists of

a loan, or investment, other than an in-house asset;

  (b) that loan or investment was made as the result of the entering into or

carrying out of an agreement; and

  (c) any of the persons who entered into or carried out the agreement did so

for the purpose, or for purposes that included the purpose, of achieving the

result that a loan or investment would be made to or in, or to or in an

associate of, an employer sponsor of the fund, the asset is an in-house asset

of the fund for the purposes of this section.

  &quot;(12) Where -

  (a) an asset of a superannuation fund consists of a loan to, or investment

in, a person other than - (i) an employer sponsor of the fund; or (ii) an

associate of an employer sponsor of the fund;

  (b) the person has a financial link with an employer sponsor of the fund or

an associate of an employer sponsor of the fund; and

  (c) sub-section (11) does not apply in relation to the asset, the cost of

the in-house assets of the fund shall be deemed, for the purposes of this

section, to be increased by such amount (if any) as, in the opinion of the

Commissioner, is reasonable in the circumstances.

  &quot;(13) For the purposes of sub-section (12) and this sub-section -

first-mentioned person consists of a loan to, or an investment in, the second

person; and

person has a financial link with a third person who has a financial link with

the second person (including a financial link with the second person by

another application or other applications of this paragraph). &quot;(14) Subject to

sub-section (15), the cost of the in-house assets of a superannuation fund

shall be deemed, for the purposes of this section, to be increased by an

amount equal to the sum of -

  (a) the amount of any subsisting guarantee given by the trustee of the fund

(whether jointly or otherwise) in relation to, or in relation to an associate

of, an employer sponsor of the fund;

  (b) the amount of any subsisting mortgage given in respect of an asset of

the fund for the benefit of, or for the benefit of an associate of, an

employer sponsor of the fund (whether or not the mortgage was also given for

the benefit of other persons); and

  (c) the amount of payments by way of calls in respect of shares in, or in an

associate of, an employer sponsor of the fund, that the trustee of the fund

is, or could become, liable to pay (whether jointly or otherwise).

  &quot;(15) Where -

  (a) the trustee of a superannuation fund could become liable (whether

jointly or otherwise) to pay an amount by way of calls in respect of shares

in, or in an associate of, an employer sponsor of the fund; and

  (b) the Commissioner is satisfied that the assets of the employer sponsor or

the associate of the employer sponsor, as the case may be, are sufficient to

enable it to pay any debts that it has incurred, or is reasonably likely to

incur, without requiring any of those calls to be paid, the Commissioner may

determine that the amount referred to in paragraph (a) shall be disregarded

for the purposes of paragraph (14) (c).

  &quot;(16) Where -

  (a) an employer of an employee is a company;

  (b) the employee has, or dependants of the employee have, a right to receive

benefits from a superannuation fund;

  (c) the employee, or a dependant of the employee, is a beneficial owner of

shares in the employer;

  (d) an asset of the fund consists of a loan to the employee, or the

dependant, referred to in paragraph (c); and

  (e) but for this sub-section, the asset is an in-house asset of the fund,

the asset shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed not to be an

inhouse asset of the fund if the Commissioner, having regard to -

  (f) the amount of the loan;

  (g) the value of the shares; and

  (h) any other matters that the Commissioner considers relevant, is satisfied

that there are special circumstances by reason of which it would be reasonable

to treat the asset as not being an in-house asset of the fund.

  &quot;(17) Nothing in sub-section (14), (15) or (16) shall be construed as

permitting, by implication, the doing of an act or thing by or in relation to

a superannuation fund that could not be done without contravening whichever of

sections 23F or 23FB is applicable in relation to the fund.

  &quot;(18) Where a superannuation fund is in existence during part only of a year

of income, this section has effect as if references to all times during the

year of income were references to all times during the part of that year of

income during which the superannuation fund was in existence.&quot;.
