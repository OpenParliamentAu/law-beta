 The Australian Mission in East Timor presents it compliments to the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) and has the honour to refer to UNTAET's Note to the Mission dated 10 February 2000 which reads as follows:
 "The United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) presents its compliments to the Australian Mission in East Timor and has the honour to refer to the fact that, pursuant to United Nations Security Council resolution 1272 (1999) of 25 October 1999, and in accordance with paragraph 35 of the Report of the Secretary-General (S/1999/1024), the United Nations will conclude such international agreements with States and international organisations as may be necessary for the carrying out of the functions of UNTAET in East Timor.
 An agreement between UNTAET, acting on behalf of East Timor, and Australia, providing practical arrangements for the continuity of the terms of the "Treaty between Australia and the Republic of Indonesia on the Zone of Cooperation in an Area between the Indonesian Province of East Timor and Northern Australia" (the "Timor Gap Treaty") in the transitional period, will benefit the people of East Timor and will assist UNTAET in carrying out its functions entrusted to it under Security Council resolution 1272 (1999). The conclusion of this agreement, however, is without prejudice to the position of the future government of an independent East Timor with regard to the Treaty.
 UNTAET therefore has the honour to advise the Australian Mission in East Timor that all rights and obligations under the Timor Gap Treaty previously exercised by Indonesia are assumed by UNTAET, acting on behalf of East Timor, until the date of independence of East Timor. UNTAET, acting on behalf of East Timor, and Australia may enter into subsidiary arrangements or agreements relating to the continued operation of the terms of the Treaty. In agreeing to continue the arrangements under the terms of the Treaty, the United Nations does not thereby recognise the validity of the "integration" of East Timor into Indonesia.
 If the understanding of Australia is in accordance with the foregoing advice, UNTAET has the honour to propose that this Note and Australia's confirmatory Note in reply shall constitute an agreement between UNTAET, acting on behalf of East Timor, and Australia which shall be applied as of 25 October 1999".
 The Australian Mission has the honour to advise that the foregoing proposal is acceptable to the Government of Australia and to agree that the UNTAET Note and this reply shall constitute an Agreement between the Government of Australia 
<center>Back to Top</center>
 and UNTAET which shall be applied as of 25 October 1999.
 The Australian Mission in East Timor avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor the assurances of its highest consideration.
