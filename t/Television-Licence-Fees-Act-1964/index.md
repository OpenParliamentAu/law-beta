7  Earnings of subsidiary companies etc.
		Where the ABA is of the opinion that:

	(b)	a relationship exists between the licensee and the other person (whether by reason of any shareholding or of any agreement or arrangement, or for any other reason) of such a kind that the amount or the part of the amount, as the case may be, should, for the purposes of this Act, be treated as part of the gross earnings in respect of the licence in respect of that period;
the ABA may direct that the amount or the part of the amount, as the case may be, shall be so treated.
