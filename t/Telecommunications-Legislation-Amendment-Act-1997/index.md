Division 5&#151;Allocation of costs in relation to interception, special assistance, and agency specific delivery capabilities
 332K  Purpose of Division

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note:	The actual cost of the provision of help to an agency in

<dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>The capital and ongoing costs of developing, installing and maintaining an

<dl compact="">

<dt>(2)</dt><dd>Despite subsection 332L(1), the capital and ongoing costs incurred on or

this section applies are to be borne not by the carrier or provider concerned

but by the agencies on the same basis as was provided under the

_Telecommunications Act 1991_ as in force  before that date.

332N  Working out costs of agency specific delivery capabilities

<dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>Each carrier or carriage service provider who is obliged to ensure the

agency specific delivery capability must be consistent with the following

principles:

</dd> </dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>the principle that the most cost effective means of ensuring the

development, installation and maintenance of that capability is employed;</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>the principle that the carrier or provider is to incur the costs (whether

of a capital nature or otherwise) relating to the development, installation and

maintenance of that capability;</dd>

<dt>(c)</dt><dd>the principle that the carrier or provider may, over time, recover from an

agency such of those costs as are required, under section 332L, to be borne by

that agency.

<dl compact="">

<dt>(3)</dt><dd>Nothing in subsection (2) prevents a carrier or provider from entering

into an agreement with more than one agency.</dd> <dt>(4)</dt><dd>The agreement should also provide that if the working out of the costs to a particular agency of developing, installing and maintaining an agency specific delivery capability is the subject of a disagreement between the carrier or provider and that agency: </dd> </dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>must allow the agency credit for any costs already charged to the extent

that they were worked out at a rate that exceeds that lesser rate; and</dd>
