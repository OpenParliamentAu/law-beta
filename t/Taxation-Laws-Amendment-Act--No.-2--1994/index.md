TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT ACT (No. 2) 1994No. 82, 1994

- SECT 10

Repeal of section and substitution of new sections

  10\. Section 159GQ of the Principal Act is repealed and the following

sections are substituted:

Tax treatment of holder of qualifying security

Accrual amounts to be worked out

  &quot;159GQ.(1) If a taxpayer holds a qualifying security for all or part of a

year of income, the effect on the taxpayer's taxable income is determined by

working out the accrual amount (see section 159GQB) for each accrual period

(see section 159GQA) in the year of income and then summing the accrual

amounts.

Positive sum assessable

  &quot;(2) If the sum is a positive amount, the amount is included in the

assessable income of the taxpayer of the year of income.

Negative sum deductible

  &quot;(3) If the sum is a negative amount, a deduction of the amount is allowable

in the assessment of the taxpayer of the year of income.

Accrual period

Taxpayer's maximum term to be divided into accrual periods

  &quot;159GQA.(1) The taxpayer's maximum term for the qualifying security is

divided into accrual periods in accordance with this section.

Whole year of income

  &quot;(2) If a year of income is wholly taken up by any of the taxpayer's maximum

term, the year of income is divided into 2 accrual periods of 6 months.

Beginning of taxpayer's maximum term

  &quot;(3) If the taxpayer's maximum term begins after the beginning of the year

of income:

  (a) if it begins less than 6 months after the beginning of the year of

income-the period from the beginning of the taxpayer's maximum term until the

middle of the year of income is an accrual period and the second 6 months of

the year of income is an accrual period; and

  (b) in any other case-the part of the year of income taken up by the

taxpayer's maximum term is an accrual period.

End of taxpayer's maximum term

  &quot;(4) If the taxpayer's maximum term ends before the end of a year of

income:

  (a) if it ends no later than 6 months after the beginning of the year of

income-the part of the year of income taken up by the taxpayer's maximum term

is an accrual period; and

  (b) in any other case-the first 6 months of the year of income is an accrual

period and the period from the middle of the year of income until the end of

the taxpayer's maximum term is an accrual period.

Example

  &quot;(5) For example, if the taxpayer's year of income is a financial year and a

security with a 2 year term is issued to the taxpayer on 1 April, the accrual

periods will be as follows:

1st year of income

               2nd year of income

                               3rd year of income

1 Apr.   1 July

               1 Jan.       1 July

                               1 Jan.    1 Apr.

3 month accrual period

               6 month accrual period

               6 month accrual period

                               6 month accrual period

                               3 month accrual period

Accrual amount

Formula

  &quot;159GQB.(1) The 'accrual amount' for an accrual period is worked out using

the formula:

(Implicit interest rate  x  Opening balance) -  Periodic interest etc.

&quot;Implicit interest rate&quot;

  &quot;(2) In the formula in subsection (1), 'Implicit interest rate' means the

rate of interest worked out under section 159GQC (for a fixed return security)

or 159GQD (for a variable return security), properly adjusted to take account

of the case where the accrual period is less than 6 months.

&quot;Opening balance&quot;

  &quot;(3) In the formula in subsection (1), 'Opening balance' means the amount

worked out using the formula:

    Issue/transfer price  +  Previous accruals  -  Payments

where:

  'Issue/transfer price' means the issue price or transfer price, as the case

requires, of the security; and

  'Previous accruals' means:

  (a) if paragraph (b) does not apply-the sum, whether positive or negative,

of all accrual amounts for previous accrual periods in the taxpayer's maximum

term; or

  (b) if the accrual period is the first in the taxpayer's maximum term-nil;

and

  'Payments' means all payments (other than of periodic interest) made or

liable to be made under the security during all previous accrual periods in

the taxpayer's maximum term.

&quot;Periodic interest etc.&quot;

  &quot;(4) In the formula in subsection (1), 'Periodic interest etc.' means the

sum of:

  (a) all periodic interest payments made or liable to be made under the

security during the accrual period, properly adjusted in the case of any

payment made other than at the end of the period; and

  (b) if any payments (other than of periodic interest) made or liable to be

made under the security during the accrual period are made or liable to be

made other than at its end-an amount to adjust properly for the making of the

payments other than at the end of the period.

Implicit interest rate for fixed return security

  &quot;159GQC. For the purposes of the formula component 'Implicit interest rate'

in subsection 159GQB(1), the rate of interest for a fixed return security in

relation to a taxpayer is the rate of compound interest per period of 6 months

at which:

  (a) the sum of the present values of all amounts payable under the security

during the taxpayer's maximum term; equals:

  (b) the issue price or the transfer price, as the case requires, of the

security.

Implicit interest rate for variable return security

Implicit interest rate to be recalculated each year etc.

  &quot;159GQD.(1) For the purposes of the formula component 'Implicit interest

rate' in subsection 159GQB(1), the rate of interest for a variable return

security must be worked out in accordance with subsection (2) separately for

each year of income during the taxpayer's maximum term. If there are 2 accrual

periods of 6 months in the year of income, the rate is the same for both

periods. It is possible for the rate to be negative.

Rate

  &quot;(2) The rate applicable in relation to a year of income is the rate of

compound interest per period of 6 months in the calculation period (see

subsection (3)) at which:

  (a) the sum of the present values of all amounts payable under the security

during the calculation period; equals:

  (b) the opening balance, mentioned in subsection 159GQB(1), for the accrual

period that begins the calculation period.

&quot;Calculation period&quot;

  &quot;(3) The 'calculation period' means the part of the taxpayer's maximum term

that occurs after the beginning of the year of income.

Where amount payable is not known

  &quot;(4) For the purposes of paragraph (2)(a), if by the end of the year of

income it is not possible to determine whether an amount will be payable, or

the size of the amount that will be payable, after the end of the year of

income, the determination is to be made by applying subsection (5), (7) or

(11), or a combination of those subsections.

Assumption of constant level

  &quot;(5) Subject to subsection (7), if an amount payable is worked out to any

extent by reference to the amount or level, at a particular time, of a rate,

price, index or other thing, it is to be assumed that the rate, price, index

or thing will be the same at all times after the end of the year of income as

it was at the end of the year of income (or, if it was not available at the

end of the year of income, at the time when it was last available in the year

of income).

Examples

  &quot;(6) For the purposes of subsection (5):

  (a) an example of an amount worked out wholly by reference to the amount of

a rate at a particular time is an interest payment under a floating rate note.

The amount payable is the product of an interest rate indicator (such as the

prevailing bank bill rate) and the face or par value of the note; and

  (b) an example of an amount worked out wholly by reference to the amount of

a price at a particular time is a redemption payment under a commodity linked

security where the amount of the payment is the product of the prevailing

price of a commodity (such as gold) and the face or par value of the security.

Assumption of continuing rate of change

  &quot;(7) If an amount payable is worked out to any extent by reference to the

amount of change in an index or other thing that occurs during a period, it is

to be assumed that the index or other thing will continue to change at the

same rate as it did:

  (a) if the index or other thing was available at the end of the year of

income-during the year of income; or

  (b) in any other case-during the period of 12 months in respect of which the

index or other thing was last available in the year of income.

Example

  &quot;(8) An example for the purposes of subsection (7) is a payment whose amount

is the product of the face or par value of a security and the percentage

increase in the All Groups Consumer Price Index number (the 'CPI') during the

year ending on 30 June 1995\. If the year of income for which the implicit

interest rate is being worked out is the 1993-94 year of income and the CPI

increases by 2% during the year ending on 31 March 1994 (the date of the last

available number during the year of income), the CPI is assumed to increase by

2% during the year ending on 30 June 1995.

Disguised continuing rate of change case

  &quot;(9) For the purposes of subsection (7), if an amount payable is worked out

to any extent by reference to the quotient of:

  (a) the amount or level of an index or other thing at a particular time;

and

  (b) either:

    (i) the amount or level of the index or other thing at a different

time; or

    (ii) another amount that, while not expressed to be the amount or

level of the index or other thing at a different time, may reasonably be

regarded as representing the amount or level of the index or other thing at a

different time;

the amount payable is taken to be worked out to that extent by reference to

the amount of change in the index or other thing that occurs during the period

between the 2 times.

Example

  &quot;(10) An example for the purposes of subsection (9) is a payment under a

security issued in December 1994 that is worked out by multiplying a number of

dollars by the quotient of:

  (a) the All Groups Consumer Price Index number in respect of the quarter

ending on 31 December 1997; and

  (b) the number 114.

Assume that the number in paragraph (b) is the same as the All Groups Consumer

Price Index number in respect of the quarter ending on 31 December 1994\. In

this case, it would be reasonable to regard the number as representing the

amount of the index at 31 December 1994, and therefore to apply subsection

(7).

General assumption

  &quot;(11) If it is not possible to make the determination mentioned in

subsection (4) in respect of the whole or part of any amount by applying

subsection (5) or (7), or both, (for example, because no information about a

rate, price or index was available during the year of income), the

determination in respect of that whole or part is to be made on the basis of

what is most likely in the circumstances.&quot;.

  &quot;(1A) If, on the assumptions in subsection (1C), an amount would be included

in the taxpayer's assessable income of the year of income in respect of the

issuer period, then, subject to this section, the taxpayer is entitled to a

deduction in his or her assessment for the year of income equal to that

amount.

allowable in the taxpayer's assessment for the year of income, then an amount

equal to the deduction is included in the taxpayer's assessable income of the

  &quot;(1C) For the purposes of subsections (1A) and (1B), the assumptions are

that:

  (a) the security was issued to the taxpayer (rather than the taxpayer being

the issuer of the security); and

  (b) by inserting after subsection (9) the following subsections:

  &quot;(9A) For the purposes of paragraph (ba) of the definition of 'qualifying

security' in subsection (1), if:

  (a) after 16 December 1984, a person issues a security (the 'first in the

series') that is not a qualifying security; and

  (b) during the period from the end of 16 December 1984 until the issuing of

the first in the series, the person did not issue any qualifying security with

exactly the same payment dates, payment amounts and other terms as the first

in the series; and

security (the 'later security') with exactly the same payment dates, payment

amounts and other terms as the first in the series; the later security is

Requirements for Division to apply

  &quot;160ZZRL. In order for the operative provisions of this Division (sections

160ZZRP and 160ZZRQ) to apply, the following requirements must be satisfied:

  (a) first, a share value shift must take place under an arrangement

involving a company and a taxpayer (see section 160ZZRM);

  (b) secondly, the taxpayer must be a controller (see subsection 160ZZRN(1))

of the company at some time during the period beginning when the arrangement

is entered into and ending when it has been implemented;

  (c) thirdly, there must be a material decrease (see subsection 160ZZRO(1))

in the market value of a share involved in the share value shift.

Share value shift under an arrangement

&quot;Share value shift&quot;

  &quot;160ZZRM.(1) A 'share value shift' takes place under an arrangement (see

subsection (3)) involving a company and a taxpayer if:

  (a) under the arrangement, the company, the taxpayer or an associate of the

taxpayer, either alone or with one or more other persons, does something in

relation to a share or shares (including issuing a share or shares) in the

company (for example, changing voting rights attached to a share, buying-back

shares or issuing new shares at a discount on their market value); and

  (b) at the same time as, or after, the thing is done, one or more shares

(each of which is a 'decreased value share') in the company (whether or not

shares to which paragraph (a) applies) that are post-CGT shares held by the

taxpayer or an associate of the taxpayer decrease in market value; and

  (c) at the same time as, or after, the thing is done, either or both of the

following happen:

    (i) one or more existing shares (each of which is an 'increased

value share') in the company (whether post-CGT shares or pre-CGT shares and

whether or not shares to which paragraph (a) applies) held by:

      (A) in any case-the taxpayer or an associate of the taxpayer; or

      (B) if any decreased value share was held by an associate of the

taxpayer-an associate of that associate;

increase in market value; or

    (ii) one or more new shares (each of which is also an 'increased

value share') in the company are issued to:

      (A) in any case-the taxpayer or an associate of the taxpayer; or

      (B) if any decreased value share was held by an associate of the

taxpayer-an associate of that associate;

where the market value of each new share exceeds the consideration (if any)

given by the taxpayer or other person for its issue (the excess is referred to

in this Division as an 'increase' in its market value); and

  (d) it is reasonable to conclude that the decrease and increase were caused

by the doing of the thing mentioned in paragraph (a).

Increase or decrease partly due to arrangement

  &quot;(2) If it is reasonable to conclude that an increase or decrease in the

market value of one or more shares is partly caused by the doing of the thing

under the arrangement and partly caused by something else, subsection (1)

applies to the decrease or increase to the extent only that it is reasonable

to conclude that the decrease or increase is caused by the doing of the thing

under the arrangement.

&quot;Arrangement&quot;

  &quot;(3) An 'arrangement' is:

  (a) any arrangement, agreement, understanding, promise or undertaking,

whether express or implied and whether or not enforceable, or intended to be

enforceable, by legal proceedings; or

  (b) any scheme, plan, proposal, action, course of action, or course of

conduct, whether of one person or more than one person.

&quot;Share&quot;

  &quot;(4) The expression 'share' includes:

  (a) an interest in a share; or

  (b) a right or option (including a contingent right or option) to acquire a

share or an interest in a share.

&quot;Pre-CGT share&quot;

  &quot;(5) A share is a 'pre-CGT share' if it was acquired by the shareholder

before 20 September 1985.

&quot;Post-CGT share&quot;

  &quot;(6) A share is a 'post-CGT share' if it was acquired by the shareholder on

or after 20 September 1985.

Controller of a company etc.

&quot;Controller&quot;

  &quot;160ZZRN.(1) A taxpayer is a 'controller' of a company if:

  (a) the taxpayer has an associate-inclusive control interest in the company

of not less than 50%; or

  (b) both the following subparagraphs apply:

    (i) the taxpayer has an associate-inclusive control interest in

the company of not less than 40%;

    (ii) the company is not controlled by a group of entities other

than a group consisting of or including the taxpayer or any of the taxpayer's

associates; or

  (c) the taxpayer controls the company, either alone or together with an

associate or associates.

&quot;Associate&quot;, &quot;entity&quot; and &quot;group&quot;

  &quot;(2) The expressions 'associate', 'entity' and 'group' have the same

respective meanings as in Part X.

&quot;Associate-inclusive control interest&quot;

  &quot;(3) Subject to the modifications in subsection (4), whether a taxpayer has

an associate-inclusive control interest of not less than 50%, or not less than

40%, in a company is to be determined by applying Division 3 of Part X.

Modifications of applied provisions

  &quot;(4) The modifications are as follows:

  (a) that Division 3 of Part X applies for the purpose of determining the

associate-inclusive control interests in a company whether or not in the

capacity of trustee;

Note: The expression 'company' in Part X does not include a company in the

capacity of trustee.

  (b) that the purpose of making the determination is one of the purposes for

which subsection 349(4) is to be applied;

  (c) that subsections 350(6) and (7) and 355(1) do not apply;

  (d) that the reference in subsection 352(2) to a CFE is a reference to:

    (i) a company of which the taxpayer or an associate is a

controller; or

    (ii) a partnership; or

    (iii)  a trust;

  (e) that references in section 354 to a CFP are references to any

partnership;

  (f) that references in section 355 to a CFT are references to any trust.

&quot;Material decrease&quot;, &quot;material increase&quot; and &quot;total market value increase&quot;

&quot;Material decrease&quot;

  &quot;160ZZRO.(1) A decrease (the 'current decrease') in the market value of a

share involved in a share value shift is a 'material decrease' if:

  (a) the sum of the percentage of the current decrease and the percentages of

all other decreases (if any) in the market value of the share as a result of

share value shifts under the same arrangement (whether before or after the

current decrease) is at least 5%; or

  (b) the sum of all decreases in the market value of all shares whose market

value is decreased as a result of share value shifts at any time under the

same arrangement is at least $100,000.

&quot;Material increase&quot;

  &quot;(2) An increase (the 'current increase') in the market value of a share

involved in a share value shift is a 'material increase' if:

  (a) the sum of the percentage of the current increase and the percentages of

all other increases (if any) in the market value of the share as a result of

share value shifts under the same arrangement (whether before or after the

current increase) is at least 5%; or

  (b) the sum of all increases in the market value of all shares whose market

value is increased as a result of share value shifts at any time under the

same arrangement is at least $100,000.

&quot;Total market value increase&quot;

  &quot;(3) The 'total market value increase' in respect of an arrangement under

which one or more share value shifts take place is the sum of:

  (a) all increases in market value of all shares whose market value is

increased as a result of the share value shifts; and

  (b) all increases in market value of all other shares whose market value is

increased, where it is reasonable to conclude that the doing of the thing

mentioned in paragraph 160ZZRM(1)(a) in relation to any of the share value

shifts caused the increase.

Consequences of value shift to pre-CGT share

Section sets out consequences

  &quot;160ZZRP.(1) If the requirements of section 160ZZRL are satisfied and a

particular increased value share is a pre-CGT share, the following are the

consequences.

Deemed capital gain

  &quot;(2) If:

  (a) in respect of each decreased value share for which there was a material

decrease in market value, this Part were applied on the following

assumptions:

    (i) that a part of the share had been disposed of by its holder

immediately after the decrease in value of the share;

    (ii) that the consideration for the disposal was an amount worked

out using the formula:

   Increase in market value of      x     Decrease in market value of

  particular increased value share          decreased value share

    Total market value increase

    (iii) that the cost base or indexed cost base of the part was the

amount worked out by multiplying the amount that would be the cost base or

indexed cost base for the whole of the share if it were being disposed of at

the time, by the fraction worked out using the formula:

           Amount worked out under subparagraph (ii)

    Market value of the share immediately before the decrease

and

  (b) as a result a capital gain would accrue to the holder; then, for the

purposes of this Act, a capital gain of that amount is taken to accrue to the

holder for the year of income in respect of the disposal of an asset (even

though no asset was actually disposed of).

Adjustment to acquisition consideration etc. for decreased value share

  &quot;(3) Regardless of whether subsection (2) applies, for the purposes of any

application of this Part to a later disposal by the holder of any decreased

value share for which there was a material decrease in market value:

  (a) all amounts that, under section 160ZH (which deals with cost base,

indexed cost base and reduced cost base) are attributable to the share in

relation to the period before the decrease in value took place;

are taken to be reduced by:

  (b) the fraction worked out using the formula:

    Increase in market value of    .     Decrease in market value of

  particular increased value share    x    decreased value share

   Total market value increase           Market value of decreased

                                          value share immediately

                                            before the decrease

Consequences of value shift to post-CGT share

Section sets out consequences

  &quot;160ZZRQ.(1) If the requirements of section 160ZZRL are satisfied and a

particular increased value share is a post-CGT share, the following are the

consequences.

Deemed capital gain

  &quot;(2) If:

  (a) in respect of each decreased value share (a 'different person share'):

    (i) held by a person other than the holder of the particular

increased value share; and

    (ii) for which there was a material decrease in market value;

this Part were applied on the following assumptions:

    (iii) that a part of the different person share had been disposed

of by its holder immediately after the decrease in value of the share;

    (iv) that the consideration for the disposal was an amount worked

out using the formula:

   Increase in market value of    x    Decrease in market value of

    of particular increased              different person share

         value share

   Total market value increase

    (v) that the cost base or indexed cost base of the part was the

amount worked out by multiplying the amount that would be the cost base or

indexed cost base for the whole of the share if it were being disposed of at

the time, by the fraction worked out using the formula:

           Amount worked out under subparagraph (iv)

   Market value of the share immediately before the decrease

and

  (b) as a result a capital gain would accrue to the holder; then, for the

purposes of this Act, a capital gain of that amount is taken to accrue to the

holder for the year of income in respect of the disposal of an asset (even

though no asset was actually disposed of).

Adjustment to acquisition consideration etc. for decreased value share

  &quot;(3) For the purpose of any application of this Part to a later disposal by

the holder of any decreased value share for which there was a material

decrease in market value:

  (a) all amounts that, under section 160ZH (which deals with cost base,

indexed cost base and reduced cost base) are attributable to any such share in

relation to the period before the decrease in value took place;

are taken to be reduced by:

  (b) the fraction worked out using the formula:

    Increase in market value of    x    Decrease in market value of

  particular increased value share         decreased value share

    Total market value increase        Market value of decreased value

                                         share immediately before the

                                                  decrease.

Adjustment to cost base expenditure for increased value share

  &quot;(4) If there is a material increase (see subsection 160ZZRO(2)) in the

market value of the particular increased value share then, for the purposes of

any application of this Part to a later disposal of the particular increased

value share by the holder, the holder is taken to have incurred in relation to

the share, at the time of the increase in its market value, expenditure to

which paragraph 160ZH(1)(c), (2)(c) or (3)(c) applies that is equal to the sum

of the amounts qualifying under subsections (5) and (6) of this section.

Deemed expenditure referable to decreased value shares of different persons

  &quot;(5) One amount qualifying for the purposes of subsection (4) is the smaller

of the following:

  (a) the amount worked out by multiplying the increase in market value of the

particular increased value share, to the extent that the increase is reflected

in its market value at the time of the later disposal, by the following

fraction:

   Sum of decreases in market value of all different person shares

   Sum of decreases in market value of all decreased value shares;

  (b) the sum of the amounts worked out for each different person share using

the following formula:

    Increase in market value of     x     Decrease in market value

  particular increased value share        of different person share

    Total market value increase.

Deemed expenditure referable to decreased value shares of same person

  &quot;(6) The other amount qualifying for the purposes of subsection (4) is the

smallest of the following:

  (a) the amount worked out by multiplying the increase in market value of the

particular increased value share, to the extent that the increase is reflected

in its market value at the time of the later disposal, by the following

fraction:

             1 - fraction in paragraph (5)(a);

  (b) the sum of the amounts worked out for each share (a 'same person

share'):

    (i) held by the person who holds the particular increased value

share; and

    (ii) for which there was a material decrease in market value;

using the following formula:

    Increase in market value of    x      Decrease in market value

  particular increased value share         of same person share

    Total market value increase

  (c) the sum of the amounts of reductions that would result from the

application of subsection (3) if that subsection applied only to same person

shares.&quot;.

tax (the 'dividend rebate') in the holder's assessment for a year of income

under section 46 or 46A in respect of a dividend (the 'dividend amount') that

is taken, by subsection 159GZZZP(1), to be paid by the company in relation to

the purchase of the RDA share.

  &quot;(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), so much of the purchase price of

the RDA share as does not exceed the lesser of the dividend amount and the

amount worked out using the following formula is taken to be paid out of the

premiums:

  Purchase price  x  Total of all   -   Total of purchase prices

                     premiums on       paid out of those premiums

                 shares issued under    through a share premium

                  the arrangement             account

                    Total of purchase prices for all purchases of

                           shares under the arrangement

where:

  'Total of purchase prices paid out of those premiums through a share premium

account' means

  (a) if:

    (i) any amount (the 'credited amount') of the premiums on shares

issued under the arrangement was credited to a share premium account of the

company; and

    (ii) any amount (the 'share premium amount') of the purchase price

of shares under the arrangement was debited against amounts standing to the

credit of that account;

so much of the share premium amount as could reasonably be attributed to the

credited amount; or

  (b) in any other case-nil.

  &quot;(3) The amount of the rebatable dividend adjustment arising under

subsection (1) in relation to the RDA share is:

(Attributable amount -

        Amount (if any) of the share

          premium referred to in

          subparagraph (1)(a)(i)

  &quot;(4) A rebatable dividend adjustment also arises in relation to a share (the

'RDA share') if:

  (a) under an arrangement:

    (i) the RDA share is a share in the company; and

    (ii) the company buys the RDA share from the holder of the share;

and

    (iii)  the purchase is an off-market purchase; and

  (b) an amount (the 'attributable amount'), being the whole or a part of the

purchase price of the RDA share, is taken by subsection (5) to be paid out of

profits arising from the revaluation of an asset; and

  (c) had the company disposed of the asset immediately after the revaluation,

one or more of the following subparagraphs would have applied:

    (i) any profit that would have arisen on the disposal of the asset

would, in whole or in part, have been included in the assessable income of the

company;

    (ii) any loss that would have arisen from the disposal of the

asset would, in whole or in part, have been allowable as a deduction to the

company;

    (iii) Part IIIA would, or would but for Division 17 of that Part,

have applied in respect of the disposal of the asset; and

  (d) the holder of the RDA share is entitled to a rebate of tax (the

'dividend rebate') in the holder's assessment for a year of income under

section 46 or 46A in respect of an amount (the 'dividend amount') being so

much of the purchase price of the RDA share as is a dividend.

  &quot;(5) For the purposes of paragraph (4)(b), but subject to subsection (6), so

much of the purchase price as does not exceed the lesser of the dividend

amount and the amount worked out using the following formula is taken to be

paid out of the profit arising on the revaluation of the asset:

     Purchase price   x   Amount of profit arising on

                           revaluation of the asset

                        Total of purchase prices for all

                    purchases of shares under the arrangement

  &quot;(6) If a share purchase is made under an arrangement covered by both

paragraphs (1)(a) and (4)(a), the amount of the purchase price that would,

apart from this subsection, be taken by subsection (5) to be paid out of the

profit arising on the revaluation of the asset under the arrangement does not

exceed the amount that remains after deducting from the dividend amount any

part of the purchase price that is taken by subsection (2) to be paid out of

premiums on shares issued under the arrangement.

  &quot;(7) The amount of the rebatable dividend adjustment arising under

subsection (4) in relation to the RDA share is:

     Attributable amount       x       Amount of dividend rebate

                                  Amount of purchase   x   General

                                   price that is a         company

stock market of an approved stock exchange; and

  (a) at the end of the notional accounting period, either:

be, one or more other foreign companies were wholly-owned subsidiaries of the

holding company; and

considered together, were the active carrying on of life insurance business is

determined as follows:

  (a) first, work out for each subsidiary (including by applying subsections

507(3) to (11) (inclusive) in the same way as they apply for the purpose of

paragraph 507(2)(b)):

    (i) the gross value, at its test time, of the subsidiary's assets

for use in carrying on life insurance business; and
