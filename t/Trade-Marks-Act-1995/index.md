READER’S GUIDE 

This guide aims to give you a general idea of the purpose of this Act and some information about its structure. It also explains briefly how the operation and interpretation of this Act is affected by other Acts.

**Purpose of this Act**

This Act provides for the registration of trade marks, collective trade marks, certification trade marks and defensive trade marks (for a definition of these terms, see sections 17, 162, 169 and 185 respectively) and sets out and protects the rights deriving from registration. 

It is a rewrite of the legislation relating to trade marks, certification trade marks and defensive trade marks. The previous Act did not deal with collective trade marks. 

In rewriting the legislation, some changes have been made to reflect international trends towards greater uniformity in that field of law. In particular, this Act conforms with the minimum standards and principles prescribed for trade marks in the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization. 

An attempt has also been made to simplify the language as much as possible to make it easier for readers to understand the law. For that reason, a number of terms used in the old legislation have been replaced by simpler ones. For example, the word “owner” has been used where the previous Act referred to the proprietor of a trade mark. No difference in meaning is intended when simpler terms have thus been used.

**Summary of this Act**

Part 1:                       Deals with formal matters such as the commencement of this Act and its general application. 

Part 2:                       Contains definitions and terms that are used frequently throughout this Act. 

Part 3:                       Explains what is a trade mark and sets out the rights given by this Act to the registered owner and any authorised user of a registered trade mark. 

Parts 4 and 5:            Deal with the steps that you have to take to have a trade mark registered. 

Part 6:                       Sets out how and why an application for registration and other documents may be amended. 

Parts 7, 8 and 9:        Deal with the registration of trade marks and how and why particulars of the registration of a trade mark may be amended, cancelled or removed from the Register. 

Parts 10 and 11:        Deal with the assignment of trade marks, the registration of assignments of registered trade marks and the recording of the rights and interests that persons (other than registered owners) may have in registered trade marks or trade marks whose registration is being sought. 

Parts 12, 13 and 14:  Deal with the protection of trade marks. Part 12 sets out what constitutes an infringement of a trade mark and how to obtain redress and relief in cases of infringement. Part 13 provides for a special regime to deal with any importation of goods that would infringe a registered trade mark. Part 14 makes certain types of conduct offences against this Act. 

Parts 15, 16 and 17:  Explain what are collective trade marks, certification trade marks and defensive trade marks and apply to them, with necessary alterations, the provisions of this Act relating to trade marks. 

Part 17A:                  Enables the making of regulations to enable the performance of the obligations of Australia, or to obtain for Australia any advantage or benefit, under the Madrid Protocol. Those regulations prevail over this Act to the extent of any inconsistency.

Part 18:                     Deals with the jurisdiction of the courts to hear and determine matters arising under this Act. 

Parts 19 and 20:        Deal with the Trade Marks Office, the officials responsible for its administration and the keeping of the Register of Trade Marks. 

Part 21:                     Deals with miscellaneous matters such as the payment of fees, the service of documents and the making of regulations. 

Part 22:                            Repeals the _Trade Marks Act 1955_ and explains how matters that were being dealt with under that Act at the time of its repeal are to be dealt with when this Act is in force.

**How to use this Act**

_Definitions:_ Section 6 contains definitions of terms that have special meanings and are used frequently in this Act. A list of terms defined in section 6 appears after the Table of Provisions. _Notes:_ Notes are to be found throughout the text. They are designed to help you find your way through the Act. They may tell you that certain words or terms are defined and where to find the definition; they may alert you to other provisions in this Act and in other legislation that are relevant to the text you are reading; or they may draw your attention to information that may help you to understand the contents or legal consequences of certain provisions or how to comply with them. 

_Chart:_ The appendix to this Guide contains a chart showing the main steps involved in obtaining the registration of a trade mark. The chart is intended to be used only as an illustration and is not intended to have any other effect. If there is any inconsistency between any matter contained in the chart and a provision of this Act or the regulations, the provision prevails.

**Related legislation**

The following Acts are directly relevant to the operation or interpretation of this Act.

Acts Interpretation Act 1901 

That Act contains general rules about the meaning or effect of many terms and provisions that are commonly used in Commonwealth Acts. Some of the notes used in this Act draw your attention to some of them, but it is not possible to refer to all of them.

Crimes Act 1914 

In Parts 13 and 14, you will find that a penalty, expressed as imprisonment for a particular period or a number of penalty units, is set out at the foot of some sections or subsections. Section 4D of the _Crimes Act 1914_ provides that this indicates that any contravention of the section or subsection is an offence against this Act punishable upon conviction by a penalty not exceeding the penalty set out. 

If only a term of imprisonment is provided as the penalty for an offence, subsections 4B(2) and 4B(3) of the _Crimes Act 1914_ allow a court to impose an appropriate fine instead of, or in addition to, the term of imprisonment. 

Section 4AA of the _Crimes Act 1914_ sets out the amount of a penalty unit. Under subsection 4B(3) of that Act a court may impose on a body corporate convicted of an offence a fine of up to 5 times the amount of the fine that could be imposed on a natural person convicted of that offence. 

Criminal Code

The _Criminal Code_ is set out in the Schedule to the _Criminal Code Act 1995_. It contains many general rules that apply to offences. Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility. For example, it has default fault elements that apply to offences that do not specify a fault element and provides the consequences of an offence being an offence of strict liability.

Trade Marks Act 1955 

That Act is repealed by this Act. It contained the legislation that previously applied to trade marks, certification trade marks and defensive trade marks. Even though it is repealed, this Act provides that some of the provisions of that Act are to continue to apply to certain matters that were being dealt with under that Act immediately before it was repealed. 

The list of Acts cited above is not exhaustive. Other Acts may also affect the operation or interpretation of this Act.

immediately before the regulations were registered under the _Legislative Instruments Act 1995_.

##### <a id="20"></a>20  Rights given by registration of trade mark

             (1)  If a trade mark is registered, the registered owner of the trade mark has, subject to this Part, the exclusive rights:

                     (a)  to use the trade mark; and

                     (b)  to authorise other persons to use the trade mark;

in relation to the goods and/or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered.

Note 1:       For **_registered owner_** see section 6.

Note 2:       For **_use_** see section 7.

Note 3:       In addition, the regulations may provide for the effect of a protected international trade mark: see Part 17A.

             (2)  The registered owner of a trade mark has also the right to obtain relief under this Act if the trade mark has been infringed.

Note:          For what amounts to an infringement of a trade mark see Part 12.

             (3)  The rights are taken to have accrued to the registered owner as from the date of registration of the trade mark.

Note:          For **_date of registration_** see section 6.

             (4)  If the trade mark is registered subject to conditions or limitations, the rights of the registered owner are restricted by those conditions or limitations.

Note:          For **_limitations_** see section 6.

             (1)  A registered trade mark is personal property.

             (1)  Before a trade mark is registered, the Registrar may revoke the acceptance of the application for registration of the trade mark if he or she is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the application should not have been accepted, taking account of all the circumstances that existed when the application was accepted (whether or not the Registrar knew then of their existence); and

                     (b)  it is reasonable to revoke the acceptance, taking account of all the circumstances.

             (2)  If the Registrar revokes the acceptance:

                     (a)  the application is taken to have never been accepted; and

                     (b)  the Registrar must examine, and report on, the application as necessary under section 31; and

                     (c)  sections 33 and 34 again apply in relation to the application.

### Division 2—Grounds for rejecting an application

##### <a id="39"></a>39  Trade mark containing etc. certain signs

             (1)  An application for the registration of a trade mark must be rejected if the trade mark contains or consists of a sign that, under regulations made for the purposes of section 18, is not to be used as a trade mark.

             (2)  An application for the registration of a trade mark may be rejected if the trade mark contains or consists of:

                     (a)  a sign that is prescribed for the purposes of this subsection; or

                     (b)  a sign so nearly resembling:

                              (i)  a sign referred to in paragraph (a); or

                             (ii)  a sign referred to in subsection (1);

as to be likely to be taken for it.

##### <a id="40"></a>40  Trade mark that cannot be represented graphically

                   An application for the registration of a trade mark must be rejected if the trade mark cannot be represented graphically.

##### <a id="41"></a>41  Trade mark not distinguishing applicant’s goods or services

             (1)  For the purposes of this section, the use of a trade mark by a predecessor in title of an applicant for the registration of the trade mark is taken to be a use of the trade mark by the applicant.

Note 1:       For **_applicant_** and **_predecessor in title_** see section 6.

Note 2:       If a predecessor in title had authorised another person to use the trade mark, any authorised use of the trade mark by the other person is taken to be a use of the trade mark by the predecessor in title (see subsection 7(3) and section 8).

             (2)  An application for the registration of a trade mark must be rejected if the trade mark is not capable of distinguishing the applicant’s goods or services in respect of which the trade mark is sought to be registered (**_designated goods or services_**) from the goods or services of other persons.

Note:          For **_goods of a person_** and **_services of a person_** see section 6.

             (3)  In deciding the question whether or not a trade mark is capable of distinguishing the designated goods or services from the goods or services of other persons, the Registrar must first take into account the extent to which the trade mark is inherently adapted to distinguish the designated goods or services from the goods or services of other persons.

             (4)  Then, if the Registrar is still unable to decide the question, the following provisions apply.

             (5)  If the Registrar finds that the trade mark is to some extent inherently adapted to distinguish the designated goods or services from the goods or services of other persons but is unable to decide, on that basis alone, that the trade mark is capable of so distinguishing the designated goods or services:

                     (a)  the Registrar is to consider whether, because of the combined effect of the following:

                              (i)  the extent to which the trade mark is inherently adapted to distinguish the designated goods or services;

                             (ii)  the use, or intended use, of the trade mark by the applicant;

                            (iii)  any other circumstances;

                            the trade mark does or will distinguish the designated goods or services as being those of the applicant; and

                     (b)  if the Registrar is then satisfied that the trade mark does or will so distinguish the designated goods or services—the trade mark is taken to be capable of distinguishing the applicant’s goods or services from the goods or services of other persons; and

                     (c)  if the Registrar is not satisfied that the trade mark does or will so distinguish the designated goods or services—the trade mark is taken not to be capable of distinguishing the applicant’s goods or services from the goods or services of other persons.

Note 1:       For **_goods of a person_** and **_services of a person_** see section 6.

Note 2:       Use of a trade mark by a predecessor in title of an applicant and an authorised use of a trade mark by another person are each taken to be use of the trade mark by the applicant (see subsections (1) and 7(3) and section 8).

             (6)  If the Registrar finds that the trade mark is not to any extent inherently adapted to distinguish the designated goods or services from the goods or services of other persons, the following provisions apply:

                     (a)  if the applicant establishes that, because of the extent to which the applicant has used the trade mark before the filing date in respect of the application, it does distinguish the designated goods or services as being those of the applicant—the trade mark is taken to be capable of distinguishing the designated goods or services from the goods or services of other persons;

                     (b)  in any other case—the trade mark is taken not to be capable of distinguishing the designated goods or services from the goods or services of other persons.

Note 1:       Trade marks that are not inherently adapted to distinguish goods or services are mostly trade marks that consist wholly of a sign that is ordinarily used to indicate:

(a)  the kind, quality, quantity, intended purpose, value, geographical origin, or some other characteristic, of goods or services; or 

(b)  the time of production of goods or of the rendering of services.

Note 2:       Use of a trade mark by a predecessor in title of an applicant and an authorised use of a trade mark by another person are each taken to be use of the trade mark by the applicant (see subsections (1) and 7(3) and section 8).

##### <a id="42"></a>42  Trade mark scandalous or its use contrary to law

                   An application for the registration of a trade mark must be rejected if:

                     (a)  the trade mark contains or consists of scandalous matter; or

                     (b)  its use would be contrary to law.

##### <a id="43"></a>43  Trade mark likely to deceive or cause confusion

                   An application for the registration of a trade mark in respect of particular goods or services must be rejected if, because of some connotation that the trade mark or a sign contained in the trade mark has, the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods or services would be likely to deceive or cause confusion.

##### <a id="44"></a>44  Identical etc. trade marks

             (1)  Subject to subsections (3) and (4), an application for the registration of a trade mark (**_applicant’s trade mark_**) in respect of goods (**_applicant’s goods_**) must be rejected if:

                     (a)  the applicant’s trade mark is substantially identical with, or deceptively similar to:

                              (i)  a trade mark registered by another person in respect of similar goods or closely related services; or

                             (ii)  a trade mark whose registration in respect of similar goods or closely related services is being sought by another person; and

                     (b)  the priority date for the registration of the applicant’s trade mark in respect of the applicant’s goods is not earlier than the priority date for the registration of the other trade mark in respect of the similar goods or closely related services.

Note 1:       For **_deceptively similar_** see section 10.

Note 2:       For **_similar goods_** see subsection 14(1).

Note 3:       For **_priority date_** see section 12.

Note 4:       The regulations may provide that an application must also be rejected if the trade mark is substantially identical with, or deceptively similar to, a protected international trade mark or a trade mark for which there is a request to extend international registration to Australia: see Part 17A.

             (2)  Subject to subsections (3) and (4), an application for the registration of a trade mark (**_applicant’s trade mark_**) in respect of services (**_applicant’s services_**) must be rejected if:

                     (a)  it is substantially identical with, or deceptively similar to:

                              (i)  a trade mark registered by another person in respect of similar services or closely related goods; or

                             (ii)  a trade mark whose registration in respect of similar services or closely related goods is being sought by another person; and

                     (b)  the priority date for the registration of the applicant’s trade mark in respect of the applicant’s services is not earlier than the priority date for the registration of the other trade mark in respect of the similar services or closely related goods.

Note 1:       For **_deceptively similar_** see section 10.

Note 2:       For **_similar services_** see subsection 14(2).

Note 3:       For **_priority date_** see section 12.

Note 4:       The regulations may provide that an application must also be rejected if the trade mark is substantially identical with, or deceptively similar to, a protected international trade mark or a trade mark for which there is a request to extend international registration to Australia: see Part 17A.

             (3)  If the Registrar in either case is satisfied:

                     (a)  that there has been honest concurrent use of the 2 trade marks; or

                     (b)  that, because of other circumstances, it is proper to do so;

the Registrar may accept the application for the registration of the applicant’s trade mark subject to any conditions or limitations that the Registrar thinks fit to impose. If the applicant’s trade mark has been used only in a particular area, the limitations may include that the use of the trade mark is to be restricted to that particular area.

Note:          For **_limitations_** see section 6.

             (4)  If the Registrar in either case is satisfied that the applicant, or the applicant and the predecessor in title of the applicant, have continuously used the applicant’s trade mark for a period:

                     (a)  beginning before the priority date for the registration of the other trade mark in respect of:

                              (i)  the similar goods or closely related services; or

                             (ii)  the similar services or closely related goods; and

                     (b)  ending on the priority date for the registration of the applicant’s trade mark;

the Registrar may not reject the application because of the existence of the other trade mark.

Note 1:       An authorised use of the trade mark by a person is taken to be a use of the trade mark by the owner of the trade mark (see subsection 7(3)).

Note 2:       For **_predecessor in title_** see section 6.

Note 3:       For **_priority date_** see section 12.

### Division 3—Divisional applications

##### <a id="45"></a>45  Divisional applications

             (1)  If a single application for the registration of a trade mark in respect of certain goods and/or services is pending (**_parent application_**), the applicant may make another application (**_divisional application_**) for the registration of the trade mark in respect of some only of the goods and/or services in respect of which registration is sought under the parent application.

Note:          For **_applicant_** and **_pending_** see section 6.

             (2)  To avoid doubt, the parent application may itself be a divisional application.

Note:          A divisional application may be made by a person who has become the applicant in relation to the parent application because of subsection 108(2) (which deals with assignment and transmission).

##### <a id="46"></a>46  Rules relating to divisional applications

             (1)  A divisional application must:

                     (a)  be for the registration of the trade mark to which the parent application relates; and

                     (b)  specify the goods and/or services to which it relates; and

                     (c)  specify the goods and/or services that are to remain in the parent application.

Note:          For **_divisional application_** and **_parent application_** see section 45.

             (2)  When a divisional application is made, the Registrar must, unless the parent application has lapsed, amend the parent application by excluding the goods and/or services in respect of which the divisional application is made.

Note:          Section 204 requires the Registrar, where no time or period is specified for doing a thing, to do the thing as soon as practicable. However, it is possible that a parent application will lapse before it is practicable for the Registrar to amend it under subsection (2) of this section.

### Division 4—Application for registration of series of trade marks

##### <a id="51"></a>51  Application—series of trade marks

             (1)  A person may make a single application under subsection 27(1) for the registration of 2 or more trade marks in respect of goods and/or services if the trade marks resemble each other in material particulars and differ only in respect of one or more of the following matters:

                     (a)  statements or representations as to the goods or services in relation to which the trade marks are used or are intended to be used;

                     (b)  statements or representations as to number, price, quality or names of places;

                     (c)  the colour of any part of the trade mark.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  the application meets all the requirements of this Act; and

                     (b)  the Registrar is required (under section 68) to register the trade marks;

he or she must register them as a series in one registration.

##### <a id="51A"></a>51A  Linking series applications

             (1)  Subsection (2) applies if:

                     (a)  before the commencement of this section, 2 or more applications (**_series applications_**) were made each seeking the registration of the same 2 or more trade marks in respect of goods or services of different classes; and

                     (b)  the filing date of each of the series applications is the same; and

                     (c)  each of the trade marks has the same owner.

Note:          For **_filing date_** see section 6.

             (2)  The owner of the trade marks may apply to the Registrar, in writing, to have:

                     (a)  the series applications; or

                     (b)  so many of the series applications as are identified in the application to the Registrar;

dealt with under this Act as if they were one application for the registration of the trade marks in respect of all goods and services specified in the series applications or the identified series applications.

Note:          For **_this Act_** see section 6.

             (3)  If an application is made under subsection (2), the Registrar must deal with the series applications that are the subject of the application under that subsection as if they were one application.

## Part 5—Opposition to registration

### Division 1—General

##### <a id="52"></a>52  Opposition

             (1)  If the Registrar has accepted an application for the registration of a trade mark, a person may oppose the registration by filing a notice of opposition.

             (2)  The notice of opposition must be in an approved form and must be filed within the prescribed period or within that period as extended in accordance with the regulations or in accordance with subsection (5).

Note:          For **_approved form_** and **_file_** see section 6.

             (3)  The opponent must serve a copy of the notice on the applicant.

Note:          For **_opponent_** see section 6.

             (4)  The registration of a trade mark may be opposed on any of the grounds specified in this Act and on no other grounds.

Note:          For **_this Act_** see section 6.

             (5)  If:

                     (a)  a person is granted an extension of time in which to file a notice of opposition; and

                     (b)  before the notice of opposition is filed, the right or interest on which the person could have relied to file the notice of opposition becomes vested in another person; and

                     (c)  the other person notifies the Registrar in writing that the right or interest is vested in him or her;

then:

                     (d)  the other person is taken to have been granted an extension of time in which to file the notice of opposition; and

                     (e)  that extension ends when the extension mentioned in paragraph (a) ends.

##### <a id="53"></a>53  Circumstances in which opposition may proceed in name of a person other than the person who filed the notice

                   If:

                     (a)  after a person has filed a notice of opposition, the right or interest on which the person relied to file the notice of opposition becomes vested in another person; and

                     (b)  the other person:

                              (i)  notifies the Registrar in writing that the right or interest is vested in him or her; and

                             (ii)  does not withdraw the opposition;

the opposition is to proceed as if the notice of opposition had been filed in that other person’s name.

Note:          For **_file_** see section 6.

##### <a id="54"></a>54  Opposition proceedings

             (1)  The Registrar must give to the opponent and to the applicant an opportunity of being heard on the opposition.

Note:          For **_opponent_** and **_applicant_** see section 6.

             (2)  Subject to subsection (1), the proceedings for dealing with the opposition must be in accordance with the regulations.

##### <a id="55"></a>55  Decision

             (1)  Unless the proceedings are discontinued or dismissed, the Registrar must, at the end, decide:

                     (a)  to refuse to register the trade mark; or

                     (b)  to register the trade mark (with or without conditions or limitations) in respect of the goods and/or services then specified in the application;

having regard to the extent (if any) to which any ground on which the application was opposed has been established.

Note:          For **_limitations_** see section 6.

             (2)  Without limiting subsection (1), if the application was opposed on the ground specified in paragraph 62(a) (that the application, or a document filed in support of the application, was amended contrary to this Act), the Registrar may revoke the acceptance of the application and examine the application again under section 31.

Note:          For **_examine_** and **_this Act_** see section 6.

##### <a id="56"></a>56  Appeal

                   The applicant or the opponent may appeal to the Federal Court from a decision of the Registrar under section 55.

Note:          For **_applicant_** and **_opponent_** see section 6.

### Division 2—Grounds for opposing registration

##### <a id="57"></a>57  Registration may be opposed on same grounds as for rejection

                   The registration of a trade mark may be opposed on any of the grounds on which an application for the registration of a trade mark may be rejected under this Act, except the ground that the trade mark cannot be represented graphically.

Note:          For **_this Act_** see section 6.

##### <a id="58"></a>58  Applicant not owner of trade mark

                   The registration of a trade mark may be opposed on the ground that the applicant is not the owner of the trade mark.

Note:          For **_applicant_** see section 6.

##### <a id="58A"></a>58A  Opponent’s earlier use of similar trade mark

             (1)  This section applies to a trade mark (**_section 44 trade mark_**) the application for registration of which has been accepted because of:

                     (a)  subsection 44(4); or

                     (b)  a similar provision of the regulations made for the purposes of Part 17A.

Note:          Subsection 44(4) prevents rejection of an application for registration of a trade mark that is substantially identical with, or deceptively similar to, a registered trade mark or a trade mark whose registration is being sought where the first‑mentioned trade mark has been continuously used since before the priority date of the other trade mark.

             (2)  The registration of the section 44 trade mark may be opposed on the ground that the owner of the substantially identical or deceptively similar trade mark (**_similar trade mark_**) or the predecessor in title:

                     (a)  first used the similar trade mark in respect of:

                              (i)  similar goods or closely related services; or

                             (ii)  similar services or closely related goods;

                            before the owner of the section 44 trade mark or the predecessor in title in relation to the section 44 trade mark first used the section 44 trade mark; and

                     (b)  has continuously used the similar trade mark in respect of those goods or services since that first use.

Note:          For **_predecessor in title_** see section 6.

##### <a id="59"></a>59  Applicant not intending to use trade mark

                   The registration of a trade mark may be opposed on the ground that the applicant does not intend:

                     (a)  to use, or authorise the use of, the trade mark in Australia; or

                     (b)  to assign the trade mark to a body corporate for use by the body corporate in Australia;

in relation to the goods and/or services specified in the application.

Note:          For **_applicant_** see section 6.

##### <a id="60"></a>60  Trade mark similar to trade mark that has acquired a reputation in Australia

                   The registration of a trade mark in respect of particular goods or services may be opposed on the ground that:

                     (a)  another trade mark had, before the priority date for the registration of the first‑mentioned trade mark in respect of those goods or services, acquired a reputation in Australia; and

                     (b)  because of the reputation of that other trade mark, the use of the first‑mentioned trade mark would be likely to deceive or cause confusion.

Note:          For **_priority date_** see section 12.

##### <a id="61"></a>61  Trade mark containing or consisting of a false geographical indication

             (1)  The registration of a trade mark in respect of particular goods (**_relevant goods_**) may be opposed on the ground that the trade mark contains or consists of a sign that is a geographical indication for goods (**_designated goods_**) originating in:

                     (a)  a country, or in a region or locality in a country, other than the country in which the relevant goods originated; or

                     (b)  a region or locality in the country in which the relevant goods originated other than the region or locality in which the relevant goods originated;

if the relevant goods are similar to the designated goods or the use of a trade mark in respect of the relevant goods would be likely to deceive or cause confusion.

             (2)  An opposition on a ground referred to in subsection (1) fails if the applicant establishes that:

                     (a)  the relevant goods originated in the country, region or locality identified by the geographical indication; or

                    (aa)  the sign is not recognised as a geographical indication for the designated goods in the country in which the designated goods originated; or

                     (b)  the sign has ceased to be used as a geographical indication for the designated goods in the country in which the designated goods originated; or

                     (c)  the applicant, or a predecessor in title of the applicant, used the sign in good faith in respect of the relevant goods, or applied in good faith for the registration of the trade mark in respect of the relevant goods, before:

                              (i)  1 January 1996; or

                             (ii)  the day on which the sign was recognised as a geographical indication for the designated goods in their country of origin;

                            whichever is the later; or

                     (d)  if the registration of the trade mark is being sought in respect of wine or spirits (**_relevant wine or spirits_**)—the sign is identical with the name that, on 1 January 1995, was, in the country in which the relevant wine or spirits originated, the customary name of a variety of grapes used in the production of the relevant wine or spirits.

             (3)  An opposition on a ground referred to in subsection (1) also fails if the applicant establishes that:

                     (a)  although the sign is a geographical indication for the designated goods, it is also a geographical indication for the relevant goods; and

                     (b)  the applicant has not used, and does not intend to use, the trade mark in relation to the relevant goods in a way that is likely to deceive or confuse members of the public as to the origin of the relevant goods.

             (4)  An opposition on a ground referred to in subsection (1) also fails if the applicant establishes that:

                     (a)  the sign consists of a word or term that is a geographical indication; and

                     (b)  the word or term is a common English word or term; and

                     (c)  the applicant has not used, and does not intend to use, the trade mark in relation to the relevant goods in a way that is likely to deceive or confuse members of the public as to the origin of the relevant goods.

Note 1:       For **_applicant_**,**_predecessor in title_** and **_geographical indication_** see section 6.

Note 2:       For **_originate_**(in relation to wine only) see section 15.

##### <a id="62"></a>62  Application etc. defective etc.

                   The registration of a trade mark may be opposed on any of the following grounds:

                     (a)  that the application, or a document filed in support of the application, was amended contrary to this Act;

                     (b)  that the Registrar accepted the application for registration on the basis of evidence or representations that were false in material particulars.

Note:          For **_file_** see section 6.

##### <a id="62A"></a>62A  Application made in bad faith

                   The registration of a trade mark may be opposed on the ground that the application was made in bad faith.

## Part 6—Amendment of application for registration of a trade mark and other documents

##### <a id="63"></a>63  Amendment of application for registration of trade mark

             (1)  The Registrar may, at the request of the applicant or of his or her agent, amend an application for the registration of a trade mark in accordance with section 64, 65 or 65A.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  an application for the registration of a trade mark may be amended under section 65; and

                     (b)  the applicant has not asked that the application be amended;

the Registrar may, on his or her own initiative but in accordance with the regulations, amend the application as necessary:

                     (c)  to remove any ground on which the application could be rejected; or

                     (d)  so as to ensure that the application is made in accordance with this Act.

##### <a id="64"></a>64  Amendment before particulars of application are published

                   If:

                     (a)  the particulars of the application have not yet been published under section 30; and

                     (b)  the request for the amendment is made within the prescribed period;

an amendment may be made to correct a clerical error or an obvious mistake.

             (1)  The Registrar must, within the period provided under the regulations, register a trade mark that has been accepted for registration:

                     (b)  in a case where there has been an opposition:

                              (i)  if the Registrar’s decision, or (in the case of an appeal against the Registrar’s decision) the decision on appeal, is that the trade mark should be registered; or

                             (ii)  if the opposition has been withdrawn; or

                            (iii)  if the opposition has been dismissed under section 222.

Otherwise, the application for the registration of the trade mark lapses.

##### <a id="69"></a>69  Registration—how effected

##### <a id="70"></a>70  Colours in registered trade marks

             (1)  A trade mark may be registered with limitations as to colour.

             (2)  The limitations may be in respect of the whole, or a part, of the trade mark.

Note:          For **_limitations_** see section 6.

##### <a id="72"></a>72  Date and term of registration

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), the registration of a trade mark in respect of the goods and/or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered is taken to have had effect from (and including) the filing date in respect of the application for registration.

Note:          For **_filing date_** see section 6.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  the application was in respect of a trade mark whose registration had also been sought in one or more than one Convention country; and

                     (b)  the applicant claimed a right of priority under section 29 for the registration of the trade mark in respect of particular goods or services; and

                     (c)  the trade mark is registered under this Act;

the registration of the trade mark in respect of those goods or services is taken to have had effect:

                     (d)  if an application to register the trade mark was made in only one Convention country—from (and including) the day on which the application was made in that country; or

                     (e)  if applications to register the trade mark were made in more than one Convention country—from (and including) the day on which the earliest of those applications was made.

Note:          Section 84C explains the effect of revocation of the registration of a trade mark, applying some provisions as if the registration had ceased at a particular time (but for most purposes treating the registration as if it had never occurred).

##### <a id="74"></a>74  Disclaimers

             (1)  An applicant for the registration of a trade mark, or the registered owner of a registered trade mark, may, by notice in writing given to the Registrar, disclaim any exclusive right to use, or authorise the use of, a specified part of the trade mark.

             (1)  This section applies to a registered trade mark if:

                     (b)  at the time when the particulars of registration of the trade mark were entered in the Register, the obligation did not exist.

             (2)  The registered owner of the registered trade mark may, in writing, request the Registrar to do either or both of the following:

                     (b)  a trade mark that is being used by the person in respect of similar or closely related goods or similar or closely related services.

Note:          In certain circumstances a person cannot oppose the granting of a request under this subsection (see subsection (7)).

             (5)  The Registrar may grant the request for the amendment if he or she is satisfied that the amendment is reasonable, having regard to:

                     (a)  the extent to which the amendment relates to the inconsistency; and

                     (b)  whether the amendment involves replacing a term (the **_existing term_**) with another term that is recognised by the industry in which the trade mark is used as being a substitute for the existing term; and

                     (c)  if a person has opposed the request for the amendment under subsection (4)—the extent (if any) to which the ground on which the request was opposed has been established; and

                     (d)  in any case—any other relevant circumstance.

             (6)  The Registrar may grant the request for the amendment even if the amendment would:

                     (a)  substantially affect the identity of the trade mark; or

                     (b)  extend the rights that the registered owner has under the registration.

             (7)  If the Registrar is satisfied that the request for the amendment would not be granted even in the absence of opposition under subsection (4):

                             (ii)  to register the trade mark only if the registration were subject to conditions or limitations to which the registration was not actually subject.

             (3)  The circumstances to be taken into account under paragraph (1)(b) include the following:

                     (a)  any use that has been made of the trade mark;

                              (i)  to revoke the registration; or

                             (ii)  not to revoke the registration.

Note:          For **_use of a trade mark_** see section 6.

Prerequisites to revocation decision

             (4)  The Registrar may revoke the registration of the trade mark only if the Registrar gives notice of the proposed revocation to each of the following persons in accordance with the regulations within 12 months of registering the trade mark:

                     (a)  the registered owner of the trade mark;

                     (b)  any person recorded under Part 11 as claiming a right in respect of, or an interest in, the trade mark.

Note:          For **_registered owner_** see section 6.

                     (a)  the registered owner of the trade mark;

                     (b)  any person recorded under Part 11 as claiming a right in respect of, or an interest in, the trade mark.

Note:          For **_registered owner_** see section 6.

No duty to consider whether to revoke

             (6)  The Registrar does not have a duty to consider whether to revoke the registration under this section, whether or not the Registrar is requested to do so.

##### <a id="84B"></a>84B  Registration must be revoked if opposition was ignored in registration process

                   The Registrar must revoke the registration of a trade mark if:

                     (a)  either:

                              (i)  a notice of opposition to the registration was filed in accordance with subsection 52(2); or

                             (ii)  before the registration, a person applied in accordance with the regulations for an extension of the period for filing a notice of opposition to the registration; and

                     (b)  the Registrar failed to take account of the opposition or application in deciding to register the trade mark; and

                     (c)  the Registrar becomes aware of the failure within 1 month after the notice was filed or the application was made.

The revocation must be done within that month.

Note:          If the Registrar becomes aware of the failure later, he or she may be able to revoke the registration under section 84A.

##### <a id="84C"></a>84C  Effect of revocation of registration

             (1)  This section applies if the Registrar revokes the registration of a trade mark under section 84A or 84B.

             (2)  This Act generally applies as if the registration had never occurred, but:

                     (a)  subsection 129(4) applies as if the trade mark had ceased to be registered at the time of the revocation; and

                     (b)  if the Customs CEO, purporting to act under Part 13, seizes goods in respect of which the trade mark was registered before the revocation, the Commonwealth is not liable for any loss or damage suffered because of the seizure, unless:

                              (i)  the Registrar gives the Customs CEO written notice of the revocation; and

                             (ii)  the seizure occurs after the notice is given to the Customs CEO; and

                     (c)  Part 14 applies as if the trade mark had ceased to be registered at the time of the revocation; and

                     (d)  subsection 230(2) applies in relation to a defendant who was the registered owner of the trade mark before the revocation as if the trade mark had ceased to be registered at the time of the revocation; and

                     (e)  subsection 230(2) applies in relation to a defendant who was an authorised user of the trade mark before the revocation as if the trade mark had ceased to be registered at the time the defendant became aware of the revocation.

Note:          For **_registered owner_** see section 6.

             (3)  To avoid doubt, paragraph (2)(b) does not, by itself, make the Commonwealth liable if the circumstances described in subparagraphs (2)(b)(i) and (ii) exist.

             (4)  This Act applies as if, just after the revocation:

                     (a)  the application for registration of the trade mark reflected the particulars in the Register for the trade mark just before the revocation; and

                     (b)  the applicant for registration of the trade mark were the person in whose name the trade mark was registered just before the revocation.

             (5)  This subsection has effect if the Registrar revokes the acceptance of the application for registration of the trade mark after revoking the registration. The Registrar may, but need not, examine the application again under section 31 before rejecting the application. This has effect despite paragraph 38(2)(b).

##### <a id="84D"></a>84D  Appeal from revocation of registration

                   An appeal lies to the Federal Court from a decision of the Registrar to revoke the registration of a trade mark under section 84A.

                     (b)  describes or is the name of:

the court may decide not to make an order under subsection (1) and allow the trade mark to remain on the Register in respect of:

                     (c)  the article or substance or goods of the same description; or

                     (d)  the service or services of the same description;

subject to any condition or limitation that the court may impose.

Note 1:       Sections 24 and 25 provide that the registered owner of a trade mark does not have exclusive rights to use, or to authorise the use of, the trade mark if it consists of, or contains, a sign that: 

(a)  becomes generally accepted within the relevant trade as the sign that describes or is the name of an article, substance or service; or 

(b)  is the only commonly known way to describe or identify an article formerly exploited under a patent, or a service formerly provided as a patented process, where the patent has expired more than 2 years ago.

                     (b)  an amendment of the application for the registration of the trade mark was obtained as a result of fraud, false suggestion or misrepresentation;

                             (c)  because of the circumstances applying at the time when the application for rectification is filed, the use of the trade mark is likely to deceive or cause confusion;

                     (e)  if the application is in respect of an entry in the Register—the entry was made, or has been previously amended, as a result of fraud, false suggestion or misrepresentation.

if the registered owner of the trade mark satisfies the court that the ground relied on by the applicant has not arisen through any act or fault of the registered owner.

Note:          For **_registered owner_** see section 6.

             (2)  In making a decision under subsection (1), the court:

                     (a)  must also take into account any matter that is prescribed; and

                     (a)  must be in accordance with the regulations; and

                     (b)  may be made in respect of any or all of the goods and/or services in respect of which the trade mark may be, or is, registered.

             (3)  An application may not be made to the Registrar under subsection (1) if an action concerning the trade mark is pending in a prescribed court, but the person may apply to the court for an order directing the Registrar to remove the trade mark from the Register.

Note:          For **_prescribed court_** see section 190.

             (4)  An application under subsection (1) or (3) (**_non‑use application_**) may be made on either or both of the following grounds, and on no other grounds:

                            in relation to the goods and/or services to which the non‑use application relates and that the registered owner:

                            (iv)  has not used the trade mark in Australia; or

                             (v)  has not used the trade mark in good faith in Australia;

Note 2:       If non‑use of a trade mark has been established in a particular place or export market, then instead of the trade mark being removed from the Register, conditions or limitations may be imposed under section 102 on the registration of the trade mark so that its registration does not extend to that place or export market.

             (5)  If the right or interest on which a person relied to make an application (under subsection (1) or (3)) to obtain the removal of a trade mark from the Register becomes vested in another person, the other person may, on giving notice of the relevant facts to the Registrar or the court (as the case requires), be substituted for the first‑mentioned person as the applicant.

                              (i)  to use the trade mark in Australia; or

                             (ii)  to authorise the use of the trade mark in Australia; or

                            (iii)  to assign the trade mark to a body corporate for use by the body corporate in Australia;

                            in relation to the goods and/or services to which the opposed application relates (**_relevant goods and/or services_**); or

                     (b)  any allegation made under paragraph 92(4)(a) that the trade mark has not, at any time before the period of one month ending on the day on which the opposed application was filed, been used, or been used in good faith, by its registered owner in relation to the relevant goods and/or services; or

                     (c)  any allegation made under paragraph 92(4)(b) that the trade mark has not, at any time during the period of 3 years ending one month before the day on which the opposed application was filed, been used, or been used in good faith, by its registered owner in relation to the relevant goods and/or services.

Note 1:       If the registered owner of the trade mark has authorised another person to use it, any authorised use of the trade mark by that person is taken to be a use of the trade mark by the registered owner (see subsection 7(3)).

Note 2:       For **_file_**, **_month_** and **_registered owner_** see section 6.

             (2)  For the purposes of paragraph 1(b), the opponent is taken to have rebutted the allegation that the trade mark has not, at any time before the period referred to in that paragraph, been used, or been used in good faith, by its registered owner in relation to the relevant goods and/or services if:

                     (a)  the opponent has established that the trade mark or the trade mark with additions or alterations not substantially affecting its identity, was used in good faith by its registered owner in relation to those goods or services before that period; or

                     (b)  in a case where the trade mark has been assigned but a record of the assignment has not been entered in the Register:

                              (i)  the opponent has established that the trade mark, or the trade mark with additions or alterations not substantially affecting its identity, was used in good faith by the assignee in relation to those goods or services before that period and that that use was in accordance with the terms of the assignment; and

                             (ii)  the Registrar or the court is of the opinion that it is reasonable, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, to treat the use of the trade mark by the assignee before that period as having been a use of the trade mark in relation to those goods or services by the registered owner.

Note 1:       If the registered owner of the trade mark has authorised another person to use it, any authorised use of the trade mark by that person is taken to be a use of the trade mark by the registered owner (see subsection 7(3)).

Note 2:       For **_registered owner_** see section 6.

             (3)  For the purposes of paragraph 1(c), the opponent is taken to have rebutted the allegation that the trade mark has not, at any time during the period referred to in that paragraph, been used, or been used in good faith, by its registered owner in relation to the relevant goods and/or services if:

                     (a)  the opponent has established that the trade mark, or the trade mark with additions or alterations not substantially affecting its identity, was used in good faith by its registered owner in relation to those goods or services during that period; or

                     (b)  in a case where the trade mark has been assigned but a record of the assignment has not been entered in the Register:

                              (i)  the opponent has established that the trade mark, or the trade mark with additions or alterations not substantially affecting its identity, was used in good faith by the assignee of the trade mark in relation to those goods or services during that period and that that use was in accordance with the terms of the assignment; and

                             (ii)  the Registrar or the court is of the opinion that it is reasonable, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, to treat the use of the trade mark by the assignee during that period as having been a use of the trade mark in relation to those goods or services by the registered owner; or

                     (c)  the opponent has established that the trade mark was not used by its registered owner in relation to those goods and/or services during that period because of circumstances (whether affecting traders generally or only the registered owner of the trade mark) that were an obstacle to the use of the trade mark during that period.

Note 1:       If the registered owner of the trade mark has authorised another person to use it, any authorised use of the trade mark by that person is taken to be a use of the trade mark by the registered owner (see subsection 7(3)).

Note 2:       For **_registered owner_** see section 6.

##### <a id="101"></a>101  Determination of opposed application—general

             (1)  Subject to subsection (3) and to section 102, if:

                     (a)  the proceedings relating to an opposed application have not been discontinued or dismissed; and

                     (b)  the Registrar is satisfied that the grounds on which the application was made have been established;

the Registrar may decide to remove the trade mark from the Register in respect of any or all of the goods and/or services to which the application relates.

             (3)  If satisfied that it is reasonable to do so, the Registrar or the court may decide that the trade mark should not be removed from the Register even if the grounds on which the application was made have been established.

             (4)  Without limiting the matters the Registrar may take into account in deciding under subsection (3) not to remove a trade mark from the Register, the Registrar may take into account whether the trade mark has been used by its registered owner in respect of:

                     (a)  similar goods or closely related services; or

                     (b)  similar services or closely related goods;

to those to which the application relates.

Note 1:       If the registered owner of the trade mark has authorised another person to use it, any authorised use of the trade mark by that person is taken to be a use of the trade mark by the registered owner (see subsection 7(3)).

                              (i)  goods or services dealt with or provided in the specified place; or

                             (ii)  goods or services to be exported to the specified market;

the Registrar may decide, or the court may order, that the challenged trade mark should not be removed from the Register but that the registration of the trade mark should be subject to the conditions or limitations that the Registrar or the court considers necessary to ensure that the registration does not extend to the use of the trade mark in relation to:

                     (c)  goods or services dealt with or provided in the specified place; or

                     (d)  goods or services to be exported to the specified market.

                     (a)  a trade mark has been used in good faith during a particular period; or

                     (b)  a trade mark has not been used during a particular period solely because of circumstances that were an obstacle to its use;

the Registrar or the court must, if so requested by the registered owner of the trade mark, give to the registered owner a certificate of those findings.

             (2)  In any subsequent proceedings in which non‑use of the trade mark is alleged:

                     (a)  the certificate is, on being produced, evidence of the facts stated in it; and

                     (b)  if the proceedings are determined in favour of the opponent and, on or before filing the notice of opposition, the opponent notified the applicant of the contents of the certificate—the opponent is entitled, unless the Registrar or the court otherwise directs, to have the opponent’s full costs paid by the applicant.

## Part 12—Infringement of trade marks

##### <a id="120"></a>120  When is a registered trade mark infringed?

             (1)  A person infringes a registered trade mark if the person uses as a trade mark a sign that is substantially identical with, or deceptively similar to, the trade mark in relation to goods or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered.

Note 1:       For **_registered trade mark_** see section 6.

Note 2:       For **_deceptively similar_** see section 10.

Note 3:       In addition, the regulations may provide for the effect of a protected international trade mark: see Part 17A.

             (2)  A person infringes a registered trade mark if the person uses as a trade mark a sign that is substantially identical with, or deceptively similar to, the trade mark in relation to:

                     (a)  goods of the same description as that of goods (**_registered goods_**) in respect of which the trade mark is registered; or

                     (b)  services that are closely related to registered goods; or

                     (c)  services of the same description as that of services (**_registered services_**) in respect of which the trade mark is registered; or

                     (d)  goods that are closely related to registered services.

However, the person is not taken to have infringed the trade mark if the person establishes that using the sign as the person did is not likely to deceive or cause confusion.

Note 1:       For **_registered trade mark_** see section 6.

Note 2:       For **_deceptively similar_** see section 10.

Note 3:       In addition, the regulations may provide for the effect of a protected international trade mark: see Part 17A.

             (3)  A person infringes a registered trade mark if:

                     (a)  the trade mark is well known in Australia; and

                     (b)  the person uses as a trade mark a sign that is substantially identical with, or deceptively similar to, the trade mark in relation to:

                              (i)  goods (**_unrelated goods_**) that are not of the same description as that of the goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered (**_registered goods_**) or are not closely related to services in respect of which the trade mark is registered (**_registered services_**); or

                             (ii)  services (**_unrelated services_**) that are not of the same description as that of the registered services or are not closely related to registered goods; and

                     (c)  because the trade mark is well known, the sign would be likely to be taken as indicating a connection between the unrelated goods or services and the registered owner of the trade mark; and

                     (d)  for that reason, the interests of the registered owner are likely to be adversely affected.

Note 1:       For **_registered trade mark_** see section 6.

Note 2:       For **_deceptively similar_** see section 10.

Note 3:       For **_well known in Australia_** see subsection (4).

Note 4:       In addition, the regulations may provide for the effect of a protected international trade mark: see Part 17A.

             (4)  In deciding, for the purposes of paragraph (3)(a), whether a trade mark is **_well known in Australia_**, one must take account of the extent to which the trade mark is known within the relevant sector of the public, whether as a result of the promotion of the trade mark or for any other reason.

##### <a id="121"></a>121  Infringement of trade mark by breach of certain restrictions

             (1)  This section applies to a registered trade mark if the registered owner, or an authorised user of the trade mark having power to do so, has caused to be displayed on goods (**_registered goods_**) in respect of which the trade mark is registered, or on their package, or on the container in which they are offered to the public, a notice (**_notice of prohibition_**) prohibiting any act that is under subsection (2) a prohibited act in relation to the goods.

Note 1:       An authorised user of the trade mark may not have power to cause notices of prohibition to be displayed on goods etc. because of the terms of the agreement between the authorised user and the registered owner of the trade mark (see section 26).

Note 2:       For **_registered owner_** and **_registered trade mark_** see section 6.

Note 3:       For **_authorised user_** see section 8.

Note 4:       In addition, the regulations may provide for the effect of a protected international trade mark: see Part 17A.

             (2)  Each of the following is a prohibited act:

                     (a)  applying the trade mark to registered goods, or using the trade mark in physical relation to them, after the state, condition, get‑up or packaging in which they were originally offered to the public has been altered;

                     (b)  altering, or partially removing or obliterating, any representation of the trade mark applied to registered goods or used in physical relation to them;

                     (c)  if the trade mark has been applied to registered goods, or used in physical relation to them, together with other matter indicating that the registered owner or authorised user has dealt with the goods—removing or obliterating, totally or in part, any representation of the trade mark without totally removing or obliterating the other matter;

                     (d)  applying another trade mark to registered goods or using another trade mark in physical relation to them;

                     (e)  if the trade mark has been applied to registered goods or used in physical relation to them—using on the goods, or on the packaging or container of the goods, any matter that is likely to injure the reputation of the trade mark.

Note 1:       For **_applied_**_to_ see section 9.

Note 2:       For **_authorised user_** see section 8.

             (3)  Subject to subsection (4), a person infringes a trade mark to which this section applies if the person:

                     (a)  is the owner of registered goods; and

                     (b)  in the course of trade, or with a view to a dealing with the goods in the course of trade:

                              (i)  does an act that is prohibited under the notice of prohibition; or

                             (ii)  authorises that act to be done.

             (4)  The trade mark is not infringed if the owner of the goods:

                     (a)  acquired them in good faith and without being aware of the notice of prohibition; or

                     (b)  became the owner of the goods by virtue of a title derived from a person who had so acquired them.

##### <a id="122"></a>122  When is a trade mark not infringed?

             (1)  In spite of section 120, a person does not infringe a registered trade mark when:

                     (a)  the person uses in good faith:

                              (i)  the person’s name or the name of the person’s place of business; or

                             (ii)  the name of a predecessor in business of the person or the name of the predecessor’s place of business; or

                     (b)  the person uses a sign in good faith to indicate:

                              (i)  the kind, quality, quantity, intended purpose, value, geographical origin, or some other characteristic, of goods or services; or

                             (ii)  the time of production of goods or of the rendering of services; or

                     (c)  the person uses the trade mark in good faith to indicate the intended purpose of goods (in particular as accessories or spare parts) or services; or

                     (d)  the person uses the trade mark for the purposes of comparative advertising; or

                     (e)  the person exercises a right to use a trade mark given to the person under this Act; or

                      (f)  the court is of the opinion that the person would obtain registration of the trade mark in his or her name if the person were to apply for it; or

                    (fa)  both:

                              (i)  the person uses a trade mark that is substantially identical with, or deceptively similar to, the first‑mentioned trade mark; and

                             (ii)  the court is of the opinion that the person would obtain registration of the substantially identical or deceptively similar trade mark in his or her name if the person were to apply for it; or

                     (g)  the person, in using a sign referred to in subsection 120(1), (2) or (3) in a manner referred to in that subsection, does not (because of a condition or limitation subject to which the trade mark is registered) infringe the exclusive right of the registered owner to use the trade mark.

             (2)  In spite of section 120, if a disclaimer has been registered in respect of a part of a registered trade mark, a person does not infringe the trade mark by using that part of the trade mark.

##### <a id="123"></a>123  Goods etc. to which registered trade mark has been applied by or with consent of registered owner

             (1)  In spite of section 120, a person who uses a registered trade mark in relation to goods that are similar to goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered does not infringe the trade mark if the trade mark has been applied to, or in relation to, the goods by, or with the consent of, the registered owner of the trade mark.

Note:          For **_similar goods_** see subsection 14(1).

             (2)  In spite of section 120, a person who uses a registered trade mark in relation to services that are similar to services in respect of which the trade mark is registered does not infringe the trade mark if the trade mark has been applied in relation to the services by, or with the consent of, the registered owner of the trade mark.

Note:          For **_similar services_** see subsection 14(2).

##### <a id="124"></a>124  Prior use of identical trade mark etc.

             (1)  A person does not infringe a registered trade mark by using an unregistered trade mark that is substantially identical with, or deceptively similar to, the registered trade mark in relation to:

                     (a)  goods similar to goods (**_registered goods_**) in respect of which the trade mark is registered; or

                     (b)  services closely related to registered goods; or

                     (c)  services similar to services (**_registered services_**) in respect of which the trade mark is registered; or

                     (d)  goods closely related to registered services;

if the person, or the person and the person’s predecessor in title, have continuously used in the course of trade the unregistered trade mark in relation to those goods or services from a time before:

                     (e)  the date of registration of the registered trade mark; or

                      (f)  the registered owner of the registered trade mark, or a predecessor in title, or a person who was a registered user of the trade mark under the repealed Act, first used the trade mark;

whichever is earlier.

Note 1:       For **_deceptively similar_** see section 10.

Note 2:       For **_predecessor in title_** and **_date of registration_** see section 6.

             (2)  If the unregistered trade mark has continuously been used only in a particular area of Australia, subsection (1) applies only to the use of the trade mark by the person in that area.

##### <a id="125"></a>125  What courts may hear action for infringement of registered trade mark

             (1)  An action for an infringement of a registered trade mark may be brought in a prescribed court.

Note:          For **_prescribed court_** see section 190.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not prevent an action for infringement of a registered trade mark from being brought in any other court that has jurisdiction to hear the action.

##### <a id="126"></a>126  What relief can be obtained from court

                   The relief that a court may grant in an action for an infringement of a registered trade mark includes:

                     (a)  an injunction, which may be granted subject to any condition that the court thinks fit; and

                     (b)  at the option of the plaintiff but subject to section 127, damages or an account of profits.

##### <a id="127"></a>127  Special case—plaintiff not entitled to damages etc.

                   If:

                     (a)  in an action for the infringement of a trade mark registered in respect of particular goods or services, the court finds that the defendant has infringed the trade mark; and

                     (b)  either:

                              (i)  the defendant has applied to the court under subsection 92(3) for an order directing the Registrar to remove the trade mark from the Register in respect of those goods or services; or

                             (ii)  the defendant has applied to the Registrar under subsection 92(1) for the trade mark to be removed from the Register in respect of those goods or services, and the matter has been referred to a court under section 94; and

                     (c)  the court finds that, because the trade mark has not during a particular period (**_critical period_**) been used in good faith by its registered owner in relation to those goods or services, there are grounds (under subsection 92(4)) for so removing the trade mark from the Register;

the court may not grant relief to the plaintiff by way of damages or an account of profits in respect of any infringement of the trade mark that happened during the critical period.

##### <a id="128"></a>128  Circumstances in which action may not be brought

             (1)  If the registration of a trade mark is renewed under section 79 within 6 months after it has expired, an action may not be brought in respect of an act that:

                     (a)  infringed the trade mark; and

                     (b)  was done after the registration had expired and before it was renewed.

             (2)  If the registration of a trade mark is renewed under section 80G within 10 months after the end of the prescribed period, an action may not be brought in respect of an act that:

                     (a)  infringed the trade mark; and

                     (b)  was done after the end of the prescribed period and before the registration was renewed.

             (3)  In subsection (2):

                    <a name="prescrib-period"></a>**_prescribed period_** has the same meaning as in Division 3 of Part 7.

Note:          For **_month_** see section 6.

##### <a id="129"></a>129  Groundless threats of legal proceedings 

             (1)  If a person threatens to bring an action against another person (**_threatened person_**) on the ground that the threatened person has infringed:

                     (a)  a registered trade mark; or

                     (b)  a trade mark alleged by the person to be registered;

any person aggrieved by the threat (**_plaintiff_**) may bring an action (either in a prescribed court or in any other court having jurisdiction) against the person making the threat (**_defendant_**).

Note:          For **_prescribed court_** see section 190.

             (2)  The purpose of the action is to obtain from the court:

                     (a)  a declaration that the defendant has no grounds for making the threat; and

                     (b)  an injunction restraining the defendant from continuing to make the threat.

The plaintiff may also recover any damages that he or she has sustained because of the defendant’s conduct.

             (3)  The action may be brought whether or not the defendant is the registered owner, or an authorised user, of the trade mark alleged to have been infringed.

Note:          For **_authorised user_** see section 8.

             (4)  The court may not find in favour of the plaintiff if the defendant satisfies the court that:

                     (a)  the trade mark is registered; and

##### <a id="131"></a>131  Object of Part

                   The object of this Part is to protect registered trade marks by making provision allowing the Customs CEO to seize and deal with goods that are imported into Australia if the importation infringes, or appears to infringe, a registered trade mark.

Note:          In addition, the regulations may provide for the effect of a protected international trade mark: see Part 17A.

##### <a id="132"></a>132  Notice of objection to importation

             (1)  The registered owner of a registered trade mark may give to the Customs CEO a notice in writing objecting to the importation after the date of the notice of goods that infringe the trade mark. The notice is to be given together with any prescribed document.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  the registered owner of the registered trade mark has not given a notice under subsection (1); or

                     (b)  any notice given under subsection (1) is no longer in force;

an authorised user of the trade mark having power to give a notice under subsection (1) may ask the registered owner to give such a notice in respect of the trade mark.

Note 1:       For **_authorised user_** see section 8.

Note 2:       An authorised user of the trade mark may not have power to give a notice under subsection (1) because of the terms of the agreement between the authorised user and the registered owner of the trade mark (see section 26).

             (3)  The authorised user may give the notice to the Customs CEO:

                     (a)  at any time, with the consent of the registered owner; or

                     (b)  during the prescribed period, if the registered owner refuses to comply with the request on a particular occasion during the prescribed period; or

                     (c)  after the end of the prescribed period, if the registered owner has failed to give such a notice during the prescribed period.

The authorised user must give also to the Customs CEO, together with the notice:

                     (d)  any document prescribed for the purposes of subsection (1); and

                     (e)  any other prescribed document.

             (4)  A notice given by the registered owner of a trade mark remains in force for 4 years from the day on which the notice is given unless it is revoked, before the end of that period, by notice in writing given to the Customs CEO by the person who is then the registered owner of the trade mark.

             (5)  A notice given by an authorised user of the trade mark remains in force for 4 years unless it is revoked, before the end of that period, by notice in writing given to the Customs CEO:

                     (a)  if the authorised user has power to revoke the notice—by the authorised user; or

                     (b)  in any other case—by the person who is then the registered owner of the trade mark.

Note 1:       For **_authorised user_** see section 8.

Note 2:       An authorised user of a trade mark may not have power to revoke the notice because of the terms of the agreement between the authorised user and the registered owner of the trade mark (see section 26).

                     (b)  the use of a registered collective trade mark by a member of the association that is the registered owner of the collective trade mark is taken to be a use of the collective trade mark by the registered owner.

##### <a id="171"></a>171  Rights given by registration of a certification trade mark

                   Section 20 applies in relation to a certification trade mark as if subsection (1) were omitted and the following subsection were substituted:

                     (b)  the rules referred to in section 173:

                              (i)  would not be to the detriment of the public; and

                     (b)  provides to what extent, and subject to what modifications or additions, the provisions of this Act relating to trade marks apply to defensive trade marks.

##### <a id="185"></a>185  Defensive trade marks

             (1)  If, because of the extent to which a registered trade mark has been used in relation to all or any of the goods or services in respect of which it is registered, it is likely that its use in relation to other goods or services will be taken to indicate that there is a connection between those other goods or services and the registered owner of the trade mark, the trade mark may, on the application of the registered owner, be registered as a **_defensive trade mark_** in respect of any or all of those other goods or services.

Note:          For **_registered trade mark_** and _registered owner_ see section 6.

             (2)  A trade mark may be registered as a defensive trade mark in respect of particular goods or services even if the registered owner does not use or intend to use the trade mark in relation to those goods or services.

             (3)  A trade mark may be registered as a defensive trade mark in respect of particular goods or services even if it is already registered otherwise than as a defensive trade mark in the name of the applicant in respect of those goods or services.

             (4)  A trade mark that is registered as a defensive trade mark in respect of particular goods or services may be subsequently registered otherwise than as a defensive trade mark in the name of the registered owner in respect of the same goods or services.

##### <a id="186"></a>186  Application of Act

                   Subject to this Part, the provisions of this Act (other than subsection 20(1), paragraph 27(1)(b), sections 41 and 59, sections 121 and 127, Part 9—Removal of trade mark from Register for non‑use and Part 16—Certification Trade Marks) apply to defensive trade marks and so apply as if a reference to a trade mark included a reference to a defensive trade mark.

##### <a id="187"></a>187  Additional grounds for rejecting application for registration or opposing registration

                   In addition to any other ground on which:

                     (a)  an application for the registration of a trade mark as a defensive trade mark may be rejected; or

                     (b)  the registration of a trade mark as a defensive trade mark may be opposed;

the application must be rejected or the registration may be opposed:

                     (c)  if the trade mark is not registered as a trade mark in the name of the applicant; or

                     (d)  in the case of a registered trade mark—if it is not likely that the use of the trade mark in relation to the goods or services in respect of which its registration as a defensive trade mark is sought will be taken to indicate that there is a connection between those goods or services and the registered owner.

Note:          Division 2 of Part 4 sets out the main grounds for rejecting an application but section 41 does not apply to defensive trade marks (see section 186). Division 2 of Part 5 sets out the main grounds for opposing registration.

##### <a id="189"></a>189  Cancellation of registration by Registrar
