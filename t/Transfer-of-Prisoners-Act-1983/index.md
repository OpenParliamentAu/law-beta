                     (a)  an application must not be made to a court for an order under a State transfer law for the transfer of the prisoner or remand prisoner to another State or Territory; and

                     (b)  an order (other than an order by a court) must not be made under a State transfer law for the transfer of the prisoner or remand prisoner to another State or Territory;

unless the Attorney‑General has consented in writing to the transfer.

             (2)  This section does not apply once the prisoner or remand prisoner has been returned to the originating State or Territory (within the meaning of section 16C).

## Part V—Effect of transfer order

##### <a id="17"></a>17  Transfer in custody of escort etc.

             (1)  A transfer order shall direct that the prisoner to whom the transfer order relates be removed to the State or Territory mentioned in the order, and, for that purpose, be delivered into the custody of a person named or described in the order and be held in custody and conveyed to such prison in that State or Territory as is specified in the order.

             (2)  Upon production to him or her of a transfer order, the Superintendent or other officer in charge of the prison where the prisoner to whom the transfer order relates is imprisoned shall deliver the prisoner into the custody of the person named or described in the order.

             (3)  Where a prisoner to whom a transfer order relates is delivered, in pursuance of subsection (2) into the custody of a person named or described in that order, that person:

                     (a)  shall keep the prisoner in custody for purposes in connection with the transfer of the prisoner; and

                     (b)  shall deliver the prisoner into the custody of the Superintendent or other officer in charge of the prison specified in that order.

             (4)  A prisoner to whom a transfer order relates may, in the course of being transferred in pursuance of that transfer order, be detained in any State or Territory in a prison or in a police station or other premises in which persons awaiting trial may lawfully be detained for such time as is reasonably necessary to facilitate the transfer.

             (5)  A transfer order (other than an order under Part IV) relating to a person who is a joint prisoner has no effect:

                     (a)  to the extent that, but for this subsection, it authorizes or requires the doing of any act or thing under this Act in relation to that person in his or her capacity as a person upon whom a State sentence of imprisonment has been imposed; and

                     (b)  unless and until a complementary State order of transfer corresponding to the transfer order is in force in respect of the person.

             (6)  A transfer order (other than an order under Part IV) has no effect to the extent that it purports to authorize the transfer of a State prisoner from a State to another State or to a Territory.

             (7)  The Commonwealth may, for the purpose of enabling officers or employees of a State to carry out functions in relation to the execution of transfer orders, enter into such arrangements with that State as are necessary to secure the services of those officers or employees for that purpose.

##### <a id="18"></a>18  Transferred sentences

             (1)  Where a prisoner upon whom a sentence of imprisonment for an offence against a law of a Territory has been imposed is transferred, in pursuance of a transfer order, to a State or Territory, any law of the Commonwealth (including this section) applies, and the provisions of any law of that State or Territory and the provisions of the State transfer law of any other State apply, in relation to that sentence on and after the transfer of that prisoner as if that sentence had been imposed upon the prisoner under, and for an offence against, a law of the State or Territory to which he or she is transferred.

             (2)  Where a prisoner upon whom a sentence of imprisonment for an offence against a law of a State has been imposed is transferred, in pursuance of a transfer order or a State order of transfer or both, to a Territory, any law of the Commonwealth (including this section) applies, and the provisions of any law of that Territory apply, in relation to that sentence on and after the transfer of that prisoner as if that sentence had been imposed upon the prisoner under, and for an offence against, the law of that Territory.

             (3)  In the application:

                     (a)  of any law of the Commonwealth (including this section) and of the provisions of any law of a State or Territory in relation to a transferred Territory sentence of a prisoner; or

                     (b)  of any law of the Commonwealth (including this section) and of the provisions of any law of a Territory in relation to a transferred State sentence of a prisoner;

any period of imprisonment served by the prisoner in respect of the sentence of imprisonment to which the transferred sentence is attributable has the effect that it would have if the prisoner had served it in respect of the transferred sentence.

##### <a id="19"></a>19  Transferred sentences—non‑parole periods

             (1)  Where a prisoner upon whom a sentence or sentences of imprisonment has or have been imposed under, and for an offence or offences against, a law of a Territory, being a sentence or sentences in respect of which a minimum term of imprisonment has been fixed, is transferred, in pursuance of a transfer order, to a State or Territory, then, in the application of the provisions of the law of that State or Territory relating to the fixing of minimum terms of imprisonment, those provisions have effect upon his or her being so transferred as if, in lieu of any minimum term of imprisonment that would or might have been fixed by or under those provisions in relation to the transferred sentence or the transferred sentences, there had been fixed the first‑mentioned minimum term of imprisonment.

             (2)  Where a prisoner upon whom a sentence or sentences of imprisonment has or have been imposed under, and for an offence or offences against, a law of a State, being a sentence or sentences in respect of which a minimum term of imprisonment has been fixed, is transferred, in pursuance of a transfer order or a State order of transfer or both, to a Territory, then, in the application of the provisions of the law of that Territory relating to the fixing of minimum terms of imprisonment, those provisions have effect upon his or her being so transferred as if, in lieu of any minimum term of imprisonment that would or might have been fixed by or under those provisions in relation to the transferred State sentence or the transferred State sentences, there had been fixed the first‑mentioned minimum term of imprisonment.

             (3)  Except as expressly provided, nothing in this section affects the application, in accordance with section 18:

                     (a)  of the provisions of a law of a State or Territory relating to the fixing of minimum terms of imprisonment to the transferred Territory sentence or transferred Territory sentences of a prisoner; or

                     (b)  of the provisions of a law of a Territory relating to the fixing of minimum terms of imprisonment to the transferred State sentence or transferred State sentences of a prisoner.

             (2)  Where a prisoner upon whom a sentence or sentences of imprisonment has or have been imposed under, and for an offence or offences against, a law of a State is transferred, in pursuance of a transfer order or a State order of transfer or both, to a Territory, then, in the application of the provisions of a law of that Territory relating to the reduction or remission of sentences or of minimum terms of imprisonment to the transferred State sentence or transferred State sentences of the prisoner, the prisoner shall be deemed to be entitled under those provisions, upon his or her being so transferred;

                     (a)  in lieu of any period or periods of reduction or remission of the transferred State sentence or transferred State sentences to which he or she would otherwise be entitled upon being so transferred—to a period or periods of reduction or remission of the transferred State sentence or the transferred State sentences equivalent to the period or periods of reduction or remission applicable, immediately before he or she was so transferred, to the sentence or sentences to which the transferred State sentence or the transferred State sentences is or are attributable; and

                     (b)  in lieu of any period or periods of reduction or remission of a minimum term of imprisonment fixed in relation to the transferred State sentence or the transferred State sentences to which he or she would otherwise be entitled upon being so transferred—to a period or periods of reduction or remission of the minimum term of imprisonment fixed in relation to the transferred State sentence or transferred State sentences equivalent to the period or periods of reduction or remission applicable, immediately before he or she was so transferred, to the minimum terms of imprisonment fixed in relation to the sentence or sentences to which the transferred State sentence or the transferred State sentences is or are attributable.

             (3)  Except as expressly provided, nothing in this section affects the application, in accordance with section 18:

                     (a)  of the provisions of a law of a State or Territory relating to the reduction or remission of sentences or of minimum terms of imprisonment to the transferred Territory sentence or transferred Territory sentences of a prisoner; or

                     (b)  of the provisions of a law of a Territory relating to the reduction or remission of sentences or of minimum terms of imprisonment to the transferred State sentence or transferred State sentences of a prisoner.

##### <a id="21"></a>21  Transferred sentences—default imprisonment

                   Where a prisoner is serving a transferred sentence that is attributable to a sentence of default imprisonment and the whole or any part of the total amount in default of payment of which that sentence of default imprisonment was imposed is paid by or on behalf of the prisoner to the Superintendent or other officer in charge of the prison in which the prisoner is imprisoned:

                     (a)  the transferred sentence shall:

                              (i)  upon receipt of the whole of that total amount by the Superintendent or other officer, by force of this subsection, expire forthwith; or

                             (ii)  except in a case where, but for the transfer of the prisoner, the sentence of default imprisonment imposed on the prisoner would have expired only on payment of the whole of that total amount—upon receipt of part of that total amount, be reduced, by force of this subsection, by a period that bears to the total sentence of default imprisonment the same proportion as the amount paid bears to the total amount; and

                     (b)  the Superintendent or other officer shall, forthwith upon receipt of the amount by him or her, remit the amount:

                              (i)  in a case where the sentence of default imprisonment was imposed under a law of the Commonwealth or a Territory—to the Attorney‑General; and

                             (ii)  in a case where the sentence of default imprisonment was imposed under a law of a State—to the appropriate Minister of that State.

                   Where a prisoner upon whom a sentence of imprisonment has been imposed under, and for an offence against, a law of a Territory is transferred, in pursuance of a transfer order, to a State or Territory, that sentence ceases, for the purposes of this Act and of any law of that first‑mentioned Territory, upon the prisoner’s being so transferred, to have effect in that first‑mentioned Territory except for the purpose of any appeal against, or review of, any conviction, judgment, sentence or minimum term of imprisonment made, imposed or fixed by a court of that first‑mentioned Territory.

##### <a id="23"></a>23  Federal sentences—reductions and remissions

                     (a)  in lieu of any period or periods of reduction or remission of his or her federal sentence to which he or she would otherwise be entitled under that law in that application upon being so transferred—to a period or periods of reduction or remission of his or her federal sentence equivalent to the period or periods of reduction or remission of his or her sentence to which he or she was entitled under the law of the first‑mentioned State or Territory in its application, by virtue of that section of that Act, immediately before being so transferred; and

                     (b)  in lieu of any period or periods of reduction or remission of a minimum term of imprisonment fixed under section 19AB, 19AC or 19AR, as the case may be, of that Act in relation to his or her federal sentence to which he or she would otherwise be entitled under that law in that application upon being so transferred—to a period or periods of reduction or remission of that minimum term of imprisonment equivalent to the period or periods of reduction or remission of that minimum term of imprisonment to which he or she was entitled under the law of the first‑mentioned State or Territory in its application, by virtue of section 19 of that Act, immediately before being so transferred.

                     (b)  a person is authorized in accordance with a State transfer law (whether or not that law is a law of that State) to keep that prisoner in custody in a State for the purpose of so transferring the prisoner; and

                     (c)  in the course of so transferring the prisoner, the person brings the prisoner into a Territory;

             (1)  Section 47 of the _Crimes Act 1914_ applies to a State prisoner in lawful custody in accordance with section 25 of this Act as if a reference in the definition of **_federal criminal detention_** in section 45A of that Act to an offence against a law of the Commonwealth were a reference to an offence against a law of the Commonwealth or of a State.

             (2)  Section 47 of the _Crimes Act 1914_ applies to a prisoner in lawful custody in pursuance of a transfer order (whether or not the person is also in lawful custody in pursuance of a State order of transfer) as if a reference in the definition of **_federal criminal detention_** in section 45A of that Act to an offence against a law of the Commonwealth were a reference to an offence against a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory.

##### <a id="28"></a>28  State laws may make provision in relation to certain transfers of joint prisoners and State prisoners

                   It is the intention of the Parliament that, without limiting the generality of paragraph 30(e), this Act shall not apply to the exclusion of a law of a State in so far as that law makes provision:

          (1A)  However, a delegation under subsection (1) does not extend to the power:

                      (f)  in which making or revoking the order, making the application, giving the consent or serving the notice would involve consideration of questions of security.

             (2)  A power delegated under subsection (1), when exercised by the delegate, shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to have been exercised by the Attorney‑General.

             (3)  A delegation under subsection (1) does not prevent the exercise of a power by the Attorney‑General.

             (4)  The appropriate Minister of a State may, either generally or as otherwise provided in the instrument of delegation, by writing signed by him or her, delegate to a person all or any of his or her powers under this Act other than this power of delegation or the powers under Part IV.

                     (d)  the operation of any other law of the Commonwealth relating to the release of offenders; or

                     (e)  the operation of a law of a State or Territory, to the extent that that law is capable of operating concurrently with this Act.

             (1)  A court before which there are instituted:

                     (a)  proceedings by way of appeal against, or review of, a conviction, judgment, sentence or minimum term of imprisonment made, imposed or fixed in relation to a person in respect of whom a transfer order has been made; or

                     (b)  proceedings by way of the retrial of such a person;

may, if it is satisfied that it would be unjust or oppressive not to do so, make orders (including interim orders) in relation to the application of the provisions of this Act to the person as if the provisions of this Act were modified in such manner as the court thinks fit, and may, at any time, vary or rescind an order so made.

             (2)  Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), orders made under that subsection in relation to a person may make provision for:
