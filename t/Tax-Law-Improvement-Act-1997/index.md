Other recoupment

             (3)  An amount you receive as * recoupment of a loss or outgoing (_except_ by way of insurance or indemnity) is an **_assessable recoupment_** if:

                     (a)  you can deduct an amount for the loss or outgoing for the * current year; or

                     (b)  you have deducted or can deduct an amount for the loss or outgoing for an earlier income year;

Amount for disposing of right to recoupment

             (3)  If you dispose of your right to receive an amount as * recoupment of a loss or outgoing you are taken to receive as **_recoupment_** of the loss or outgoing any amount you receive for disposing of that right. (The disposal need not be to another entity.)

Amount received that is recoupment to an unspecified extent

#### How much is included in your assessable income?

##### <a id="20-35"></a>20-35  If the expense is deductible in a single income year

             (1)  Your assessable income includes an * assessable recoupment of a loss or outgoing if:

                     (a)  you can deduct the whole of the loss or outgoing for the * current year; or

                     (b)  you have deducted or can deduct the whole of the loss or outgoing for an earlier income year.

Note 1:       The operation of this section may be affected if a balancing charge has been included in your assessable income because of a deduction for the loss or outgoing: see section 20-45.

Note 2:       Recoupment of a loss or outgoing for which you can deduct amounts over more than one income year is covered by section 20-40.

Note 3:       Recoupment of a loss or outgoing that is only partially deductible is covered by section 20-50.

Total assessed not to exceed the loss or outgoing

             (2)  The total of all amounts that subsection (1) includes in your assessable income for one or more income years in respect of a loss or outgoing cannot exceed the amount of the loss or outgoing.

Recoupment received before income year of the deduction

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  you can deduct the whole of a loss or outgoing for the * current year; and

                     (b)  before the current year you received an * assessable recoupment of the loss or outgoing;

your assessable income for the current year includes so much of the recoupment as subsection (1) would have included if you had instead received the recoupment at the start of the current year.

##### <a id="20-40"></a>20-40  If the expense is deductible over 2 or more income years

             (1)  This section includes an amount in your assessable income if:

                     (a)  you receive in the * current year an * assessable recoupment of a loss or outgoing for which you can deduct amounts over 2 or more income years; or

                     (b)  you received in an _earlier_ income year an * assessable recoupment of a loss or outgoing of that kind (unless all of the recoupment has already been included in your assessable income for one or more earlier income years by this section or a * previous recoupment law).

(This section applies even if the recoupment was received before the first of those income years.)

Note:          Recoupment of a loss or outgoing that is only partially deductible is covered by section 20-50.

             (2)  Work out as follows how much is included in your assessable income for the * current year because of one or more * assessable recoupments of the loss or outgoing.

Note:          The method statement ensures that assessable recoupments are included:

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>· only so far as they have _not_ already been included for an earlier income year; and

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>· only to the extent of your total deductions to date for the loss or outgoing.

* * *

_Method statement_

_Step 1._ Add up all the * assessable recoupments of the loss or outgoing that you have received (in the * current year or earlier). The result is the **_total assessable recoupment_**.

_Step 2_.   Add up the amounts (if any) included in your assessable income for earlier income years, in respect of the loss or outgoing, by this section or a * previous recoupment law. The result is the **_recoupment already assessed_**. (If no amount was included, the **_recoupment already assessed_** is nil.)

_Step 3_.   Subtract the recoupment already assessed from the total assessable recoupment. The result is the **_unassessed recoupment_**.

_Step 4._   Add up each amount that you can deduct for the loss or outgoing for the * current year, or you have deducted or can deduct for the loss or outgoing for an earlier income year. The result is the **_total deductions for the loss or outgoing_**.

                   Note:          The total deductions may be reduced if an amount has been included in your assessable income because of a balancing adjustment: see section 20-45.

_Step 5_.   Subtract the recoupment already assessed from the total deductions for the loss or outgoing. The result is the **_outstanding deductions_**.

_Step 6._ The unassessed recoupment is included in your assessable income, unless it is greater than the outstanding deductions. In that case, the amount of the outstanding deductions is included instead.

* * *

Example:    At the start of the 1997-98 income year, a mining company incurs $100,000 of expenditure on mining operations. $10,000 is deductible for the 1997-98 income year and for each of the following 9 income years under section 330-80.

                   In the 1997-98 income year, the company receives $20,000 as recoupment. How much is assessable for the 1997-1998 income year?

                   Applying the method statement:

                   After Step 1: the total assessable recoupment is $20,000.

                   After Step 2: the recoupment already assessed is nil.

                   After Step 3: the unassessed recoupment is: 
 total assessable recoupment – recoupment already assessed,
 ie $20,000 – 0 = $20,000.

                   After Step 4: the total deductions for the loss or outgoing are $10,000.

                   After Step 5: the outstanding deductions are: 
 total deductions for the loss or outgoing – recoupment already assessed, ie $10,000 – 0 = $10,000.

                   After Step 6: the unassessed recoupment (Step 3) is greater than outstanding deductions (Step 5), so the amount of the outstanding deductions is included in assessable income, ie $10,000.

                   Applying the method statement to the 1998-99 income year: a further $10,000 is included in the company’s assessable income.

##### <a id="20-45"></a>20-45  Effect of balancing charge

             (1)  This section may affect the operation of section 20-35 or 20-40 (as appropriate) if:

                     (a)  a balancing adjustment is required for the * current year (or for an earlier income year) because you have deducted or can deduct an amount for an income year for the loss or outgoing; and

                     (b)  an amount (the **_balancing charge_**) is included in your assessable income for the * current year (or for the earlier income year) because of the balancing adjustment.

To find out about balancing adjustments, see section 40-25\. 

Effect on section 20-35

             (2)  In applying section 20-35, treat each of the following as reduced by the balancing charge:

                     (a)  the amount of the loss or outgoing; 

                     (b)  the total of what you can deduct for the loss or outgoing for the * current year, or have deducted or can deduct for an earlier income year.

Effect on section 20-40

             (3)  In applying the method statement in subsection 20-40(3), reduce the **_total deductions for the loss or outgoing_** by the balancing charge.

Example:Continuing the example in subsection 20-40(3): during the 2000-2001 income year, the mining company:

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>· receives a further $10,000 as recoupment of the original expenditure; and

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>· sells its mining operations for $75,000.

                   As a result of the sale, a balancing charge of $5,000 is included under section 330-485 in the company’s assessable income for that income year.

                   How much of the recoupment amount received in the 2000-2001 income year is assessable for that income year?

                   Applying the method statement in subsection 20-40(3):

                   After Step 1: the total assessable recoupment is $30,000 (received during 1997-98 and 2000-2001).

                   After Step 2: the recoupment already assessed is $20,000 (for 1997-98 and 1998-99).

                   After Step 3: the unassessed recoupment is:
 total assessable recoupment – recoupment already assessed, 
 ie $30,000 – $20,000 = $10,000.

                   After Step 4: the total deductions for the loss or outgoing are $30,000 ($10,000 for each of 1997-98, 1998-99 and 1999-2000), reduced by $5,000 (the amount included in assessable income for the balancing adjustment), ie $25,000.

                   After Step 5: the outstanding deductions are: 
 total deductions for the loss or outgoing – recoupment already assessed, ie $25,000 – $20,000 = $5,000.

                   After Step 6: the unassessed recoupment (Step 3) is greater than outstanding deductions (Step 5), so the amount of the outstanding deductions is included in assessable income, ie $5,000.

##### <a id="20-50"></a>20-50  If the expense is only partially deductible

             (1)  This section extends the operation of section 20-35 or 20-40 (as appropriate) to a case where the total of what you can deduct under a provision (the **_deduction provision_**) for a loss or outgoing is limited to a proportion of the loss or outgoing.

             (2)  If you receive an * assessable recoupment of the loss or outgoing, section 20-35 or 20-40 applies as if:

                     (a)  you had incurred _only_ that proportion of the loss or outgoing, but could deduct the _whole_ of that proportion under the deduction provision; and

                     (b)  you had received only that proportion of the recoupment.

Example:    You incur expenditure of $500\. A provision listed in section 20-30 entitles you to deduct 10% of the expenditure ($50) over 5 years. This means you can deduct $10 in each of the 5 years.

                   You recoup $300 of the expenditure. This section treats you as receiving only 10% of the recoupment. Therefore, $30 is dealt with by section 20-40.

##### <a id="20-55"></a>20-55  Meaning of _previous recoupment law_

                    <a name="previou-recoup-law"></a>**_Previous recoupment law_** means a provision of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ listed in this table.

#### Subdivision 20-B—Disposal of a car for which lease payments have been deducted

#### Guide to Subdivision 20-B

##### <a id="20-100"></a>20-100  What this Subdivision is about

* * *

This Subdivision reverses the effect of deductions for lease payments for a car leased to you (or to your associate), but only if you make a profit by disposing of the car after acquiring it from the lessor. The _smallest_ of these amounts is included in your assessable income:

        your profit on the disposal;

        the total deductible lease payments for the period of the lease;

        the total amounts you _could have deducted_ for depreciation of the car if, instead of leasing it, you had owned it and used it solely for the purpose of producing assessable income.

##### <a id="20-110"></a>20-110  Disposal of a leased car for profit

             (1)  Your assessable income includes the * profit you make on disposing of a * car if:

                     (a)  the car was designed mainly for carrying passengers; and

                     (b)  the car was leased to you and has been leased to no-one else; and

                     (c)  you or another entity can deduct for the income year any of the lease payments paid or payable by you, or have deducted or can deduct any of them for an earlier income year, under this Act; and

                     (d)  you acquired the car from the lessor.

Note 1:       Even if subsection (1) does not apply, an amount may still be included in your assessable income:

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>· under section 20-125 (which deals with more complicated cases that may involve your associate); or

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>· if you disposed of an interest in a car (rather than the car itself): see section 20-160.

Note 2:       In some cases you do _not_ include an amount in your assessable income:

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>· if there has been an earlier disposal of the car for market value: see section 20-135; or

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>· if you inherited the car: see section 20-145; or

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>· if the car was let on hire in the circumstances set out in section 20-155.

             (2)  However, the amount included cannot exceed the smaller of these limits:

                     (a)  the total lease payments for the lease that you or another entity have deducted or can deduct under this Act for an income year;

                     (b)  the amount of * notional depreciation for the lease period.

Note 1:       If, because of more than one lease of the car, there is more than one way to work out the amount to be included, you only include the largest amount: see section 20-130.

Note 2:       In some cases you reduce the amount to be included:

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>· if there has been an earlier disposal of the car, or of an interest in it: see section 20-140; or

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>· if another provision requires you to include an amount because of the disposal: see section 20-150.

             (3)  You increase those limits if you have previously leased the * car from the same lessor, or from an * associate of that lessor.

                   You increase the first limit by the total lease payments for each previous lease of that kind that you or another entity have deducted or can deduct under this Act for an income year.

                   You increase the second limit by the amount of * notional depreciation for the period of each previous lease of that kind.

##### <a id="20-115"></a>20-115  Working out the profit on the disposal

             (1)  The **_profit_** on the disposal is the amount by which the * consideration receivable for the disposal exceeds:

   the amount it cost you to acquire the * car;

                   plus:

   any capital expenditure you incurred on the car after acquiring it.

             (2)  The **_consideration receivable_** is worked out using this table:

<table>
<colgroup>
  <col width="10%">
  <col width="44%">
  <col width="46%">
</colgroup>

<thead>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="3">

      <div><b> the consideration receivable is: </b></div>
    </td>
  </tr>

<tr>
  <td>
    <div>2</div>
  </td>
  <td>
    <div>you sell the * car with other property without a specific price being allocated to it</div>
  </td>

    <div>the part of the total sale price that is reasonably attributable to the car less the part of the reasonably attributable expenses of the sale</div>
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>
    <div>3</div>
  </td>
  <td>
    <div>you trade the * car in and buy another car</div>

  </td>
</tr></table>

##### <a id="20-120"></a>20-120  Meaning of _notional depreciation_

                   This is how to work out the **_notional depreciation_** for a lease period:

* * *

_Method statement_

_Step 1._   Compare:

                 •     the * car’s * cost to the lessor for the purposes of Subdivision 42-B (which is about working out the cost of * plant for the purposes of depreciation);

              with:

                 •     the car’s * termination value for the purposes of section 42-205 when the lessor disposed of it.

_Step 2._   If the car’s cost exceeds the car’s termination value, multiply the excess by:

                 •     the number of days in the lease period; 

              divided by:

                 •     the number of days the lessor owned the car.

_Step 3._   The result is the **_notional depreciation_** for the lease period.

_Step 4_.   If the car’s cost does _not_ exceed the car’s termination value, the **_notional depreciation_** for the lease period is zero.

* * *

Note 1:       The notional depreciation for the lease period represents:

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>· the amount you could have deducted for depreciation of the car if, instead of leasing it, you had owned it and used it solely for the purpose of producing assessable income for that period; 

                   adjusted by:

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>· the balancing adjustment you would have made if you had disposed of the car at the end of that period.

Note 2:       The car’s cost to the lessor is worked out differently if the lessor acquired it in the 1996-97 income year or an earlier income year: see section 20-105 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

Note 3:       The car’s termination value is worked out differently if the lessor disposed of it in the 1996-97 income year or an earlier income year: see section 20-110 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

#### The associate case

##### <a id="20-125"></a>20-125  Disposal of a leased car for profit

             (1)  Your assessable income includes the * profit you make on disposing of a * car if:

                     (a)  section 20-110 does _not_ include an amount in your assessable income because of the disposal; and

                     (b)  the car was designed mainly for carrying passengers; and

                     (c)  the car was leased to you or your * associate; and

                     (d)  you, your associate or another entity can deduct for the income year any of the lease payments paid or payable by the lessee, or have deducted or can deduct any of them for an earlier income year, under this Act; and

                     (e)  either:

                              (i)  you, your associate, or entities including you or your associate, acquired the car from the lessor; or 

                             (ii)  another entity acquired the car from the lessor under an * arrangement that enabled you or your associate to acquire the car.

Note 1:       Even if subsection (1) does not apply, an amount may be included in your assessable income if you disposed of an interest in a car (rather than the car itself): see section 20-160.

Note 2:       In some cases you do _not_ include an amount in your assessable income:

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>· if there has been an earlier disposal of the car for market value: see section 20-135; or

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>· if you inherited the car: see section 20-145; or

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>· if the car was let on hire in the circumstances set out in section 20-155.

             (2)  However, the amount included cannot exceed the smallest of these limits:

                     (a)  the total lease payments for the lease that you, your * associate or another entity have deducted or can deduct under this Act for an income year;

                     (b)  the amount of * notional depreciation for the lease period;

                     (c)  if an entity other than you, or if entities including you, acquired the * car from the lessor—the amount by which the * consideration receivable for the disposal of the car by you exceeds the total of:

                              (i)  the car’s cost to that entity, or those entities; and

                             (ii)  any capital expenditure that entity, or any of those entities, incurred on the car after that acquisition and before you acquired it.

Note 1:       If, because of more than one lease of the car, there is more than one way to work out the amount to be included, you only include the largest amount: see section 20-130.

Note 2:       In some cases you reduce the amount to be included:

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>· if there has been an earlier disposal of the car, or of an interest in it: see section 20-140; or

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>· if another provision requires you to include an amount because of the disposal: see section 20-150.

Example:    Your associate leases a car for 5 years and then acquires it from the lessor for $4,000\. Your associate sells it to you for $3,000\. You sell it for $10,000.

                   Your profit is $10,000 (the consideration receivable) less $3,000 (the car’s cost to you) = $7,000.

                   The first 2 limits on the amount to be included in your assessable income are $9,000 (total deductible lease payments for the lease) and $8,000 (notional depreciation for the lease period).

                   Since your associate acquired the car from the lessor, the third limit is $10,000 (the consideration receivable by you) less $4,000 (the car’s cost to the associate) = $6,000.

                   The amount you include in your assessable income _cannot_ exceed the smallest of the limits. So, you do not include your profit of $7,000\. Instead, you include $6,000 (the smallest of the limits).

             (3)  You increase the first 2 limits if you, or your associate, have previously leased the * car from the same lessor, or from an associate of that lessor.

                   You increase the first limit by the total lease payments for each previous lease of that kind that you, your * associate or another entity have deducted or can deduct under this Act for an income year.

                   You increase the second limit by the amount of * notional depreciation for the period of each previous lease of that kind.

#### Successive leases

##### <a id="20-130"></a>20-130  Successive leases

                   If, because of 2 or more leases of the * car, there are different amounts that could be included in your assessable income because of the disposal, only the largest of those amounts is included.

#### Previous disposals of the car

##### <a id="20-135"></a>20-135  No amount included if earlier disposal for market value

                   You do _not_ include an amount in your assessable income because of the disposal if, after the lessor disposed of the * car and before you disposed of it, an entity other than you disposed of the car and:

                     (a)  the * consideration receivable for that disposal was at least the market value of the car at the time of that disposal; or

                     (b)  because of that disposal, that market value was included, or an amount worked out using that market value was included, in the entity’s assessable income under this Act.

##### <a id="20-140"></a>20-140  Reducing the amount to be included if there has been an earlier disposal

                   Each limit on the amount to be included in your assessable income because of your disposal of the * car is reduced if, after the lease period began and before your disposal, the car, or an interest in it, was disposed of in one of these situations:

Examples:  Your associate leases a car for 5 years and then acquires it. Your associate disposes of it to you and section 20-110 includes $500 in your associate’s assessable income.

                   You later dispose of the car.

                   In working out the amount to include in your assessable income for your disposal, you _can_ reduce each limit in subsection 20-125(2) by $500 because the disposal by your associate occurred _after_ the lease period began.

                   Contrast this case:

                   You lease a car for 5 years and then acquire it. You dispose of it to another entity and section 20-110 includes $1,000 in your assessable income.

                   You lease the car from that entity for 2 years and then acquire it. You later dispose of it.

                   In working out the amount to include in your assessable income in respect of the second lease, you _cannot_ reduce each limit in subsection 20-110(2) by $1,000 because the first disposal did _not_ occur after the start of that lease.

Note:          If the earlier disposal occurred in the 1996-97 income year or an earlier income year, each limit may be able to be reduced by a further amount: see section 20-115 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

#### Miscellaneous rules 

##### <a id="20-145"></a>20-145  No amount included if you inherited the car

                   You do _not_ include an  amount in your assessable income because of the disposal if you inherited the * car.

##### <a id="20-150"></a>20-150  Reducing the amount to be included if another provision requires you to include an amount for the disposal

                   The amount to be included in your assessable income because of the disposal is reduced by any amount that another provision of this Act (except sections 42-190 and 42-240) requires you to include in your assessable income because of the disposal.

Note:          Sections 42-190 and 42-240 are about including an amount after making a balancing adjustment on the disposal of a car.

##### <a id="20-155"></a>20-155  Exception for particular cars taken on hire

                   This Subdivision does not apply to these kinds of leases:

                     (a)  letting a * car on hire under a hire purchase agreement; or

                     (b)  letting a * car on hire under an agreement of a kind ordinarily entered into by people who take cars on hire intermittently on an hourly, daily, weekly or monthly basis.

#### Disposals of interests in a car: special rules apply

##### <a id="20-160"></a>20-160  Disposal of an interest in a car

             (1)  This Subdivision applies to the disposal of an interest in a * car in almost the same way as it does to the disposal of the car itself. The differences are set out below.

             (2)  Your assessable income includes so much of your * profit on the disposal as is reasonable. The limits in subsections 20-110(2) and 20-125(2) do _not_ apply.

             (3)  The cost of the interest to you is taken to be a reasonable amount.

             (4)  Sections 20-135 and 20-140 do _not_ apply to the disposal.

Note 1:       Section 20-135 says that you do not include an amount if there has been an earlier disposal of the car for market value.

Note 2:       Section 20-140 allows you to reduce the amount to be included if there has been an earlier disposal of the car.

             (5)  Section 20-145 applies to the disposal if you inherited either the interest or the * car itself.

Note:          Section 20-145 says that you do not include an amount if you inherited the car.

#### Operative provisions

##### <a id="25-5"></a>25-5  Tax-related expenses

             (1)  You can deduct expenditure you incur to the extent that it is for:

                     (a)  managing your * tax affairs; or

                     (b)  complying with an obligation imposed on you by a * Commonwealth law, insofar as that obligation relates to the * tax affairs of an entity; or

                     (c)  interest under section 170AA (Underpayment of tax) or 207A (Late payment of tax) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

Note:          To find out whether a trustee of a deceased estate can deduct expenditure under this section, see subsection 69(7) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

No deduction for certain expenditure

             (2)  You cannot deduct under subsection (1):

                     (a)  * tax; or

                     (b)  an amount payable under Part VI (Collection and recovery of tax) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; or

                     (c)  expenditure for borrowing money (including payments of interest) to pay an amount covered by paragraph (a) or (b); or 

                     (d)  expenditure for a matter relating to the commission (or possible commission) of an offence against an * Australian law or a * foreign law; or

                     (e)  a fee or commission for advice about the operation of a * Commonwealth law relating to taxation, unless that advice is provided by a * recognised tax adviser.

No deduction for expenditure excluded from general deductions

             (3)  You cannot deduct expenditure under subsection (1) to the extent that a provision of this Act (except section 8-1) expressly prevents or limits your deducting it under section 8-1 (about general deductions). It does not matter whether the provision specifically refers to section 8-1.

No deduction for capital expenditure

             (4)  You cannot deduct capital expenditure under subsection (1). However, for this purpose, expenditure is not capital expenditure merely because the * tax affairs concerned relate to matters of a capital nature.

Example:    Under this section, you can deduct expenditure you incur in applying for a private ruling on whether you can depreciate an item of property.

Use of property taken to be for income producing purpose

             (5)  Under some provisions of this Act it is important to decide whether you used property for the * purpose of producing assessable income. For provisions of that kind, your use of property is taken to be for that purpose insofar as you use the property for:

                     (a)  managing your * tax affairs; or

                     (b)  complying with an obligation imposed on you by a * Commonwealth law, insofar as that obligation relates to the * tax affairs of another entity.

Example:    You buy a computer to prepare your tax returns. The expenditure you incur in buying the computer is capital expenditure and cannot be deducted under this section. 

                   However, to the extent that you use the computer in preparing your income tax return, you will be able to depreciate your computer and deduct an amount under section 54 (Depreciation) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. That is because, under this subsection, the computer is property that you are taken to use for the purpose of producing assessable income.

             (6)  If another provision of this Act expressly provides that a particular use of property is not taken to be for the * purpose of producing assessable income, that provision overrides subsection (5).

##### <a id="25-10"></a>25-10  Repairs

             (1)  You can deduct expenditure you incur for repairs to premises (or part of premises), * plant, machinery, tools or articles that you held or used _solely_ for the * purpose of producing assessable income.

Property held or used partly for that purpose

             (2)  If you held or used the property only _partly_ for that purpose, you can deduct so much of the expenditure as is reasonable in the circumstances.

No deduction for capital expenditure

             (3)  You cannot deduct capital expenditure under this section.

##### <a id="25-15"></a>25-15  Amount paid for lease obligation to repair

                   You can deduct an amount that you pay for failing to comply with a lease obligation to make repairs to premises if you use or have used the premises for the * purpose of producing assessable income.

Note:          The amount is assessable income of the entity to which you pay it: either as ordinary income under section 6-5 or because it is included by section 15-25.

##### <a id="25-20"></a>25-20  Lease document expenses

             (1)  You can deduct expenditure you incur for preparing, registering or stamping:

                     (a)  a lease of property; or

                     (b)  an assignment or surrender of a lease of property;

if you have used or will use the property _solely_ for the * purpose of producing assessable income.

Property used partly for that purpose

             (2)  If you have used, or will use, the leased property only _partly_ for that purpose, you can deduct the expenditure to the extent that you have used, or will use, the leased property for that purpose.

##### <a id="25-25"></a>25-25  Borrowing expenses

             (1)  You can deduct expenditure you incur for borrowing money, to the extent that you use the money for the * purpose of producing assessable income. In most cases the deduction is spread over the *period of the loan. 

For the cases where the deduction is _not_ spread, see subsection (6).

Note:          Your deductions under this section may be reduced if any of your commercial debts have been forgiven in the income year: see Subdivision 245-E of Schedule 2C to the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

Income year when money used solely for the purpose of producing assessable income

             (2)  You can deduct for an income year the maximum amount worked out under subsection (4) if you use the borrowed money during that income year _solely_ for the * purpose of producing assessable income.

Example:    In 1997-98 you borrow $100,000 and incur expenditure of $1,500 for the borrowing. You use the money to buy a house. Throughout 1998-99 you rent the house to a tenant. You can deduct for the expenditure for 1998-99 the maximum amount worked out under subsection (4).

Income year when borrowed money used partly for that purpose

             (3)  If you use the money only _partly_ for that purpose during that income year, you can deduct the proportion of that maximum amount that is appropriate having regard to the extent that you used the borrowed money for that purpose.

Note:          You cannot deduct anything for that income year if you do not use the money for that purpose at all during that income year.

Maximum deduction for an income year

             (4)  You work out as follows the maximum amount that you can deduct for the expenditure for an income year:

* * *

_Method statement_

_Step 1._   Work out the **_remaining expenditure_** as follows:

                 •     For the income year in which the * period of the loan begins, it is the amount of the expenditure.

                 •     For a later income year, it is the amount of the expenditure reduced by the the maximum amount that you can deduct for the expenditure for each earlier income year.

_Step 2._   Work out the **_remaining loan period_** as follows:

                 •     For the income year in which the * period of the loan begins, it is the period of the loan (as determined at the end of the income year).

                 •     For a later income year, it is the period from the start of the income year until the end of the period of the loan (as determined at the end of the income year).

_Step 3._   Divide the remaining expenditure by the number of days in the remaining loan period.

_Step 4._   Multiply the result from Step 3 by the number of days in the remaining loan period that are in the income year.

* * *

Example:    To continue the example in subsection (2): suppose the original period of the loan is 4 years starting on 1 September 1997\. What is the maximum amount you can deduct for the expenditure for 1997-98?

                   Applying the method statement:

                   After Step 1: the remaining expenditure is $1,500 (the amount of the expenditure).

                   After Step 2: the remaining loan period is 4 years from 1 September 1997 (1,461 days).

                   After Step 3: the result is $1,500 divided by 1,461 = $1.03.

                   After Step 4: the result is $1.03 multiplied by 302 days = $310.06.

                   Suppose you repay the loan early, on 31 December 1998\. What is the maximum amount you can deduct for the expenditure for 1998-99? 

                   Applying the method statement:

                   After Step 1: the remaining expenditure is $1,500 (the amount of the expenditure) reduced by $310.06 (the maximum amount you can deduct for 1997-98) = $1,189.94.

                   After Step 2: the remaining loan period is the period from 1 July 1998 to 31 December 1998 (183 days).

                   After Step 3: the result is $1,189.94 divided by 183 days = $6.50.

                   After Step 4: the result is $6.50 multiplied by 183 days = $1,189.94.

Meaning of **period of the loan**

             (5)  The **_period of the loan_** is the shortest of these periods:

                     (a)  the period of the loan as specified in the original loan contract;

                     (b)  the period starting on the first day on which the money was borrowed and ending on the day the loan is repaid;

                     (c)  5 years starting on the first day on which the money was borrowed.

When deduction not spread

             (6)  If the total of the following is $100 or less:

                     (a)  each amount of expenditure you incur in an income year for borrowing money you use during that income year _solely_ for the * purpose of producing assessable income;

                     (b)  for each amount of expenditure you incur in that income year for borrowing money you use during that income year only _partly_ for that purpose—the proportion of that amount that is appropriate having regard to the extent that you use the money during that income year for that purpose;

you can deduct for the income year:

                     (c)  each amount covered by paragraph (a); and

                     (d)  each proportion covered by paragraph (b).

##### <a id="25-30"></a>25-30  Expenses of discharging a mortgage

Mortgage for borrowed money

             (1)  You can deduct expenditure you incur to discharge a mortgage that you gave as security for the repayment of money that you borrowed if you used the money _solely_ for the * purpose of producing assessable income.

Mortgage for property bought

             (2)  You can deduct expenditure you incur to discharge a mortgage that you gave as security for the payment of the whole or part of the purchase price of property that you bought if you used the property _solely_ for the * purpose of producing assessable income.

Money or property used partly for that purpose

             (3)  If you used the money you borrowed, or the property you bought, only _partly_ for the * purpose of producing assessable income, you can deduct the expenditure to the extent that you used the money or property for that purpose.

No deduction for payments of principal or interest

             (4)  You cannot deduct payments of principal or interest under this section.

##### <a id="25-35"></a>25-35  Bad debts

             (1)  You can deduct a debt (or part of a debt) that you write off as bad in the income year if:

                     (a)  it was included in your assessable income for the income year or for an earlier income year; or

                     (b)  it is in respect of money that you lent in the ordinary course of your * business of lending money.

Note:          If a bad debt is in respect of a payment that is required to be made under a qualifying security (within the meaning of Division 16E of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_): see subsection 63(1A) of that Act.

Writing off a debt you have bought

             (2)  You can deduct a debt that you write off as bad in the income year if you bought the debt in the ordinary course of your * business of lending money. However, you cannot deduct more than the expenditure you incurred in buying the debt.

Writing off part of a debt you have bought

             (3)  You can deduct a part of a debt if:

                     (a)  you write off that part as bad in the income year; and

                     (b)  you bought the debt in the ordinary course of your * business of lending money.

             (4)  However, the maximum that you can deduct under subsection (3) for one or more income years is the amount (if any) by which:

                        •  the expenditure you incurred in buying the debt;

exceeds:

                        •  so much of the debt as has not yet been written off as bad.

             (1)  To the extent that you incur expenditure in respect of providing * entertainment, you cannot deduct it under section 25-60.

             (2)  However, subsection (1) does not stop you deducting expenditure to the extent that you incur it in respect of:

#### Operative provisions

##### <a id="26-5"></a>26-5  Penalties

                   You cannot deduct under this Act:

                     (a)  an amount (however described) payable, by way of penalty, under an * Australian law or a * foreign law; or

                     (b)  an amount ordered by a court to be paid on the conviction of an entity for an offence against an * Australian law or a * foreign law.

##### <a id="26-10"></a>26-10  Leave payments

             (1)  You cannot deduct under this Act a loss or outgoing for long service leave, annual leave, sick leave or other leave except:

                     (a)  an amount paid in the income year to the individual to whom the leave relates (or, if that individual has died, to that individual’s dependant or * legal personal representative); or

                     (b)  an * accrued leave transfer payment that is made in the income year.

             (2)  An **_accrued leave transfer payment_** is a payment that an entity makes:

                     (a)  in respect of an individual’s leave (some or all of which accrued while the entity was required to make payments in respect of the individual’s leave, or leave the individual might take); and

                     (b)  when the entity is no longer required (or is about to stop being required) to make payments in respect of such leave; and

                     (c)  to another entity when the other entity has begun (or is about to begin) to be required to make payments in respect of such leave; and

                     (d)  under (or for the purposes of facilitating the provisions of) an * Australian law, or an award, order, determination or industrial agreement under an * Australian law.

It does not matter whether the leave accrues to the individual as an employee or for some other reason.

Example:    Your employee goes to a new employer. You pay the new employer $2,000 for the employee’s unused long service leave because an industrial agreement requires you to make that payment.

Note:          An accrued leave transfer payment is included in the assessable income of the entity to which it is made: see section 15-5.

\[The next section is section 26-20.]

             (1)  You cannot deduct under this Act:

Exception when you provide a fringe benefit 

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not stop you deducting expenditure you incur in * providing a * fringe benefit.

\[The next section is section 26-30.]

##### <a id="26-30"></a>26-30  Relative’s travel expenses

             (1)  You cannot deduct under this Act a loss or outgoing you incur, insofar as it is attributable to your * relative’s travel, if:

                     (b)  your relative accompanied you while you travelled.

Exception to subsection (1) 

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not stop you deducting a loss or outgoing if:

                     (a)  your * relative, while accompanying you, performed substantial duties as your employer’s employee, or as your employee; and

                     (b)  it is reasonable to conclude that your relative would still have accompanied you even if he or she had not had a personal relationship with you.

Exception when you provide a fringe benefit

             (3)  Subsection (1) does not stop you deducting expenditure you incur in * providing a * fringe benefit.

This section applies to PAYE earners

             (4)  If an individual is _not_ an employee, but _is_ a * PAYE earner, this section applies to him or her as if:

                     (a)  he or she were an employee; and

                     (b)  the entity (the **_notional employer_**) who pays (or is liable to pay) * PAYE earnings because of which he or she is (or would be) a * PAYE earner were his or her employer; and

                     (c)  any other individual who receives (or is entitled to receive) * PAYE earnings:

                              (i)  because of which the other individual is (or would be) a * PAYE earner; and

                             (ii)  that the notional employer pays (or is liable to pay) to the other individual;

                            were also an employee of the notional employer.

This section applies to entities liable to PAYE earnings

             (5)  If an entity is _not_ an employer, but pays (or is liable to pay) * PAYE earnings, this section applies to the entity as if:

                     (a)  it were an employer; and

                     (b)  an individual to whom the entity pays (or is liable to pay) * PAYE earnings were the entity’s employee.

##### <a id="26-35"></a>26-35  Reducing deductions for amounts paid to related entities

You can only deduct reasonable amounts paid to related entities

             (1)  If, under another provision of this Act, you can deduct an amount for a payment you make, or for a liability you incur, to a * related entity, then you can only deduct so much of the amount as the Commissioner considers reasonable.

Note:          This section has a special operation if the payment is made, or the liability is incurred, by a partnership in which a private company is a partner: see section 65 (Payments to associated persons and relatives) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

Meaning of **related entity**

             (2)  A **_related entity_** is any of the following:

                     (a)  your * relative; or

                     (b)  a partnership in which your relative is a partner.

             (3)  In the case of a partnership, a **_related entity_** is any of the following:

                     (a)  a * relative of a partner in the partnership;

                     (b)  an individual who is or has been a director of a company that is a partner in the partnership and is a * private company for the income year;

                     (c)  an entity that is or has been a shareholder in a company of that kind;

                     (d)  a * relative of an individual who is or has been a director or shareholder of a company of that kind;

                     (e)  a beneficiary of a trust if the trustee is a partner in the partnership;

                      (f)  a * relative of a beneficiary of a trust if the trustee is a partner in the partnership;

                     (g)  another partnership, if a partner in the other partnership is a * relative of a partner in the first partnership.

However, a partner in a partnership is _not_ a **_related entity_** of the partnership.

If you can’t deduct, then related entity doesn’t include amount as income

             (4)  To the extent that subsection (1) stops you deducting an amount, the amount is neither assessable income, nor exempt income, of the * related entity.

Amendments of assessments

             (5)  The Commissioner can amend an assessment at any time for the purpose of giving effect to subsection (4).

Example:    An amount was not included in the related entity’s assessable income because at the time you could not deduct the amount. At a later time you discover that you could deduct the amount and your assessment is amended. The Commissioner can amend the entity’s assessment so that the amount is included in the entity’s assessable income.

##### <a id="26-40"></a>26-40  Maintaining your family

                   You cannot deduct under this Act expenditure you incur for maintaining:

                     (a)  your * spouse (except a spouse permanently living separately and apart from you); or

                     (b)  your * child who is under 16 years.

Example:    A farmer cannot deduct an amount for food or lodgings that the farmer provides to his or her child who is under 16 years for the work the child performs on the farm.

##### <a id="26-45"></a>26-45  Recreational club expenses

             (1)  You cannot deduct under this Act a loss or outgoing to the extent you incur it to obtain or maintain:

                     (a)  membership of a * recreational club; or

                     (b)  rights to enjoy (otherwise than as a * member) facilities provided by a * recreational club for the use or benefit of its * members;

whether for yourself or someone else.

Meaning of **recreational club**

             (2)  A **_recreational_ _club_** is a company that was established or is carried on mainly to provide facilities, for the use or benefit of its * members, for drinking, dining, * recreation or entertainment.

Exception when you provide a fringe benefit

             (3)  Subsection (1) does not stop you deducting expenditure you incur in * providing a * fringe benefit.

##### <a id="26-50"></a>26-50  Expenses for a leisure facility or boat

             (1)  You cannot deduct under this Act a loss or outgoing to the extent you incur it:

                     (a)  to acquire ownership of a * leisure facility or boat; or

                     (b)  to retain ownership of a * leisure facility or boat; or

                     (c)  to acquire rights to use a * leisure facility or boat; or

                     (d)  to retain rights to use a * leisure facility or boat; or

                     (e)  to use, operate, maintain or repair a * leisure facility or boat; or

                      (f)  in relation to any obligation associated with your ownership of a * leisure facility or boat; or

                     (g)  in relation to any obligation associated with your rights to use a * leisure facility or boat.

However, there are exceptions (see subsections (3), (4), (5), (6) and (8)).

What is a **leisure facility**?

             (2)  A**_leisure facility_** is land, a building, or part of a building or other structure, that is used (or held for use) for holidays or * recreation.

Exception—leisure facilities

             (3)  Subsection (1) does not stop you deducting a loss or outgoing for a * leisure facility if at all times in the income year:

                     (a)  you hold the leisure facility for sale in the ordinary course of your business of selling leisure facilities; or

                     (b)  you use the leisure facility (or hold it for use) mainly to provide it:

                              (i)  in the ordinary course of your * business of providing leisure facilities for payment; or

                             (ii)  to produce your assessable income in the nature of rents, lease premiums, licence fees or similar charges; or

                            (iii)  for your employees to use; or

                            (iv)  for the care of your employees’ children.

In the case of a company, subparagraphs (b)(iii) and (iv) do not apply to employees who are * members or directors of the company.

Exception—part year use of leisure facilities

             (4)  If you use a * leisure facility (or hold it) as described in subsection (3) at all times during _part_ of the income year, then subsection (1) does not stop you deducting so much of the loss or outgoing as is reasonable in the circumstances.

Exception—boats

             (5)  Subsection (1) does not stop you deducting a loss or outgoing for a boat if at all times in the income year you:

                     (a)  hold the boat as * trading stock for sale in the ordinary course of a * business that you carry on; or

                     (b)  use the boat (or hold it) mainly for letting it on hire in the ordinary course of a * business that you carry on; or

                     (c)  use the boat (or hold it) mainly for transporting for payment in the ordinary course of a * business that you carry on, the public or goods; or

                     (d)  use the boat for a purpose that is essential to the efficient conduct of a * business that you carry on.

Exception—part year use of boats

             (6)  If you use a boat (or hold it) as described in subsection (5) at all times during _part_ of the income year, then subsection (1) does not stop you deducting so much of the loss or outgoing as is reasonable in the circumstances.

Anti-avoidance—when exceptions do not apply

             (7)  A * leisure facility or boat is taken not to be used (or held) as described in subsection (3) or (5) if:

                     (a)  apart from this subsection, the leisure facility or boat would be used (or held) in that way because of a * scheme; and

                     (b)  in the Commissioner’s opinion, the scheme would not have been entered into or carried out if this section had not been enacted.

Exception when you provide a fringe benefit

             (8)  Subsection (1) does not stop you deducting expenditure you incur in * providing a * fringe benefit.

30-10        Index

##### <a id="30-5"></a>30-5  How to find your way around this Division

             (1)  You should start at Subdivision 30-A unless you are making a testamentary gift under the Cultural Bequests Program.

Note:          Subdivision 30-D deals with the deductibility of such a gift.

             (2)  Subdivision 30-A contains a table of all the gifts and contributions that you can deduct. You need to look at the table to see whether the type of gift or contribution you are making is covered by it.

             (3)  In some cases, the table sends you off to Subdivision 30-B. It has a number of tables that list particular funds, authorities or institutions that deductible gifts can be made to.

             (4)  In other cases, the table sends you off to Subdivision 30-C. It contains rules that apply to particular gifts of property.

             (5)  Subdivision 30-E requires the establishment of a register of * environmental organisations. Subdivision 30-F requires the establishment of a register of * cultural organisations. Their only relevance to you is that you can deduct a gift that you make to a fund listed on either register.

##### <a id="30-15"></a>30-15  Table of gifts or contributions that you can deduct

             (1)  You can deduct a gift or contribution that you make in the situations set out in the following table. It tells you:

                          who the recipient of the gift or contribution can be; and

                          the type of gift or contribution that you can make; and

                          how much you can deduct for the gift or contribution; and

                          any special conditions that apply.

             (2)  A testamentary gift or contribution is not deductible under this section.

Note:          Subdivision 30-D deals with the deductibility of testamentary gifts under the Cultural Bequests Program.

#### Subdivision 30-C—Rules applying to particular gifts of property

**Table of sections**

Valuation requirements

30-200      Getting written valuations

30-205      Sale price would have been assessable

30-210      Approved valuers

Working out the amount you can deduct for a gift of property

30-215      How much you can deduct

30-220      Reducing the amount you can deduct

Joint ownership of property

30-225      Gift of property by joint owners

#### Valuation requirements

##### <a id="30-200"></a>30-200  Getting written valuations

             (1)  You satisfy the valuation requirements if you get 2 or more written valuations of the gift you made.

Note 1:       In most cases, you need to get these written valuations to be able to deduct a gift of property that you make to a recipient covered by 
 item 4, 5 or 6 of the table in section 30-15.

Note 2:       You do _not_ need to get written valuations in the circumstances set out in section 30-205.

             (2)  The valuations must be by different individuals, each of whom is an approved valuer of the kind of property you are giving away.

Note:          Section 30-210 deals with how an individual becomes an approved valuer.

             (3)  Each valuation must state the amount that, in the opinion of the valuer, was:

                     (a)  the market value of the property on the day you made the gift; or

                     (b)  the market value of the property on the day the valuation was made.

             (4)  If a valuation states the market value of the property on the day the valuation was made, it must have been made within 90 days before or after the gift was made. However, the Commissioner may allow a longer period than this.

##### <a id="30-205"></a>30-205  Sale price would have been assessable

                   You do _not_ need to get written valuations of the gift you made if:

                     (a)  no amount is included in your assessable income in respect of the gift you made; but

                     (b)  an amount _would_ have been included in your assessable income if you had sold the property instead of making the gift.

##### <a id="30-210"></a>30-210  Approved valuers

             (1)  The Secretary to the Department of Communications and the Arts may approve an individual as a valuer of a particular kind of property. The approval must be in writing, signed by the Secretary.

             (2)  The Secretary must, in deciding whether to approve an individual, have regard to:

                     (a)  the individual’s qualifications, experience and knowledge in valuing that kind of property; and

                     (b)  the individual’s knowledge of the current market value of that kind of property; and

                     (c)  the individual’s standing in the professional community.

#### Working out the amount you can deduct for a gift of property

##### <a id="30-215"></a>30-215  How much you can deduct

             (1)  This section contains the rules for working out how much you can deduct for a gift of property that you make to a recipient covered by item 4, 5 or 6 of the table in section 30-15.

             (2)  The general rule is that the amount you can deduct for a gift of this kind is the average of the market values specified in the written valuations you got from the approved valuers.

Note:          In some situations you must reduce the amount you can deduct: see section 30-220.

             (3)  The exceptions to the general rule are set out in this table:

##### <a id="30-220"></a>30-220  Reducing the amount you can deduct

             (1)  The amount you can deduct is reduced by a reasonable amount if:

                            (iii)  does not obtain an immediate, indefeasible and unencumbered legal and equitable title to the property; or

                     (b)  the custody, control or use of the property by the recipient is affected by an * arrangement entered into in respect of the making of the gift.

             (2)  In deciding what is a reasonable amount, have regard to the effect of those terms and conditions, or that * arrangement, on the market value of the gift.

             (6)  If:

                     (a)  you die before the last day of an income year; and

                     (b)  section 26-55 (which is about a limit on deductions) prevents the whole or a part of the gift from being deductible in the tax return lodged for you for that income year;

the trustee of your estate can claim the whole or part as a deduction in the trust return for that income year.

Note:          The trust return covers the period from the day you die to the end of the income year.

##### <a id="30-235"></a>30-235  Getting a certificate

You cannot deduct costs of providing entertainment. Nor can you deduct amounts for property that you use for providing entertainment. But there are exceptions.

* * *

#### Subdivision 32-A—No deduction for entertainment expenses

**Table of sections**

32-5          No deduction for entertainment expenses

32-10        Meaning of**_entertainment_**

32-15        No deduction for property used for providing entertainment

##### <a id="32-5"></a>32-5  No deduction for entertainment expenses

                   To the extent that you incur a loss or outgoing in respect of providing * entertainment, you cannot deduct it under section 8-1\. However, there are exceptions, which are set out in 
 Subdivision 32-B.

Note 1:       Under section 8-1 you can deduct a loss or outgoing that you incur for the purpose of producing assessable income.

Note 2:       If you have used your property in providing entertainment, you may not be able to deduct an amount for the property: see section 32-15\. 

Note 3:       Section 32-75 deals with arrangements to avoid the operation of this section.

##### <a id="32-10"></a>32-10  Meaning of _entertainment_

             (1)  **_Entertainment_** means:

                     (a)  entertainment by way of food, drink or * recreation; or

                     (b)  accommodation or travel to do with providing entertainment by way of food, drink or * recreation.

             (2)  You are taken to provide **_entertainment_** even if business discussions or transactions occur.

Note:          These are some examples of what is entertainment:

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>· business lunches

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>· social functions.

                   These are some examples of what is _not_ entertainment:

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>· meals on business travel overnight

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>· theatre attendance by a critic

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>· a restaurant meal of a food writer.

##### <a id="32-15"></a>32-15  No deduction for property used for providing entertainment

                   To the extent that you use property in providing * entertainment, your use of the property is taken _not_ to be for the * purpose of producing assessable income if section 32-5 would stop you deducting a loss or outgoing if you incurred it in the income year in providing the entertainment.

Note:          Under some provisions of this Act, in order to deduct an amount for your property, you must have used the property for the purpose of producing assessable income.

#### Subdivision 32-B—Exceptions

**Table of sections**

32-20        The main exception—fringe benefits

32-25        The tables set out the other exceptions

32-30        Employer expenses 

32-35        Seminar expenses 

32-40        Entertainment industry expenses 

32-45        Promotion and advertising expenses 

32-50        Other expenses 

##### <a id="32-20"></a>32-20  The main exception—fringe benefits

                   Section 32-5 does not stop you deducting a loss or outgoing to the extent that you incur it in respect of providing * entertainment by way of * providing a * fringe benefit. 

                   But this exception does not apply to the extent that the taxable value of the * fringe benefit is reduced under section 63A of the _Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986._

Note 1:       You may be able to deduct losses or outgoings that are fringe benefits under section 51AEA, 51AEB or 51AEC of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. If you do, then you cannot deduct them under section 8-1 (about general deductions) and so this section is not relevant.

Note 2:       There are other exceptions for a loss or outgoing you incur in providing a benefit that would be a fringe benefit if it were not an exempt benefit: see items 1.6 and 1.7 of the table in section 32-30.

##### <a id="32-25"></a>32-25  The tables set out the other exceptions

                   Section 32-5 does not stop you deducting a loss or outgoing to the extent that you incur it in respect of providing * entertainment as described in column 2 of an item of a table in this Subdivision.

                   However, if column 3 of that item applies, the exception in column 2 of that item does not.

#### Subdivision 32-D—In-house dining facilities (employer expenses table item 1.2)

**Table of sections**

32-70        $30 is assessable for each meal provided to non-employee in an in-house dining facility

##### <a id="32-70"></a>32-70  $30 is assessable for each meal provided to non-employee in an in-house dining facility

             (1)  Your assessable income includes $30 for a meal you provide in an * in-house dining facility in the income year to an individual other than your employee, but only if:

                     (a)  you incur a loss or outgoing in respect of providing the meal; and

                     (b)  because of item 1.2 of the table in section 32-30, 
 section 32-5 does not stop you deducting the loss or outgoing under section 8-1 (which deals with general deductions); and

                     (c)  the loss or outgoing is one that you can deduct under 
 section 8-1 for the income year or some other income year.

             (2)  However, you can choose _not_ to include in your assessable income $30 for each meal you provide in the * in-house dining facility in the income year to an individual other than your employee.

Note:          If you do choose, you cannot rely on item 1.2 of the table in 
 section 32-30 as a basis for deducting a loss or outgoing you incur in respect of providing a meal.

             (3)  You must choose by the day you lodge your * income tax return for the income year, or within a further time allowed by the Commissioner.

#### Subdivision 32-E—Anti-avoidance

**Table of sections**

32-75        Commissioner may treat you as having incurred entertainment expense

##### <a id="32-75"></a>32-75  Commissioner may treat you as having incurred entertainment expense

                   If:

                     (a)  you incur a loss or outgoing under an * arrangement; and

                     (b)  someone provides * entertainment under the arrangement to you or someone else; and

                     (c)  section 32-5 would have stopped you deducting the loss or outgoing under section 8-1 (which deals with general deductions) if you had incurred it in respect of providing that entertainment;

this Division applies to you as if you had incurred the loss or outgoing in providing that entertainment, to the extent (if any) that the Commissioner thinks reasonable.

Note:          This means that section 32-5 will prevent you from deducting the loss or outgoing under section 8-1 unless an exception applies.

Example:    A company pays $1,000 to sponsor a football game. Under the same arrangement, the company is given a viewing box at the game. To the extent the Commissioner thinks reasonable, he or she can treat the company as having incurred the $1,000 in providing entertainment.

##### <a id="42-40"></a>42-40  Choices

             (1)  Any choice you are required to make under this Division must be made:

                     (a)  by the day you lodge your * income tax return for the income year to which the choice relates; or

                     (b)  within a further time allowed by the Commissioner.

             (2)  Your choice, once made, applies to that income year and all later income years.

##### <a id="42-45"></a>42-45  Exclusions

Primary production expenditure

             (1)  You cannot deduct an amount for depreciation of * plant if any expenditure incurred on it by any entity has been or can be deducted under Subdivision 387-A (Landcare operations) or 387-B (Facilities to conserve or convey water).

Research and development plant

             (2)  You cannot deduct an amount for depreciation of * plant that you have * installed ready for use exclusively for the purpose of carrying on * research and development activities unless you have elected under subsection 73B(18) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ that the research and development provisions are not to apply to the plant.

Leisure facilities and boats

             (3)  You cannot deduct an amount for depreciation of a * leisure facility or a boat unless, at some time in the income year:

                     (a)  its use constitutes a * fringe benefit; or

                     (b)  you use the leisure facility or hold it for use as mentioned in subsection 26-50(3); or

                     (c)  you use the boat or hold it for use as mentioned in 
 paragraph 26-50(5)(b), (c) or (d).

##### <a id="42-48"></a>42-48  Debt forgiveness: amounts deducted for depreciation

             (1)  An amount applied in reduction of deductible expenditure (within the meaning of Division 245 of Schedule 2C to the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) for * plant under section 245-155 of that Schedule is taken to be an amount you have deducted under section 42-15 for depreciation of the plant.

             (2)  The amount is taken to have been deducted as at the first day of your income year that corresponds to the forgiveness year of income for the reduction within the meaning of Division 245 of that Schedule.

Note:          Therefore, the amount must be taken into account for the plant under paragraph (a) of the definition of **_undeducted cost_** in section 42-175\. Also, because the amount is taken to have been deducted as at the first day of the income year, it will reduce the opening undeducted cost of the plant if you are using the diminishing value method.

#### Non-operative provisions

##### <a id="42-50"></a>42-50  What are other “amounts deducted for depreciation”?

             (1)  A number of provisions in this Division require you to work out the amounts you have deducted or can deduct for depreciation of plant. Apart from amounts you have deducted or can deduct under section 42-15, other amounts may need to be taken into account.

             (2)  Those other amounts are:

* * *

_Method statement_

_Step 1._ Work out the **_cost_** of the * plant using the following table. If more than one row applies, use the cost under the last applicable row.

_Step 2._ The table indicates provisions that may adjust the cost. Refer to them to see if an adjustment is necessary.

_Step 3._ If more than one provision adjusts the cost, apply them in the order they appear in the table to:

               (a)     the cost; or

               (b)     the adjusted cost after applying the last applicable provision.

_Step 4._   The result is your **_cost_**.

* * *

Example:    An entity acquires a car in a non-arm’s length transaction for $80,000\. The market value of the car is $60,000\. Assume the car depreciation limit for the year is $55,000.

                   The provisional cost is $80,000 (item 1 of the table). The non-arm’s length rule is applied next to reduce it to $60,000\. Then the car depreciation limit applies to further reduce it. Your cost is $55,000.

##### <a id="42-70"></a>42-70  Adjustment: acquiring a car at a discount

             (1)  You must increase the cost of a * car designed mainly for carrying passengers and which you acquire at a discount if:

                     (a)  it is reasonable to conclude that any portion (**_discount portion_**) of the discount is referable to you or another entity selling other * plant for less than its market value; and

                     (b)  you, or another entity, deducted or can deduct an amount for depreciation of the other plant for any income year; and

                     (c)  the sum of the cost of the car and the discount portion exceeds the * car depreciation limit calculated under 
 section 42-345 for the * financial year in which you first use the car for any purpose.

             (2)  The cost of the * car is increased by the discount portion.

Note:          The termination value of the other plant is also increased by the discount portion: see section 42-205.

             (3)  This section does not apply to a * car that is excluded from 
 section 42-80 by subsection 42-80(2).

##### <a id="42-75"></a>42-75  Adjustment: non-arm’s length transactions

                   Common rule 2 applies for the purpose of working out the cost of * plant, but with the following modifications:

                     (a)  it applies to cost rather than expenditure; and

                     (b)  it compares the cost with the amount that would have been the cost if the parties had dealt with each other at arm’s length, and substitutes that amount instead of market value.

##### <a id="42-80"></a>42-80  Adjustment: car depreciation limit

             (1)  If the cost of a * car designed mainly for carrying passengers would exceed the * car depreciation limit for the * financial year in which you first use the car for any purpose, your cost is reduced to that limit.

             (2)  This section does not apply to a * car that, immediately before you first used it for any purpose, was specially fitted out for transporting disabled people in wheelchairs unless, at that time:

                     (a)  it was for your personal transportation; and

                     (b)  it would be covered by subitem 96(1) or 97(1) of Schedule 1 to the _Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1992_.

##### <a id="42-85"></a>42-85  Adjustment: double deduction

             (1)  The cost of * plant is reduced by any portion of its cost that you have deducted or can deduct, or that has been or will be taken into account in working out an amount you can deduct, other than for depreciation.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply to deductions for:

                     (a)  research and development (section 73B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_);

                     (b)  development and investment allowances (Subdivisions B and BA of Division 3 of Part III of that Act);

                     (c)  drought investment allowance (Part XII of that Act).

##### <a id="42-90"></a>42-90  Adjustment: previously depreciated plant limit

             (1)  The Commissioner may limit the cost to you of * plant for which an amount has been deducted or can be deducted for depreciation by any earlier owner or * quasi-owner.

             (2)  The cost of the * plant may be limited to the sum of:

                     (a)  its * written down value, immediately before the * balancing adjustment event occurred, in the hands of the last entity who had deducted or can deduct an amount for depreciation of it; and

                     (b)  any balancing adjustment included in that entity’s assessable income for the plant under Subdivision 42-F or 42-G; and

                     (c)  any balancing adjustment that would have been included in that entity’s assessable income for the plant if balancing adjustment relief under section 42-285 (same year relief) or 42-290 (later year relief) had not applied.

             (3)  If the last entity had the * plant in a * pool for the income year in which the * balancing adjustment event occurred, its cost may be limited to the sum of:

                     (a)  any balancing adjustment included in that entity’s assessable income for the plant under section 42-390; and

                     (b)  any balancing adjustment that would have been included in that entity’s assessable income for the plant if balancing adjustment relief under section 42-285 or 42-290 had not applied.

             (4)  The matters to be taken into account by the Commissioner in deciding whether to limit the cost of * plant include:

                     (a)  whether you acquired the plant from an * associate; and

                     (b)  the market value of the plant; and

                     (c)  how the purchase price of the plant was calculated; and

                     (d)  how the acquisition was financed; and

                     (e)  whether the plant is for use by the entity from whom you acquired it or by an associate of the entity.

#### Operative provisions

##### <a id="42-100"></a>42-100  Choice of method

             (1)  You must either:

                     (a)  work out the * effective life of * plant; or

                     (b)  adopt the * effective life specified by the Commissioner (if any) for the plant under section 42-110.

             (2)  You make the choice for the income year in which a depreciation deduction is first allowable to you for the * plant.

##### <a id="42-105"></a>42-105  How to work out effective life

             (1)  You work out the * effective life of * plant by estimating how long it can be used by any entity for income producing purposes. You do this as at the time you first use it, or have it * installed ready for use, for the * purpose of producing assessable income.

             (2)  In making that estimate, you assume that the * plant:

                     (a)  is new; and

                     (b)  will be subject to wear and tear at a rate that was reasonable for you to expect when you were working it out having regard to the expected circumstances of your use; and

                     (c)  will be maintained in reasonably good order and condition.

             (3)  If, at that time, you conclude that you would be likely to scrap the * plant, sell it for scrap or abandon it before the end of the period worked out under subsection (1), its * effective life ends at the earlier time. This conclusion is also to be made on the assumption that the plant is new.

##### <a id="42-110"></a>42-110  Commissioner’s determination of effective life

             (1)  The Commissioner may make a written determination specifying the * effective life of * plant.

             (2)  Any conditions in the determination must be satisfied when you first use the * plant, or have it * installed ready for use, for the * purpose of producing assessable income.

                   where:

                    <a name="opening-undeducted-cost"></a>**_opening undeducted cost_** is the * undeducted cost of the * plant on the first day of the income year on which you were its owner or * quasi-owner.

                    <a name="dai-owned"></a>**_days owned_** is the number of days in the income year you were the owner or * quasi-owner of the * plant.

##### <a id="42-165"></a>42-165  _Prime cost method_

             (1)  Calculate your deduction using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004C00927/Html/TaxLawImprovement1997_image007.gif)

                   where:

             (2)  However, if you are using the 100% rate, your deduction is your * cost.

             (3)  In applying this section, the * cost of the * plant is reduced by:

                     (a)  any amount that you choose under section 42-285 or 42-290 (balancing adjustment relief) to treat as having been deducted for depreciation of the plant; and

                     (b)  any amount you are taken to have deducted for depreciation of the plant under subsection 42-48(2) (debt forgiveness).

Note:          You cannot deduct more than the undeducted cost of the plant.

##### <a id="42-170"></a>42-170  Reducing deductions

General

             (1)  Reduce your deduction by an amount that reasonably reflects the extent (if any) you neither used the * plant, nor had it * installed ready for use, for the * purpose of producing assessable income during the period in the income year you were its owner or * quasi-owner.

Leisure facilities and boats

             (2)  You may have to make a further reduction if your * plant is a * leisure facility or a boat. That reduction is made for any period in the income year during which you:

                     (a)  were its owner or * quasi-owner; and

                     (b)  used it, or had it * installed ready for use, for the * purpose of producing assessable income.

             (3)  The reduction must reflect the extent (if any) to which you did not satisfy any of the exceptions in paragraphs 42-45(3)(a), (b) and (c) for the * leisure facility or boat in that period.

Note:          Paragraphs 42-45(3)(a), (b) and (c) set out the limited circumstances in which you can deduct an amount for a leisure facility or a boat.

##### <a id="42-175"></a>42-175  Meaning of _undeducted cost_

                   The **_undeducted cost_** of * plant is its * cost less the sum of:

                     (a)  for plant that is not a * car—the amounts you have deducted or can deduct for depreciation of the plant; and

                     (b)  for plant that is not a car—any further amounts you could have deducted for depreciation of the plant for any period you were its owner or * quasi-owner and used it, or had it * installed ready for use, assuming that:

                              (i)  you used it wholly for the * purpose of producing assessable income during that period; and

                             (ii)  you used the same rate and method during that period as you used for the income year in which a depreciation deduction was first allowable to you for the plant; and

                            (iii)  no provision of this Act denied a depreciation deduction for it; and

                     (c)  if the plant is a car—the amounts you could have deducted under this Division for any period you were its owner and used it, or had it installed ready for use, assuming that:

                              (i)  you used it wholly for the purpose of producing assessable income during that period; and

                             (ii)  you used the same rate and method during that period as you used for the income year in which a depreciation deduction was first allowable to you for the car; and

                            (iii)  no provision of this Act denied a depreciation deduction for it; and

                            (iv)  Division 28 (Car expenses) did not apply; and

                     (d)  if Common rule 1 applied to your acquisition of the plant—the sum of the amounts that would apply under paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) to the transferor and earlier successive transferors.

#### Operative provisions

##### <a id="42-185"></a>42-185  When do you make a balancing adjustment calculation?

                   You must make a balancing adjustment calculation for the income year in which a * balancing adjustment event occurs.

##### <a id="42-190"></a>42-190  Including an amount in assessable income

             (1)  You include an amount in your assessable income if the * termination value of * plant exceeds its * written down value.

             (2)  You include the lesser of:

                     (a)  the amounts you have deducted or can deduct for depreciation of the * plant; and

                     (b)  the excess referred to in subsection (1).

For balancing adjustment relief, see sections 42-285, 42-290 and 42-295.

For plant used for research and development, see section 42-220.

             (3)  If Common rule 1 applied to your acquisition of the * plant, the amounts you have deducted or can deduct are taken to include amounts the transferor, and earlier successive transferors, deducted or can deduct for depreciation of it.

##### <a id="42-195"></a>42-195  Deducting an amount

             (1)  You deduct an amount if the * termination value of * plant is less than its * undeducted cost.

             (2)  The amount you deduct is the difference between those amounts.

             (3)  However, you reduce that difference to reasonably reflect the extent (if any) to which you used the * plant, or had it * installed ready for use, other than for the * purpose of producing assessable income when you were its owner or * quasi-owner.

##### <a id="42-200"></a>42-200  Meaning of _written down value_

                   The **_written down value_** of * plant is its * cost less the sum of:

                     (a)  the amounts you have deducted or can deduct for depreciation of it; and

                     (b)  if Common rule 1 applied to your acquisition of it—the amounts the transferor, and earlier successive transferors, deducted or can deduct for depreciation of it.

##### <a id="42-205"></a>42-205  Meaning of _termination value_

* * *

_Method statement_

_Step 1._Work out the **_termination value_** of the * plant using the following table. If more than one row applies, use the value under the last applicable row.

_Step 2._The table indicates provisions which may adjust the value. Refer to them to see if an adjustment is necessary.

_Step 3._   If more than one provision adjusts the value, apply them in the order they appear in the table to:

               (a)     the termination value; or

               (b)     the adjusted termination value after applying the last applicable provision.

_Step 4._   The result is your **_termination value_**.

##### <a id="42-210"></a>42-210  Adjustment: non-arm’s length transactions

             (1)  Common rule 2 applies for the  purpose of working out the * termination valueof * plant.

             (2)  However, that Common rule has a different application for depreciation purposes in 2 respects:

                     (a)  it only applies to disposals by sale; and

                     (b)  instead of requiring the party disposing of the property to have incurred capital expenditure, it is taken to require that party to have incurred a * cost.

##### <a id="42-215"></a>42-215  Adjustment: car depreciation limit

                   For a * car the * cost of which was worked out by applying section 42-80 (Car depreciation limit), adjust the value by multiplying it by the fraction:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004C00927/Html/TaxLawImprovement1997_image009.gif)

where:

                    <a name=""></a><a name="cdl"></a>**_CDL_** is the * car depreciation limit for the * car for the * financial year in which you first used it for any purpose.

                    <a name="origin-cost"></a>**_original cost_** is the * cost of the * car (ignoring the * car depreciation limit).

##### <a id="42-220"></a>42-220  Plant used for research and development

             (1)  The amounts referred to in paragraph 42-190(2)(a) are increased if you have deducted or can deduct an amount for the * plant under section 73B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. However, this subsection does not apply if subsection (3) applies.

             (2)  The increase for * plant to which subsection (1) applies is the difference between:

                     (a)  its cost under section 73B, ignoring subsection 73B(6); and

                     (b)  its written down value under that section.

Note:          Subsection 73B(6) imposed a ceiling of $10,000,000 on the cost of certain pilot plant for research and development purposes.

             (3)  The amounts referred to in paragraph 42-190(2)(a) are increased if you acquired the * plant under a disposal to which Common rule 1 or section 73E of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (roll-over relief) applied and:

                     (a)  the transferor had deducted or could deduct an amount for the plant under section 73B of that Act; or

                     (b)  your acquisition of the plant was the last of 2 or more successive transfers to which Common rule 1 or section 73E applied and any of the prior transferors had deducted or could deduct an amount for the plant under section 73B.

             (4)  The increase for * plant to which subsection (3) applies is worked out using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004C00927/Html/TaxLawImprovement1997_image010.gif)

where:

                    <a name="transferor-origin-cost"></a>**_transferor’s original cost_** means:

                     (a)  the * plant’s cost; or

                     (b)  if paragraph (3)(b) applies—the plant’s cost to the earliest successive transferor;

under section 73B, ignoring subsection 73B(6).

                    <a name="modifi-written-down-valu"></a>**_modified written down value_** means the written down value under section 73B worked out as though:

                     (a)  the transferor's original cost were your cost; and

                     (b)  the amount mentioned in paragraph (3)(a) or (b) had been deducted or deductible by you.

##### <a id="42-230"></a>42-230  Explanatory material

             (1)  This Subdivision has limited application because:

                     (a)  if you have used only the “cents per kilometre” method or the “12% of original value” method since you began using the car, you will not have been able to deduct depreciation and so balancing adjustments are not relevant; and

                     (b)  if you have used only the “log book” method or the 
 “one-third of actual expenses” method since you began using the car, balancing adjustments are calculated under Subdivision 42-F.

             (2)  If this Subdivision applies, you have to reduce your balancing adjustment to reflect the extent to which you have chosen the “cents per kilometre” method or the “12% of original value” method: see section 42-250.

#### Operative provisions

##### <a id="42-235"></a>42-235  When do you use this Subdivision for a car?

             (1)  A balancing adjustment for a * car is calculated under this Subdivision if, for the period you were its owner:

                     (a)  you deducted or can deduct an amount for depreciation of the car in one or more income years; and 

                     (b)  you chose:

                              (i)  the “cents per kilometre” method in 
 Subdivision 28-C; or

                             (ii)  the “12% of original value” method in 
 Subdivision 28-D;

                            for deducting your * car expenses for the car for one or more other income years.

             (2)  You must make that calculation for the income year in which a * balancing adjustment event occurs for the * car.

##### <a id="42-240"></a>42-240  Including an amount in assessable income

             (1)  You include an amount in your assessable income if the * termination value of the * car exceeds its * notional written down value.

             (2)  First, work out the lesser of:

                     (a)  the sum of the * notional depreciation amount and the amounts you have deducted or can deduct for depreciation of the * car; and

                     (b)  the excess referred to in subsection (1).

             (3)  Then apply the reduction rule in section 42-250 and include the result in your assessable income.

For balancing adjustment relief, see sections 42-285, 42-290 and 42-295.

             (4)  If Common rule 1 applied to your acquisition of the * car, the amounts you have deducted or can deduct are taken to include amounts the transferor, and earlier successive transferors, deducted or can deduct for depreciation of it.

##### <a id="42-245"></a>42-245  Deducting an amount

             (1)  You deduct an amount if the * termination value of the * car is less than its * undeducted cost.

             (2)  Work out the difference between those amounts.

             (3)  Reduce that difference to reasonably reflect the extent (if any) to which you used the * car, or had it * installed ready for use, other than for the * purpose of producing assessable income when you were its owner. In working out the reduction for the income years for which you chose the “cents per kilometre” method or the “12% of original value” method for the car, you apply the assumptions in section 42-255.

             (4)  Then apply the reduction rule in section 42-250 and deduct the result.

##### <a id="42-250"></a>42-250  Reduction to take account of days when depreciation not claimed

                 Multiply the amount from subsection 42-240(2) or 42-245(3) by the fraction calculated using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004C00927/Html/TaxLawImprovement1997_image012.gif)

where:

                    <a name="depreci-dai"></a>**_depreciation days_** is the total number of days you were the owner of the * car in each income year for which you have deducted or can deduct an amount for depreciation of it.

                    <a name="non-depreci-dai"></a>**_non-depreciation days_** is the total number of days you were the owner of the * car in each income year for which you chose the “cents per kilometre” method or the “12% of original value” method for deducting your * car expenses.

##### <a id="42-255"></a>42-255  Meaning of _notional depreciation amount_

                   The **_notional depreciation amount_** for a * car is the sum of the amounts you could have deducted for depreciation of the car for the income years for which you chose the “cents per kilometre” method or the “12% of original value” method for the car assuming that:

                     (a)  you had not chosen either of those methods for the car; and 

                     (b)  Division 28 (car expenses) had not applied to the car; and

                     (c)  you used the car for the * purpose of producing assessable income:

                              (i)  to the extent of 20% if you used the “cents per kilometre” method; or

                             (ii)  to the extent of one-third if you used the “12% of original value” method.

##### <a id="42-260"></a>42-260  Meaning of _notional written down value_

                   The **_notional written down value_** of a * car is its * written down value less its * notional depreciation amount.

42-300      Working out **_notional income_** and **_abnormal income_** for the concessional rate

##### <a id="42-270"></a>42-270  Explanatory material

             (1)  There are 3 forms of balancing adjustment relief.

             (2)  The first is in Common rule 1\. If it applies, you do not have to make a balancing adjustment calculation.

             (3)  The second is an alternative, or partial alternative, to including an amount in your assessable income.

             (4)  The third may reduce your income tax payable in certain circumstances where a balancing adjustment amount is included in your assessable income.

#### Roll-over relief

##### <a id="42-275"></a>42-275  Modifications of Common rule 1

             (1)  The following provisions of Common rule 1 do not apply for the purposes of this Division:

                     (a)  section 41-40;

                     (b)  section 41-45.

             (2)  Despite section 41-30, the transferor and the transferee must 
 pro-rate their depreciation deductions for the income year in which the * roll-over event occurred on the basis of the number of days in the income year each of them was its owner or * quasi-owner.

             (3)  The obligation in subsection 41-50(4) applies to the transferee as if the period for keeping the notice referred to in subsection 41-50(2) were until the end of 5 years after the next * balancing adjustment event occurs for the * plant.

             (4)  The obligation in subsection 41-55(5) applies to the transferee as if the period for keeping the election referred to in subsection 41-55(2) or a copy of it were until the end of 5 years after the next * balancing adjustment event occurs for the * plant.

##### <a id="42-280"></a>42-280  Additional consequences

             (1)  In addition to the consequences of the roll-over set out in 
 section 41-30 (about the transferor’s and transferee’s right to a deduction), the roll-over has the consequences set out in this section for the purposes of this Division.

Note:          For other consequences of the roll-over, see the definitions of **_written down value_** in section 42-200 and **_undeducted cost_** in section 42-175 and the provisions dealing with balancing adjustments.

Cost

             (2)  The * cost of the * plant is the same for the transferee as it is for the transferor.

Method

             (3)  The transferee must use the same method for calculating depreciation deductions for the * plant as the transferor was using for the income year in which the * roll-over event occurred.

Effective life

             (4)  The * effective life of the * plant in the hands of the transferee is the same as that worked out by the transferor, or the earliest successive transferor, under Subdivision 42-C.

Scientific research

             (5)  If the transferor was deducting amounts for depreciation of the * plant using the special rate for plant used for scientific research in the fields of natural or applied science—the transferee is taken to have acquired the plant before 1 July 1995.

Note:          This subsection allows the transferee to satisfy the condition of the special rate about date of acquisition, but the transferee will still have to satisfy the other conditions of the special rate in order to use it.

#### Offsetting

##### <a id="42-285"></a>42-285  Same year relief

             (1)  You do not have to include an amount in your assessable income for * plant as a result of a balancing adjustment calculation to the extent that you choose to treat that amount as an amount you have deducted for depreciation of other * plant.

             (2)  You make the choice, for the same income year in which the * balancing adjustment event occurred, successively for:

                     (a)  any replacement * plant you acquire in that year; and

                     (b)  other * plant you acquire in that year; and

                     (c)  any other * plant.

             (3)  You can only make this choice if:

                     (a)  at the end of the income year in which the * balancing adjustment event occurred, you used the replacement or other * plant, or had it * installed ready for use, wholly for the * purpose of producing assessable income; and

                     (b)  you can deduct an amount for depreciation of that plant.

             (4)  The amount covered by the choice is taken to be an amount you have deducted for depreciation of the replacement or other * plant as at the first day of the income year in which the * balancing adjustment event occurred.

Note:          Therefore, the amount must be taken into account for the plant under paragraph (a) of the definition of **_undeducted cost_** in section 42-175\. Also, because the amount is taken to have been deducted as at the first day of the income year, it will reduce the opening undeducted cost of the plant if you are using the diminishing value method.

##### <a id="42-290"></a>42-290  Later year relief

             (1)  You may exclude an amount that has been included in your assessable income for * plant as a result of a balancing adjustment calculation to the extent that you choose to treat that amount as an amount you have deducted for depreciation of replacement * plant.

             (2)  You can only make this choice for the replacement * plant if:

                     (a)  you acquire it within 2 income years after the end of the income year in which the * balancing adjustment event occurred; and

                     (b)  at the end of the income year in which you acquired it, you used it, or had it * installed ready for use, wholly for the * purpose of producing assessable income; and

                     (c)  you can deduct an amount for depreciation of it; and

                     (d)  you have not made a choice under section 42-285 for the balancing adjustment event.

             (3)  The amount covered by the choice is taken to be an amount you have deducted for depreciation of the replacement * plant as at the first day of the income year in which you acquired it.

Note:          Therefore, the amount must be taken into account for the plant under paragraph (a) of the definition of **_undeducted cost_** in section 42-175\. Also, because the amount is taken to have been deducted as at the first day of the income year, it will reduce the opening undeducted cost of the plant if you are using the diminishing value method.

#### Concessional rate

##### <a id="42-295"></a>42-295  Concessional rate

             (1)  If this section applies, you may choose to request, in writing, the Commissioner to determine a * notional income under section 42-300 that is less than your taxable income. That notional income must be used for the purposes of any Act that fixes an income tax rate by reference to a notional income.

             (2)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a * balancing adjustment event causes the cessation of a * business carried on by:

                              (i)  you; or

                             (ii)  a partnership of which you are a partner; or

                            (iii)  the trustee of a trust in which you have a present entitlement to a share of the net income and are not under a legal disability; and

                     (b)  as a result of the following balancing adjustment calculation, an amount is included in your assessable income or the assessable income of the partnership or trust.

             (3)  This section does not apply if, for the income year in which the * balancing adjustment event occurred:

                     (a)  you are a company, other than a corporate trustee; or

                     (b)  you are the trustee of a trust and are liable to be assessed under section 99A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (Certain trust income to be taxed at special rate); or

                     (c)  the * plant was in a * pool; or

                     (d)  Division 16 of Part III of that Act (averaging of income) applies to your assessment; or

                     (e)  you chose balancing adjustment relief under section 42-285 (same year relief) or 42-290 (later year relief) for the balancing adjustment event.

##### <a id="42-300"></a>42-300  Working out _notional income_ and _abnormal income_ for the concessional rate

             (1)  Your **_notional income_** for the income year in which the * balancing adjustment event occurred is:

                     (a)  if your taxable income is greater than your * abnormal income—your taxable income less 2/3 of your abnormal income;

                     (b)  if your taxable income is equal to or less than your abnormal income—1/3 of your taxable income;

                     (c)  if section 86 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (Notional income of a taxpayer deriving a premium) applies to you and your notional income under that section is:

                              (i)  greater than your abnormal income—your notional income under that section less 2/3 of your abnormal income;

                             (ii)  equal to or less than your abnormal income—1/3 of your notional income under that section.

             (2)  Your **_abnormal income_** is worked out using the following table.

#### Operative provisions

##### <a id="42-310"></a>42-310  Meaning of _quasi-owner_

             (1)  You are a **_quasi-owner_** of * plant if:

                     (a)  it is attached to land you hold under a * quasi-ownership right granted by an * exempt Australian government agency or an * exempt foreign government agency; and

                     (b)  you either:

                              (i)  attached the plant to the land after you acquired the right; or

                             (ii)  acquired the right from the entity that attached the plant or from a later successive holder of the right; and

                     (c)  you are not its owner.

             (2)  You are not a * quasi-owner under subsection (1) if, when you would otherwise have become a quasi-owner, you had entered into a * scheme:

                     (a)  under which an entity, other than the grantor of the right or that person’s successor, would become the owner of the * plant at a later time; or

                     (b)  that has a purpose of providing finance to enable an entity, other than you, the grantor of the right or that person’s successor, to become the end-user of the plant:

                              (i)  if you attached the plant to the land—for the whole, or a substantial part, of the * effective life of the plant as worked out or adopted by you; or

                             (ii)  if the plant was already attached to the land when you acquired the * quasi-ownership right—for the whole, or a substantial part, of the remainder of the * effective life of the plant as worked out or adopted by the person who first attached the plant to the land.

##### <a id="42-315"></a>42-315  Grant of new quasi-ownership right

                   If your * quasi-ownership right over land expires, is surrendered or is terminated and that event is followed by a grant of a new * quasi-ownership right over the land to you:

                     (a)  the new right is taken to be a continuation of the original right; and

                     (b)  you are taken not to have ceased to be the * quasi-owner of * plant attached to the land.

##### <a id="42-320"></a>42-320  Only one entity can deduct

                   If there is both an owner and a * quasi-owner of * plant, only the quasi-owner can deduct an amount for depreciation.

Note:          If subsection (1) or (2) applies, a balancing adjustment event occurs for the plant, see subsection 42-30(3).

             (3)  However, subsection (1) or (2) applies only if a * balancing adjustment event does not otherwise occur for the * plant.

             (4)  The reasons for the change occurring include:

                     (a)  the formation or dissolution of a partnership; and

                     (b)  a variation in the constitution of a partnership, or in the interests of the partners.

##### <a id="42-335"></a>42-335  Acquisition and roll-over relief

             (1)  If subsection 42-330(1) applies, the owners of the * plant after the change (the **_transferee_**) are taken to have acquired it from its owners before the change (the **_transferor_**).

##### <a id="42-365"></a>42-365  What plant is eligible for allocation to a pool?

                   You can only allocate * plant to a * pool for an income year if:

                     (a)  you can deduct an amount for depreciation of it for that year; and

                     (b)  the * diminishing value rate for the plant matches the pool percentage; and

                     (c)  during the period you were its owner or * quasi-owner before that year, you used it, or had it * installed ready for use, wholly for the * purpose of producing assessable income; and

                     (d)  you were its owner or * quasi-owner immediately after the beginning of that year; and

                     (e)  it has not been allocated to another * pool for that year.

##### <a id="42-370"></a>42-370  Removal of plant from a pool

             (1)  * Plant is removed from a * pool if you choose to remove it and you record the removal and the date of removal in writing.

Note:          You may re-allocate the plant to a pool under section 42-360.

                     (a)  you cease to use it, or to have it * installed ready for use, wholly for the * purpose of producing assessable income and the cessation was not caused by a * balancing adjustment event; or

                     (b)  the * diminishing value rate for the plant no longer matches the pool percentage; or

                     (c)  a balancing adjustment event occurs for the plant and Common rule 1 applies to that event.

Note:          Property removed from a pool because of paragraph (b) can be allocated to another pool under section 42-360.

             (3)  If * plant is removed from a * pool:

                     (a)  it is taken not to have been in the pool for the income year in which it is removed; and

                     (b)  you are taken to have deducted amounts for depreciation of it for the period it was in the pool as if you had used the pool percentage as your rate and the * diminishing value method; and

                     (c)  you must use the diminishing value method in calculating future depreciation deductions for it.

             (2)  The total of the following are exempt up to the * tax-free amount:

                     (a)  the lump sum payment;

                     (b)  all other payments that become due to you under the _Social Security Act 1991_ on pension paydays that occur during the bereavement lump sum period.

             (3)  This is how to work out the **_tax-free amount_**:

* * *

_Method statement_

_Step 1._   Work out the payments under the _Social Security Act 1991_ that would have become due to you on each of the pension paydays during the bereavement lump sum period if: 

               (a)     your partner had not died; and

               (b)     your partner had been under pension age; and

               (c)     immediately before your partner died, you and your partner had been neither an illness separated couple nor a respite care couple.

_Step 2._   Work out how much of those payments would have been exempt in those circumstances.

_Step 3._   Work out the payments under the _Social Security Act 1991_ or Part III of the _Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986_ that would have become due to your partner on each of the pension paydays during the bereavement lump sum period if:

               (a)     your partner had not died; and 

               (b)     immediately before your partner died, you and your partner were neither an illness separated couple nor a respite care couple;

              even if the payments would not have been exempt.

_Step 4._   Total the payments worked out at Steps 2 and 3: the result is the _tax-free amount_.

* * *

Example:    You are receiving a disability support pension of $300 a fortnight and a pharmaceutical allowance of $5 a fortnight. You are over pension age. Your partner is receiving a partner allowance of $250 a fortnight and rental assistance of $75 a fortnight.

                   Your partner dies. There are 7 pension paydays during the bereavement lump sum period. You work out the tax-free amount as follows:

                   Step 1: The payments that would have become due to you on each of those 7 paydays are $300 + $5 = $305\. The total for the 7 paydays is  $2,135\. 

                   Step 2: The exempt component of the $305 you receive on each of the 7 paydays is $5\. The total for the 7 paydays is $35.

                   Step 3: The payments that would have become due to your partner on each of those 7 paydays are $250 + $75 = $325\. The total for the 7 paydays is $2,275\. 

                   Step 4: The tax-free amount is $35 + $2,275 = $2,310.

             (2)  The total of the following are exempt up to the * tax-free amount:

                     (a)  the lump sum payment;

                     (b)  all other payments that become due to you under the _Social Security Act 1991_ on pension paydays that occur during the bereavement lump sum period.

_Method statement_

_Step 1._   Work out the payments under the _Social Security Act 1991_ that would have become due to you on each of the pension paydays during the bereavement lump sum period if:

               (a)     your partner had not died; and

               (b)     your partner had been under pension age; and

               (c)     immediately before your partner died, you and your partner had been neither an illness separated couple nor a respite care couple.

_Step 2._   Work out how much of those payments would have been exempt in those circumstances.

_Step 3._   Work out the payments under the _Social Security Act 1991_ that would have become due to your partner on each of the pension paydays during the bereavement lump sum period if your partner had not died, even if the payments would not have been exempt.

_Step 4._   Total the payments worked out at Steps 2 and 3: the result is the **_tax-free amount_**.

70-5          The 3 key features of tax accounting for trading stock

##### <a id="70-5"></a>70-5  The 3 key features of tax accounting for trading stock

                   The purpose of income tax accounting for trading stock is to produce an overall result that (apart from concessions) properly reflects your activities with your trading stock during the income year.

                   There are 3 key features:

                     (1)  You bring your gross outgoings and earnings to account, not your net profits and losses on disposal of trading stock.

                     (2)  Those outgoings and earnings are on revenue account, not capital account. As a result:

                             (a)  the gross outgoings are usually deductible as general deductions under section 8-1 (when the trading stock becomes trading stock on hand); and

                             (b)  the gross earnings are usually assessable as ordinary income under section 6-5 (when the trading stock stops being trading stock on hand).

                      (3)  You must bring to account any difference between the value of your trading stock on hand at the start and at the end of the income year. This is done in such a way that, in effect:

                             (a)  you account for the value of your trading stock as assessable income; and

                             (b)  you carry that value over as a corresponding deduction for the next income year.

#### Subdivision 70-A—What is trading stock

**Table of sections**

70-10        Meaning of **_trading stock_**

##### <a id="70-10"></a>70-10  Meaning of _trading stock_

                   **_Trading stock_** includes:

                     (a)  anything produced, manufactured or acquired that is held for purposes of manufacture, sale or exchange in the ordinary course of a * business; and 

                     (b)  * live stock.

Note 1:       Shares in a PDF are _not_ trading stock. See section 124ZO of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

Note 2:       If a company becomes a PDF, its shares are taken not to have been trading  stock before it became a PDF. See section 124ZQ of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

#### Subdivision 70-B—Acquiring trading stock

**Table of sections**

70-15        In which income year do you deduct an outgoing for trading stock?

70-20        Non-arm’s length transactions

70-25        Cost of trading stock is not a capital outgoing

70-30        Starting to hold as trading stock an item you already own

##### <a id="70-15"></a>70-15  In which income year do you deduct an outgoing for trading stock?

             (1)  This section tells you in which income year to deduct under section 8-1 (about general deductions) an outgoing incurred in connection with acquiring an item of * trading stock. (The outgoing must be deductible under that section.)

             (2)  If the item becomes part of your * trading stock on hand before or during the income year in which you incur the outgoing, deduct it in that income year.

             (3)  Otherwise, deduct the outgoing in the first income year:

                     (a)  during which the item becomes part of your * trading stock on hand; or

                     (b)  for which an amount is included in your assessable income in connection with the disposal of that item.

Note:          You can deduct your capital costs of acquiring land carrying trees or of acquiring a right to fell trees, to the extent that the trees are felled for sale, or for use in manufacture, by you. (This is because the trees will then usually become your trading stock.) See section 70-120.

##### <a id="70-20"></a>70-20  Non-arm’s length transactions

                   If:

                     (a)  you incur an outgoing that is directly attributable to your buying or obtaining delivery of an item of your * trading stock; and

                     (b)  you and the seller of the item did not deal with each other at arm’s length; and

                     (c)  the amount of the outgoing is greater than the market value of what the outgoing is for;

the amount of the outgoing is instead taken to be that market value. This has effect for the purposes of applying this Act to you and also to the seller.

Note 1:       This section also affects the value of the item of trading stock at the end of an income year if you value it at its cost under section 70-45 (Value of trading stock at end of income year).

Note 2:       This section is disregarded in applying Division 13 (about transfer-pricing arrangements) of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

##### <a id="70-25"></a>70-25  Cost of trading stock is not a capital outgoing

                   An outgoing you incur in connection with acquiring an item of * trading stock is not an outgoing of capital or of a capital nature.

Note:          This means that paragraph 8-1(2)(a) does not prevent the outgoing from being a general deduction under section 8-1.

##### <a id="70-30"></a>70-30  Starting to hold as trading stock an item you already own

             (1)  If you start holding as * trading stock an item you already own, but do not hold as trading stock, you are treated as if:

                     (a)  just before it became trading stock, you had sold the item to someone else (at arm’s length) for whichever of these amounts you elect:

                               •  its cost (as worked out under subsection (3) or (4));

                               •  its market value just before it became trading stock; and

                     (b)  you had immediately bought it back for the same amount.

Example:    You start holding a unit of depreciable plant as part of your trading stock. You are treated as having sold it just before that time, and immediately bought it back, for its cost or market value, whichever you elect. (Subdivision 42-F provides for the consequences of selling depreciated property.)

                   The same amount is normally a general deduction under section 8-1 as an outgoing in connection with acquiring trading stock. The amount is also taken into account in working out the item’s cost for the purposes of section 70-45 (about valuing trading stock at the end of the income year).

Note:          Depending on how you elect under paragraph (1)(a), the sale may or may not give rise to a capital gain or a capital loss for the purposes of Part IIIA (Capital gains and capital losses) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. It does not if you elect to be treated as having sold the item for what would have been its cost: see subsection 160ZB(7) of that Act. However, it can if you elect market value.

When you must make the election

             (2)  You must make the election by the time you lodge your * income tax return for the income year in which you start holding the item as * trading stock. (If you do not make the election by then because you do not realise until later that you started to hold the item as trading stock, you must make the election as soon as is reasonable after realising that.) 

                   However, the Commissioner can allow you to make it later (in either case).

How to work out the item’s cost

             (3)  The item’s cost is what would have been its cost for the purposes of section 70-45 (about valuing trading stock at the end of the income year) if it had been your trading stock ever since you last acquired it. In working that out, disregard section 70-55 (about acquiring live stock by natural increase).

             (4)  However, if you last acquired the item for no consideration and the acquisition involved:

                     (a)  a disposal of the item to you for the purposes of Part IIIA (Capital gains and capital losses) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; or

                     (b)  the item passing to you as someone’s * legal personal representative, or as a beneficiary in a dead person’s estate;

its cost is taken to be its market value when you last acquired it.

Exceptions

             (5)  Subsection (1) does not apply if you start holding any of the following as * trading stock because they are severed from land: 

                     (a)  standing or growing crops; 

                     (b)  crop-stools; 

                     (c)  trees planted and tended for sale.

(This does not prevent subsection (1) from applying to a severed item that you later start holding as * trading stock.)

Note:          A transaction that this section treats as having occurred is disregarded for the purposes of these provisions of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_:

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>· subsection 47A(10) (which treats certain benefits as dividends paid by a CFC)

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>· paragraph 103A(3A)(c) (which affects whether a company is a public company for an income year).

#### General rules

##### <a id="70-35"></a>70-35  You include the value of your trading stock in working out your assessable income and deductions

             (1)  If you carry on a * business, you compare:

                     (a)  the * value of all your * trading stock on hand at the start of the income year; and

                     (b)  the * value of all your * trading stock on hand at the end of the income year.

             (2)  Your assessable income includes any excess of the * value at the _end_ of the income year over the value at the _start_ of the income year.

             (3)  On the other hand, you can deduct any excess of the * value at the _start_ of the income year over the value at the _end_ of the income year.

##### <a id="70-40"></a>70-40  Value of trading stock at start of income year

             (1)  The **_value_** of an item of * trading stock on hand at the start of an income year is the same amount at which it was taken into account under this Division at the end of the last income year.

             (2)  The **_value_** of the item is a nil amount if the item was not taken into account under this Division at the end of the last income year.

Note:          For the value of trading stock at the start of the 1997-98 income year, see section 70-40 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

##### <a id="70-45"></a>70-45  Value of trading stock at end of income year

             (1)  You must elect to **_value_** each item of * trading stock on hand at the end of an income year at:

                     (a)  its * cost; or

                     (b)  its market selling value; or

                     (c)  its replacement price.

Note:          An item’s market selling value at a particular time may not be the same as its market value.

             (2)  The rest of this Subdivision deals with cases where the normal operation of this section is modified, or where a different valuation method may or must be used. The table sets out other cases where that happens because of provisions outside this Subdivision.

#### Special valuation rules

##### <a id="70-50"></a>70-50  Valuation if trading stock obsolete etc.

                   You may elect to **_value_** an item of your * trading stock below all the values in section 70-45 if:

                     (a)  that is warranted because of obsolescence or any other special circumstances relating to that item; and

                     (b)  the value you elect is reasonable.

##### <a id="70-55"></a>70-55  Working out the cost of natural increase of live stock

             (1)  The **_cost_** of an animal you hold as * live stock that you acquired by natural increase is whichever of these you elect:

                     (a)  the actual cost of the animal;

                     (b)  the cost prescribed by the regulations for each animal in the applicable class of live stock.

             (2)  However, if you incur a service fee for insemination and, as a result, acquire a horse by natural increase, its **_cost_** is the greater of:

                     (a)  the amount worked out under subsection (1); and

                     (b)  the part of the service fee that is attributable to your acquiring the horse.

             (3)  An election under this section must be made by the time you lodge your * income tax return for the income year in which you acquired the animal. However, the Commissioner can allow you to make it later.

##### <a id="70-60"></a>70-60  Valuation of horse breeding stock

             (1)  For a horse at least 3 years old that you acquired under a contract and hold for breeding, you can elect a **_value_** other than the values in section 70-45.

(2)The **_value_** you can elect for the horse at the end of the income year is worked out using the table:

<table>
<colgroup>

</tr></table>

             (3)  However, if the value worked out under subsection (2) would be less than $1, you must elect the **_value_** of $1.

             (4)  A horse’s age is to be measured in whole years as at the end of the relevant income year. The age of a horse not born on 1 August is determined as if the horse had been born on the last 1 August before it was actually born.

##### <a id="70-65"></a>70-65  Working out the _horse opening value_ and the _horse reduction amount_

             (1)  The **_horse opening value_** is:

                     (a)  if the horse has been your * live stock ever since the start of the income year—its * value as * trading stock at the start of the income year; or

                     (b)  otherwise—the horse’s base amount (see subsection (3)).

             (2)  The **_horse reduction amount_** is worked out as follows:

                     (a)  for female horses under 12 years of age:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004C00927/Html/TaxLawImprovement1997_image019.gif)

                     (b)  for any male horse:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004C00927/Html/TaxLawImprovement1997_image020.gif)

             (3)  In this section:

                    <a name="base-amount"></a>**_base amount_** is the lesser of:

                     (a)  the horse’s * cost; and 

                     (b)  the horse’s * undeducted cost when it most recently became your * live stock. 

                    <a name="breing-dai"></a>**_breeding days_** is the number of whole days in the income year since you most recently began to hold the horse for breeding.

                    <a name="nomin-percentag"></a>**_nominated percentage_** is any percentage, up to 25%, you nominate when you make the election in section 70-60.

                    <a name="ruction-factor"></a>**_reduction factor_** is the greater of:

                     (a)  3; and

                     (b)  the difference between 12 and the horse’s age when you most recently began to hold it for breeding.

##### <a id="70-70"></a>70-70  Valuing interests in FIFs

             (1)  You must **_value_** at its cost an item of your * trading stock that is an interest in a * foreign investment fund (a * FIF). 

Note:          For special rules about valuing an interest in a FIF that was an item of your trading stock on hand at the  start  of the 1991-92 income year, see section 70-70 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

             (2)  However, you may elect to value all your interests in * FIFs at their market value instead. If you make this election, then for the income year of the election, and for all later income years, you must **_value_** at their market value all your interests in FIFs.

             (3)  You can only make this election _before_ you lodge your * income tax return for the _first_ income year in which a * notional accounting period of any * FIF you have an interest in ends. 

#### Subdivision 70-D—Assessable income arising from disposals of trading stock and certain other assets

#### Guide to Subdivision 70-D

##### <a id="70-75"></a>70-75  What this Subdivision is about

* * *

Your assessable income includes the market value of an item of trading stock if you dispose of it outside the ordinary course of business or it ceases to be trading stock in certain other circumstances.

This Subdivision treats certain other assets in the same way as trading stock.

* * *

70-80        Why the rules in this Subdivision are necessary

Operative provisions

70-85        Application of this Subdivision to certain other assets

70-90        Assessable income on disposal of trading stock outside the ordinary course of business

70-95        Purchase price is taken to be market value

70-115      Compensation for lost trading stock

##### <a id="70-80"></a>70-80  Why the rules in this Subdivision are necessary

             (1)  When you dispose of an item of your trading stock in the ordinary course of business, what you get for it is included in your assessable income (under section 6-5) as ordinary income.

             (2)  If an item stops being your trading stock for certain other reasons, an amount is generally included in your assessable income to balance the reduction in trading stock on hand, which is a transaction on revenue account.

             (3)  The other reasons for an item to stop being your trading stock are:

                     (a)  you dispose of it outside the ordinary course of * business; or

                     (b)  interests in it change; or

                     (c)  you die; or

                     (d)  you stop holding it as trading stock.

#### Operative provisions

##### <a id="70-85"></a>70-85  Application of this Subdivision to certain other assets

                   This Subdivision (except section 70-115) applies to certain assets of a * business as if they were * trading stock on hand of the entity that carries on that business.  The assets are:

                     (a)  standing or growing crops; and

                     (b)  crop-stools; and

                     (c)  trees planted and tended for sale.

Note:          Section 70-115 assesses insurance or indemnity amounts for lost trading stock.

##### <a id="70-90"></a>70-90  Assessable income on disposal of trading stock outside the ordinary course of business

             (1)  If you dispose of an item of your * trading stock outside the ordinary course of a * business:

                     (a)  that you are carrying on; and

                     (b)  of which the item is an asset;

your assessable income includes the market value of the item on the day of the disposal.

             (2)  Any amount that you actually receive for the disposal is not included in your assessable income (nor is it * exempt income).

Note 1:       In the case of an asset covered by section 70-85 (which applies this Subdivision to certain other assets), the disposal will usually involve disposing of the land of which the asset forms part.

Note 2:       For certain disposals of live stock by primary producers, special rules apply: see Subdivision 385-E.

Note 3:       If the disposal is by way of gift, you may be able to deduct the gift: see Division 30 (Gifts).

Note 4:       If the disposal is of trees, you can deduct the relevant portion of your capital costs of acquiring the land carrying the trees or of acquiring a right to fell the trees: see section 70-120.

##### <a id="70-95"></a>70-95  Purchase price is taken to be market value

                   If an entity disposes of an item of the entity’s * trading stock outside the ordinary course of * business, the entity acquiring the item is treated as having bought it for the market value included in the disposing entity’s assessable income under section 70-90.

##### <a id="70-100"></a>70-100  Notional disposal when you stop holding an item as trading stock

             (1)  An item of * trading stock is treated as having been disposed of outside the ordinary course of * business if it stops being trading stock on hand of an entity (the **_transferor_**) and, immediately afterwards:

                     (a)  the transferor is not the item’s sole owner; but

                     (b)  an entity that owned the item (alone or with others) immediately beforehand still has an interest in the item.

Example:    A grocer decides to take her daughters into partnership with her. Her trading stock becomes part of the partnership assets, owned by the partners equally. As a result, it becomes trading stock on hand of the partnership instead of the grocer. This section treats the grocer as having disposed of the trading stock to the partnership outside the ordinary course of her business.

Note:          If the transferor _is_ the item’s sole owner after it stops being trading stock on hand of the transferor, section 70-110 applies instead of this section.

             (2)  As a result, the transferor’s assessable income includes the market value of the item on the day it stops being * trading stock on hand of the transferor.

             (3)  The entity or entities (the **_transferee_**) that own the item immediately _after_ it stops being * trading stock on hand of the transferor are  treated as having bought the item for the same value on that day.

Election to treat item as disposed of at closing value

             (4)  However, an election can be made to treat the item as having been disposed of for what would have been its * value as * trading stock of the _transferor_ on hand at the end of an income year ending on that day.

             (5)  If this election is made, this * value is included in the transferor’s assessable income for the income year that includes that day. The transferee is treated as having bought the item for the same value on that day.

             (6)  This election can only be made if:

                     (a)  immediately _after_ the item stops being * trading stock on hand of the transferor, it is an asset of a * business carried on by the transferee; and

                     (b)  immediately _after_ the item stops being * trading stock on hand of the transferor, the entities that owned it immediately beforehand have (between them) interests in the item whose total value is at least 25% of the item’s market value on that day; and

                     (c)  the * value elected is _less than_ that market value; and

                     (d)  the item is not a thing in action.

             (7)  Also, the election can only be made before 1 September following the end of the * financial year in which the item stops being * trading stock on hand of the transferor. However, the Commissioner can allow the election to be made later.

             (8)  An election must be in writing and signed by or on behalf of each of:

                     (a)  the entities that own the item immediately before it stops being * trading stock on hand of the transferor; and

                     (b)  the entities that own it immediately afterwards.

             (9)  If a person whose signature is required for the election has died, the * legal personal representative of that person’s estate may sign instead.

When election has no effect

           (10)  An election has no effect if:

                     (a)  the item stops being * trading stock on hand of the transferee outside the course of ordinary family or commercial dealing; and

                     (b)  the * consideration receivable by the transferor (or by any of the entities constituting the transferor) substantially exceeds what would reasonably be expected to be the consideration receivable by the entity concerned if the market value of the item immediately before it stops being * trading stock on hand of the transferor were the * value elected under subsection (4).

           (11)  **_Consideration receivable_** by an entity means so much of the value of any benefit as it is reasonable to expect that the entity will obtain in connection with the item ceasing to be * trading stock on hand of the transferor.

##### <a id="70-105"></a>70-105  Death of owner 

             (1)  When you die, your assessable income up to the time of your death includes the market value at that time of the * trading stock of your * business (if any).

Note:          In the case of trees, you can deduct the relevant portion of your capital costs of acquiring the land carrying the trees or of acquiring a right to fell the trees: see section 70-120.

             (2)  The person on whom the * trading stock devolves is treated as having bought it for its market value at that time.

             (3)  However, your * legal personal representative can elect to have included in your assessable income (instead of the market value) the amount that would have been the * value of the * trading stock at the end of an income year ending on the day of your death.

             (4)  In the case of an asset covered by section 70-85 (which applies this Subdivision to certain other assets), your * legal personal representative can elect to have a nil amount included in your assessable income (instead of the market value).

             (5)  Your * legal personal representative can make an election only if:

                     (a)  the * business is carried on after your death; and

                     (b)  the * trading stock continues to be held as trading stock of that business, or the asset continues to be held as an asset of that business, as appropriate.

             (6)  If an election is made, the person on whom the * trading stock devolves is treated as having bought it for the amount referred to in subsection (3) or (4).

             (7)  An election can only be made on or before the day when your * legal personal representative lodges your * income tax return for the period up to your death. However, the Commissioner can allow it to be made later.

##### <a id="70-110"></a>70-110  You stop holding an item as trading stock but still own it

                   If you stop holding an item as * trading stock, but still own it, you are treated as if:

                     (a)  just before it stopped being trading stock, you had sold it to someone else (at arm’s length and in the ordinary course of business) for its * cost; and

                     (b)  you had immediately bought it back for the same amount.

Example 1: You are a sheep grazier and take a sheep from your stock to slaughter for personal consumption. You are treated as having sold it for its cost. This amount is assessable income, just like the proceeds of sale of any of your trading stock.

                   Although you are also treated as having bought the sheep for the same amount, it would not be deductible because the sheep is for personal consumption.

Example 2: You stop holding an item as trading stock and begin to use it as plant for the purpose of producing your assessable income. You are treated as having sold it for its cost. This amount is assessable income, just like the proceeds of sale of any of your trading stock.

                   You are also treated as having bought the item for the same amount, which is relevant to working out the item’s cost for depreciation purposes: see Subdivision 42-B.

Note:          A transaction that this section treats as having occurred is disregarded for the purposes of these provisions of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_:

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>· subsection 47A(10) (which treats certain benefits as dividends paid by a CFC)

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>· paragraph 103A(3A)(c) (which affects whether a company is a public company for an income year).

##### <a id="70-115"></a>70-115  Compensation for lost trading stock

                   Your assessable income includes an amount that:

                     (a)  you receive by way of insurance or indemnity for a loss of * trading stock; and

                     (b)  is not assessable as * ordinary income under section 6-5.

#### Subdivision 70-E—Miscellaneous

**Table of sections**

70-120      Deducting capital costs of acquiring trees

##### <a id="70-120"></a>70-120  Deducting capital costs of acquiring trees

             (1)  This section gives you deductions for your capital costs of acquiring land carrying trees or of acquiring a right to fell trees.

Note:          This section is included in this Division because:

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>· trees felled for sale, or for use in manufacture, by you will usually become your trading stock; and

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>· before they are felled, the trees are covered by sections 70-90 and 70-105 because of section 70-85\. 

Land carrying trees

             (2)  You can deduct an amount for the price you paid to acquire land carrying trees if:

                     (a)  some or all of the trees are felled during the income year for sale, or for use in manufacture, by you for the * purpose of producing assessable income; or

                     (b)  some or all of the trees are felled during the income year under a right you granted to another entity in consideration of payments as or by way of  * royalty; or

                     (c)  the market value of some or all of the trees is included in your assessable income for the income year by section 70-90 (because you disposed of the trees outside the ordinary course of * business) or section 70-105 (because of your death).

(It does not matter when you acquired the land.)

Note:          The market value of trees is _not_ included in your assessable income for the income year by section 70-105 (because of your death) if your legal personal representative elects under subsection 70-105(4) to have a nil amount included instead.

Right to fell trees

             (3)  You can deduct an amount for the price you paid to acquire a right to fell trees if:

                     (a)  some or all of the trees are felled during the income year for sale, or for use in manufacture, by you for the * purpose of producing assessable income; or

                     (b)  some or all of the trees are felled during the income year under a right you granted to another entity in consideration of payments as or by way of  * royalty.

(It does not matter when you acquired the right.)

How much you can deduct for costs of acquiring land or right

             (4)  You can deduct for the income year so much of the price you paid as is attributable to the trees covered by a paragraph of subsection (2) or (3).

             (5)  If you can deduct an amount because of paragraph (2)(c), you can also deduct for the income year so much of any other capital expenditure you incurred as is attributable to acquiring the trees covered by that paragraph (except so far as you have deducted it, or can deduct it, for any income year under a provision of this Act outside this section).

Non-arm’s length transactions

             (6)  If:

                     (a)  you can deduct an amount under this section for expenditure incurred in connection with a transaction; and

                     (b)  the parties to the transaction did not deal with each other at arm’s length; and

                     (c)  the amount of the expenditure is greater than the market value of what the expenditure is for;

the amount of the expenditure is instead taken to be that market value. This has effect for the purposes of working out what you can deduct under this section.

#### Guide to Subdivision 385-E

##### <a id="385-90"></a>385-90  What this Subdivision is about

* * *

You can elect to exclude from your assessable income the profit on a forced disposal or death of live stock that you held as assets of a primary production business you carry on in Australia.

The excluded profit is then brought into your assessable income over a 5 year period in one of 2 ways.

385-95      Basic principles for elections under this Subdivision

Operative provisions

385-100    Cases where you can make an election

385-105    Election to spread tax profit over 5 years

385-110    Alternative election to defer tax profit and reduce cost of replacement live stock

385-115    Your assessable income includes an amount for replacement live stock you breed

385-120    Purchase price of replacement live stock is reduced

385-125    Alternative election because of bovine tuberculosis has effect over 10 years not 5

##### <a id="385-95"></a>385-95  Basic principles for elections under this Subdivision

             (1)  You can elect:

                          to spread the profit on the disposal or death over the income year of the disposal or death and the next 4 income years (**_election to spread_**); or

                          to defer including the profit in your assessable income, if you will use the proceeds of the disposal or death mainly to replace the live stock (**_election to defer_**).

             (2)  If you make an election to defer, the profit is “used” over the next 5 income years:

                          by reducing the price for which you are taken to have bought replacement stock (as a result, your tax profit on the disposal of the replacement stock is increased); and

                          by including in your assessable income amounts for replacement stock that you breed.

Any unused part of the profit is included in your assessable income for the fifth income year.

#### Operative provisions

##### <a id="385-100"></a>385-100  Cases where you can make an election

             (1)  You can make an election if:

                     (a)  you dispose of * live stock, or they die, because:

                              (i)  land is compulsorily acquired or resumed under an Act; or

                             (ii)  a State or Territory leases land for a cattle tick eradication campaign; or

                            (iii)  pasture or fodder is destroyed by fire, drought or flood and you will use the * proceeds of the disposal or death mainly to buy replacement stock or to maintain breeding stock for the purpose of replacing the live stock; or

                            (iv)  they are compulsorily destroyed under an * Australian law for the control of a * disease or they die of such a * disease; or

                             (v)  you receive an official notification under an * Australian law dealing with contamination of property; and

                     (b)  you held the live stock as assets of a * primary production business you carry on in Australia; and

                     (c)  apart from this Subdivision, your assessable income for any income year would include the * proceeds of the disposal or death.

             (2)  The **_proceeds of the disposal or death_** are:

                     (a)  if you dispose of the * live stock or their carcases in the ordinary course of * business—the total of:

                              (i)  any amount you receive as payment for the live stock or carcases; and

                             (ii)  any compensation you receive for the death or destruction, or a reduction in market value, of the live stock or their carcases from an * Australian government agency; or

                     (b)  if you dispose of the * live stock or their carcases outside the ordinary course of * business—the total of:

                              (i)  the market value of the live stock or their carcases, at the time of disposal; and

                             (ii)  any compensation you receive for the death or destruction, or a reduction in market value, of the live stock or their carcases from an * Australian government agency; or

                     (c)  if the * live stock die, and you do not dispose of their carcases to someone else—any compensation you receive for their death or destruction from an * Australian government agency.

##### <a id="385-105"></a>385-105  Election to spread tax profit over 5 years

             (1)  You can elect:

                     (a)  to include in your assessable income for the * disposal year the * proceeds of the disposal or death, reduced by the * tax profit on the disposal or death; and

                     (b)  to include 20% of the tax profit on the disposal or death in your assessable income for the disposal year; and

                     (c)  to include 20% of the tax profit on the disposal or death in your assessable income for each of the next 4 income years.

For rules about the making and effect of an election, see Subdivision 385-H.

             (2)  The **_disposal year_** is the income year in which you dispose of the * live stock, or they die, as mentioned in subsection 385-100(1).

             (3)  The **_tax profit on the disposal or death_** is any amount remaining after subtracting from the * proceeds of the disposal or death the sum of:

                     (a)  the purchase price of as many of the * live stock as you purchased during the income year; and

                     (b)  the * value of the rest of the live stock as * trading stock on hand at the start of the income year.

##### <a id="385-110"></a>385-110  Alternative election to defer tax profit and reduce cost of replacement live stock

             (1)  Alternatively, you can elect:

                     (a)  to include in your assessable income for the * disposal year the * proceeds of the disposal or death, reduced by the * tax profit on the disposal or death; and

                     (b)  to reduce the cost of replacement * live stock you buy in the disposal year (or any of the next 5 income years) by amounts totalling not more than the tax profit on the disposal or death; and

                     (c)  to include in your assessable income for the last of the 5 income years following the disposal year any * unused tax profit on the disposal or death on the last day of that year.

Note:          If the election is made because of bovine tuberculosis, it has effect over 10 income years instead of 5: see section 385-125.

For rules about the making and effect of an election, see Subdivision 385-H

             (2)  However, you can only make this election if you will use the * proceeds of the disposal or death mainly to buy replacement * live stock, or to maintain breeding stock for the purpose of replacing the live stock that were disposed of or died.

             (3)  The **_unused tax profit_**_on the disposal or death_is the * tax profit on the disposal or death less the total of:

                     (a)  the amounts included in your assessable income under section 385-115 for replacement animals you breed; and

                     (b)  the amounts by which the purchase price of replacement animals is reduced under section 385-120.

##### <a id="385-115"></a>385-115  Your assessable income includes an amount for replacement live stock you breed

                   If you make the election in section 385-110, then for the * disposal year and each of the next 5 income years, your assessable income includes any amount you choose for each replacement animal you breed during that income year. (However, you can choose not to include an amount.)

##### <a id="385-120"></a>385-120  Purchase price of replacement live stock is reduced

             (1)  If you make the election in section 385-110, then the purchase price of each replacement animal you buy in the * disposal year, or in the next 5 income years, is treated as if it were reduced by the * reduction amount.

Meaning of **reduction amount**

             (2)  The **_reduction amount_** is:

                          so much of the * tax profit on the disposal or death as is attributable to live stock of the species you are replacing;

divided by:

                          the number of animals of that species that you disposed of or that died.

             (3)  However, if:

                     (a)  you purchase a replacement animal of a different species from the * live stock it replaces; and 

                     (b)  you pay substantially more for it than you could have paid for a replacement animal of the same species;

the **_reduction amount_** for the animal is any reasonable amount at least equal to the amount worked out under subsection (2). 

Exception to avoid reducing unused tax profit to less than nil

             (4)  However, if applying subsection (1) to a particular purchase would reduce the * unused tax profit on the disposal or death to less than nil, instead reduce the purchase price of each replacement animal in that purchase by:

                          the * unused tax profit on the disposal or death;

divided by:

                          the number of animals in the purchase.

##### <a id="385-125"></a>385-125  Alternative election because of bovine tuberculosis has effect over 10 years not 5

                   If you can make an election under this Subdivision because:

                     (a)  * live stock are compulsorily destroyed under an * Australian law for the control of bovine tuberculosis; or

                     (b)  * live stock die of that * disease;

sections 385-110 to 385-120 apply as if they referred to 10 income years instead of 5 years.

#### Subdivision 385-F—Insurance for loss of live stock or trees

**Table of sections**

385-130    Insurance for loss of live stock or trees

##### <a id="385-130"></a>385-130  Insurance for loss of live stock or trees

                   If your assessable income for an income year would otherwise include an insurance recovery for a loss of * live stock, or for a loss by fire of trees, that you hold as assets of a * primary production business you carry on in Australia, you can elect:

                     (a)  to include only 20% of the insurance recovery in your assessable income for that income year; and

                     (b)  to include 20% of the insurance recovery in your assessable income for each of the next 4 income years.

For rules about the making and effect of an election, see Subdivision 385-H.

#### Subdivision 385-G—Double wool clips

**Table of sections**

385-135    Election to defer including profit on second wool clip

##### <a id="385-135"></a>385-135  Election to defer including profit on second wool clip

             (1)  If your assessable income for an income year would otherwise include the * proceeds of the sale of 2 wool clips because fire, drought or flood causes you to shear your sheep earlier than normal, you can elect to include in your assessable income for the _next_ income year the * profit on the sale of the earlier than normal wool clip.

For rules about the making and effect of an election, see Subdivision 385-H.

             (2)  However, at the time the wool was shorn, the sheep must have been assets of a * primary production business you carried on in Australia. Also, the fire, drought or flood must have been in an area of Australia where you carried on that business at that time.

             (3)  The **_proceeds of the sale of 2 wool clips_** are:

                     (a)  the proceeds of the sale of the earlier than normal wool clip; and

                     (b)  an amount covered by one or more of the following:

                              (i)  proceeds of the sale of another wool clip in the income year; 

                             (ii)  proceeds of the sale of wool shorn in the previous income year that you hold at the start of the income year and that you took into account at cost in working out the * value of your trading stock under Division 60 at the end of the previous income year; 

                            (iii)  an amount for wool shorn in the previous income year that is included in your assessable income of the income year because of a previous election under this section.

             (4)  The **_profit on the sale of the earlier than normal wool clip_** is the proceeds of the sale of the wool clip that would otherwise be included in your assessable income for the income year, less the expenses you incur in the income year that are directly attributable to the earlier shearing and sale.

                     (a)  the * proceeds of the disposal or death of * live stock; or

                     (b)  the insurance recovery for the loss of * live stock or trees; or

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004C00927/Html/TaxLawImprovement1997_image021.gif)

where:

                    <a name="establish-expenditur"></a>**_establishment expenditure_** is the amount of the capital expenditure that is attributable to the establishment of the grapevine.

                    <a name="write-off-dai-incom-year"></a>**_write-off days in income year_** is the number of days in the income year on which you owned the grapevine and used it in a * primary production business for the * purpose of producing assessable income.

No deduction for period more than 4 years after grapevine established

             (3)  Disregard your use of the grapevine on a day that is more than 4 years after the grapevine was established.

Note:          That 4-year period will be spread over 5 income years, unless the grapevine is established on the first day of an income year.

##### <a id="387-310"></a>387-310  Expenditure on draining swamps and clearing land not counted

                   When working out the amount of a deduction under this Subdivision, do not count expenditure incurred in draining swamp or low-lying land or in clearing land.

             (1)  If a grapevine in Australia that you own and use in a * primary production business for the * purpose of producing assessable income is destroyed at any time up to 4 years after the day it was established, you can deduct an amount for the income year during which the grapevine is destroyed.

             (2)  Work out the amount you can deduct as follows:

* * *

_Method statement_

_Step 1._   Work out the total of the amounts you could have deducted under section 387-305 for that expenditure if you had owned the grapevine and used it in a * primary production business for the * purpose of producing assessable income for the whole of the period:

               (a)     starting when the grapevine was established; and

               (b)     ending when the grapevine was destroyed.

_Step 2._   Subtract from the establishment expenditure worked out under subsection 387-305(2):

               (a)     the result from Step 1; and

               (b)     any amount you received (under an insurance policy or otherwise) for the destruction of the grapevine.

              The remaining amount (if any) is the amount you can deduct under subsection (1).

* * *

Note:          In Step 1 you must take into account any amounts you could have deducted if section 387-305 had applied to assessments for income years before the 1997-98 income year. See section 387-315 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

             (3)  This deduction is in addition to a deduction under section 387-305 for expenditure on establishing the grapevine.

##### <a id="387-320"></a>387-320  Deductions for quasi-owners of land with grapevines

             (1)  You are treated for the purposes of this Subdivision as if you own a grapevine so long as:

##### <a id="387-455"></a>387-455  How this Subdivision applies to pre-1997-98 expenditure

             (1)  This Subdivision applies to your capital expenditure on a forestry road or a timber mill building, even if you incurred it _before_ the 1997-98 income year.

Note:          Sections 387-450 to 387-507 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_ explain how this Subdivision applies if you incurred expenditure before that income year.

             (2)  In that case, you may have taken the expenditure into account in working out your deductions under Division 10A of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (which provided for deductions for expenditure on access roads and timber mill buildings for the 1996-97 income year and earlier income years).

             (3)  If so, you treat any deductions that you made, or could make, under that Division for the 1996-97 income year and earlier income years as if you had made them in those years under this Subdivision.

#### Deductions

##### <a id="387-460"></a>387-460  What expenditure you can deduct

             (1)  A **_forestry road_** is a road constructed primarily and principally for the purpose of providing access to an area to enable:

                     (a)  trees to be planted or tended in the area; or

                     (b)  timber felled in the area to be removed.

For this purpose, a road includes any bridge, culvert or similar work forming part of the road.

             (2)  A **_timber operation_** is:

                     (a)  planting or tending trees for felling; or

                     (b)  felling standing timber; or

                     (c)  removing felled timber; or

                             (ii)  as residential accommodation for your employees engaged in connection with the * business, or for their dependants; and

                     (b)  located in a forest, and in or adjacent to the area where timber milled in the business is, or is to be, felled.

##### <a id="387-470"></a>387-470  How much you can deduct for the current year

                   Work out the amount you can deduct for the * current year using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004C00927/Html/TaxLawImprovement1997_image022.gif)

where:

                    <a name="capit-expenditur"></a>**_capital expenditure_** is the amount of your capital expenditure.

                    <a name="previou-duction"></a>**_previous deductions_** is the sum of the amounts that you have deducted or can deduct for income years before the * current year under this Subdivision for your capital expenditure.

                    <a name="remain-life"></a><a name="remain-life"></a>**_remaining life_** is the number of whole years for which you estimate that the road or building will be used after the * current year for the purpose for which it was primarily and principally constructed or acquired. However, if that number is more than 25, **_remaining life_** is 25.

Note 1:       Section 387-475 may limit the amount of expenditure on acquiring a forestry road or timber building that you can count for this purpose.

Note 2:       When working out previous deductions, take account of amounts deducted or deductible under section 124F or 124JA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ for the road or building. See section 387-472 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

#### Limits on deductions

##### <a id="387-475"></a>387-475  Limits on expenditure on acquiring a road or building

             (1)  If you acquired the road or building from another entity, the Commissioner may limit your capital expenditure for the purposes of section 387-470.

             (2)  Your capital expenditure may be limited to the sum of:

                     (a)  the amount that, if the entity had not disposed of the road or building to you, would have been the difference between the entity’s capital expenditure and previous deductions (as those terms are defined in section 387-470) at the end of the income year during which the disposal took place; and

                     (b)  any amount included in the entity’s assessable income under subsection 387-485(3) as a result of a balancing adjustment required by the disposal.

             (3)  If you incurred capital expenditure acquiring a building that is * plant for which an amount has been deducted or can be deducted for depreciation by any earlier owner or * quasi-owner, your capital expenditure may be limited to the sum of:

                     (a)  the * written down value (as defined in section 42-200, which relates to deductions for depreciation) of the building immediately before it was disposed of by the last entity who had deducted or can deduct an amount for depreciation of it; and

                     (b)  any balancing adjustment included in that entity’s assessable income for the building under Subdivision 42-F (which explains how to make a balancing adjustment for depreciated * plant); and

                     (c)  any balancing adjustment that would have been included in that entity’s assessable income if balancing adjustment relief had not applied under section 42-285 or 42-290 (both of which let you exclude from your assessable income amounts that would be included in that income under the balancing adjustment).

             (4)  The matters the Commissioner must take into account in deciding whether to limit your capital expenditure include:

                     (a)  whether you acquired the road or building from an * associate; and

                     (b)  the market value of the road or building; and

                     (c)  how the purchase price of the road or building was calculated; and

                     (d)  how your acquisition of the road or building was financed.

##### <a id="387-480"></a>387-480  When you cannot deduct

When your deductions equal your whole expenditure

             (1)  You cannot deduct an amount under this Subdivision for the * current year for your expenditure on a * forestry road or a * timber mill building if the sum of the amounts that you have deducted or can deduct under this Subdivision for that expenditure for earlier income years equals that expenditure.

Note:          Take account of amounts deducted or deductible under section 124F or 124JA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ for the road or building. See section 387-472 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

When you have deducted or can deduct amounts otherwise

             (2)  You cannot deduct an amount under this Subdivision for the * current year for your expenditure on a * forestry road or a * timber mill building if:

                     (a)  you can deduct, or have deducted, an amount for the expenditure under a provision of this Act (other than this Subdivision) for the * current year or an earlier income year; or

                     (b)  the expenditure is being, or was, taken into account in calculating the amount of one of your deductions for the * current year or an earlier income year under a provision of this Act (other than this Subdivision).

Note:          Disregard amounts deducted or deductible under section 124F or 124JA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ for the road or building. See section 387-472 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

When the road or building has been disposed of or destroyed, or is no longer used

             (3)  You cannot deduct an amount under section 387-460 for the * current year for your expenditure on a * forestry road or a * timber mill building if, during the current year or an earlier income year:

                     (a)  you disposed of the road or building; or

                     (b)  the road or building was destroyed; or

                     (c)  for some other reason, you stopped using it for the purpose for which it was primarily and principally constructed or acquired.

Note:          Although you cannot deduct an amount under section 387-460 if you have stopped using, or disposed of, the road or building or it has been destroyed, you may be able to deduct an amount because of the balancing adjustment that you must make in this case. See 
 section 387-485.

#### Balancing adjustments

##### <a id="387-485"></a>387-485  Making a balancing adjustment when an event stops you deducting

             (1)  You must make a balancing adjustment for the * current year if:

                     (a)  you have deducted or can deduct an amount for an earlier income year under this Subdivision for your capital expenditure relating to constructing or acquiring a * forestry road or a * timber mill building; and

                     (b)  one or more of the following events happens during the current year:

                              (i)  you dispose of the road or building in circumstances in which Subdivision 41-A (which sets out Common 
 rule 1 dealing with roll-over relief for related entities) does not apply;

                             (ii)  the road or building is destroyed;

                            (iii)  for some other reason, you stop using it for the purpose for which it was primarily and principally constructed or acquired.

Note:          Take account of amounts deducted or deductible under section 124F or 124JA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ for the road or building. See section 387-472 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

             (2)  You make the balancing adjustment by comparing the * termination value of the road or building with its * written down value.

Note:          If there has been an earlier disposal of the road or building covered by Subdivision 41-A (which sets out Common rule 1 dealing with 
 roll-over relief for related entities), the balancing adjustment is modified as described in section 41-20.

             (3)  If the * termination value _exceeds_ the * written down value, the excess is included in your assessable income for the * current year. However, if the excess is _more than_ the total of the amounts you deducted or can deduct under this Subdivision for earlier income years for your capital expenditure relating to the road or building, that total is included in your assessable income instead.

             (4)  If the * termination value is _less than_ the * written down value, you can deduct the amount of the difference.

##### <a id="387-490"></a>387-490  Meaning of _termination value_

             (1)  The **_termination value_** of a * forestry road or * timber mill building is the value shown in the following table, depending on the circumstances that require you to make a balancing adjustment.

             (2)  However, the **_termination value_** does not include:

                     (a)  an amount that is included, or when received will be included, in your assessable income for any income year as a lease premium under Division 4 (Leases) of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; or

                     (b)  if a net capital gain is or will be included in your assessable income for any income year under Part IIIA (Capital gains and capital losses) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_—the part of the net capital gain that is attributable to a premium on the grant or assignment of a lease.

##### <a id="387-495"></a>387-495  Meaning of _written down value_

                   The **_written down value_** of a road or building is:

   your total capital expenditure of a kind that qualifies for a deduction under this Subdivision in respect of the road or building;

less:

   the total of the amounts you deducted or can deduct in relation to the road or building under this Subdivision for income years before the * current year.

Note:          Take account of amounts deducted or deductible under section 124F or 124JA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ for the road or building. See section 387-472 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

#### Resuming deductions

##### <a id="387-500"></a>387-500  Resuming deductions after you stop using a road or building

             (1)  This section explains how this Subdivision applies if:

                     (a)  you incurred capital expenditure relating to a * forestry road or * timber mill building as described in section 387-460 (which allows you to deduct for the expenditure); and

                     (b)  for a reason other than the disposal or destruction of the road or building, you stopped using it for the purpose for which it was primarily and principally constructed or acquired; and

                     (c)  you started to use the road or building again for that purpose.

             (2)  This Subdivision applies as if:

                     (a)  you had incurred a reasonable amount of capital expenditure relating to the road or building when you started to use the road or building again; and

                     (b)  you had not, and could not have, deducted amounts relating to the road or building for income years ending before you started to use it again.

Note:          This section allows you to make deductions for the income year during which you started to use the road or building again and for later income years, despite the fact that you stopped using the road or building as described in paragraph (b).

#### Application of Common rules

##### <a id="387-505"></a>387-505  Application of Common rules 1, 2 and 3

             (1)  Subdivision 41-A (which sets out Common rule 1 dealing with roll-over relief for related entities) applies to a disposal of a * forestry road or * timber mill building in the circumstances set out in section 41-20.

             (2)  Subdivision 41-B (which sets out Common rule 2 dealing with non-arm’s length transactions) applies to transactions involving expenditure on, or disposal of, a * forestry road or * timber mill building.

             (3)  Subdivision 41-C (which sets out Common rule 3 dealing with anti-avoidance provisions relating to the ownership of property) applies in relation to a * forestry road or * timber mill building in relation to which you can deduct an amount.

##### <a id="70-5"></a>70-5  Treatment of items that become trading stock because of the change of definition

                   If:

                     (a)  immediately _before_ the 1997-98 income year you owned an item that was _not_ trading stock as defined in subsection 6(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ as in force at that time; and

                     (b)  at the _start_ of that income year you hold the item as trading stock as defined in section 70-10 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (the **_1997 Act_**);

section 70-30 of the 1997 Act applies as if you had _started_ to hold the item as trading stock as defined in section 70-10 of the 1997 Act _immediately after_ the start of that income year.

##### <a id="70-10"></a>70-10  Accounting for your disposal of items that stop being trading stock because of the change of definition

             (1)  This section explains how to account for your disposal of an item if:

                     (a)  immediately before 1 July 1997, the item was an item of your trading stock, as defined in subsection 6(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ as in force at that time; and

                     (b)  the item has _not_ been an item of your trading stock, as defined in section 70-10 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, after that time; and

                     (c)  the disposal occurs on or after 1 July 1997; and

                     (d)  subsection 36(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ would have applied to the disposal if it had occurred before 1 July 1997.

Example:    This section applies to your disposal on or after  1 July 1997 of an item you produced, manufactured, acquired or purchased before that day for manufacture, sale or exchange, but did not hold for that purpose immediately before that day or since the start of that day.

             (2)  Sections 70-90 and 70-95 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (dealing with disposals of trading stock outside the ordinary course of business) apply to your disposal of the item as if it were an item of your trading stock (as defined in section 70-10 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_).

Note:          Applying those sections ensures that your assessable income includes the market value of the item on the day of disposal. This counters your deduction under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ for your expenditure to acquire the item as trading stock.

\[The next section is section 70-20.]

##### <a id="70-20"></a>70-20  Application of section 70-20 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ to trading stock bought on or after 1 July 1997

                   Section 70-20 (Non-arm’s length transactions) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies to purchases that take place on or after 1 July 1997.

\[The next section is section 70-40.]

##### <a id="70-40"></a>70-40  Value of trading stock at the start of the 1997-98 income year

             (1)  The **_value_** of an item of trading stock on hand at the start of the 1997-98 income year is its value as taken into account at the end of the 1996-97 income year under Subdivision B (Trading stock) of Division 2 of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

             (2)  The **_value_** of the item is a nil amount if the item was not taken into account as described in subsection (1).

\[The next section is section 70-55.]

##### <a id="70-55"></a>70-55  Cost of live stock acquired by natural increase

             (1)  Section 70-55 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies to animals acquired by natural increase in or after the 1997-98 income year.

             (2)  For the purposes of Subdivision 70-C of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, the **_cost_** of an animal acquired by natural increase before the 1997-98 income year is the cost price of the animal under section 34 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

\[The next section is section 70-70.]

##### <a id="70-70"></a>70-70  Valuing interests in FIFs on hand at the start of 1991-92

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  an interest in a FIF was an item of your trading stock on hand at the _start_ of the 1991-92 income year; and

                     (b)  that interest was also an item of your trading stock on hand at the _end_ of the 1997-98 income year or a later income year;

the **_value_** of the item at the _end_ of the 1997-98 or later income year is the value of the item as taken into account under Subdivision B (Trading stock) of Division 2 of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ at the _start_ of the 1991-92 income year.

             (2)  This section has effect despite section 70-45 (the general rule about how to value your trading stock at the end of the income year) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, but subject to subsection 70-70(2) (which allows you to elect to value all your interests in FIFs at their market value instead) of that Act.

Effect of election under subsection 31(5) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 on valuation of interests in FIFs

             (3)  If you made an election under subsection 31(5) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (to value all your interests in FIFs at market value), subsection 70-70(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies to your interests in FIFs as if you had made an election under subsection 70-70(2).

\[The next section is section 70-90.]

\[The next section is section 70-100.]

##### <a id="70-100"></a>70-100  Application of section 70-100 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ to disposals of trading stock outside ordinary course of business

Basic application

             (1)  Section 70-100 (Notional disposal when you stop holding an item as trading stock) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies to trading stock that stops being trading stock on hand of an entity on or after 1 July 1997.

Transitional provision if that section affects an assessment for 1996-97

             (2)  The value of trading stock to which subsection (4) of that section applies is to be worked out using the rules in the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (and not the rules in Subdivision 70-C of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_) if:

                     (a)  that section affects an assessment for the 1996-97 year of income under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; and

                     (b)  an election is made under subsection (4) of that section to value trading stock at what would have been its value at the end of an income year ending on the day it became trading stock on hand of the second entity.

Note:          Section 70-100 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ may affect an assessment for the 1996-97 income year if any of the entities with an interest in the trading stock (either before or after it becomes trading stock on hand of the second entity) has a 1996-97 income year ending on or after 1 July 1997.

##### <a id="70-105"></a>70-105  Application of section 70-105 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ to deaths on or after 1 July 1997

             (1)  Section 70-105 (Death of owner) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies to trading stock that devolves as a result of a person dying on or after 1 July 1997.

Transitional provision if that section affects an assessment for 1996-97

             (2)  The value of an item to which subsection (3) or (4) of that section applies is to be worked out using the rules in the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (and not the rules in Subdivision 70-C of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_) if:

                     (a)  that section affects an assessment for the 1996-97 year of income under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; and

                     (b)  an election is made under subsection (3) or (4) of that section to value the item at an amount other than its market value.

Note:          Section 70-105 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ may affect an assessment for the 1996-97 income year if an entity on which the item devolves has a 1996-97 income year ending on or after 1 July 1997.

\[The next section is section 70-115.]

##### <a id="70-115"></a>70-115  Application of section 70-115 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ to insurance and indemnity payments in 1997-98 and later income years

Note:          Deductions for these ships continue to be calculated under the 1936 Act. See subsection 53I(2) of the 1936 Act.

##### <a id="42-6"></a>42-6  General transitional provision

             (1)  The following subsections have effect if you have deducted or can deduct an amount for depreciation of plant:

                     (a)  under the old depreciation provisions; or

                     (b)  using the “log book” method or the “one-third of actual expenses” method under section 82KUD or 82KW, or Schedule 2A, of the 1936 Act;

and you can deduct an amount for depreciation of it under the new depreciation provisions or Division 28 of the 1997 Act.

Method

             (2)  You use the same method of calculation that you were using for the plant under the old depreciation provisions.

Cost

             (3)  The cost of the plant is the cost you were using under the old depreciation provisions.

             (4)  However, if you are using the diminishing value method for the plant and section 58 of the 1936 Act applied to its acquisition by you, the cost is:

                     (a)  the cost used by the transferor; or

                     (b)  if there were earlier successive transferors—the cost used by the earliest successive transferor.

Rate

             (5)  Your rate is the annual depreciation percentage worked out under the old depreciation provisions.

             (6)  However, if you are using the diminishing value method and you acquired or constructed the plant before 27 February 1992, you multiply that percentage by 1.5.

             (7)  However, if you are using the prime cost method and you acquired or constructed the plant after 26 February 1992, you multiply that percentage by two thirds.

Note:          Section 42-400 of this Act is relevant in working out whether plant was acquired or constructed after 26 February 1992.

##### <a id="42-7"></a>42-7  Special rules for plant used but not depreciated before the 1997-98 income year

             (1)  This section applies to you if:

                     (b)  you owned and used it before that income year but:

                              (i)  you did not use it for the purpose of producing assessable income; or

                             (ii)  a provision of the 1936 Act denied a depreciation deduction for it.

Method

             (2)  If section 58 of the 1936 Act applied to your acquisition of the plant, you use the method of calculation that the transferor was using or would have been required to use.

Note:          However, for other plant to which this section applies, you choose your method under the 1997 Act.

Cost

             (3)  The cost of the plant is the cost you would have been required to use if you had been deducting amounts for depreciation of it under the 1936 Act.

             (4)  However, if you are using the diminishing value method for the plant and section 58 of the 1936 Act applied to your acquisition of the plant, the cost is:

                     (a)  the cost used by the transferor; or

                     (b)  if there were earlier successive transferors—the cost used by the earliest successive transferor.

Rate

             (5)  You use the rate worked out under subsections 42-6(5), (6) and (7).

you use the rate worked out under subsections 42-6(5), (6) and (7).

             (3)  In working out that rate, you are taken to have acquired or constructed the plant at the time when:

                     (a)  the transferor; or

             (1)  An approved land management plan under section 75D of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ is taken to be an approved management plan for the purposes of Subdivision 387-A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ also.

Note:          This means that you can deduct amounts for capital expenditure in the 1997-98 income year or a later income year on fencing under an approved management plan that was prepared or approved before the 1997-98 income year.

             (2)  An approved management plan for the purposes of Subdivision 387-A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ also has effect as if it were an approved land management plan under section 75D of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936._

Note:          This allows an entity whose 1996-97 income year ends after 30 June 1997 to deduct expenditure incurred after that date on fencing under a management plan prepared or approved after 30 June 1997 but before the end of the entity’s 1996-97 income year.

##### <a id="387-85"></a>387-85  Transitional provisions for approvals of farm consultants

             (1)  An approval of a person as a farm consultant for the purposes of section 75D of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ that was in force immediately before 1 July 1997 also has effect on and after that day as an approval of the person as a farm consultant for the purposes of Subdivision 387-A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (until the approval is revoked).

             (2)  Anything done in relation to the approval under that Subdivision also has effect for the purposes of section 75D of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  the Secretary to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy has authorised an officer of that Department to approve persons as farm consultants for the purposes of section 75D of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; and

                     (b)  the authority was in force immediately before 1 July 1997;

the authority also has effect on and after that day as an authority to approve persons as farm consultants for the purposes of Subdivision 387-A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (until the authority is revoked).

             (4)  Anything relating to an authority done under that Subdivision also has effect for the purposes of section 75D of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

             (1)  Subdivision 387-B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies to assessments for the 1997-98 income year and later income years, in relation to capital expenditure relating to a water facility, regardless of when it was incurred.

             (2)  For the purpose of applying that Subdivision in relation to expenditure you incurred before the 1997-98 income year, you are taken to have incurred the amount of expenditure for which you could deduct an amount under section 75B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ for an income year before the 1997-98 income year.

Note:          This means that you cannot get a deduction under that Subdivision for expenditure that you recouped before the 1997-98 income year.

\[The next section is section 387-140.]

##### <a id="387-140"></a>387-140  _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ taken to apply to expenditure covered by section 75A or 75B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_

                   In determining whether section 387-140 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ prevents you from deducting expenditure on acquiring a water facility, treat the following amounts as if they had been deducted under Subdivision 387-B of that Act:

                     (a)  an amount that was or can be deducted for any income year under section 75A or 75B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ for earlier expenditure by any person on constructing or manufacturing the facility or on a previous acquisition of the facility;

##### <a id="387-300"></a>387-300  Application of Subdivision 387-D of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_

             (1)  Subdivision 387-D of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies to assessments for the 1997-98 income year and later income years, in relation to expenditure incurred on or after 1 July 1993.

             (2)  For the purpose of applying that Subdivision in relation to expenditure you incurred before the 1997-98 income year, you are taken to have incurred the amount of expenditure for which you could deduct an amount under section 75AA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ for an income year before the 1997-98 income year.

Note:          This means that you cannot get a deduction under that Subdivision for expenditure that you recouped before the 1997-98 income year.

\[The next section is section 387-315.]

##### <a id="387-315"></a>387-315  Deduction for destruction of grapevine established before 1997-98 income year

                   Subdivision 387-E of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies to assessments for the 1997-98 income year and later income years, in relation to:

                     (a)  capital expenditure on connecting power to land or upgrading the connection, regardless of when it was incurred; and

                     (b)  contributions to the cost of connecting power to land or upgrading the connection, regardless of when they were made.

\[The next section is section 387-375.]

##### <a id="387-375"></a>387-375  Saving of deductions under section 70A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_

                   Subdivision 387-E of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ does not affect a deduction, or an entitlement to a deduction, under section 70A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ for the 1996-97 income year or an earlier income year.

#### Subdivision 387-F—Telephone lines

**Table of sections**

                   Subdivision 387-F of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies to assessments for the 1997-98 income year and later income years, in relation to capital expenditure on a telephone line, regardless of when it was incurred.

\[The next section is section 387-410.]

##### <a id="387-410"></a>387-410  Disregarding deductions under section 70 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_

             (1)  In applying subsection 387-410(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ to work out whether you can deduct an amount under Subdivision 387-F of that Act for your expenditure, disregard any amount that you have deducted, or can deduct, for that expenditure under section 70 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

Note:          This ensures that you can deduct amounts under Subdivision 387-F of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ for the 1997-98 income year and later income years, even if you did or can deduct amounts for your expenditure under section 70 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ for one or more income years before the 1997-98 income year.

             (2)  Disregard an amount deducted or deductible for any income year under section 70 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ for capital expenditure on a part of a telephone line by an entity that worked on installing that part, when applying subsection 387-410(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ to work out whether you can deduct an amount under that Subdivision.

Note:          This helps prevent deductions by different entities for capital expenditure on the same part of a telephone line.

##### <a id="387-415"></a>387-415  Saving of deductions under section 70 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_

                   Subdivision 387-F of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ does not affect a deduction, or an entitlement to a deduction, under section 70 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ for the 1996-97 income year or an earlier income year.

\[The next section is section 387-470.]

##### <a id="387-470"></a>387-470  Expenditure incurred before the 1997-98 income year

             (1)  The purpose of this section is to ensure that the amount of capital expenditure you must take into account for the purposes of working out the amount of a deduction under Subdivision 387-G of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ is the same as the amount of your capital expenditure taken into account as a basis for working out a deduction under section 124F or 124JA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

             (2)  This section applies if, before the 1997-98 income year, you incurred capital expenditure (the **_original expenditure_**) on an access road or a timber mill building for which you did or can deduct an amount for an income year before the 1997-98 income year under section 124F or 124JA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

             (3)  For the purposes of Subdivision 387-G of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_:

                     (a)  you are taken to have incurred an amount (the **_base amount_**) of capital expenditure on the road or building equal to:

                              (i)  what was your residual capital expenditure for the road or building for the purposes of section 124F or 124JA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ immediately after you incurred the original expenditure; or

                             (ii)  if you incurred the original expenditure before the first income year for which you could deduct an amount for it—what was your residual capital expenditure for the road or building for the purposes of section 124F or 124JA of that Act at the start of that first income year; and

                     (b)  you are taken to have incurred the base amount:

                              (i)  when you incurred the original expenditure; or

                             (ii)  if you incurred the original expenditure before the first income year for which you could deduct an amount for it—at the start of that first income year.

Note:          Your residual capital expenditure mentioned in subparagraph (3)(a)(i) will equal your capital expenditure (as affected by section 124H or 124JC of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) if you incurred the original expenditure on construction of an access road after the 1955-56 income year, or on construction of a timber mill building after the 1962-63 income year.

             (4)  Despite subsection (3), if before the 1997-98 income year:

                     (a)  you incurred capital expenditure on constructing or acquiring an access road for which you did or can deduct an amount under section 124F of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; and

                     (b)  you stopped using the road for the purpose for which it was primarily and principally constructed; and

                     (c)  you started using the road again for that purpose;

you are taken to have incurred an amount of capital expenditure on the road equal to the amount described in subsection 124F(4) of that Act in the income year in which you started using the road again.

##### <a id="387-472"></a>387-472  Treatment of deductions for income years before 1997-98

             (1)  If you deducted, or can deduct, an amount for an income year (the **_old law year_**) before the 1997-98 income year under section 124F or 124JA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ for your expenditure on an access road or a timber mill building:

                     (a)  you are taken to have deducted that amount for the old law year under Subdivision 387-G of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (which allows deductions for the 1997-98 income year and later income years for expenditure on forestry roads and timber mill buildings), as if that Subdivision had applied to assessments for the old law year; and

                     (b)  the amount is taken not to have been deducted or be deductible under section 124F or 124JA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

             (2)  This section applies only for the purposes of Subdivision 387-G of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_. It does not affect a deduction, or an entitlement to a deduction, under section 124F or 124JA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ for an income year before the 1997-98 income year for the purposes of that Act.

\[The next section is section 387-485.]

##### <a id="387-485"></a>387-485  How the balancing adjustment is affected if there has only been old roll-over relief

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  before the 1997-98 income year, roll-over relief was available under section 124GA or section 124JD of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ in relation to the disposal of an access road or a timber mill building by a taxpayer (the **_transferor_**) to another taxpayer (the **_transferee_**); and

                     (b)  in the 1997-98 income year or a later income year:

                              (i)  the road or building is destroyed; or

                             (ii)  the transferee disposes of it in circumstances where Subdivision 41-A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (which sets out Common rule 1 dealing with roll-over relief for related entities) does not apply to the disposal; or

                            (iii)  for some other reason, the transferee stops using it for the purpose for which it was primarily and principally constructed or acquired; and

                     (c)  there has been no earlier disposal of the road or building where roll-over relief was available under Common rule 1;

the balancing adjustment is affected in 2 ways.

             (2)  First:

                     (a)  the total amounts deductible by the transferor under 
 section 124F or 124JA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ in relation to the road or building; or
