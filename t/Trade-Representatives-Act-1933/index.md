             (6)  A determination shall not be expressed to take effect on a day earlier than the day on which it is made in any case where, if the determination so took effect:

                     (a)  the rights of a person (other than the Commonwealth) existing immediately before the last‑mentioned day would be affected in a manner prejudicial to the person; or

                     (b)  liabilities would be imposed on a person (other than the Commonwealth) in respect of anything done or omitted to be done before that last‑mentioned day, and where, in a determination, any provision is made in contravention of this subsection, the provision is void and of no effect.

                     (c)  anyone else who would be a member of the person’s family if someone mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b) is taken to be a member of the person’s family.

           (12)  In this section:

                    <a name="child"></a><a name="child"></a>**_child_**: without limiting who is a child of a person for the purposes of this Act, someone is the **_child_** of a person if he or she is a child of the person within the meaning of the _Family Law Act 1975_.

             (2)  Determinations are not statutory rules within the meaning of the _Statutory Rules Publication Act 1903._

##### <a id="11B"></a>11B  Evidence

                   For the purposes of section 5 of the _Evidence Act 1905_, a determination shall be deemed to be an order made by a Minister.

             (5)  A delegation under this section does not prevent the exercise of a power by the person who made the delegation. 

             (6)  A delegation under this section continues in force notwithstanding a change in the occupancy of, or a vacancy in, the office of the person who made the delegation, but, for the purposes of the application of subsection 33(3) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ to a delegation under this section, nothing in this Act shall be taken to preclude the revocation or variation of the delegation by the same or a subsequent holder of the office. 

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Regulations

                   The Governor‑General may make regulations, not inconsistent with this Act, prescribing all matters which by this Act are required or permitted to be prescribed, or which are necessary or convenient to be prescribed, for giving effect to this Act.
