#### Guide to Division 5

##### <a id="5‑1"></a>5‑1  What this Division is about

* * *

If your assessed income tax liability exceeds the credits available to you under the PAYG system, this Division explains _when_ you must pay the excess to the Commissioner.

If your assessment is amended so that you must pay income tax, or pay more income tax than under the previous assessment, this Division explains:

               (a)     _when_ you must pay the additional tax; and

              (b)     _when_ any associated interest charges must be paid.

                   Note:             For provisions about the collection and recovery of income tax and other tax‑related liabilities, see Part 4‑15 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

**Table of sections**

5‑5            When income tax is payable

5‑10          When shortfall interest charge is payable

5‑15          General interest charge payable on unpaid income tax or shortfall interest charge

##### <a id="5‑5"></a>5‑5  When income tax is payable

Scope

             (1)  This section tells you when income tax you must pay for a * financial year is due and payable.

Note:          The Commissioner may defer the time at which the income tax is due and payable: see section 255‑10 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

             (2)  The income tax is only due and payable if the Commissioner makes an * assessment of your income tax for the year.

             (3)  However, if the Commissioner does make an * assessment of your income tax for the year, the tax may be taken to have been due and payable at a time before your assessment was made.

Note:          This is to ensure that general interest charge begins to accrue from the same date for all like entities. General interest charge on unpaid income tax is calculated from when the tax is due and payable, not from when the assessment is made: see section 5‑15.

Original assessments—self‑assessment entities

             (4)  If you are a * self‑assessment entity, the income tax is due and payable on the first day of the sixth month after the end of the income year.

Example:    If your income year is the same as the financial year, your income tax would be due and payable on 1 December.

Original assessments—other entities

             (5)  If you are _not_ a * self‑assessment entity, the income tax is due and payable 21 days after the day (the **_return day_**) on or before which you are required to lodge your * income tax return with the Commissioner.

Note:          For rules about income tax returns and when they are due, see Part IV of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

             (6)  However, if you lodge your return _on or before_ the return day and the Commissioner gives you a notice of * assessment (other than an amended assessment) _after_ the return day, the income tax is due and payable 21 days after the Commissioner gives you the notice.

Amended assessments

             (7)  If the Commissioner amends your * assessment, any extra income tax resulting from the amendment is due and payable 21 days after the day on which the Commissioner gives you notice of the amended assessment.

Note:          Shortfall interest charge may be payable, on any amount of extra income tax payable as a result of the amended assessment, for each day in the period that:

(a)           starts at the time income tax was due and payable on your original assessment; and

(b)           ends the day before the day on which the Commissioner gives you notice of the amended assessment.

##### <a id="5‑10"></a>5‑10  When shortfall interest charge is payable

                   An amount of * shortfall interest charge that you are liable to pay is due and payable 21 days after the day on which the Commissioner gives you notice of the charge.

Note:          Shortfall interest charge is imposed if the Commissioner amends an assessment and the amended assessment results in an increase in some tax payable. For provisions about liability for shortfall interest charge, see Division 280 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

##### <a id="5‑15"></a>5‑15  General interest charge payable on unpaid income tax or shortfall interest charge

                   If an amount of income tax or * shortfall interest charge that you are liable to pay remains unpaid after the time by which it is due to be paid, you are liable to pay the * general interest charge on the unpaid amount for each day in the period that:

                     (a)  starts at the beginning of the day on which the amount was due to be paid; and

                     (b)  finishes at the end of the last day on which, at the end of the day, any of the following remains unpaid:

                              (i)  the income tax or shortfall interest charge;

                             (ii)  general interest charge on any of the income tax or shortfall interest charge.

Note 1:       The general interest charge is worked out under Part IIA of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

Note 2:       Shortfall interest charge is worked out under Division 280 in Schedule 1 to that Act.

## 4  Subsection 995‑1(1)

Insert:

                    <a name="self-assess-entiti"></a>**_self‑assessment entity_** means a full self‑assessment taxpayer (within the meaning of subsection 6(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_).

## 5  Subsection 995‑1(1)

Insert:

                    <a name="statutori-demand"></a>**_statutory demand_** has the same meaning as in the _Corporations Act 2001_.

<h9 class="ActHead9">Taxation Administration Act 1953</h9>

## 6  Before subsection 255‑10(1) in Schedule 1

Insert:

Deferrals for particular taxpayers

## 7  After subsection 255‑10(2) in Schedule 1

Insert:

Deferrals for classes of taxpayers

          (2A)  The Commissioner, having regard to the circumstances of the case, may, by notice published on the Australian Taxation Office website, defer the time at which amounts of * tax‑related liabilities are, or would become, due and payable by a class of taxpayers (whether or not the liabilities have already arisen).

          (2B)  If the Commissioner does so, that time is varied accordingly.

Note:          General interest charge and any other relevant penalties, if applicable for any unpaid amounts of the liabilities, will begin to accrue from the time as varied. See, for example, paragraph 5‑15(a) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

          (2C)  A notice published under subsection (2A) is not a legislative instrument.

Deferral does not affect time for giving form

## 8  Subsection 255‑10(3) in Schedule 1

Omit “subsection (1)”, substitute “this section”.

## 9  At the end of Division 255 in Schedule 1

Add:

#### Subdivision 255‑D—Security deposits

**Table of sections**

255‑100    Commissioner may require security deposit

255‑105    Notice of requirement to give security

255‑110    Offence

##### <a id="255‑100"></a>255‑100  Commissioner may require security deposit

             (1)  The Commissioner may require you to give security for the due payment of an existing or future * tax‑related liability of yours if:

                     (a)  the Commissioner has reason to believe that:

                              (i)  you are establishing or * carrying on an * enterprise in Australia; and

                             (ii)  you intend to carry on that enterprise for a limited time only; or

                     (b)  the Commissioner reasonably believes that the requirement is otherwise appropriate, having regard to all relevant circumstances.

Note:          A requirement to give security under this section is _not_ a tax‑related liability. As such, the collection and recovery provisions in this Part do not apply to it.

             (2)  The Commissioner may require you to give the security:

                     (a)  by way of a bond or deposit (including by way of payments in instalments); or

                     (b)  by any other means that the Commissioner reasonably believes is appropriate.

             (3)  The Commissioner may require you to give security under this section:

                     (a)  at any time the Commissioner reasonably believes is appropriate; and

                     (b)  as often as the Commissioner reasonably believes is appropriate.

Example:    The Commissioner may require additional security if he or she reasonably believes that the original security requirement underestimated the amount of the likely tax‑related liability.

##### <a id="255‑105"></a>255‑105  Notice of requirement to give security

Commissioner must give notice of requirement to give security

             (1)  If the Commissioner requires you to give security under section 255‑100, he or she must give you written notice of the requirement.

Content of notice

             (2)  The notice must:

                     (a)  state that you are required to give the security to the Commissioner; and

                     (b)  explain why the Commissioner requires the security; and

                     (c)  set out the amount of the security; and

                     (d)  describe the means by which you are required to give the security under subsection 255‑100(2); and

                     (e)  specify the time by which you are required to give the security; and

                      (f)  explain how you may have the Commissioner’s decision to require you to give the security reviewed.

             (3)  To avoid doubt, a single notice may relate to security for the payment of 2 or more existing or future * tax‑related liabilities, but must comply with subsection (2) in relation to each of them.

When notice is given

             (4)  Despite section 29 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_, a notice under subsection (1) is taken to be given at the time the Commissioner leaves or posts it.

Note:          Section 28A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ may be relevant to giving a notice under subsection (1).

Miscellaneous

             (5)  A failure to comply with this section does not affect the validity of the requirement to give the security under section 255‑100.

##### <a id="255‑110"></a>255‑110  Offence

                   You commit an offence if:

                     (a)  the Commissioner requires you to give security under section 255‑100; and

                     (b)  you fail to give that security as required.

                    Penalty:  100 penalty units.

This Division enables the Commissioner to make an estimate of amounts not paid as required by Part 2‑5 (Pay as you go (PAYG) withholding), and to recover the amount of the estimate.

If you are given an estimate, you are liable to pay the amount of the estimate. That liability is distinct from your liability to pay the amounts required by Part 2‑5\. However, you can ensure that the Commissioner does not require you to pay more than the amounts not paid under that Part.

Other Divisions of this Part provide for the recovery of amounts payable under this Division.

             (2)  The amount of the estimate must be what the Commissioner thinks is reasonable.

             (3)  In making the estimate, the Commissioner may have regard to anything he or she thinks relevant.

Example:    The Commissioner may have regard to information about amounts you withheld under the Pay as you go rules before the period in relation to which the underlying liability arose.

Only one estimate for each liability

             (4)  While the estimate is in force, the Commissioner cannot make another estimate relating to the underlying liability.

             (5)  For the purposes of subsection (4), the estimate is in force if:

                     (a)  the Commissioner has given you notice of the estimate; and

                     (b)  the estimate has not been revoked; and

                     (c)  your liability to pay the estimate has not been discharged.

##### <a id="268‑15"></a>268‑15  Notice of estimate

Commissioner must give notice of estimate

             (1)  The Commissioner must give you written notice of the estimate.

Content of notice

             (2)  The notice must:

                     (a)  identify the underlying liability; and

                     (b)  specify the date of the estimate; and

                     (c)  set out the amount of the estimate; and

                     (d)  state that the amount of the estimate is due and payable; and

                     (e)  explain how you may have the amount of the estimate reduced or the estimate revoked.

             (3)  To avoid doubt, a single notice may relate to 2 or more estimates, but must comply with subsection (2) in relation to each of them.

When notice is given

             (4)  Despite section 29 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_, a notice under subsection (1) is taken to be given at the time the Commissioner leaves or posts it.

Note:          Section 28A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ may be relevant to giving a notice under subsection (1).

#### Subdivision 268‑C—Liability to pay estimates

**Table of sections**

268‑20      Nature of liability to pay estimate

268‑25      Accuracy of estimate irrelevant to liability to pay

268‑30      Estimate provable in bankruptcy or winding up

##### <a id="268‑20"></a>268‑20  Nature of liability to pay estimate

Liability to pay amount of estimate

             (1)  You must pay to the Commissioner the amount of the estimate if the Commissioner gives you notice of the estimate in accordance with section 268‑15\. The amount is due and payable when the Commissioner gives you the notice.

Note:          The amount of the estimate may be reduced, or the estimate revoked, under Subdivision 268‑D.

Liability to pay amount of estimate is distinct from underlying liability

             (2)  Your liability to pay the amount of the estimate is separate and distinct from the underlying liability. It is separate and distinct for all purposes.

Example:    The Commissioner may take:

(a)           proceedings to recover the unpaid amount of the estimate; or

(b)           proceedings to recover the unpaid amount of the underlying liability; or

(c)           proceedings of both kinds.

Discharging one liability discharges other liabilities

             (3)  Despite subsection (2), if, at a particular time, one of the liabilities to which this subsection applies is discharged, to the extent of an amount, for either of the following reasons, each of the other liabilities to which this subsection applies is discharged to the extent of the same amount:

                     (a)  an amount is paid or applied towards discharging the liability;

                     (b)  the liability is discharged because of section 269‑40 (Effect of director paying penalty or company discharging liability).

             (4)  Subsection (3) applies to whichever of the following liabilities are in existence at the particular time:

                     (a)  your liability to pay the amount of the estimate;

                     (b)  the underlying liability;

                     (c)  a liability of yours under a judgment, to the extent that it is based on a liability referred to in paragraph (a) or (b).

             (5)  Subsection (3) does not discharge a liability to a greater extent than the amount of the liability.

##### <a id="268‑25"></a>268‑25  Accuracy of estimate irrelevant to liability to pay

                   You are liable to pay the unpaid amount of the estimate even if:

                     (a)  the underlying liability never existed or has been discharged in full; or

                     (b)  the unpaid amount of the underlying liability is less than the unpaid amount of the estimate.

Note 1:       Section 268‑40 revokes the estimate if you give the Commissioner a statutory declaration, or file an affidavit, to the effect that the underlying liability never existed.

Note 2:       Subdivision 268‑D provides ways in which you can challenge the estimate or its amount.

##### <a id="268‑30"></a>268‑30  Estimate provable in bankruptcy or winding up

             (1)  Your liability (the **_estimate liability_**) to pay the unpaid amount of the estimate is provable in a bankruptcy or winding up, even if the estimate was made after:

                     (a)  the date of the bankruptcy; or

                     (b)  the relevant date (within the meaning of the _Corporations Act 2001_).

             (2)  However, the estimate liability is provable only to the extent that the underlying liability would be provable if the unpaid amount of the underlying liability were the same as the unpaid amount of the estimate.

Example:    Subsection (2) prevents proof of the estimate liability if the underlying liability could not be proved because, for example, of when it arose.

             (3)  Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply if:

                     (a)  the underlying liability has already been admitted to proof; and

                     (b)  the proof has not been set aside.

             (4)  If the estimate liability has been admitted to proof at a particular amount, the underlying liability is provable only to the extent the unpaid amount of the underlying liability exceeds that particular amount.

             (5)  To the extent that a liability is provable because of this section, it is taken, for the purposes of the _Bankruptcy Act 1966_, to be provable in bankruptcy under that Act.

##### <a id="268‑35"></a>268‑35  How estimate may be reduced or revoked—Commissioner’s powers

Reduction

             (1)  The Commissioner may at any time reduce the amount of the estimate, but is not obliged to consider whether or not to do so.

             (2)  If the Commissioner reduces the amount of the estimate under subsection (1), he or she must give you a written notice that:

                     (a)  identifies the underlying liability; and

                     (b)  sets out the reduced amount of the estimate.

Note:          The estimate is taken always to have had effect as reduced: see section 268‑55.

Revocation

             (3)  The Commissioner may at any time revoke the estimate, but is not obliged to consider whether or not to do so.

             (4)  If the Commissioner revokes the estimate under subsection (3), he or she must give you a written notice that:

                     (a)  identifies the underlying liability; and

                     (b)  states that the estimate has been revoked.

Note:          The estimate is taken never to have been made: see section 268‑55.

Matters for Commissioner to consider

             (5)  In exercising his or her power under this section to reduce the amount of the estimate, or to revoke the estimate, the Commissioner must have regard to:

                     (a)  the following principles:

                              (i)  the estimate is of the unpaid amount of the underlying liability as at a particular time;

                             (ii)  the purpose of reducing the amount of the estimate is to bring it closer to the unpaid amount of the underlying liability as at the time the estimate was made;

                            (iii)  reductions of the unpaid amount of the underlying liability that happen after the time the estimate was made are dealt with by section 268‑20 (Nature of liability to pay estimate) and so should not be taken into account in exercising such a power; and

                     (b)  the effects of sections 268‑55 and 268‑70 (effect of reduction or revocation on liabilities).

Example:    For the purposes of item 2 of the table, taking a procedural step as a party to proceedings includes entering an appearance, filing a notice of intention to defend, or applying to set aside judgment entered in default of appearance.

Note 1:       Section 459C of the _Corporations Act 2001_ creates a presumption that a company is insolvent, and may be wound up, if the company fails to comply with a statutory demand.

Note 2:       See section 268‑90 for what the statutory declaration or affidavit must contain and who must make, swear or affirm it.

Reduction

             (2)  The amount of the estimate is reduced if the statutory declaration is to the effect, or the affidavit verifies facts sufficient to prove, that a specified lesser amount is the unpaid amount of the underlying liability.

Example:    Subsection (2) will apply if the statutory declaration etc. is to the effect that the underlying liability has been discharged in full (and therefore the unpaid amount of the liability is nil).

             (3)  The amount of the reduction is the amount by which the unpaid amount of the estimate (just before the reduction) exceeds the amount specified.

Note:          The effect of subsection (3) is to reduce the unpaid amount of the estimate to the amount specified.

Revocation

             (4)  The estimate is revoked if the statutory declaration is to the effect, or the affidavit verifies facts sufficient to prove, that the underlying liability never existed.

##### <a id="268‑45"></a>268‑45  How estimate may be reduced or revoked—rejection of proof of debt

Scope

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  the Commissioner lodges a proof of debt relating to the unpaid amount of the estimate; and

                     (b)  section 268‑95 applies to an entity (your **_supervising entity_**) in relation to you.

Rejection of proof of debt

             (2)  Your supervising entity may give the Commissioner a statutory declaration to the effect that:

                     (a)  the underlying liability has been discharged in full; or

                     (b)  the unpaid amount of the underlying liability is a specified, lesser amount; or

                     (c)  the underlying liability never existed.

Note:          See section 268‑90 for what the statutory declaration must contain and who must make it.

             (3)  If your supervising entity does so, he or she may reject the proof of debt (in whole or in part) on the ground made out in the statutory declaration.

             (4)  If the Commissioner appeals, or applies for review of, your supervising entity’s decision to reject the proof of debt, nothing in subsection (2) or (3) prevents evidence being adduced to contradict statements in the declaration.

Note:          Such evidence might also be relevant to a prosecution for an offence, such as an offence against section 11 of the _Statutory Declarations Act 1959_ (False declarations).

Revocation or reduction of estimate

             (5)  The following table applies in relation to the outcome following all (if any) appeals from, and applications for review of, your supervising entity’s decision to reject the proof of debt. (If there are no appeals or applications for review, the outcome is your supervising entity’s decision as originally made.)

##### <a id="268‑50"></a>268‑50  How estimate may be reduced—amount paid or applied

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  an amount is paid or applied towards discharging your liability to pay the amount of the estimate; and

                     (b)  the amount paid or applied exceeds the unpaid amount of the underlying liability as at the time just before the payment or application.

             (2)  The amount of the estimate is reduced so that it does not exceed the unpaid amount, at the time mentioned in paragraph (1)(b), of the underlying liability.

##### <a id="268‑55"></a>268‑55  When reduction or revocation takes effect

Scope

             (1)  This section applies for the purposes of the following:

                     (a)  Subdivision 268‑C (Liability to pay estimates);

                     (b)  section 268‑60 (refund of overpayments);

                     (c)  Subdivision 268‑E (Late payment of estimates);

                     (d)  Division 269 (Penalties for directors of non‑complying companies).

When reduction or revocation takes effect

             (2)  If the amount of the estimate is reduced, the estimate has effect, and is taken always to have had effect, as if the original amount of the estimate had been the reduced amount.

             (3)  If the estimate is revoked, the estimate is taken never to have been made.

##### <a id="268‑60"></a>268‑60  Consequences of reduction or revocation—refund

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  an amount is paid or applied towards discharging your liability to pay the amount of the estimate; and

                     (b)  the amount paid or applied exceeds the unpaid amount of the estimate as at the time just before the payment or application.

Example:    You pay an amount towards discharging the estimate and the estimate is later reduced to a lesser amount.

Note:          Section 268‑50 provides for the reduction of the amount of the estimate in the case of overpayment.

             (2)  The Commissioner must pay you the excess.

Note:          See Division 3A of Part IIB of this Act for the rules about how the Commissioner must pay you. Division 3 of that Part allows the Commissioner to apply the amount owing as a credit against tax debts that you owe the Commonwealth.

##### <a id="268‑65"></a>268‑65  Consequences of reduction or revocation—statutory demand changed or set aside

Scope

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  the estimate is of the unpaid amount of a liability of a company; and

                     (b)  the Commissioner has served a * statutory demand on the company relating to the company’s liability to pay the unpaid amount of the estimate; and

                     (c)  the amount of the estimate is later reduced, or the estimate is revoked.

Statutory demand changed

             (2)  The * statutory demand is changed accordingly.

             (3)  The * statutory demand is taken to have had effect (as so changed) from the time the Commissioner served it on the company.

Statutory demand set aside

             (4)  The * statutory demand is set aside if subsection (2) reduces the amount of the debt (or the total of the amounts of the debts) below the statutory minimum (within the meaning of the _Corporations Act 2001_).

##### <a id="268‑70"></a>268‑70  Consequences of reduction or revocation—underlying liability

                   Reduction of the amount of the estimate, or revocation of the estimate, does not affect the Commissioner’s rights or remedies in relation to the underlying liability (except to the extent that this Division expressly provides otherwise).

268‑80      Effect of paying the general interest charge

##### <a id="268‑75"></a>268‑75  Liability to pay the general interest charge

             (1)  This section applies if your liability to pay the amount of the estimate remains undischarged at the end of 7 days after the Commissioner gives you notice of the estimate.

             (2)  You are liable to pay the * general interest charge on the unpaid amount of the estimate for each day in the period that:

                     (a)  started at the beginning of the day by which the underlying liability was due to be paid; and

                     (b)  finishes at the end of the last day on which, at the end of the day, any of the following remains unpaid:

                              (i)  the amount of the estimate;

                             (ii)  general interest charge on any of the amount of the estimate.

Note:          The general interest charge is worked out under Part IIA of this Act.

##### <a id="268‑80"></a>268‑80  Effect of paying the general interest charge

Scope

             (1)  If you are liable to pay the * general interest charge under section 268‑75 in relation to the estimate, this section applies to the following liabilities:

                     (a)  your liability to pay the general interest charge;

                     (b)  a liability of yours to pay a general interest charge, under a corresponding provision of Subdivision 16‑B, because the underlying liability remains undischarged;

                     (c)  liability under a judgment, to the extent that it is based on a liability referred to in paragraph (a) or (b);

                     (d)  a liability of yours to pay interest carried by a judgment debt, to the extent that the judgment debt is based on:

                              (i)  the liability to pay the estimate; or

                             (ii)  the liability to pay the general interest charge under section 268‑75 on an unpaid amount of the estimate.

Discharging one liability discharges other liabilities

             (2)  If, at a particular time, an amount is paid or applied towards discharging one of the liabilities, each of the other liabilities that is in existence at that time is discharged to the extent of the same amount.

             (3)  However, this section does not discharge a liability to a greater extent than the amount of the liability.

             (4)  If, because a judgment debt carries interest, section 8AAH of this Act reduces the amount of a * general interest charge payable as mentioned in paragraph (1)(b) of this section, the amount of the reduction is taken, for the purposes of subsection (2) of this section, to have been applied towards discharging your liability to the charge.

Estimate payable despite judgment

             (1)  The unpaid amount of the estimate, or of the underlying liability, does not stop being payable merely because a judgment has been given by, or entered in, a court.

Division applies to liability under judgment

             (2)  This Division applies in relation to liability under a judgment, to the extent that it is based on your liability to pay the amount of the estimate, in the same way as this Division applies to that estimate liability.

Content

             (2)  The statutory declaration or affidavit must verify the following facts:

                     (a)  whichever of the following are applicable:

Instalment arrangements

             (3)  The Commissioner must not commence, or take a procedural step as a party to, proceedings to enforce an obligation, or to recover a penalty, of a director under this Division if an * arrangement that covers the company’s obligation is in force under section 255‑15 (Commissioner’s power to permit payments by instalments).

Note 1:       The arrangement may also cover other obligations of the company.

                     (c)  a liability under a judgment, to the extent that it is based on a liability referred to in paragraph (a) or (b).

Discharging one liability discharges other liabilities

             (2)  If an amount is paid or applied at a particular time towards discharging one of the liabilities, each of the other liabilities in existence at that time is discharged to the extent of the same amount.

             (3)  If, because of section 268‑20 (Nature of liability to pay estimate), one of the liabilities is discharged at a particular time to the extent of a particular amount, each of the other liabilities in existence at that time is discharged to the extent of the same amount.

             (4)  This section does not discharge a liability to a greater extent than the amount of the liability.

#### Guide to Division 245

##### <a id="245‑1"></a>245‑1  What this Division is about

* * *

When a creditor forgives a commercial debt you owe, you make a gain. This is usually not included in your assessable income. Instead, this Division offsets the forgiven amount against amounts that could otherwise reduce your taxable income in the same or a later income year. Those amounts are:

               (a)     your tax losses and net capital losses; and

              (b)     capital allowances and some similar deductions; and

               (c)     the cost bases of your CGT assets.

* * *

##### <a id="245‑2"></a>245‑2  Simplified outline of this Division

             (1)  This Division applies to any commercial debt (or part of a commercial debt) you owe that is forgiven.

Note:          This Division does not apply if:

(a)           the debt is waived and the waiver constitutes a fringe benefit; or

(b)           the amount of the debt has been, or will be, included in your assessable income in any income year; or

(c)           the debt is forgiven under an Act relating to bankruptcy; or

(d)           the debt is forgiven by will; or

(e)           the debt is forgiven for reasons of natural love and affection; or

(f)            the debt is a tax‑related liability.

             (2)  The net forgiven amount of a debt is worked out by reducing the value  of your forgiven debt by:

                     (a)  any consideration you provided for the forgiveness; and

                     (b)  any amounts that this Act already brings to account because of the forgiveness.

             (3)  The net forgiven amounts of all your forgiven debts in an income year are added up. This total net forgiven amount is applied to reduce the following amounts (in the following order):

                     (a)  your tax losses from previous income years;

                     (b)  your net capital losses from previous income years;

                     (c)  the deductions you would otherwise get in the income year, or in a later year, because of expenditure from a previous year (e.g. the capital allowance deductions you would get for the cost of a depreciating asset);

                     (d)  the cost bases of your CGT assets.

             (4)  Any unapplied total net forgiven amount is disregarded.

             (5)  Special rules apply to debts of partnerships.

                     (b)  interest, or an amount in the nature of interest, is not payable by you in respect of the debt but, had interest or such an amount been payable, the whole or any part of the interest or amount could have been deducted by you; or

                     (c)  interest or an amount mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b) could have been deducted by you apart from the operation of a provision of this Act (other than paragraphs 8‑1(2)(a), (b) and (c)) that has the effect of preventing a deduction.

Note:          Paragraphs 8‑1(2)(a), (b) and (c) prevent deductions for capital, private or domestic outgoings and for outgoings relating to exempt income or non‑assessable non‑exempt income.

##### <a id="245‑15"></a>245‑15  Non‑equity shares

                   This Division applies to a * non‑equity share issued by a company as if it were a debt to which section 245‑10 applies that is owed by the company to the relevant shareholder.

##### <a id="245‑20"></a>245‑20  Parts of debts

                   This Division applies to part of a debt in the same way as it applies to a whole debt.

Note:          This Division treats interest, or an amount in the nature of interest, payable on a debt as being a separate debt if the interest or amount has accrued but has not been paid.

##### <a id="245‑35"></a>245‑35  What constitutes _forgiveness_ of a debt

                   A debt is **_forgiven_** if and when:

                     (a)  the debtor’s obligation to pay the debt is released or waived, or is otherwise extinguished other than by repaying the debt in full; or

                     (b)  the period within which the creditor is entitled to sue for the recovery of the debt ends, because of the operation of a statute of limitations, without the debt having been paid.

##### <a id="245‑36"></a>245‑36  What constitutes _forgiveness_ of a debt if the debt is assigned

                   A debt is **_forgiven_** if and when the creditor assigns the right to receive payment of the debt to another entity (the **_new creditor_**) and the following conditions are met:

                     (a)  either the new creditor is the debtor’s * associate or the assignment occurred under an * arrangement to which the new creditor and debtor were parties;

                     (b)  the right to receive payment of the debt was not acquired by the new creditor in the ordinary course of * trading on a market, exchange or other place on which, or facility by means of which, offers to sell, buy or exchange securities (within the meaning of Division 16E of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) are made or accepted.

Note 1:       Division 16E of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ brings to account gains and losses on some securities on an accruals basis.

Note 2:       This Division also applies if an assigned debt is subsequently forgiven by the new creditor. Section 245‑61 tells you how to work out the value of the debt in that case.

##### <a id="245‑37"></a>245‑37  What constitutes _forgiveness_ of a debt if a subscription for shares enables payment of the debt

                   If an entity subscribes for * shares in a company to enable the company to make a payment in or towards discharge of a debt it owes to the entity, the debt is **_forgiven_** when, and to the extent that, the company applies any of the money subscribed in or towards payment of the debt.

##### <a id="245‑40"></a>245‑40  Forgivenesses to which operative rules do not apply

                   Subdivisions 245‑C to 245‑G do not apply to a * forgiveness of a debt if:

                     (a)  the debt is waived and the waiver constitutes a * fringe benefit; or

Note:       The waiver by an employer of a debt owed by an employee is usually a fringe benefit: see section 14 of the _Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986_.

                     (b)  the amount of the debt has been, or will be, included in the assessable income of the debtor  in any income year; or

                     (c)  the forgiveness is effected under an Act relating to bankruptcy; or

                     (d)  the forgiveness is effected by will; or

                     (e)  the forgiveness is for reasons of natural love and affection; or

                      (f)  the debt is a * tax‑related liability or a civil penalty under Division 290 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ (about penalties for promoters and implementers of tax avoidance schemes).

Note:          If the forgiveness of your debt involved an arrangement which was entered into before 28 June 1996, see section 245‑10 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

##### <a id="245‑45"></a>245‑45  Application of operative rules if forgiveness involves an arrangement

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  the debtor and the creditor in relation to a debt enter into an * arrangement; and

                     (b)  under the arrangement, the debtor’s obligation to pay the debt is to cease at a particular future time; and

                     (c)  the cessation of the obligation is to occur without the debtor incurring any financial or other obligation (other than an obligation that, having regard to the debtor’s  circumstances, is of a nominal or insignificant amount or kind);

Subdivisions 245‑C to 245‑G apply as if the debt were * forgiven when the arrangement is entered into.

             (2)  If, after the arrangement is entered into, the debt is forgiven, the later forgiveness is disregarded for the purposes of those Subdivisions.

#### Subdivision 245‑C—Calculation of gross forgiven amount of a debt

#### Guide to Subdivision 245‑C

##### <a id="245‑48"></a>245‑48  What this Subdivision is about

* * *

The amount of forgiveness (called the gross forgiven amount) for the debtor reflects the loss that the creditor makes for tax purposes. It is worked out in 2 steps:

               (a)     the value of the debt when it was forgiven is worked out on the basis that you were solvent both then and when you incurred the debt; and

              (b)     the value of the debt is then offset by any consideration given for the forgiveness of the debt.

The difference between the value of the debt and the amount offset is the gross forgiven amount.

If the debt was owed by several debtors, the gross forgiven amount is divided between them equally _._

#### Working out the value of a debt

##### <a id="245‑50"></a>245‑50  Extent of forgiveness if consideration is given

                   If any consideration is paid or given in respect of the * forgiveness of a debt, the debt that is forgiven is:

                     (a)  the obligation that existed before the forgiveness to pay so much of the debt as is expressed, or is taken, to be forgiven; and

                     (b)  the obligation that existed before the forgiveness to pay any part of the debt to which paragraph (a) does not apply but which ceases to be payable as a result of the payment or giving of the consideration.

Example:    Daniel owes Samara $100\. Samara agrees to accept $60 in full payment of the debt.

                   If their agreement specifies that Samara forgives the whole debt in return for $60, paragraph (a) provides that the forgiven debt is $100.

                   If their agreement instead requires Daniel to repay $60 and specifies that Samara forgives the remaining $40, paragraph (a) would deal with the $40 and paragraph (b) would add the remaining $60, again producing a forgiven amount of $100.

                   In either case, the $60 Daniel pays is offset against the forgiven amount of $100 in working out the gross forgiven amount of the debt: see sections 245‑65 and 245‑75.

##### <a id="245‑55"></a>245‑55  General rule for working out the value  of a debt

             (1)  The  value  of your debt at the time (the **_forgiveness time_**) when it is * forgiven is the amount that would have been its * market value (considered as an asset of the creditor) at the forgiveness time, assuming that:

                     (a)  when you incurred the debt, you were able to pay all your debts (including that one) as and when they fell due; and

                     (b)  your capacity to pay the debt is the same at the forgiveness time as when you incurred it.

             (2)  However, the value of the debt at the forgiveness time is the sum of the following amounts, if that sum is less than the amount applicable under subsection (1):

                     (a)  what would have been the amount applicable under subsection (1) if there had been no change, from the time the debt was incurred until the forgiveness time, in any rate of interest, or rate of exchange between currencies, that affects the * market value of the debt;

                     (b)  each amount:

                              (i)  that you have deducted or can deduct as a result of the * forgiveness of the debt; and

                             (ii)  that is attributable to such a change.

             (3)  Paragraph (1)(a) does not apply to the debt if:

                     (a)  either:

                              (i)  the creditor was an Australian resident at the forgiveness time; or

                             (ii)  the * forgiveness of the debt was a * CGT event involving a * CGT asset that was * taxable Australian property; and

                     (b)  you and the creditor were not dealing with each other at * arm’s length in respect of you incurring the debt; and

                     (c)  the debt was not a * moneylending debt.

Note:          This subsection reduces your gross forgiven amount to reflect the reduction in the creditor’s loss on the forgiven debt under the capital gains tax regime.

             (4)  This section has effect subject to sections 245‑60 and 245‑61 (about non‑recourse and assigned debts).

##### <a id="245‑60"></a>245‑60  Special rule for working out the value of a non‑recourse debt

             (1)  The value  of a debt when it is * forgiven is the lesser of:

                     (a)  the amount of the debt outstanding at that time; and

                     (b)  the * market value at that time of the creditor’s rights mentioned in paragraph (2)(b).

             (2)  Subsection (1) applies to a debt if:

                     (a)  you incurred the debt directly in respect of financing:

                              (i)  the acquisition of property by you; or

                             (ii)  the construction or development of property by you;

                            (but not including the manufacture of goods); and

                     (b)  the creditor’s rights against you in the event of default in the payment of the debt or interest were, just before the debt was forgiven, limited to all or any of the following:

                              (i)  rights (including the right to money payable) in relation to all or any of the matters mentioned in subsection (3);

                             (ii)  rights in respect of a mortgage or other security over the property;

                            (iii)  rights arising out of any * arrangement relating to the financial obligations, in relation to the property, of the * end user of the property to you.

             (3)  For the purposes of subparagraph (2)(b)(i), the matters are as follows:

                     (a)  the property or the use of the property;

                     (b)  goods produced, supplied, carried, transmitted or delivered by means of the property;

                     (c)  services provided by means of the property;

                     (d)  the loss or * disposal of the whole or a part of the property or of your interest in the property.

##### <a id="245‑61"></a>245‑61  Special rule for working out the value of a previously assigned debt

                   If your debt has been assigned as mentioned in section 245‑36 and is later * forgiven by the new creditor, the value of that debt when it is later forgiven is:

                     (a)  if the debt was not a * moneylending debt and the creditor and the new creditor were not dealing with each other at * arm’s length in connection with the assignment—the * market value of the debt at the time of the assignment; or

                     (b)  in any other case—the sum of:

                              (i)  the amount or market value of the consideration (if any) you paid or gave, or are required to pay or give, to the creditor in respect of the assignment; and

                             (ii)  the amount or market value of the consideration (if any) the new creditor paid or gave in respect of the assignment.

#### Working out if an amount is offset against the value of the debt

##### <a id="245‑65"></a>245‑65  Amount offset against amount of debt

             (1)  The table explains how to work out the amount (if any) that is offset against the value of a debt when it is forgiven (calculated under section 245‑55, 245‑60 or 245‑61) in working out the * gross forgiven amount of the debt.

#### Subdivision 245‑D—Calculation of net forgiven amount of a debt

#### Guide to Subdivision 245‑D

##### <a id="245‑80"></a>245‑80  What this Subdivision is about

* * *

The net forgiven amount of a debt is worked out by subtracting, from the gross forgiven amount of the debt, any amount that this Act already takes into account for the debtor because the debt was forgiven (for example, if some part of the forgiven amount is treated as the debtor’s ordinary income).

If the debtor and creditor were companies under common ownership, they may agree to transfer some of the net forgiven amount from the debtor to the creditor. The creditor must apply that amount to reduce the capital loss or deduction it has because of the forgiveness.

#### Operative provisions

##### <a id="245‑85"></a>245‑85  Reduction of gross forgiven amount

             (1)  The * gross forgiven amount of your debt is reduced by the sum of the following amounts:

                     (a)  any amount that, under a provision of this Act other than this Division, has been, or will be, included in your assessable income for any income year as a result of the * forgiveness of the debt;

                     (b)  any amount by which, under a provision of this Act other than this Division, an amount you could otherwise have deducted for any income year has been, or will be, reduced as a result of the forgiveness of the debt (except a reduction under Division 727 (about indirect value shifting));

                     (c)  any amount by which the * cost base of any of your * CGT assets has been, or will be, reduced under Part 3‑1 or 3‑3 as a result of the forgiveness of the debt.

Note:          Paragraph (1)(c) does not cover a reduction under Division 727 (indirect value shifting) because that Division is not in Part 3‑1 or 3‑3.

             (2)  Subject to section 245‑90, the amount remaining after reducing the * gross forgiven amount under subsection (1) is the **_net forgiven amount_** of the debt.

##### <a id="245‑90"></a>245‑90  Agreement between companies under common ownership for creditor to forgo capital loss or deduction

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a debt owed by a company to another company is * forgiven; and

                     (b)  from the time when the debt was incurred until the time when the debt is forgiven, the companies were * under common ownership.

             (2)  If, apart from this subsection, the creditor would have made a * capital loss as a result of the * forgiveness of the debt:

                     (a)  the debtor and creditor may agree that the creditor is to forgo so much of the loss as is stated in the agreement and does not exceed the amount that would be the net forgiven amount of the debt apart from this section (the **_provisional net forgiven amount_** of the debt); and

                     (b)  if such an agreement is made:

                              (i)  the creditor’s capital loss is reduced by the agreed amount; and

                             (ii)  the provisional net forgiven amount of the debt is also reduced by the agreed amount; and

                            (iii)  the amount remaining after the reduction of the provisional net forgiven amount of the debt under subparagraph (ii) is the **_net forgiven amount_** of the debt.

             (3)  If, apart from this subsection, the creditor could deduct an amount in respect of the debt under section 8‑1 (about general deductions) or section 25‑35 (about bad debts) for the * forgiveness income year:

                     (a)  the debtor and creditor may agree that the creditor is to forgo so much of the deduction as is stated in the agreement and does not exceed the amount that would be the net forgiven amount of the debt apart from this section (the **_provisional net forgiven amount_** of the debt); and

                     (b)  if such an agreement is made:

                              (i)  the amount the creditor can deduct is reduced by the agreed amount; and

                             (ii)  the provisional net forgiven amount of the debt is also reduced by the agreed amount; and

#### Subdivision 245‑E—Application of net forgiven amounts

#### Guide to Subdivision 245‑E

##### <a id="245‑95"></a>245‑95  What this Subdivision is about

* * *

The total of the net forgiven amounts of all your debts forgiven in an income year is applied to reduce 4 classes of amounts that could otherwise reduce your taxable income in the same or a later income year. It is applied in the following order:

               (a)     to your tax losses from previous income years;

              (b)     to your net capital losses from previous income years;

               (c)     to the deductions you would otherwise get in the income year, or in a later income year, because of expenditure from a previous year (for example, the capital allowance deductions you would get for expenditure on acquiring a depreciating asset);

              (d)     to the cost bases of your CGT assets.

You can choose the order in which the net forgiven amounts reduce the amounts within each class.

If all the amounts in the 4 classes are reduced to nil, any remaining net forgiven amounts are disregarded.

Note:          If the asset to which the expenditure relates was disposed of, lost or destroyed before 28 June 1996 or the expenditure was recouped before 28 June 1996, see section 245‑10 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

             (2)  Expenditure is covered by this subsection if:

                     (a)  it was incurred in respect of an asset you * disposed of to an entity that you dealt with at * arm’s length in respect of the disposal; and

                     (b)  the disposal occurred during the * forgiveness income year before the * forgiveness of any debt owed by you, and the forgiveness resulted in a * net forgiven amount; and

                     (c)  no provision of this Act includes an amount in your assessable income, or allows you a deduction, as a result of the disposal.

##### <a id="245‑150"></a>245‑150  Allocation of remaining total net forgiven amount in respect of expenditures

             (1)  You may choose:

                     (a)  the order in which your expenditures are reduced; and

                     (b)  the amount applied in reduction of each of those expenditures;

so long as that the * total net forgiven amount remaining is applied, to the maximum extent possible, in reduction of your expenditures.

             (2)  If you do not make a choice for the purposes of subsection (1), the Commissioner may make the choice on your behalf in a reasonable way.

##### <a id="245‑155"></a>245‑155  How expenditure is reduced—straight line deductions

             (1)  This section applies in respect of the reduction under section 245‑145 of an expenditure of yours, if:

                     (a)  the amount that you could deduct, apart from this Subdivision, in respect of the expenditure is a percentage, fraction or proportion of an amount (the **_base amount_**); and

                     (b)  the base amount is worked out without regard to any amount or amounts you previously deducted in respect of that expenditure.

             (2)  The amount of the reduction of the expenditure must not exceed:

                     (a)  the base amount; less

                     (b)  the amount of that part of the expenditure in respect of which you have deducted (disregarding subsection (4)), or can deduct, an amount for any income year before the * forgiveness income year.

             (3)  For the purpose of working out your deductions for the * forgiveness income year and later income years, any amount that is applied in reduction of your expenditure is taken to reduce the base amount.

             (4)  You are taken to have deducted the amount of the reduction in respect of the expenditure:

                     (a)  before the * forgiveness income year; and

                     (b)  for the purposes of any provision of this Act that includes an amount in your assessable income or allows you a deduction:

                              (i)  because of the * disposal, loss or destruction of the asset in respect of which the expenditure was incurred; or

                             (ii)  because of the * recoupment of any of the expenditure; or

                            (iii)  because use of the asset for a particular purpose has been otherwise terminated; or

                            (iv)  because a * balancing adjustment event occurs for that asset.

             (5)  The amount of that part of the expenditure in respect of which you have deducted (disregarding subsection (4), or can deduct, an amount for all income years (including income years before the * forgiveness income year) must not exceed the base amount as reduced under subsection (3).

##### <a id="245‑157"></a>245‑157  How expenditure is reduced—diminishing balance deductions

                   Any amount applied in reduction under section 245‑145 of an expenditure of yours is taken to have been deducted by you in respect of the expenditure before the * forgiveness income year, if the amount you could deduct, apart from this Subdivision, in respect of the expenditure is a percentage, fraction or proportion of an amount that is worked out after taking into account any amount previously deducted by you in respect of the expenditure.

##### <a id="245‑160"></a>245‑160  Amount applied in reduction of expenditure included in assessable income in certain circumstances

                   If:

                     (a)  after the * forgiveness income year you * recoup an amount of expenditure that is subject to reduction under section 245‑145; and

                     (b)  as a result of the recoupment, this Act applies to disallow any amount you have deducted in respect of the expenditure;

an amount equal to the amount, or the sum of the amounts, applied under this Subdivision in reduction of the expenditure is included in your assessable income in the income year in which the expenditure is recouped.

#### Reduction of cost bases of assets

##### <a id="245‑175"></a>245‑175  Remaining total net forgiven amount is applied in reduction of cost bases of CGT assets

             (1)  The * total net forgiven amount (if any) remaining after being applied under sections 245‑115, 245‑130 and 245‑145 is applied, to the maximum extent possible, in reduction, in accordance with sections 245‑180 to 245‑190, of the * cost base and * reduced cost base of your * CGT assets.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply to the following * CGT assets:

                     (a)  a * pre‑CGT asset;

                     (b)  a CGT asset you * acquire after the start of the * forgiveness income year;

                     (c)  a * personal use asset;

                     (d)  a * dwelling that was your main residence at any time before the forgiveness income year;

                     (e)  goodwill;

                      (f)  a right of yours covered by section 118‑305 (which exempts from CGT certain rights relating to a superannuation fund or approved deposit fund);

                     (g)  a CGT asset that, throughout the period before the forgiveness income year when it was owned by you, was your * trading stock;

                     (h)  a CGT asset if:

                              (i)  expenditure by you (of a kind which is subject to reduction under section 245‑145) relates to the asset; and

                             (ii)  a * CGT event in relation to the asset would result in an amount being included in your assessable income, or in you being able to deduct an amount;

                      (i)  if you are a foreign resident at the beginning of the forgiveness income year—an asset of yours that is not * taxable Australian property.

##### <a id="245‑180"></a>245‑180  Allocation of remaining total net forgiven amount among relevant cost bases of CGT assets

             (1)  Subject to section 245‑185, you may choose:

                     (a)  your * CGT assets whose * cost base and * reduced cost base are subject to reduction under section 245‑175; and

                     (b)  the amount applied in reduction of the cost base and reduced cost base of each of those assets;

so long as the * total net forgiven amount remaining is applied, to the maximum extent possible, in reduction of the cost base and reduced cost base of such assets.

             (2)  If you do not make a choice for the purposes of subsection (1), the Commissioner may make the choice on your behalf in a reasonable way.

##### <a id="245‑185"></a>245‑185  Relevant cost bases of investments in associated entities are reduced last

                   If your * CGT assets that are subject to reduction under section 245‑175 include investments in, or in relation to, an * associate of yours (including * membership interests, or * debt interests, in your associate), the:

                     (a)  * cost base; and

                     (b)  * reduced cost base;

of those assets are not subject to reduction under section 245‑175 until the * total net forgiven amount (if any) remaining has been applied, to the maximum extent possible, in reduction of the cost bases of your other CGT assets.

##### <a id="245‑190"></a>245‑190  Reduction of the relevant cost bases of a CGT asset

             (1)  Subject to subsection (3), if you choose to apply an amount in reduction of the * cost base and * reduced cost base of a particular * CGT asset, the cost base and reduced cost base of the asset, as at any time on or after the beginning of the * forgiveness income year, are reduced by that amount.

             (2)  The reduction by a particular amount of the * cost base and * reduced cost base of a particular * CGT asset is, for the purpose of working out the amount by which the * total net forgiven amount remaining is applied, taken to be a reduction by the particular amount (and not by the sum of the amounts by which those cost bases are reduced).

             (3)  The maximum amount by which the * cost base and * reduced cost base of a * CGT asset may be reduced is the amount that, apart from sections 245‑175 to 245‑185, would be the reduced cost base of the asset calculated as if a * CGT event had happened to the asset:

                     (a)  subject to paragraph (b), on the first day of the * forgiveness income year; or

                     (b)  if, after the beginning of that income year, an event occurred that would cause the reduced cost base of the asset to be reduced—on the day on which the event occurred;

and the asset had been * disposed of at its * market value on the day concerned.

#### Unapplied total net forgiven amount

##### <a id="245‑195"></a>245‑195  No further consequences if there is any remaining unapplied total net forgiven amount

             (1)  If any part of the * total net forgiven amount remains after the application of that amount in making reductions under the preceding provisions of this Subdivision, the remaining part is disregarded.

             (2)  This section has effect subject to section 245‑215 (about partnerships and transferring the remaining part to the partners).

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00610/Html/82925b32-49c7-4645-9817-438bbfa73ec6_files/image004.gif)

                            where:

                            **_partner’s share of net income_** means the part of the net income of the partnership for the forgiveness income year that is included in the partner’s assessable income.

             (3)  If there is a * partnership loss in relation to the partnership in respect of the * forgiveness income year:

                     (a)  each partner is taken to have had a debt * forgiven during the forgiveness income year; and

                      (f)  if your debt is * forgiven—the date of the forgiveness and the amount offset under section 245‑65 (if any) in respect of the debt.

Note:          There is an administrative penalty if you do not keep or retain records as required by this section: see section 288‑25 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

#### Guide to Division 242

##### <a id="242‑1"></a>242‑1  What this Division is about

* * *

A luxury car is one whose market value exceeds the car limit set for a car’s capital allowance deductions by section 40‑230.

If the lessor of a luxury car is tax exempt, or taxed at a lower rate than the lessee, the lease could be structured to give both parties a better after‑tax outcome than if the lessee had bought the car. The lessee could fully deduct the lease payments, thereby avoiding the capital allowance limit for luxury cars, and the lessor would receive higher lease payments.

This Division removes the tax benefit for the lessee by putting both parties in the same position as if the lessor had sold the car to the lessee and lent the lessee the purchase price.

* * *

#### Subdivision 242‑A—Notional sale and loan

##### <a id="242‑5"></a>242‑5  What this Subdivision is about

* * *

A leased luxury car is treated for income tax purposes as if it had been sold by the lessor to the lessee for the car’s market value. The lessor is treated as having lent the lessee the money to buy the car, and the lease payments are treated as payments of the principal and interest on that notional loan.

242‑15      Notional sale and acquisition

242‑20      Consideration for notional sale, and cost, of car

242‑25      Notional loan by lessor to lessee

#### Operative provisions

##### <a id="242‑10"></a>242‑10  Application

             (1)  This Division applies to a * car that:

                     (a)  is leased (but not under a * short‑term hire agreement or a * hire purchase agreement) for consideration; and

                     (b)  was a * luxury car when the lessor first leased it; and

                     (c)  is not * trading stock of the lessee; and

                     (d)  is not a car covered by subsection 40‑230(2) (about cars modified to carry individuals with a disability).

             (2)  The provisions of this Division do not have effect for the purposes of Division 11A of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (about withholding tax on dividends, interest and royalties).

Note:          This subsection prevents interest on the notional loan that this Division creates being subject to withholding tax under Division 11A.

             (3)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), the question whether an agreement is a * short‑term hire agreement is determined on the basis that an employee or employer of an entity is an * associate of the entity.

Note:          Under the definition of **_short‑term hire agreement_** in subsection 995‑1(1), successive agreements for the hire of the same asset to an entity or its associates are not short‑term hire agreements if they result in substantial continuity of hiring.

##### <a id="242‑15"></a>242‑15  Notional sale and acquisition

             (1)  This Act has effect as if:

                     (a)  the * car had been disposed of (the **_notional sale_**) by the lessor to the lessee; and

                     (b)  the car had been acquired by the lessee;

at the start of the term of the lease.

Note:          This Act will apply as it would have if the lessor had actually disposed of the car to the lessee. For example, if the lessor had been deducting an amount for the car’s decline in value, the notional disposal will activate the balancing adjustment rules in Subdivision 40‑D because the lessor would be treated as no longer holding the car.

             (2)  This Act also has effect as if the lessee owns the * car until:

                     (a)  the lease (not including any extension or renewal of the lease) ends; or

                     (b)  the lessee enters into a sublease of the car and this Division applies to the car in relation to the sublease.

Note 1:       This means that the lessee (and not the lessor) may be able to deduct amounts for the decline in value of the car under Division 40.

Note 2:       The lessee will be treated as continuing to own the car until the end of any extension or renewal: see section 242‑80.

##### <a id="242‑20"></a>242‑20  Consideration for notional sale, and cost, of car

             (1)  The consideration for the notional sale by the lessor, and the first element of the * cost of the * car for the lessee, are the car’s * market value at the start of the term of the lease.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  the lease is a sublease; and

                     (b)  the lessee is one or more of the following:

                              (i)  an * associate of the lessor;

                             (ii)  an employer of the lessor;

                            (iii)  an employee of the lessor;

the first element of the * cost of the * car to the lessee is the sum of:

                     (c)  the amount that would have been the car’s * adjustable value at the start of the term of the lease for the purposes of applying this Act to the lessor if the lessor were not taken under this Division to have disposed of the car; and

                     (d)  any amount that is included in the lessor’s assessable income under section 40‑285 as a balancing adjustment because the lessor is treated as having disposed of the car.

Note:          Section 242‑20 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_ extends paragraph (2)(d) to cover amounts included in assessable income under former provisions corresponding to section 40‑285.

##### <a id="242‑25"></a>242‑25  Notional loan by lessor to lessee

             (1)  This Act has effect as if, on the grant of the lease, the lessor had made a loan (the **_notional loan_**) to the lessee:

                     (a)  for a period equal to the term of the lease (not including the term of any extension or renewal); and

                     (b)  of an amount (the **_notional loan principal_**) equal to the consideration for the notional sale of the * car less any amount paid, or credited by the lessor as having been paid, by the lessee to the lessor, at or before the start of the term of the lease, for the first element of the * cost of the car to the lessee; and

                     (c)  subject to payment of interest.

Note:          There is a further notional loan if the lease is extended or renewed: see section 242‑80.

             (2)  This Act has effect as if the notional loan principal were repaid, and the interest were paid, by the making of the * luxury car lease payments.

#### Subdivision 242‑B—Amount to be included in lessor’s assessable income

#### Guide to Subdivision 242‑B

##### <a id="242‑30"></a>242‑30  What this Subdivision is about

* * *

The lessor’s assessable income includes the interest on the notional loan.

The lease payments to the lessor are non‑assessable non‑exempt income.

                   Note:             If the consideration for a notional sale of a car exceeds the adjustable value of the car to the lessor, the excess will be included in the lessor’s assessable income under section 40‑285.

                                        There would be a similar result if the lessor is treated as having reacquired the car and then sells the car for more than the cost of reacquisition.

Accrual amounts

             (1)  The lessor’s assessable income for an income year includes:

                     (a)  if a * luxury car lease payment period for the lease of a * car occurs wholly during that income year—the amount (an **_accrual amount_**) worked out under subsection (2) for that luxury car lease payment period; and

                     (b)  if part of a luxury car lease payment period for the lease of a car occurs during that income year—so much of the amount (also an **_accrual amount_**) worked out under subsection (2) for that luxury car lease payment period as may appropriately be related to that income year in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

             (2)  The amount is:

where:

                    <a name="implicit-interest-rate"></a>**_implicit interest rate_** is the implicit interest rate under the lease for the * luxury car lease payment period, taking into account the payments to be made by the lessee under the lease and any * termination amounts.

                    <a name="outstanding-notion-loan-princip-start-leas-payment-period"></a>**_outstanding notional loan principal at the start of the lease payment period_** is:

                     (a)  the sum of the notional loan principal and the accrual amounts for earlier * luxury car lease payment periods; less

                     (b)  the sum of the * luxury car lease payments that the lessee was required to make before the start of the relevant luxury car lease payment period.

Excessive periods

             (3)  If, apart from this subsection, a * luxury car lease payment period for the lease of a * car would exceed 6 months, this Division applies as if each of the following were a separate luxury car lease payment period:

                     (a)  the first 6 months of the original luxury car lease payment period;

                     (b)  if the original luxury car lease payment period was not longer than 12 months—the remaining part of the original luxury car lease payment period;

                     (c)  if the original luxury car lease payment period was longer than 12 months—each successive 6 month period in the original luxury car lease payment period;

                     (d)  the period (if any) after the end of the last of the periods to which paragraph (c) applies.

##### <a id="242‑40"></a>242‑40  Treatment of lease payments

             (1)  The * luxury car lease payments under the lease are not assessable income and are not * exempt income of the lessor.

Note:          Those lease payments are instead taken into account in calculating accrual amounts that are included in the lessor’s assessable income under section 242‑35.

             (2)  In working out the amounts the lessor can deduct for any income year, ignore the fact that subsection (1) makes the * luxury car lease payments * non‑assessable non‑exempt income.

Note:          This allows the lessor to continue to deduct amounts related to earning the lease payments (such as interest on an amount the lessor borrowed to acquire the car), just as if the amounts related to earning interest on the notional loan to the lessee.

             (1)  If a * luxury car lease payment period for the lease of a * car occurs wholly during an income year of the lessee, the lessee can deduct the accrual amount for that period for that income year.

Note 1:       If a luxury car lease payment period would otherwise be longer than 6 months, subsection 242‑35(3) divides the original period into periods of no longer than 6 months.

Note 2:       For **_accrual amount_**, see subsection 242‑35(1).

             (2)  If part of a * luxury car lease payment period for the lease of a * car occurs during an income year of the lessee, the lessee can deduct so much of the accrual amount for that period as may appropriately be related to that income year in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

             (3)  The lessee can deduct an accrual amount, or part of an accrual amount, for a * luxury car lease payment period under subsection (1) or (2) for an income year only to the extent that the lessee could deduct the luxury car lease payments made for that year apart from this Division.

##### <a id="242‑55"></a>242‑55  Lease payments not deductible

                   The lessee cannot deduct the * luxury car lease payments that the lessee makes under the lease for any income year.

Note:          Those payments are instead taken into account in calculating accrual amounts that are deductible under section 242‑50.

#### Subdivision 242‑D—Adjustments if total amount assessed to lessor differs from amount of interest

#### Guide to Subdivision 242‑D

##### <a id="242‑60"></a>242‑60  What this Subdivision is about

* * *

When a luxury car lease is extended, renewed or ends, the overall nominal gain to the lessor is compared to the nominal interest so far paid under the lease.

If the overall nominal gain is greater, the difference is assessable income of the lessor, and the lessee may be able to deduct it.

If the overall nominal gain is less, the lessor can deduct the difference, which may also be assessable income of the lessee.

This process ensures that the right amount has been taxed over the term of the lease.

#### Operative provisions

##### <a id="242‑65"></a>242‑65  Adjustments for lessor

             (1)  This section applies at the following times:

                     (a)  if the term of the lease is extended—when the extension takes effect;

                     (b)  if the lease is renewed—when the renewal takes effect;

                     (c)  when the lease (including any extension or renewal of the lease) ends.

             (2)  If the sum of all amounts (whether * luxury car lease payments, a * termination amount or any other payments) that were paid or payable to the lessor under the lease exceeds the amount worked out under subsection (4), the excess is included in the lessor’s assessable income for the income year in which the relevant time occurs.

Note:          Subsection 242‑80(8) treats the amount of a notional loan that is taken to be made by an extended or renewed lease to be a termination amount paid under the previous lease.

             (3)  If the sum of all amounts (whether * luxury car lease payments, a * termination amount or any other payments) that were paid or payable to the lessor under the lease is less than the amount worked out under subsection (4), the lessor can deduct the difference for the income year in which the relevant time occurs.

             (4)  The amount for the purposes of subsections (2) and (3) is the sum of:

                     (a)  the notional loan principal; and

                     (b)  the sum of the accrual amounts that have been or are to be included in the lessor’s assessable income of any income year.

Note:          For **_accrual amount_**, see subsection 242‑35(1).

##### <a id="242‑70"></a>242‑70  Adjustments for lessee

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  an amount is included in the lessor’s assessable income for an income year under subsection 242‑65(2); or

                     (b)  an amount would have been so included if the lessor had been subject to tax on assessable income;

the lessee can deduct a corresponding amount for the same income year.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  the lessor can deduct an amount for an income year under subsection 242‑65(3); or

                     (b)  the lessor could have deducted an amount under that subsection if the lessor had been subject to tax on assessable income;

a corresponding amount is included in the lessee’s assessable income for the same income year.

             (3)  The lessee cannot deduct an amount for any income year under subsection (1), and an amount is not included in the lessee’s assessable income of any income year under subsection (2), except to the extent (if any) that the lessee could deduct the * luxury car lease payments made apart from this Division.

#### Subdivision 242‑E—Extension, renewal and final ending of the lease

#### Guide to Subdivision 242‑E

##### <a id="242‑75"></a>242‑75  What this Subdivision is about

* * *

When a luxury car lease ends (whether it expires or is terminated before its expiry date), one of 3 things will happen:

               (a)     if the lease is extended or renewed—the original notional loan is treated as having been repaid and the lessor is treated as having made a new loan to the lessee; or

              (b)     if the lessee acquires the car from the lessor—the lessee continues to own the car for tax purposes, and the actual transfer and the termination payment to acquire the car are ignored for tax purposes; or

               (c)     if the lessee’s right to use the car ends—the lessee is treated as having sold the car back to the lessor.

In each case, there may be adjustments under Subdivision 242‑D to ensure that the right amount has been taxed over the term of the lease.

#### Operative provisions

##### <a id="242‑80"></a>242‑80  What happens if the term of the lease is extended or the lease is renewed

             (1)  The rules in this section have effect if, after the end of the lease (or the end of any extension of the lease term or renewal of the lease), the lessee continues to have the * right to use the * car because the term of the lease is extended (or further extended) or the lease is renewed (or further renewed).

             (2)  This Act has effect as if the lessee continued to be the owner of the * car until the end of the lease as extended or renewed.

             (3)  However, this Act has effect as if the lessee stopped being the owner of the * car if:

                     (a)  the lessee enters into a sublease in respect of the car; and

                     (b)  this Division applies to the car in respect of that sublease.

             (4)  This Act has effect as if the notional loan that arose because of the grant of the lease, or because of the previous extension or renewal, had been repaid.

Note:          Also, Subdivision 242‑D (about balancing adjustments) will apply to the ending, extension or renewal.

             (5)  This Act has effect as if, on the grant of the extension or renewal, the lessor had made a new loan (the **_notional loan_**) to the lessee:

                     (a)  for the period of the extension of the term of the lease or the period of the renewed lease, as the case may be; and

                     (b)  of an amount (the **_notional loan principal_**) equal to the * car’s * market value when the extension or renewal is granted; and

                     (c)  subject to the payment of interest.

             (6)  This Act has effect as if the notional loan principal were repaid, and the interest were paid, by the making of the * luxury car lease payments under the lease as extended or renewed (or further extended or renewed).

             (7)  In determining whether subsection (1) applies to the lessee, disregard any period after the end of the lease (or the end of any extension of the lease term or renewal of the lease) and before the extension or renewal (or further extension or renewal) is granted and during which the lessee did not have the * right to use the * car if the extension or renewal (or further extension or renewal):

                     (a)  has effect from the time immediately after the end of that term, extension or renewal; or

                     (b)  otherwise results in substantial continuity of the leasing of the car to the lessee.

             (8)  The amount of the notional loan is treated, for the purposes of section 242‑65 (about the lessor’s balancing adjustments), as a * termination amount paid to the lessor under the lease or under the previous extension or renewal.

##### <a id="242‑85"></a>242‑85  What happens if an amount is paid by the lessee to acquire the car

                   If, at the end of the lease or, if it is extended or renewed, at the end of any extension or renewal (the **_end time_**), an amount is paid to the lessor by, or on behalf of, the lessee to acquire the * car, the following provisions have effect:

                     (a)  the amount paid is not included in the lessor’s assessable income;

                     (b)  the lessee cannot deduct the payment;

                     (c)  this Act has effect as if:

                              (i)  the lessee continued to be the owner of the car until the lessee disposes of it; and

                             (ii)  the transfer to the lessee of legal title to the car were not a disposal of the car by the lessor.

##### <a id="242‑90"></a>242‑90  What happens if the lessee stops having the right to use the car

             (1)  If, at the end time:

                     (a)  the lessee stops having the * right to use the * car; and

                     (b)  no amount is paid to the lessor by, or on behalf of, the lessee to acquire the car;

the following provisions have effect.

Note:          For **_end time_**, see section 242‑85.

             (2)  This Act has effect as if the * car:

                     (a)  were sold by the lessee to the lessor; and

                     (b)  were acquired by the lessor;

at the end time.

             (3)  The consideration for the sale of the * car by the lessee, and the first element of the * cost of the car to the lessor, are the * market value of the car at the end time.

             (4)  If the * car is afterwards acquired by an * associate of the lessee or an employer or employee of the lessee, this Act has effect as if the first element of the * cost of the car as a * depreciating asset were the lesser of:

                     (a)  the sum of:

                              (i)  the amount that would have been the * adjustable value of the car at that time for the purposes of applying this Act to the lessee if the lessee were not treated under this Division as having disposed of the car; and

                             (ii)  any amount that is included in the lessee’s assessable income under section 40‑285 as a balancing adjustment  because the lessee is treated as having disposed of the car; and

                     (b)  the cost of the acquisition of the car by the associate, employer or employee.

Note:          Section 242‑20 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_ extends subparagraph (a)(ii) to cover amounts included in assessable income under former provisions corresponding to section 40‑285.

             (5)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), the lessee is not treated as having stopped to have the * right to use the * car if:

                     (a)  the term of the lease is extended (or further extended), or the lease is renewed (or further renewed), at a time after, but not immediately after, the end of that term, extension or renewal with effect from the time immediately after that end; or

                     (b)  the extension or renewal (or further extension or renewal) otherwise results in substantial continuity of the leasing of the car to the lessee.

##### <a id="242‑10"></a>242‑10  Application

             (1)  Division 242 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (the **_new Division_**) applies to assessments for the 2010‑11 income year and later years.

             (2)  However, the new Division does not apply to a lease of a car if the lease was granted on or before 7.30 pm, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 20 August 1996 unless the lease was extended after that time (whether the extension took effect before or after that time).

             (3)  The definition of **_luxury car_** in subsection 995‑1(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies to a reduction under former section 57AF of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ or former section 42‑80 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ in the same way as it applies to a reduction under section 40‑230 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

* * *

You can deduct a farm management deposit you make, if:

               (a)     you are an individual carrying on a primary production business (including a primary production business you carry on as a partner in a partnership or as a beneficiary of a trust); and

              (b)     you hold the deposit for at least 12 months; and

               (c)     you meet some other tests.

The amount of the deposit withdrawn is included in your assessable income in the income year in which it is repaid. Special rules apply if the deposit is repaid in exceptional circumstances.

Farm management deposits allow you to carry over income from years of good cash flow and to draw down on that income in years when you need the cash. This enables you to defer the income tax on your taxable primary production income from the income year in which you make the deposit until the income year in which the deposit is repaid.

                   Note:             An FMD provider must, every quarter, give certain information to the Agriculture Secretary about farm management deposits: see section 398‑5 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

##### <a id="393‑5"></a>393‑5  Deduction for making farm management deposit

Entitlement to deduction

             (1)  You can deduct the amount of a * farm management deposit for an income year if:

                     (a)  you are the * owner of the deposit; and

                     (b)  the deposit is made at a time during the year when you are an individual carrying on a * primary production business in Australia; and

                     (c)  if during the year, at a time after the deposit was made, you stopped carrying on a primary production business in Australia—you started carrying on such a business again within 120 days (whether or not during the year); and

                     (d)  your * taxable non‑primary production income for the year is not more than $65,000; and

                     (e)  you do not die or become bankrupt during the year.

Note 1:       This section does not apply if a deposit is reinvested, the term of a deposit is extended, or a deposit is transferred at the depositor’s request: see section 393‑15.

Note 2:       This Division applies to certain partners and beneficiaries as if they were individuals who carried on a primary production business: see subsections 393‑25(2) and (3).

Sum of deductions not to exceed taxable primary production income

             (2)  The sum of the deductions that you would otherwise be entitled to under this section for * farm management deposits made in the income year must _not_ exceed your * taxable primary production income for the income year.

Amounts to be deducted in order of deposits

             (3)  If you are entitled to deduct amounts in respect of 2 or more deposits, deduct the amounts in the order in which the deposits were made (until you reach the limit imposed by subsection (2)).

##### <a id="393‑10"></a>393‑10  Assessability on repayment of deposit

Amount assessable

             (1)  Your assessable income for an income year includes the amount worked out using the following formula, if:

                     (a)  you are the * owner of a * farm management deposit; and

                     (b)  the deposit is repaid in full or in part in the year; and

                     (c)  the amount worked out using the formula is greater than nil:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00610/Html/82925b32-49c7-4645-9817-438bbfa73ec6_files/image007.gif)

Note 1:       This subsection does not apply if the deposit is reinvested, the term of the deposit is extended, or the deposit is transferred at the depositor’s request: see section 393‑15.

Note 2:       In a case where not all of the deposit is deductible under section 393‑5, repayment of the non‑deductible amount can take place without the amount being assessable. Once that amount is repaid, the remainder is assessable when it is repaid, so that the deduction is recouped.

Example:    Matt makes a farm management deposit of $120,000 on 1 April 2011\. His taxable primary production income for the 2010—11 income year is $50,000; therefore, the deposit is only partly deductible in the year because it exceeds his taxable primary production income. Matt makes the following withdrawals from the deposit: $45,000 on 1 May 2013, $40,000 on 1 March 2014 and $35,000 on 1 September 2015.

                   The unrecouped FMD deduction immediately before the first repayment of $45,000 is $50,000\. No amount is included in his assessable income for the 2012‑2013 income year because the difference between the unrecouped FMD deduction ($50,000) and the amount of the deposit remaining after the repayment ($75,000) is less than nil.

                   The unrecouped FMD deduction immediately before the second repayment of $40,000 is $50,000\. $15,000 is included in Matt’s assessable income for the 2013‑2014 income year because the difference between the unrecouped FMD deduction ($50,000) and the amount of the deposit remaining after the second repayment ($35,000) is $15,000, which is greater than nil.

                   The unrecouped FMD deduction immediately before the third repayment of $35,000 is $35,000; that is, $50,000 less $15,000\. $35,000 is included in Matt’s assessable income for the 2015‑2016 income year; that is, the difference between the unrecouped FMD deduction ($35,000) and the amount of the deposit remaining after the third repayment ($0).

Unrecouped FMD deduction

             (2)  The **_unrecouped FMD deduction_** in respect of a * farm management deposit at a particular time is:

                     (a)  if no part of the deposit has been repaid before that time—the amount of the deduction under section 393‑5 for making the deposit; or

                     (b)  if one or more parts of the deposit have been repaid before that time—the unrecouped FMD deduction in respect of the deposit just before the most recent such repayment, reduced by any amount included in the * owner’s assessable income under this section as a result of that repayment.

Example:    Mia makes a deposit of $3,000, all of which is deductible. The deposit’s unrecouped FMD deduction just before a first repayment of $1,000 is the amount of the deduction (that is, $3,000—see paragraph (2)(a)). The deposit’s unrecouped FMD deduction just before a second repayment is $2,000 (that is, according to paragraph (2)(b), the unrecouped FMD deduction immediately before the first repayment ($3,000) reduced by the $1,000 included in Mia’s assessable income as a result of the first repayment).

Note 1:       If the deposit was originally an income equalisation deposit, see section 393‑10 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

Note 2:       Section 393‑55 affects the unrecouped FMD deduction of a new deposit linked to an old deposit affected by Division 2AA (Financial claims scheme for account‑holders with insolvent ADIs) of Part II of the _Banking Act 1959_.

Application of Division to transfer, reinvestment or other dealing

             (3)  This Division applies to a transfer, reinvestment or other dealing with a * farm management deposit as if it were a repayment of the deposit, if:

                     (a)  you are the depositor; and

                     (b)  the transfer, reinvestment or other dealing is on your behalf or at your request.

Note:          Section 393‑15 modifies the application of the deduction, assessment and 12 month rules to certain transfers, reinvestments and other dealings.

Deemed repayment because of death, bankruptcy etc.

             (4)  This section applies as if a * farm management deposit had been repaid when it became repayable, rather than when it is actually repaid, if the deposit became repayable because of the requirement contained in the relevant agreement as set out in item 11 of the table in section 393‑35 (death, bankruptcy etc.).

Note 1:       This means that the amount of the deposit is included in your assessable income for the income year when the death, bankruptcy etc. occurs, rather than for any later year in which the deposit might be repaid.

Note 2:       This also means that, under subsection 45‑120(5) in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ (about Pay as you go (PAYG) instalments), the amount of the deposit is included in your instalment income for the period in which the death, bankruptcy etc. occurs.

                   However, under section 12‑140 in that Schedule, an amount may also be required to be withheld from the actual payment if you do not quote your tax file number or ABN to the relevant FMD provider.

Note 3:       Section 393‑60 of this Act may limit the operation of subsection (4) if the farm management deposit is with an ADI that becomes a declared ADI under Division 2AA (Financial claims scheme for account‑holders with insolvent ADIs) of Part II of the _Banking Act 1959_.

##### <a id="393‑15"></a>393‑15  Transactions to which the deduction, assessment and 12 month rules have modified application

             (1)  The provisions mentioned in subsection (2) do not apply in relation to the following transactions:

                     (a)  the immediate reinvestment of a * farm management deposit as a farm management deposit with the same * FMD provider;

                     (b)  the extension of the term of a farm management deposit (even if other terms such as those relating to interest payable are also varied);

                     (c)  the transfer of a farm management deposit in accordance with a requirement of the relevant agreement as set out in item 13 of the table in section 393‑35 (which allows for transfers of deposits at the request of the depositor).

Note:          This means that these transactions:

(a)           will not result in assessable income for the owner; and

(b)           will not give rise to a deduction; and

(c)           will not, if the transaction occurs within 12 months after the end of the day the deposit is made, result in the deposit losing its status as a farm management deposit.

             (2)  The provisions are:

                     (a)  section 393‑5 (about deductions for making a farm management deposit); and

                     (b)  subsection 393‑10(1) (about assessability of the repayment of a farm management deposit); and

                     (c)  subsections 393‑40(1) and (2) (about repayment of a farm management deposit within the first 12 months); and

                     (d)  subsections 393‑40(3) and (4) (about repayment of a farm management deposit in exceptional circumstances).

             (3)  For the purposes of working out the * unrecouped FMD deduction for a deposit that is subject to a transaction mentioned in subsection (1), the transaction does not cause the deposit to be a different deposit.

Note:          This ensures that the unrecouped FMD deduction (which affects how much income tax is assessed in the event of a repayment) equals the deduction for the original deposit, less any amount included in your assessable income because of a previous repayment of the deposit.

##### <a id="393‑20"></a>393‑20  Farm management deposits

Meaning of **farm management deposit**

             (1)  A deposit with an * FMD provider is a **_farm management deposit_** if:

                     (a)  the depositor applies to make the deposit in accordance with subsection (2); and

                     (b)  the deposit is made under an agreement between the FMD provider and the depositor that:

                              (i)  describes the deposit as a farm management deposit; and

                             (ii)  at all times while the deposit is with the FMD provider, contains requirements to the effect set out in the table in section 393‑35.

The agreement may also contain additional requirements that are not inconsistent with those set out in that table.

Depositor to provide information in application form

             (2)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), the depositor must apply to the * FMD provider to make the deposit by completing and signing a form that:

                     (a)  permits the depositor to state the * owner’s * tax file number in the form; and

                     (b)  requires the depositor to provide any other information required by regulations for the purposes of this paragraph; and

                     (c)  contains any statements, required by regulations for the purposes of this paragraph, that are to be read by the depositor when completing the form.

Note 1:       A depositor who makes a false or misleading statement in such a form commits an offence against section 8K or 8N of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

Note 2:       If the owner does not quote his or her tax file number or ABN to the FMD provider, the Pay as you go (PAYG) withholding required under section 12‑140 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ from a repayment of the deposit is at the highest marginal tax rate.

Note 3:       Division 4A of Part VA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ sets out rules for quoting tax file numbers in connection with farm management deposits.

Meaning of **FMD provider**

             (3)  In this Act:

                    <a name="fmd-provid"></a>**_FMD provider_** means an entity that:

                     (a)  is an * ADI; or

                     (b)  carries on in Australia the * business of banking, so long as the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory guarantees the repayment of any deposit taken in the course of that business; or

                     (c)  carries on in Australia a business that consists of or includes taking money on deposit, so long as the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory guarantees the repayment of any deposit taken in the course of that business.

##### <a id="393‑25"></a>393‑25  Owners of farm management deposits

Meaning of **owner**

             (1)  The **_owner_** of a * farm management deposit is:

                     (a)  if paragraph (b) does not apply—the individual who made or is making the deposit; or

                     (b)  in the case of a deposit made or being made by the trustee of a trust on behalf of a beneficiary who is an individual—the beneficiary.

Primary production businesses carried on by partnerships and trusts

             (2)  This Division applies to you as if you were an individual who is carrying on a * primary production business that is actually carried on by a partnership, if you are an individual who is a partner in the partnership.

             (3)  This Division, and section 97A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (about beneficiaries who are owners of farm management deposits), apply to you as if you were an individual who is carrying on a * primary production business that is actually carried on by a trustee, if you are an individual who is a beneficiary presently entitled to a share of the income of the trust.

Application of Division to beneficiary no longer under legal disability

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  a * farm management deposit was made by a trustee on behalf of a beneficiary of a trust; and

                     (b)  the beneficiary was under a legal disability when the deposit was made; and

                     (c)  the beneficiary is no longer under a legal disability;

then this Division, and Division 4A of Part VA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, apply as if the beneficiary had made the deposit.

Note:          Division 4A of Part VA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ is about quotation of tax file numbers in connection with farm management deposits.

##### <a id="393‑30"></a>393‑30  Effect of contravening requirements

             (1)  A deposit is not a **_farm management deposit_** if, when the deposit was accepted, a requirement contained in the relevant agreement as set out in items 1 to 6 of the table in section 393‑35 was contravened.

             (2)  A deposit is not, and is taken never to have been, a **_farm management deposit_** if a requirement contained in the relevant agreement as set out in items 7 to 9 of the table in section 393‑35 is contravened at any time in relation to the deposit.

             (3)  So much of a deposit as causes a requirement contained in the relevant agreement as set out in item 10 of the table in section 393‑35 to be contravened is not a **_farm management deposit_**.

##### <a id="393‑35"></a>393‑35  Requirements of agreement for a farm management deposit

                   An agreement mentioned in paragraph 393‑20(1)(b) must contain requirements to the effect of those set out in the following table:

##### <a id="393‑40"></a>393‑40  Repayment of deposit within first 12 months

Partial repayment within first 12 months

             (1)  Any part of a deposit repaid within 12 months after the end of the day the deposit is made is not, and is taken never to have been, part of a **_farm management deposit_**.

Note 1:       A repayment covered by subsection (3) or (5) is disregarded in applying this subsection. The normal rules in sections 393‑5 (about deductions for making a farm management deposit) and 393‑10 (about assessability of the repayment of a farm management deposit) apply instead.

Deposit not to be reduced to less than $1,000 within first 12 months

             (2)  A deposit is not, and is taken never to have been, a **_farm management deposit_** if the amount of the deposit is reduced to less than $1,000 because of one or more repayments within 12 months after the end of the day the deposit is made.

Note 1:       A repayment covered by subsection (3) or (5) is disregarded in applying this subsection.

Note 2:       This subsection does not apply if a deposit is reinvested, the term of a deposit is extended, or a deposit is transferred at the depositor’s request: see section 393‑15.

Repayment in exceptional circumstances

             (3)  Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply to a repayment of the whole or a part of a * farm management deposit if all of the following circumstances are satisfied:

                     (a)  the repayment is made in the income year following the income year in which the deposit is made with the * FMD provider;

                     (b)  at the time of the repayment, the * owner of the deposit is eligible for the issue of an exceptional circumstances certificate (within the meaning of subsection 8A(2) of the _Farm Household Support Act 1992_) that relates to a * primary production business of that owner;

                     (c)  by the end of 3 months after the end of the income year in which the repayment is made, such an exceptional circumstances certificate is issued in respect of that owner;

                     (d)  a declaration of exceptional circumstances (as referred to in paragraph 8(c) of the _Rural Adjustment Act 1992_) was not in force in relation to that primary production business when the deposit was made.

             (4)  Any later deposit that is made by, or on behalf of, that * owner in the income year in which the repayment is made is not, and is taken never to have been, a **_farm management deposit_**.

Repayment in the case of death, bankruptcy or ceasing to carry on a primary production business

             (5)  Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply to a repayment of a * farm management deposit because of the requirement contained in the relevant agreement as set out in item 11 of the table in section 393‑35 (death, bankruptcy etc.).

Certain transactions do not affect the day the deposit was made

             (6)  Subsections (1) to (4) apply as if a * farm management deposit that:

                     (a)  is made as a result of a transaction mentioned in subsection 393‑15(1) (about reinvesting a deposit, extending the term of a deposit and transferring a deposit at the depositor’s request); or

                     (b)  is affected by such a transaction;

were made on the day on which the original deposit was made.

Example:    A farm management deposit is made on 1 July 2010 for a term of 6 months, but is extended in December 2010 for another 6 months. For the purposes of subsections (1) to (4), the day the extended deposit was made remains as 1 July 2010.

Note:          Section 393‑40 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_ provides for a special rule for deposits transferred under the repealed _Loan (Income Equalization Deposits) Act 1976_.

#### Operative provisions

##### <a id="393‑55"></a>393‑55  Farm management deposits arising from farm management deposits with ADIs subject to financial claims scheme

Application

             (1)  This section applies if an entitlement arises under Division 2AA (Financial claims scheme for account‑holders with insolvent ADIs) of Part II of the _Banking Act 1959_ in connection with an account containing a * farm management deposit (the **_old deposit_**) with an * ADI (the **_old ADI_**) and either:

                     (a)  an amount (the **_new deposit_**) is deposited into either of the following to meet, in whole or part, so much of the entitlement as relates to the old deposit:

                              (i)  an existing account for a farm management deposit;

                             (ii)  an account established under section 16AH of that Act for the purposes of meeting (in whole or part) the entitlement; or

                     (b)  an amount (also the **_new deposit_**) is deposited by a liquidator of the old ADI into either of the following as so much of a distribution from the liquidation of the old ADI as relates to the old deposit:

                              (i)  an existing account for a farm management deposit;

                             (ii)  an account established under section 16AR of that Act for the payment of the distribution.

Note:          If an amount is deposited in connection with an account with the old ADI containing 2 or more old deposits, the amount is to be apportioned between each old deposit, so that so much of the amount as is attributable to a particular old deposit is regarded as a distinct new deposit relating to that old deposit.

New deposit is a farm management deposit

             (2)  This Division (except this section) applies to the new deposit as if the new deposit were a transfer of the old deposit in accordance with a requirement contained in the relevant agreement for the old deposit as set out in item 13 of the table in section 393‑35 (which allows for transfers of deposits at the request of the depositor). To avoid doubt, this Division applies in that way as if the amount transferred were the amount of the new deposit, even if that is more or less than the amount of the old deposit.

Note 1:       The effects of this include the following:

(a)           section 393‑5 (about deductions for making a farm management deposit) does not apply in relation to the making of the new deposit (see paragraphs 393‑15(1)(c) and (2)(a));

(b)           subsection 393‑10(1) (about assessability of the repayment of a farm management deposit) can only apply to the extent of any difference between the amount transferred and the amount of the old deposit (see paragraphs 393‑15(1)(c) and (2)(b));

(c)           subsections 393‑40(1), (2) and (4) (about repayment of a farm management deposit within the first 12 months) can only apply to the extent of any difference between the amount transferred and the amount of the old deposit (see paragraphs 393‑15(1)(c) and (2)(c) and (d));

(d)           the day the old deposit was made, for the purposes of subsections 393‑40(1) and (2) (about repayment of a farm management deposit within the first 12 months) and (3) and (4) (about repayment in exceptional circumstances), is maintained for the new deposit (see subsection 393‑40(6)).

Note 2:       Also, the unrecouped FMD deduction in respect of the new deposit is the same as the unrecouped FMD deduction in respect of the old deposit (see subsection 393‑15(3)), unless subsection (6) or (7) of this section applies because the new deposit is less than the old deposit.

             (3)  In determining whether either of the following is a * farm management deposit, disregard a requirement contained in an agreement as set out in item 4 of the table in section 393‑35 (requiring the deposit to be $1,000 or more):

                     (a)  the new deposit;

                     (b)  a deposit made later directly by the transfer of the new deposit in accordance with a requirement of the relevant agreement for the new deposit as mentioned in item 13 of that table.

             (4)  In determining whether a deposit made after the entitlement arises is a * farm management deposit, disregard the old deposit when determining whether a requirement contained in an agreement as set out in item 5 of the table in section 393‑35 (prohibiting farm management deposits with other FMD providers) has been complied with.

Note:          Subsection (4) means that a deposit made with a financial institution other than the old ADI after the entitlement arises can be a farm management deposit (despite subsection 393‑30(1)) even though the owner of the deposit still has the old deposit with the old ADI.

             (5)  A requirement contained in an agreement as set out in item 5 of the table in section 393‑35 does not apply to the new deposit to prevent it from being a * farm management deposit.

Note:          Subsections (4) and (5) mean that, despite subsection 393‑30(1) (which prevents a deposit, or part of a deposit, from being a farm management deposit if certain requirements are not met), the fact that you are the owner of both the new deposit with one financial institution and the old deposit with another financial institution does not prevent the new deposit from being a farm management deposit.

Unrecouped FMD deduction for new deposit less than old deposit

             (6)  Despite subsection (2) and subsection 393‑15(3), if the new deposit is less than the old deposit at the time (the **_declaration time_**) the old ADI became a declared ADI under the _Banking Act 1959_, the **_unrecouped FMD deduction_** in respect of the new deposit is the amount worked out using the following formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00610/Html/82925b32-49c7-4645-9817-438bbfa73ec6_files/image008.gif)

Note:          The new deposit could be less than the old deposit if the entitlement is paid in instalments (each of which will be a separate new deposit).

             (7)  However, if the amount worked out under subsection (6) is more than the difference (if any) between:

                     (a)  the * unrecouped FMD deduction in respect of the old deposit just before the declaration time; and

                     (b)  the total of the amounts worked out under all previous applications of subsection (6) in relation to that old deposit;

the **_unrecouped FMD deduction_** in respect of the new deposit is equal to the difference (if any).

Note:          This ensures that when new deposits linked to the old deposit are repaid, the total amount included in assessable income will not exceed the unrecouped FMD deduction in respect of the old deposit.

Relationship with other provisions

             (8)  This section has effect despite Division 253 (about tax treatment of entitlements under the financial claims scheme for insolvent ADIs).

##### <a id="393‑60"></a>393‑60  Repayment if owner of farm management deposit with insolvent ADI dies, is bankrupt or ceases to be a primary producer

                   Subsection 393‑10(4) does not apply in relation to so much of a * farm management deposit with an * ADI as is equal to the sum of the amounts described in subparagraphs (d)(i) and (ii) of this section if:

                     (a)  you are the * owner of the deposit; and

                     (b)  the deposit becomes repayable during an income year because of the requirement contained in the relevant agreement as set out in item 11 of the table in section 393‑35 (death, bankruptcy etc.); and

                     (c)  during the income year, the ADI becomes a declared ADI under Division 2AA (Financial claims scheme for account‑holders with insolvent ADIs) of Part II of the _Banking Act 1959_; and

                     (d)  at the end of the income year, you have either or both of the following:

                              (i)  an unmet entitlement under that Division connected with the account for the farm management deposit;

                             (ii)  an unmet claim against the ADI, or an unpaid debt owed to you by the ADI, in the winding up of the ADI connected with the account for the deposit.

Note:          Subsection 393‑10(4) makes the repayment of a farm management deposit assessable in the income year when the death, bankruptcy etc. occurs, rather than in any later year in which it might be repaid.

##### <a id="393‑10"></a>393‑10  Unrecouped FMD deduction for deposits made as a result of section 25B of the _Loan (Income Equalization Deposits) Act 1976_

                   Despite subsection 393‑10(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, if:

                     (a)  no part of a farm management deposit has been repaid before a particular time; and

                     (b)  the deposit was made with an FMD provider as a result of a request to which section 25B of the _Loan (Income Equalization Deposits) Act 1976_, as in force on 21 February 2005, applied;

the **_unrecouped FMD deduction_** in respect of the deposit at that time is equal to the amount of the unrecouped deduction (within the meaning of the former subsection 159GA(3) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) in respect of the deposit immediately before it ceased to be a deposit under the _Loan (Income Equalization Deposits) Act 1976_.

Note:          This means that the unrecouped deduction relating to the deposit under the _Loan (Income Equalization Deposits) Act 1976_ continues to apply (by becoming an unrecouped FMD deduction) when the deposit is transferred to an FMD provider as a farm management deposit. The _Loan (Income Equalization Deposits) Act 1976_ was repealed on 22 February 2005.

##### <a id="393‑40"></a>393‑40  The day the deposit was made for deposits made as a result of section 25B of the _Loan (Income Equalization Deposits) Act 1976_

                   If a farm management deposit was made with an FMD provider as a result of a request under section 25B of the _Loan (Income Equalization Deposits) Act 1976_, as in force on 21 February 2005, then:

                     (a)  subsections 393‑40(1) to (4) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ apply as if the day the deposit was made was the day on which the deposit was originally made under the _Loan (Income Equalization Deposits) Act 1976_; and

                     (b)  subsection 393‑40(6) does not apply to the deposit.

Note:          The _Loan (Income Equalization Deposits) Act 1976_ was repealed on 22 February 2005.
