##### <a id="328-110"></a>328-110  Meaning of _small business entity_

General rule: based on aggregated turnover worked out as at the beginning of the current income year

             (1)  You are a **_small business entity_** for an income year (the **_current year_**) if:

                     (a)  you carry on a * business in the current year; and

                     (b)  one or both of the following applies:

                              (i)  you carried on a business in the income year (the **_previous year_**) before the current year and your * aggregated turnover for the previous year was less than $2 million;

                             (ii)  your aggregated turnover for the current year is likely to be less than $2 million.

Note:          Section 328-110 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_ affects the operation of this subsection in relation to the 2007-08 and 2008-09 income years.

             (2)  You work out your * aggregated turnover for the current year for the purposes of subparagraph (1)(b)(ii):

                     (a)  as at the first day of the current year; or

                     (b)  if you start to carry on a * business during the current year—as at the day you start to carry on the business.

Note:          Subsection 328-120(5) provides for how to work out your annual turnover (which is relevant to working out your aggregated turnover) if you do not carry on a business for the whole of an income year.

Exception: aggregated turnover for 2 previous income years was $2 million or more

             (3)  However, you are not a **_small business entity_** for an income year (the **_current year_**) because of subparagraph (1)(b)(ii) if:

                     (a)  you carried on a * business in each of the 2 income years before the current year; and

                     (b)  your * aggregated turnover for each of those income years was $2 million or more.

Note:          Section 328-110 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_ affects the operation of this subsection in relation to the 2007-08 and 2008-09 income years.

Additional rule: based on aggregated turnover worked out as at the end of the current income year

             (4)  You are also a **_small business entity_** for an income year (the **_current year_**) if:

                     (a)  you carry on a * business in the current year; and

                     (b)  your * aggregated turnover for the current year, worked out as at the end of that year, is less than $2 million.

Note:          If you are a small business entity only because of subsection (4), you cannot choose any of the following concessions:

(a)           paying PAYG instalments based on GDP-adjusted notional tax: see section 45-130 of Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_;

(b)           accounting for GST on a cash basis: see section 29-40 of the GST Act;

(c)           making an annual apportionment of input tax credits for acquisitions and importations that are partly creditable: see section 131-5 of the GST Act;

(d)           paying GST by quarterly instalments: see section 162-5 of the GST Act.

Winding up a business previously carried on

             (5)  This Subdivision applies to you as if you carried on a * business in an income year if:

                     (a)  in that year you were winding up a business you previously carried on; and

                     (b)  you were a * small business entity for the income year in which you stopped carrying on that business.

Note 1:       Subsection 328-120(5) provides for how to work out your annual turnover (which is relevant to working out your aggregated turnover) if you do not carry on a business for the whole of an income year.

Note 2:       A special rule applies if you were an STS taxpayer under this Division (as in force immediately before the commencement of this section) in the income year in which you stopped carrying on the business: see section 328-111 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

##### <a id="328-115"></a>328-115  Meaning of _aggregated turnover_

             (1)  Your **_aggregated turnover_** for an income year is the sum of the relevant annual turnovers (see subsection (2)) excluding any amounts covered by subsection (3).

             (2)  The **_relevant annual turnovers_** are:

                     (a)  your * annual turnover for the income year; and

                     (b)  the annual turnover for the income year of any entity (a **_relevant entity_**) that is * connected with you at any time during the income year; and

                     (c)  the annual turnover for the income year of any entity (a **_relevant entity_**) that is an * affiliate of yours at any time during the income year.

             (3)  Your **_aggregated turnover_** for an income year does not include the following amounts:

                     (a)  amounts * derived in the income year by you or a relevant entity from dealings between you and the relevant entity while the relevant entity is * connected with you or is your * affiliate;

                     (b)  amounts derived in the income year by a relevant entity from dealings between the relevant entity and another relevant entity while each relevant entity is connected with you or is your affiliate;

                     (c)  amounts derived in the income year by a relevant entity while the relevant entity is not connected with you and is not your affiliate.

##### <a id="328-120"></a>328-120  Meaning of _annual turnover_

General rule

             (1)  An entity’s **_annual turnover_** for an income year is the total * ordinary income that the entity * derives in the income year in the ordinary course of carrying on a * business.

Exclusion of amounts relating to GST

             (2)  In working out an entity’s * annual turnover for an income year, do not include any amount that is * non-assessable non-exempt income under section 17-5 (which is about GST).

Exclusion of amounts derived from sales of retail fuel

             (3)  In working out an entity’s * annual turnover for an income year, do not include any amounts of * ordinary income the entity * derives from sales of * retail fuel.

Amounts derived from dealings with associates

             (4)  In working out an entity’s * annual turnover for an income year, the amount of * ordinary income the entity * derives from any dealing with an * associate of the entity is the amount of ordinary income the entity would derive from the dealing if it were at * arm’s length.

Note:          Amounts derived in an income year from any dealings between an entity and an associate that is a relevant entity within the meaning of section 328-115 are not included in the entity’s aggregated turnover for that year: see subsection 328-115(3).

Business carried on for part of income year only

             (5)  If an entity does not carry on a * business for the whole of an income year, the entity’s * annual turnover for the income year must be worked out using a reasonable estimate of what the entity’s annual turnover for the income year would be if the entity carried on a business for the whole of the income year.

Regulations may provide for different calculation of annual turnover

             (6)  The regulations may provide that an entity’s * annual turnover for an income year is to be calculated in a different way, but only so that it would be less than the amount worked out under this section.

##### <a id="328-125"></a>328-125  Meaning of _connected with_ an entity

             (1)  An entity is **_connected with_** another entity if:

                     (a)  either entity controls the other entity in a way described in this section; or

                     (b)  both entities are controlled in a way described in this section by the same third entity.

Direct control of an entity other than a discretionary trust

             (2)  An entity (the **_first entity_**) controls another entity if the first entity, its * affiliates, or the first entity together with its affiliates:

                     (a)  except if the other entity is a discretionary trust—beneficially own, or have the right to acquire the beneficial ownership of, interests in the other entity that carry between them the right to receive a percentage (the **_control percentage_**) that is at least 40% of:

                              (i)  any distribution of income by the other entity; or

                             (ii)  if the other entity is a partnership—the net income of the partnership; or

                            (iii)  any distribution of capital by the other entity; or

                     (b)  if the other entity is a company—beneficially own, or have the right to acquire the beneficial ownership of, * equity interests in the company that carry between them the right to exercise, or control the exercise of, a percentage (the **_control percentage_**) that is at least 40% of the voting power in the company.

Direct control of a discretionary trust

             (3)  An entity (the **_first entity_**) controls a discretionary trust if a trustee of the trust acts, or could reasonably be expected to act, in accordance with the directions or wishes of the first entity, its * affiliates, or the first entity together with its affiliates.

             (4)  An entity (the **_first entity_**) controls a discretionary trust for an income year if, for any of the 4 income years before that year:

                     (a)  the trustee of the trust paid to, or applied for the benefit of:

                              (i)  the first entity; or

                             (ii)  any of the first entity’s * affiliates; or

                            (iii)  the first entity and any of its affiliates;

                            any of the income or capital of the trust; and

                     (b)  the percentage (the **_control percentage_**) of the income or capital paid or applied is at least 40% of the total amount of income or capital paid or applied by the trustee for that year.

Note:          Section 328-112 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_ affects the operation of this subsection in relation to the 2007-08, 2008-09, 2009-10 and 2010-11 income years.

             (5)  An entity does not control a discretionary trust because of subsection (4) if the entity is:

                     (a)  an * exempt entity; or

                     (b)  a * deductible gift recipient.

Commissioner may determine that an entity does not control another entity

             (6)  If the control percentage referred to in subsection (2) or (4) is at least 40%, but less than 50%, the Commissioner may determine that the first entity does not control the other entity if the Commissioner thinks that the other entity is controlled by an entity other than, or by entities that do not include, the first entity or any of its * affiliates.

Indirect control of an entity

             (7)  This section applies to an entity (the **_first entity_**) that directly controls another entity (the **_second entity_**) as if the first entity also controlled any other entity that is directly, or indirectly by any other application or applications of this section, controlled by the second entity.

             (8)  However, subsection (7) does not apply if the second entity is an entity of any of the following kinds:

                     (a)  a company * shares in which (except shares that carry the right to a fixed rate of * dividend) are listed for quotation in the official list of an * approved stock exchange;

                     (b)  a * publicly traded unit trust;

                     (c)  a * mutual insurance company;

                     (d)  a * mutual affiliate company;

                     (e)  a company (other than one covered by paragraph (a)) all the shares in which are beneficially owned by one or more of the following:

                              (i)  a company covered by paragraph (a);

                             (ii)  a publicly traded unit trust;

                            (iii)  a mutual insurance company;

##### <a id="328-130"></a>328-130  Meaning of _affiliate_

             (2)  However, an individual or a company is not your **_affiliate_** merely because of the nature of the business relationship you and the individual or company share.

Example:    A partner in a partnership would not be an affiliate of another partner merely because the first partner acts, or could reasonably be expected to act, in accordance with the directions or wishes of the second partner, or in concert with the second partner, in relation to the affairs of the partnership.

                   Directors of the same company and trustees of the same trust, or the company and a director of that company, would be in a similar position.

#### Guide to Division 328

##### <a id="328-5"></a>328-5  What this Division is about

* * *

This Division explains the meaning of the terms **_small business entity_**, **_annual turnover_**, **_aggregated turnover_** and related concepts (Subdivision 328-C).

If you are a small business entity, this Division allows you to change the way the income tax law applies to you in these ways:

               (a)     you can choose to put your depreciating assets into a long life pool or a general pool and treat each pool as a single asset (Subdivision 328-D);

               (b)     you can choose not to account for annual changes in trading stock value that are not more than $5,000 (Subdivision 328-E).

In usual circumstances, these changes will simplify the working out of your taxable income, and so reduce your compliance costs.

Example:    When Bria’s van was allocated to her general small business pool for the 2007-08 income year, she estimated that it would be used 50% for deliveries in her florist business. Due to increasing deliveries, Bria estimates the van’s business use to be 70% for the 2008-09 year, and 90% for the 2009-10 year. She makes an adjustment under section 328-225 for both those years.

                   Bria sells the van for $3,000 at the start of the 2011-12 income year. She must now average the business use estimates for the van for the year it was allocated to the pool and the next 3 years to work out the taxable purpose proportion of its termination value. The average is worked out as follows:

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">          </span>50% (original estimate); plus

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">          </span>70% (2008-09 estimate); plus

                     (b)  if the previous income year is the 2007-08 income year or a later income year:

                              (i)  the trustee of the trust paid to, or applied for the benefit of, the first entity, any of the first entity’s affiliates, or the first entity and any of its affiliates, any of the income or capital of the trust; and

                             (ii)  the percentage (the **_control percentage_**) of the income or capital paid or applied is at least 40% of the total amount of income or capital paid or applied by the trustee for that year.

             (3)  This subsection applies to the following provisions:

## 166  Paragraph 328-115(1)(a)

## 172  Section 328-120

Repeal the section, substitute:

##### <a id="328-120"></a>328-120  Continuing to use the STS accounting method

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  you were an STS taxpayer for the most recent income year that started before 1 July 2005; and

                     (b)  you continued to be an STS taxpayer until the end of the 2006-07 income year; and

                     (c)  you used the STS accounting method for the 2005-06 and 2006-07 income years; and

                     (d)  you are a small business entity for the 2007-08 income year.

             (2)  You can continue to use the STS accounting method:

                     (a)  for the 2007-08 income year; and

                     (b)  for any later income year for which you are a small business entity but only if you used the STS accounting method for the income year before that later year.

Example:    You are a small business entity for the 2007-08 and 2008-09 income years and you continue to use the STS accounting method for those years. You are not a small business entity for the 2009-10 income year so you cannot continue to use the STS accounting method for that year. Because you cannot use the STS accounting method for the 2009-10 income year, you will not be able to use it again for a later income year even if you are a small business entity for that later year.

## 173  After section 328-125

Insert:

##### <a id="328-175"></a>328-175  Choices made in relation to depreciating assets used in primary production business

             (2)  The choice has effect for the purposes of subsection 328-175(3) of new Subdivision 328-D.

Note:          This means you cannot change the choice: see subsection 328-175(4) of new Subdivision 328-D.

##### <a id="328-185"></a>328-185  Depreciating assets allocated to STS pools

Assets allocated to general STS pool

             (1)  A depreciating asset of yours that had been allocated to your general STS pool is treated as being allocated to your general small business pool.

Assets allocated to long life STS pool

             (2)  A depreciating asset of yours that had been allocated to your long life STS pool is treated as being allocated to your long life small business pool.

Choice not to allocate assets to long life STS pool

             (3)  If you made a choice, under subsection 328-185(5) of old Subdivision 328-D, not to have a depreciating asset allocated to your long life STS pool, the choice has effect for the purposes of subsection 328-185(5) of new Subdivision 328-D.

Note:          This means you cannot change the choice: see subsection 328-185(6) of new Subdivision 328-D.

##### <a id="328-195"></a>328-195  Opening pool balances for 2007-08 income year

             (1)  This section applies if a depreciating asset of yours is treated as being allocated to your general small business pool or long life small business pool under section 328-185.

             (2)  The opening pool balance of your general small business pool or long life small business pool for the 2007-08 income year is taken to be the closing pool balance of your general STS pool or long life STS pool, as the case requires, for the 2006-07 income year, reduced or increased by any adjustment required under section 328-225 of new Subdivision 328-D (about change in the business use of an asset).

             (3)  However, if:

                     (a)  you were not an STS taxpayer for the 2006-07 income year (because you stopped being an STS taxpayer before that time); but

                     (b)  you are a small business entity for the 2007-08 income year or a later income year and you choose to use new Subdivision 328-D to deduct amounts for your depreciating assets for that income year;

the opening pool balance of your general small business pool or long life small business pool includes the sum of the taxable purpose proportions of the adjustable values of depreciating assets allocated to the pool under subsection 328-185(3) of new Subdivision 328-D for that year.

## 174  Section 328-440

Repeal the section, substitute:

##### <a id="328-440"></a>328-440  Taxpayers who left the STS on or after 1 July 2005

             (1)  This section applies if you chose to stop being an STS taxpayer for the 2005-06 income year or the 2006-07 income year.

             (2)  You cannot choose to use new Subdivision 328-D to deduct amounts for your depreciating assets until at least 5 years after the income year for which you chose to stop being an STS taxpayer.

Note:          Subdivision 328-D of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ continues to apply to depreciating assets that have been allocated to your small business pools even if you are not a small business entity, or do not choose to use that Subdivision, for an income year: see section 328-220 of that Subdivision.

## 175  At the end of Division 727

Add:

##### <a id="727-470"></a>727-470  Affected interests do not include equity or loan interests owned by entity that is eligible to be an STS taxpayer

                     (b)  the scheme that results in the indirect value shift was entered into before the start of the 2007-08 income year.

             (2)  Paragraph 727-470(2)(a) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (as in force immediately before the commencement of this section) continues to have effect in relation to the indirect value shift as if the repeals and amendments made by Schedule 1, Parts 1 and 2 of Schedule 3 and Schedule 8 to the _Tax Laws Amendment (Small Business) Act 2007_ had not been made.
