## Part IIA—The general interest charge

##### <a id="8AAA"></a>8AAA  Overview

* * *

This Part explains how to work out the general interest charge on an amount.

Usually, a person is liable to pay the charge if an amount that the person must pay to the Commissioner is not paid on time. But there are also other circumstances in which a person can be liable.

A person is only liable to pay the charge if a provision of an Act makes the person liable.

* * *

##### <a id="8AAB"></a>8AAB  When the general interest charge applies

             (1)  There are certain provisions of this Act and other Acts that make persons liable to pay the general interest charge. Subsection (4) lists the provisions.

             (2)  A person is only liable to pay the charge on an amount if a provision specifies that the person is liable to pay the charge on the amount.

             (3)  The charge does not apply to the Commonwealth or an authority of the Commonwealth.

             (4)  The following table is an index of the laws that deal with liability to the charge.

##### <a id="8AAC"></a>8AAC  Amount of the general interest charge

             (1)  The general interest charge for a day is worked out in accordance with this section.

             (2)  If the charge is payable under section 8AAZF on the RBA deficit at the end of that day, then the charge is worked out by multiplying the general interest charge rate for that day by the RBA deficit at the end of that day.

             (3)  If the charge is not payable under section 8AAZF, but applies to an amount that remains unpaid (the **_original unpaid amount_**), then the charge is worked out by multiplying the general interest charge rate for that day by the sum of so much of the following amounts as remains unpaid: 

                     (a)  the charge from previous days;

                     (b)  the original unpaid amount.

             (4)  If the charge applies to an amount that is specified in the provision that imposes the charge, but neither subsection (2) nor (3) applies, then the charge is worked out by multiplying the general interest charge rate for that day by the sum of the following amounts:

                     (a)  so much of the charge from previous days as remains unpaid;

                     (b)  the specified amount.

##### <a id="8AAD"></a>8AAD  What is the _general interest charge rate?_

             (1)  The **_general interest charge rate_** for a day is the rate worked out by adding 7 percentage points to the base interest rate for that day, and dividing that total by the number of days in the calendar year.

             (2)  The **_base interest rate_** for a day depends on which quarter of the year the day is in. For each day in a quarter in the second column of the table, it is the monthly average yield of 90‑day Bank Accepted Bills published by the Reserve Bank of Australia for the month in the third column of the table.

             (3)  If the monthly average yield of 90‑day Bank Accepted Bills for a particular month in the third column of the table in subsection (2) is not published by the Reserve Bank of Australia before the beginning of the relevant quarter, assume that it is the same as the last monthly average yield of 90‑day Bank Accepted Bills published by the Reserve Bank of Australia before that month.

             (4)  The base interest rate must be rounded to the second decimal place (rounding .005 upwards).

##### <a id="8AAE"></a>8AAE  When the charge is due and payable

                   The general interest charge for a day is due and payable to the Commissioner at the end of that day.

Note:          For provisions about collection and recovery of the charge, see Part 4‑15 in Schedule 1.

##### <a id="8AAF"></a>8AAF  Notification by Commissioner

             (1)  The Commissioner may give notice to a person liable to pay the charge of the amount of the charge for a particular day or days.

             (3)  The notice may be included in any other notice issued by the Commissioner in respect of the person.

             (4)  A notice given to a person by the Commissioner under this section is prima facie evidence of the matters stated in the notice.

##### <a id="8AAG"></a>8AAG  Remission of the charge

             (1)  The Commissioner may remit all or a part of the charge payable by a person.

             (2)  However, if a person is liable to pay the charge because an amount remains unpaid after the time by which it is due to be paid, the Commissioner may only remit all or a part of the charge in the circumstances set out in subsection (3), (4) or (5).

             (3)  The Commissioner may remit all or a part of the charge referred to in subsection (2) if the Commissioner is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the circumstances that contributed to the delay in payment were not due to, or caused directly or indirectly by, an act or omission of the person; and

                     (b)  the person has taken reasonable action to mitigate, or mitigate the effects of, those circumstances.

             (4)  The Commissioner may remit all or a part of the charge referred to in subsection (2) if the Commissioner is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the circumstances that contributed to the delay in payment were due to, or caused directly or indirectly by, an act or omission of the person; and

                     (b)  the person has taken reasonable action to mitigate, or mitigate the effects of, those circumstances; and

                     (c)  having regard to the nature of those circumstances, it would be fair and reasonable to remit all or a part of the charge.

             (5)  The Commissioner may remit all or a part of the charge referred to in subsection (2) if the Commissioner is satisfied that:

                     (a)  there are special circumstances because of which it would be fair and reasonable to remit all or a part of the charge; or

                     (b)  it is otherwise appropriate to do so.

##### <a id="8AAGA"></a>8AAGA  Rounding of the charge

                   If the amount of the charge payable for any period is not a multiple of 5 cents, the Commissioner may round it down to the nearest multiple of 5 cents.

##### <a id="8AAH"></a>8AAH  Judgment for payment of an unpaid amount

             (1)  This section applies if judgment is given by, or entered in, a court for the payment of:

                     (a)  all or a part of an amount in respect of which a person is, or was, liable to pay the charge because the amount remains unpaid after the time by which it is due to be paid; or

                     (b)  an amount that includes all or a part of the unpaid amount.

             (2)  The consequences of judgment being given or entered are:

                     (a)  the unpaid amount is not taken, for the purposes of a provision that makes, or would make, the person liable to pay the charge on the unpaid amount, to have ceased to be due and payable by reason only of the giving or entering of the judgment; and

                     (b)  if the judgment debt carries interest, the amount of the charge that the person would, if not for this paragraph, be liable to pay on the unpaid amount is reduced by:

                              (i)  in a case to which paragraph (1)(a) applies—the amount of the interest; or

                             (ii)  in a case to which paragraph (1)(b) applies—the amount worked out using the formula:

##### <a id="8AAZB"></a>8AAZB  Trustee to be treated as separate entity for each capacity

                   For the purposes of this Part, a person who is a trustee in more than one capacity is to be treated as a separate entity in relation to each of those capacities.

### Division 2—Running Balance Accounts (or RBAs)

##### <a id="8AAZC"></a>8AAZC  Establishment of RBAs

             (1)  The Commissioner may establish one or more systems of accounts for primary tax debts.

Note:          This section does not prevent the Commissioner from establishing other accounts that are not RBAs.

             (2)  Each account is to be known as a Running Balance Account (or RBA).

             (3)  An RBA may be established for any entity.

Note:          The same _person_ might be part of different _entities_. For example, a person might have a trustee capacity and also be a partner in a partnership. The person would then be a tax debtor in relation to each of the separate RBAs established for the trustee capacity and the partnership.

             (4)  RBAs for entities may be established on any basis that the Commissioner determines.

          (4A)  Without limiting subsection (4), separate RBAs may be established for different types of primary tax debts.

##### <a id="8AAZD"></a>8AAZD  Allocation of tax debts to RBAs

             (1)  The Commissioner may allocate a primary tax debt to an RBA that has been established for that type of tax debt.

Note:          General interest charge on an RBA deficit debt is not allocated to the RBA: it accrues automatically under section 8AAZF.

Separate RBAs for one entity

          (1A)  If 2 or more RBAs for an entity have been established for that kind of tax debt, the Commissioner may allocate the debt to any one of those RBAs, or between any 2 or more of those RBAs, in the manner the Commissioner determines.

Note:          Separate RBAs may be established for different businesses or undertakings conducted by the same entity, for different parts of the same business or undertaking or for different periods: see subsection 8AAZC(5).

Definition

             (2)  In this section:

                    <a name="primari-tax-debt"></a>**_primary tax debt_** does not include:

                     (a)  general interest charge; or

                     (b)  an RBA deficit debt.

##### <a id="8AAZF"></a>8AAZF  General interest charge on RBA deficit debt

             (1)  If there is an RBA deficit debt at the end of a day, then general interest charge is payable by the tax debtor on that RBA deficit debt for that day.

             (2)  The balance of the RBA is altered in the Commissioner’s favour by the amount of the general interest charge payable.

##### <a id="8AAZG"></a>8AAZG  RBA statements

                   The Commissioner may at any time prepare a statement for an RBA, containing such particulars as the Commissioner determines.

##### <a id="8AAZH"></a>8AAZH  Liability for RBA deficit debt

             (1)  If there is an RBA deficit debt on an RBA at the end of a day, the tax debtor is liable to pay to the Commonwealth the amount of the debt. The amount is due and payable at the end of that day.

Note:          For provisions about collection and recovery of the amount, see Part 4‑15 in Schedule 1.

             (2)  If there are several tax debtors, their liability for the debt is of the same kind as their liability for the tax debts that were allocated to the RBA.

Example:    If the tax debtors are jointly and severally liable for the tax debts that were allocated to the RBA, they will also be jointly and severally liable for the RBA deficit debt.

##### <a id="8AAZI"></a>8AAZI  RBA statement to be evidence

             (1)  The production of an RBA statement:

                     (a)  is prima facie evidence that the RBA was duly kept; and

                     (b)  is prima facie evidence that the amounts and particulars in the statement are correct.

             (2)  In this section:

                    <a name="rba-statem"></a>**_RBA statement_** includes a document that purports to be a copy of an RBA statement and is signed by the Commissioner or a delegate of the Commissioner or by a Second Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner.

##### <a id="8AAZJ"></a>8AAZJ  Evidentiary certificate about RBA transactions etc.

             (1)  In proceedings for recovery of an RBA deficit debt, a Commissioner’s certificate stating any of the following matters in respect of a specified RBA is prima facie evidence of those matters:

                     (a)  that no tax debts (other than general interest charge on the RBA deficit debt) were allocated to the RBA after the balance date shown on a specified RBA statement for the RBA;

                     (b)  that general interest charge is payable on the RBA deficit debt, as specified in the certificate;

                     (c)  that payments and credits were allocated to the RBA, as specified in the certificate;

                     (d)  that a specified amount was the RBA deficit debt on the date of the certificate.

             (2)  In this section:

                    <a name="commission-certif"></a>**_Commissioner’s certificate_** means a certificate signed by the Commissioner or a delegate of the Commissioner, or by a Second Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner.

### Division 3—Treatment of payments, credits and RBA surpluses

##### <a id="8AAZL"></a>8AAZL  Amounts covered by this Division

             (1)  This Division sets out how the Commissioner must treat the following kinds of amount:

                     (a)  a payment the Commissioner receives in respect of a current or anticipated tax debt or tax debts of an entity;

                     (b)  a credit (including an excess non‑RBA credit) that an entity is entitled to under a taxation law;

                     (c)  an RBA surplus of an entity.

             (2)  The Commissioner must treat each such amount using the method set out in section 8AAZLA or 8AAZLB (but not both).

Note:          In either case, section 8AAZLC has some additional rules that apply to RBA surpluses and to certain excess non‑RBA credits.

             (3)  However, the Commissioner does not have to treat an amount using either of those methods if doing so would require the Commissioner to apply the amount against a tax debt:

                     (a)  that is due but not yet payable; or

                     (b)  in respect of which the taxpayer has complied with an arrangement under section 255‑15 to pay the debt by instalments; or

                     (c)  in respect of which the Commissioner has agreed to defer recovery under section 255‑5.

             (4)  Furthermore, the Commissioner does not have to treat an amount using either of those methods if:

                     (a)  doing so would require the Commissioner to apply the amount against a tax debt; and

                     (b)  the tax debt is a penalty that is due and payable under section 269‑20 in Schedule 1 (penalties for directors of non‑complying companies).

##### <a id="8AAZLA"></a>8AAZLA  Method 1—allocating the amount first to an RBA

             (1)  The Commissioner may, in the manner he or she determines, allocate the amount to an RBA of the entity or, if the entity is a member of an RBA group, to an RBA of another member of the group.

             (2)  The Commissioner must then also apply the amount against the following kinds of debts (if there are any):

                     (a)  tax debts that have been allocated to that RBA;

                     (b)  general interest charge on such tax debts.

             (3)  To the extent that the amount is not applied under subsection (2), it gives rise to an **_excess non‑RBA credit_** in favour of the entity that:

                     (a)  is equal to the part of the amount that is not applied; and

                     (b)  relates to the RBA to which the amount was allocated.

##### <a id="8AAZLB"></a>8AAZLB  Method 2—applying the amount first against a non‑RBA tax debt

             (1)  The Commissioner may, in the manner he or she determines, apply the amount against a non‑RBA tax debt of the entity or, if the entity is a member of an RBA group, against a non‑RBA tax debt of another member of the group.

             (2)  If the non‑RBA tax debt is:

                     (a)  a tax debt that has been allocated to an RBA; or

                     (b)  general interest charge on such a tax debt;

the Commissioner must then also allocate the amount to that RBA.

             (3)  To the extent that the amount is not applied under subsection (1), it gives rise to an **_excess non‑RBA credit_** in favour of the entity that is equal to the part of the amount that is not applied.

             (4)  The excess non‑RBA credit relates to the RBA (if any) that the Commissioner determines and the balance of that RBA is adjusted in the entity’s favour by the amount of that credit.

Separate RBAs for one entity

             (5)  If the non‑RBA tax debt mentioned in subsection (1) has been allocated to 2 or more RBAs, the Commissioner must allocate the amount applied between those RBAs in the proportions in which the tax debt was allocated.

Note:          Separate RBAs may be established for different businesses or undertakings conducted by the same entity, for different parts of the same business or undertaking or for different periods: see subsection 8AAZC(5).

##### <a id="8AAZLC"></a>8AAZLC  RBA surplus and related credits must remain equivalent if one or the other is applied

RBA surpluses

             (1)  If an RBA surplus is allocated or applied under this Division, the Commissioner must reduce by the same amount excess non‑RBA credits that relate to the RBA.

Excess non‑RBA credits

             (2)  If, under this Division, an excess non‑RBA credit that relates to an RBA (the **_related RBA_**) is:

                     (a)  allocated to an RBA; or

                     (b)  applied against a non‑RBA tax debt;

the related RBA is adjusted in the Commissioner’s favour by the same amount.

##### <a id="8AAZLD"></a>8AAZLD  Special priority credits: FS assessment debts and compulsory repayment amounts

                   If, under this Division, the Commissioner is to apply a credit that arises under Schedule 1 to this Act (the PAYG system), the Commissioner must apply it, whether under section 8AAZLA or 8AAZLB:

                    (aa)  first, against any compulsory repayment amount of the entity; and

                     (b)  then against any FS assessment debt of the entity;

before applying it against other non‑RBA tax debts of the entity.

##### <a id="8AAZLE"></a>8AAZLE  Instructions to Commissioner not binding

                   In doing anything under this Division, the Commissioner is not required to take account of any instructions of any entity.

### Division 3A—Refunds of RBA surpluses and credits

##### <a id="8AAZLF"></a>8AAZLF  Commissioner must refund RBA surpluses and credits

             (1)  The Commissioner must refund to an entity so much of:

                     (a)  an RBA surplus of the entity; or

                     (b)  a credit (including an excess non‑RBA credit) in the entity’s favour;

as the Commissioner does not allocate or apply under Division 3.

Voluntary payments only to be refunded on request

             (2)  However, the Commissioner is not required to refund an RBA surplus or excess non‑RBA credit that arises because a payment is made in respect of an anticipated tax debt of an entity unless the entity later requests, in the approved manner, that the Commissioner do so.

             (3)  On receiving such a request, the Commissioner must refund so much of the amount as the Commissioner does not allocate or apply under Division 3.

Effect of refunding RBA surplus

             (4)  If the Commissioner refunds an RBA surplus under this section, the Commissioner must reduce by the same amount excess non‑RBA credits that relate to the RBA.

Effect of refunding credit that relates to an RBA

             (5)  If, under this section, the Commissioner refunds an excess non‑RBA credit that relates to an RBA, the RBA is adjusted in the Commissioner’s favour by the same amount.

##### <a id="8AAZLG"></a>8AAZLG  Retaining refunds until information or notification given

             (1)  The Commissioner may retain an amount that he or she otherwise would have to refund to an entity under section 8AAZLF, if the entity has not given the Commissioner a notification:

                     (a)  that affects or may affect the amount that the Commissioner refunds to the entity; and

                     (b)  that the entity is required to give the Commissioner under any of the BAS provisions (as defined in subsection 995‑1(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_).

             (2)  The Commissioner may retain the amount until the entity has given the Commissioner that notification or the Commissioner makes or amends an assessment of the amount, whichever happens first.

Note:          Interest is payable under the _Taxation (Interest on Overpayments and Early Payments) Act 1983_ if the Commissioner is late in making the payment under subsection (2).

##### <a id="8AAZLGA"></a>8AAZLGA  Retaining refunds while Commissioner verifies information

Commissioner may retain an amount

             (1)  The Commissioner may retain an amount that he or she otherwise would have to refund to an entity under section 8AAZLF, if the entity has given the Commissioner a notification that affects or may affect the amount that the Commissioner refunds to the entity, and:

                     (a)  it would be reasonable to require verification of information (the **_notified information_**) that:

                              (i)  is contained in the notification; and

                             (ii)  relates to the amount that the Commissioner would have to refund; or

                     (b)  the entity has requested the Commissioner to retain the amount for verification of the notified information, and the request has not been withdrawn.

             (2)  In deciding whether to retain the amount under this section, the Commissioner must, as far as the information available to the Commissioner at the time of making the decision reasonably allows, have regard to the following:

                     (a)  the likely accuracy of the notified information;

                     (b)  the likelihood that the notified information was affected by:

                              (i)  fraud or evasion; or

                             (ii)  intentional disregard of a taxation law; or

                            (iii)  recklessness as to the operation of a taxation law;

                     (c)  the impact of retaining the amount on the entity’s financial position;

                     (d)  whether retaining the amount is necessary for the protection of the revenue, including the likelihood that the Commissioner could recover any of the amount if the notified information were found to be incorrect after the amount had been refunded;

                     (e)  any complexity that would be involved in verifying the notified information;

                      (f)  the time for which the Commissioner has already retained the amount;

                     (g)  what the Commissioner has already done to verify the notified information;

                     (h)  whether the Commissioner has enough information to make an assessment relating to the amount (including information obtained from making further requests for information);

                      (i)  the extent to which the notified information is consistent with information that the entity previously provided;

                      (j)  any other relevant matter.

Informing the entity of the retention of the amount

             (3)  The Commissioner must inform the entity (by serving a document on the entity or by other means) that he or she has retained the amount under this section. He or she must do so by the end of:

                     (a)  in a case to which paragraph 8AAZLF(1)(a) applies—the RBA interest day (within the meaning of section 12AF of the _Taxation (Interest on Overpayments and Early Payments) Act 1983_) for the RBA surplus of the entity; or

                     (b)  in any other case—the 30th day after the entity gives to the Commissioner the notification mentioned in subsection (1) of this section.

Note:          Under Part 2A of the regulations, documents may be served on a person using the person’s preferred address for service.

             (4)  In informing the entity that the amount is retained, the Commissioner may request information that he or she is aware will be required for the purposes of verifying the notified information.

How long the amount may be retained

             (5)  The Commissioner may retain the amount under this section only until:

                     (a)  if paragraph (1)(a) applies—it would no longer be reasonable to require verification of the information; or

                     (b)  if the Commissioner fails to inform the entity, in accordance with subsection (3), that he or she has retained the amount under this section—the end of the day after the time by which, under that subsection, the Commissioner is required to inform the entity; or

                     (c)  in any case—there is a change to how much the Commissioner is required to refund, as a result of:

                              (i)  the Commissioner amending an assessment relating to the amount; or

                             (ii)  the Commissioner making or amending an assessment, under Division 105 in Schedule 1, relating to the amount;

whichever happens first.

Objecting to the decision to retain the amount

             (6)  The entity may object to a decision of the Commissioner to retain the amount under this section in the manner set out in Part IVC, if the entity is dissatisfied with the decision.

Note:          Interest on the amount may be payable under the _Taxation (Interest on Overpayments and Early Payments) Act 1983_.

             (7)  Before the end of the 7 days after the start of the period during which, under section 14ZW, the entity may object to the decision, the Commissioner must notify the entity, in writing, that the entity may object to the decision.

Note:          For the start of the period for objecting to the decision, see paragraph 14ZW(1)(aac) and subsection 14ZW(4).

             (8)  A failure to comply with subsection (7) does not affect the validity of the decision.

##### <a id="8AAZLH"></a>8AAZLH  How refunds are made

             (1)  This section applies to refunds payable to an entity of RBA surpluses, or excess non‑RBA credits that relate to an RBA, if primary tax debts arising under any of the BAS provisions (as defined in subsection 995‑1(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_) have been allocated to that RBA.

             (2)  The Commissioner must pay those refunds to the credit of a financial institution account nominated in the approved form by the entity. The account nominated must be maintained at a branch or office of the institution that is in Australia.

          (2A)  The account must be one held by:

                     (a)  the entity, or the entity and some other entity; or

                     (b)  the entity’s registered tax agent or BAS agent; or

                     (c)  a legal practitioner as trustee or executor for the entity.

             (3)  However, the Commissioner may direct that any such refunds be paid to the entity in a different way.

             (4)  If an entity has not nominated a financial institution account for the purposes of this section and the Commissioner has not directed that any such refunds be paid in a different way, the Commissioner is not obliged to refund any amount to the entity until the entity does so.

             (5)  If the Commissioner pays a refund to the credit of an account nominated by an entity, the Commissioner is taken to have paid the refund to the entity.

### Division 4—Miscellaneous provisions about tax debts
