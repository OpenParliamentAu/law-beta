             (5)  A declaration under this section cannot be revoked.

             (6)  A declaration under this section may specify a reduction percentage that applies to the declared terrorist incident for the purposes of section 8.

                     (b)  business interruption and consequential loss arising from:

                     (c)  liability of the insured that arises out of the insured being the owner or occupier of eligible property.

             (2)  A contract covered by subsection (1) is not an eligible insurance contract to the extent to which it is:

                     (b)  prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this subsection.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Effect of terrorism exclusions in eligible insurance contracts

             (1)  A terrorism exclusion in an eligible insurance contract has no effect in relation to a loss or liability to the extent to which the loss or liability is an eligible terrorism loss.

                     (a)  apart from this subsection, an amount (the **_base amount_**) would be payable under the contract, solely because of this section, in respect of a declared terrorist incident; and

                     (b)  a reduction percentage applies to the declared terrorist incident; and

                     (c)  if the contract was made on or after 1 October 2003—the insurer is reinsured with the Corporation in respect of the whole or a part of the insurer’s liabilities under the contract that arise solely because of this section;

then the base amount is to be reduced by the reduction percentage.

             (4)  The Corporation is liable to compensate an insurer for:

                     (a)  a liability incurred by the insurer under a protected contract, to the extent that the liability arises solely because of this section; and

                     (b)  expenditure incurred by the insurer in connection with, or arising from, the assessment, management, conduct, rejection, defence or settlement of a claim by the insured, to the extent to which the claim is:
