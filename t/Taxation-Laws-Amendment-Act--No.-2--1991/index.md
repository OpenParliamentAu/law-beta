Transitional capital gains tax provisions for certain Cocos (Keeling) Islands

assets

  &quot;24P. (1) Subject to an election under subsection (5), this section applies

to an asset held by a taxpayer where all of the following conditions are

satisfied:

  (a)  the asset was owned by the taxpayer at the end of 30 June 1991;

  (b)  if the asset had been disposed of by the taxpayer on 1 July 1991, Part

IIIA would, or would, apart from section 160zzf and Divisions 5A, 7A and 17 of

that Part, have applied in respect of that disposal;

  (c)  if:

    (i)  the asset had been disposed of by the taxpayer on 1

July 1991; and

    (ii)  profits or gains of a capital nature had been derived

by the taxpayer in respect of that disposal; and

    (iii) section 24BB had not been enacted; and

    (iv)  section 24BA had applied in relation to the year of

income in which disposal occurred;

    the profits or gains would have been exempt income under

this Division.

  &quot;(2) For the purposes of Part IIIA:

  (a)  except for the purposes of determining the cost base to the taxpayer of

the asset - the asset is taken to have been acquired by the taxpayer on 30

June 1991; and

  (b)  the taxpayer is taken to have paid or given as consideration in respect

of the acquisition of the asset an amount equal to the market value of the

asset as at the end of 30 June 1991; and

June 1991.

  &quot;(3) Paragraphs 160ZZU (1) (a) and (b) do not apply in relation to the

taxpayer in relation to the asset.

  &quot;(4) If a provision of Part IIIA provides that, if a disposal of an asset

occurs within 12 months after the day (in this subsection called the

`acquisition day') on which the asset was acquired by a taxpayer, a reference

in another provision of that Part to the indexed cost base to the taxpayer in

respect of the asset is to be construed as a reference to the cost base to the

taxpayer in respect of the asset, paragraph (2) (a) of this section does not

apply for the purposes of determining the acquisition day for the purposes of

the first-mentioned provision.

  &quot;(5) If, as at the date on which a taxpayer disposes of an asset, the

taxpayer has complied with section 160zzu in relation to the asset, the

taxpayer may elect that this section does not apply in relation to the asset.

  &quot;(6) An election for the purposes of subsection (5) must be lodged with the

Commissioner on or before the date of lodgment of the taxpayer's return of

income for the year of income in which the disposal occurred or within such

further period as the Commissioner allows.

  &quot;(7) An expression used in this section and in Part IIIA has the same

meaning in this section as it has in that Part.&quot;.

the distribution or issue would have been attributable to the borrower's

holding of the borrowed security at a particular time during the borrowing

period.&quot;;

  (f) by inserting after subsection (4) the following subsections:

 &quot;(4A) If the lender receives a compensatory payment covered by

sub-subparagraph (3) (c) (v) (C), then, in determining whether an amount is

Modified application of bad debt provisions

  &quot;399A. (1) For the purposes of applying this Act in calculating the

attributable income of the eligible CFC for the eligible period:

  (a)  the amendment made to section 63 by section 13 of the Taxation Laws

Amendment Act 1991 is to be taken to have applied to debts created or acquired

at any time; and

  (b)  section 63D of this Act is to be disregarded; and

  (c)  subsection (2) of this section has effect.

  &quot;(2) Where:

  (a)  apart from this subsection, an amount would be a notional allowable

deduction to the eligible CFC under section 51 or 63 in respect of the writing

off of a debt as bad; and

  (b)  the debt was created or acquired in the ordinary course of a

money-lending business of the eligible CFC that carries on that business; and

  (c)  assuming that income:

    (i)  that has been derived by the eligible CFC in respect

of the debt; or

    (ii)  that would have been reasonably likely to have been

derived by the eligible CFC in respect of the debt if it had not become bad;

were instead derived by the eligible CFC during periods to which it may

reasonably be attributed, there would be a part or parts (which part or the

total of which parts is in this subsection called the `notional exempt income

period') of the period (in this subsection called the `eligible debt holding

period') beginning when the debt was so created or acquired, and ending when

it was written off, in respect of which some or all of that income would not

be included in the notional assessable income of the eligible CFC for any

statutory accounting period;

then only a proportion of the amount referred to in paragraph (a) is a

notional allowable deduction, being the proportion calculated using the

following formula:

    Eligible debt holding period - Notional exempt income period

                       Eligible debt term

where:

`Eligible debt holding period' means the number of days in the eligible debt

holding period;

`Notional exempt income period' means the number of days in the notional

exempt income period;

`Eligible debt term' means:

  (d)  where the debt was acquired from a person other than an associate,

within the meaning of Part IIIA - the number of days in the eligible debt

holding period; or

  (e)  in any other case - the number of days in the period beginning on the

day on which the debt was created (whether by the eligible CFC or another

person) and ending at the end of the day on which it was written off.

  &quot;(3) For the purposes of subsection (2):

  (a)  where a debt that is written off was acquired from another person, the

creation and any previous acquisition of the debt is to be disregarded, other

than for the purposes of paragraph (2) (e); and

  (b)  if, on the assumption in paragraph (2) (c), income would be derived by

the eligible CFC during a period before the first statutory accounting period

of the eligible CFC beginning on or after 1 July 1990, then, in spite of

anything in that paragraph, that income is taken not to be included in the

notional assessable income of the eligible CFC for any statutory accounting

period; and

  (c)  it is to be assumed that, for any statutory accounting period for which

there is no requirement to calculate the attributable income of the eligible

CFC in relation to the eligible taxpayer, there is such a requirement.&quot;.

  (a) by inserting after subsection (2) the following subsection:

     &quot;(2A) Where:

  (a)  a dividend is not taxed in a listed country at the country's normal

company tax rate because the whole or part of the dividend represents another

amount in respect of which foreign tax is payable under an accruals tax law of

the listed country; and

  (b)  that other amount is, under the accruals tax law, taxed in the listed

country at the country's normal company tax rate;

    the following provisions have effect:

  (c)  if:

    (i)  the whole of the dividend represents the other amount;

or

    (ii)  part of the dividend represents the other amount and,

on the assumption that section 325 applied to the remainder of the dividend as

if it were an entire dividend, the remainder of the dividend would be taxed in

the listed country at the country's normal company tax rate;

then subsection (1) does not apply in relation to the dividend;

  (d)  in any other case - the only application that subsection (1) has in

relation to the dividend is in respect of the remainder of the dividend as if

it were an entire dividend.&quot;;

  (b) by inserting after subsection (6) the following subsection:

     &quot;(6A) Where:

  (a)  either:

    (i)  the dividend referred to in subsection (3) (in this

subsection called a `dividend amount'); or

    (ii)  any amount (in this subsection also called a

`dividend amount') that would, as a result of the payment of the dividend

referred to in subsection (4) or (5), be included in the tax base of the CFC

or CFT, or of any partnership or trust, referred to in paragraph (4) (b) or

(5) (b), in respect of the holding of any interest or present entitlement

referred to in that paragraph;

is not taxed in a listed country at the country's normal company tax rate

because the whole or part of the dividend amount represents another amount (in

this subsection called the `accruals-taxed amount') in respect of which

foreign tax is payable under an accruals tax law of the listed country; and

  (b)  the accruals-taxed amount is, under the accruals tax law, taxed in the

listed country at the country's normal company tax rate;

the following provisions have effect:

  (c)  if:

    (i)  the whole of the dividend amount represents the

accruals-taxed amount; or

    (ii)  part of the dividend amount represents the accruals-taxed

amount and, on the assumption that section 325 applied to the remainder of the

dividend amount as if it were an entire dividend amount, the remainder of the

dividend amount would be taxed in the listed country at the country's normal

company tax rate;

then subsection (3), (4) or (5), as the case may be, does not apply in

relation to the dividend referred to in that subsection;

  (d)  in any other case - the only application that subsection (3), (4) or

(5), as the case may be, has in relation to the dividend referred to in that

subsection is in respect of a proportion of the dividend (as if it were an

entire dividend) calculated using the formula:

         Remainder

         ---------------   x    Dividend

         Dividend amount

where:

`Remainder' means the remainder of the dividend amount;

`Dividend amount' means the dividend amount;

`Dividend' means the amount of the dividend.&quot;.
