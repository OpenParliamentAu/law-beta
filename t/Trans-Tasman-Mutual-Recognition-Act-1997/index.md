 <dl compact=""><dl compact=""> <dt>(3)</dt><dd>The second exception is that the principle does not affect the operation of any laws of an Australian jurisdiction regarding the transportation, storage or handling of goods within the jurisdiction, so long as: </dd>

</dl></dl> 

	(a)	those laws apply equally to goods produced in or imported into the jurisdiction; and

###  TRANS-TASMAN MUTUAL RECOGNITION ACT 1997- SECT 13  Defences to offences regarding sale 
**  <dl compact=""><dl compact=""> <dt>(1)</dt><dd>It is a defence to a prosecution for an offence against a law of an Australian jurisdiction in relation to the sale of any goods if the defendant expressly claims that the Trans-Tasman mutual recognition principle applies and establishes that: </dd>

	(a)	the goods were labelled at the point of sale with a statement to the effect that the goods were produced in or imported into New Zealand; and
 	(b)	the defendant had no reasonable grounds for suspecting that they were not so produced or imported.
 <dl compact=""><dl compact=""> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>The defence is not available if the prosecution proves that the Trans-Tasman mutual recognition principle did not apply in the circumstances of the alleged offence (because for example the goods did not comply with requirements imposed by the law of New Zealand).</dd>

 <dt>(3)</dt><dd>Any relevant presumptions or evidentiary procedures under the law of New Zealand are available to the prosecution or defendant in relation to matters sought to be proved by the prosecution under subsection&#160;(2).</dd>
