Part 2—Goods
  
9  Trans-Tasman mutual recognition principle
	(1)	The Trans-Tasman mutual recognition principle as applying to goods is as set out in this Part.
	(2)	This Part deals with goods produced in or imported into New Zealand and their sale in Australia.
10  Entitlement to sell goods
		The Trans-Tasman mutual recognition principle is that, subject to this Part, goods produced in or imported into New Zealand, that may lawfully be sold in New Zealand, either generally or in particular circumstances, may, by virtue of this Act, be sold in an Australian jurisdiction either generally or in particular circumstances (as the case may be), without the necessity for compliance with further requirements imposed by or under the law of that jurisdiction as described in section 11.
11  Requirements that do not need to be complied with
		The further requirements referred to in section 10 are any one or more of the following requirements relating to sale that are imposed by or under the law of the Australian jurisdiction concerned:
	(a)	a requirement that the goods satisfy standards of the jurisdiction relating to the goods themselves, including for example requirements relating to their production, composition, quality or performance; 
	(b)	a requirement that the goods satisfy standards of the jurisdiction relating to the way the goods are presented, including for example requirements relating to their packaging, labelling, date stamping or age; 
	(c)	a requirement that the goods be inspected, passed or similarly dealt with in or for the purposes of the jurisdiction;
	(d)	a requirement that any step in the production of the goods not occur outside the jurisdiction;
	(e)	any other requirement relating to sale that would prevent or restrict, or would have the effect of preventing or restricting, the sale of the goods in the jurisdiction.
12  Requirements that do need to be complied with 
	(1)	The Trans-Tasman mutual recognition principle is subject to the exceptions specified in this section.
	(2)	The first exception is that the principle does not affect the operation of any laws of an Australian jurisdiction that regulate the manner of the sale of goods in the jurisdiction or the manner in which sellers conduct or are required to conduct their business in the jurisdiction (including laws set out in the examples below), so long as those laws apply equally to goods produced in or imported into the jurisdiction.
Examples:	Laws relating to the following:
	(a)	the contractual aspects of the sale of goods;
	(b)	the registration of sellers or other persons carrying on occupations;
	(c)	the requirement for business franchise licences;
	(d)	the persons to whom goods may or may not be sold;
	(e)	the circumstances in which goods may or may not be sold.
	(3)	The second exception is that the principle does not affect the operation of any laws of an Australian jurisdiction regarding the transportation, storage or handling of goods within the jurisdiction, so long as:
	(a)	those laws apply equally to goods produced in or imported into the jurisdiction; and 
	(b)	those laws are directed at matters affecting health and safety of persons in the jurisdiction or at preventing, minimising or regulating environmental pollution (including air, water, noise or soil pollution) in the jurisdiction.
	(4)	The third exception is that the principle does not affect the operation of any laws of an Australian jurisdiction regarding the inspection of goods within the jurisdiction, so long as:
	(a)	inspection or the requirement for inspection is not a prerequisite to the sale of the goods in the jurisdiction; and 
	(b)	those laws apply equally to goods produced in or imported into the jurisdiction; and 
	(c)	those laws are directed at matters affecting the health and safety of persons in the jurisdiction or at preventing, minimising or regulating environmental pollution (including air, water, noise or soil pollution) in the jurisdiction.
13  Defences to offences regarding sale
	(1)	It is a defence to a prosecution for an offence against a law of an Australian jurisdiction in relation to the sale of any goods if the defendant expressly claims that the Trans-Tasman mutual recognition principle applies and establishes that:
	(a)	the goods were labelled at the point of sale with a statement to the effect that the goods were produced in or imported into New Zealand; and
	(b)	the defendant had no reasonable grounds for suspecting that they were not so produced or imported.
	(2)	The defence is not available if the prosecution proves that the Trans-Tasman mutual recognition principle did not apply in the circumstances of the alleged offence (because for example the goods did not comply with requirements imposed by the law of New Zealand).
	(3)	Any relevant presumptions or evidentiary procedures under the law of New Zealand are available to the prosecution or defendant in relation to matters sought to be proved by the prosecution under subsection (2).
	(4)	Any relevant defences under the law of New Zealand are available to the defendant in relation to matters sought to be proved by the prosecution under subsection (2).
	(5)	This section does not affect any defence that is available apart from this section.
14  Goods that comply with local law
		Nothing in this Part prevents goods from being sold in an Australian jurisdiction if (apart from this Act) they comply with the relevant requirements of the law in force in the jurisdiction.

Part 3—Occupations
Division 1—Preliminary
15  Trans-Tasman mutual recognition principle
	(1)	The Trans-Tasman mutual recognition principle as applying to occupations is as set out in this Part.
	(2)	This Part deals with the ability of a person who is registered in connection with an occupation in New Zealand to carry on an equivalent occupation in Australia.
16  Entitlement to carry on occupation 
	(1)	The Trans-Tasman mutual recognition principle is that, subject to this Part, a person who is registered in New Zealand for an occupation is, by virtue of this Act, entitled after notifying the local registration authority of an Australian jurisdiction for the equivalent occupation:
	(a)	to be registered in the jurisdiction for the equivalent occupation; and 
	(b)	pending such registration, to carry on the equivalent occupation in the jurisdiction.
	(2)	However, the Trans-Tasman mutual recognition principle is subject to the exception that it does not affect the operation of laws that regulate the manner of carrying on an occupation in an Australian jurisdiction, so long as those laws:
	(a)	apply equally to all persons carrying on or seeking to carry on the occupation under the law of the jurisdiction; and 
	(b)	are not based on the attainment or possession of some qualification or experience relating to fitness to carry on the occupation.
17  Application of this Part
	(1)	This Part applies to individuals and occupations carried on by them.
	(2)	This Part extends to an occupation carried on by an individual, where the individual is subject to more than one system of registration or more than one local registration authority in a participating jurisdiction, and accordingly this Part applies in relation to each such system of registration and each such authority.
	(3)	Without limiting subsection (2), an example of such an occupation is that of a legal practitioner, which involves both the admission as a legal practitioner by a court and the issue of a practising certificate by another body.

Division 2—Entitlement to registration
18  Notification to local registration authority
	(1)	A person who is registered in New Zealand for an occupation may lodge a written notice with the local registration authority of an Australian jurisdiction for the equivalent occupation, seeking registration for the equivalent occupation in accordance with the Trans-Tasman mutual recognition principle.
	(2)	The notice must:
	(a)	state that the person is registered for the occupation in New Zealand; and 
	(b)	state the occupation for which registration is sought and that it is being sought in accordance with the Trans-Tasman mutual recognition principle; and 
	(c)	specify all the participating jurisdictions in which the person has substantive registration for equivalent occupations; and
	(d)	state that the person is not the subject of disciplinary proceedings in any participating jurisdiction (including any preliminary investigations or action that might lead to disciplinary proceedings) in relation to those occupations; and 
	(e)	state that the person's registration in any participating jurisdiction is not cancelled or currently suspended as a result of disciplinary action; and 
	(f)	state that the person is not otherwise personally prohibited from carrying on any such occupation in any participating jurisdiction, and is not subject to any special conditions in carrying on that occupation, as a result of criminal, civil or disciplinary proceedings in any participating jurisdiction; and
	(g)	specify any special conditions to which the person is subject in carrying on any such occupation in any participating jurisdiction; and 
	(h)	give consent to the making of inquiries of, and the exchange of information with, the authorities of any participating jurisdiction regarding the person's activities in the relevant occupation or occupations or otherwise regarding matters relevant to the notice.
	(3)	The notice must be accompanied by a document that is either the original or a copy of the instrument evidencing the person's existing registration (or, if there is no such instrument, by sufficient information to identify the person and the person's registration).
	(4)	As regards the instrument evidencing the person's existing registration, the person must certify in the notice that the accompanying document is the original or a complete and accurate copy of the original.
	(5)	The statements and other information in the notice must be verified by statutory declaration.
	(6)	The local registration authority may permit the notice to be amended after it is lodged.
19  Entitlement to registration and continued registration
	(1)	A person who lodges a notice under section 18 with a local registration authority of an Australian jurisdiction is entitled to be registered in the equivalent occupation, as if the law of the jurisdiction that deals with registration expressly provided that registration in New Zealand is a sufficient ground of entitlement to registration.
	(2)	The local registration authority may grant registration on that ground and may grant renewals of such registration.
	(3)	Once a person is registered on that ground, the entitlement to registration continues, whether or not registration (including any renewal of registration) ceases in New Zealand.
	(4)	Continuance of registration is otherwise subject to the laws of the jurisdiction, to the extent to which those laws:
	(a)	apply equally to all persons carrying on or seeking to carry on the occupation under the law of the jurisdiction; and 
	(b)	are not based on the attainment or possession of some qualification or experience relating to fitness to carry on the occupation.
	(5)	The local registration authority may impose conditions on registration, but may not impose conditions that are more onerous than would be imposed in similar circumstances (having regard to relevant qualifications and experience) if it were registration effected apart from this Part, unless they are conditions that apply to the person's registration in New Zealand or that are necessary to achieve equivalence of occupations.
	(6)	This section has effect subject to this Part.
20  Action following notice
	(1)	Registration must be granted within one month after the notice is lodged with the local registration authority under section 18.
	(2)	When granted, registration takes effect as from the date the notice was lodged.
	(3)	However, the local registration authority may, subject to this Part and within one month after the notice was lodged, postpone or refuse the grant of registration.
	(4)	If the local registration authority neither grants the registration nor takes action under subsection (3) within the period of one month after the notice is lodged, the person is entitled to registration immediately at the end of that period and no objection may be taken to the notice on any of the grounds on which refusal or postponement may be effected, except where fraud is involved.
21  Postponement of registration
	(1)	A local registration authority may postpone the grant of registration, if:
	(a)	any of the statements or information in the notice as required by section 18 are materially false or misleading; or 
	(b)	any document or information as required by section 18(3) has not been provided or is materially false or misleading; or 
	(c)	the circumstances of the person lodging the notice have materially changed since the date of the notice or the date it was lodged; or 
	(d)	the authority decides that the occupation in which registration is sought is not an equivalent occupation.
	(2)	If the grant of registration has been postponed, the local registration authority may in due course grant or refuse the registration.
	(3)	The local registration authority may not postpone the grant of registration for longer than a period of 6 months, and the person is entitled to registration immediately, at the end of that period, unless registration was refused at or before the end of that period.
	(4)	Nothing in subsection (3) prevents earlier registration from being granted on a review by the Australian Tribunal.
22  Refusal of registration
	(1)	A local registration authority may refuse the grant of registration, if:
	(a)	any of the statements or information in the notice as required by section 18 are materially false or misleading; or 
	(b)	any document or information as required by section 18(3) has not been provided or is materially false or misleading; or 
	(c)	the authority decides that the occupation in which registration is sought is not an equivalent occupation and equivalence cannot be achieved by the imposition of conditions.
	(2)	A decision to refuse to grant registration on the ground that the occupation in which registration is sought is not an equivalent occupation takes effect at the end of a specified period (not less than 2 weeks) after the person is notified of the decision, unless it has been previously revoked or there is an application for review to the Australian Tribunal, in which case the Tribunal may make whatever orders it considers appropriate.
23  Notification of decision 
		A local registration authority must give the person who lodges a notice in accordance with section 18 a notice in writing of its decision to grant registration, or to postpone or refuse the grant of registration, or to impose conditions on registration.

Division 3—Interim arrangements
24  Deemed registration
	(1)	A person who lodges a notice under section 18 with a local registration authority of an Australian jurisdiction is, pending the grant or refusal of registration, taken to be registered as provided in section 19.
	(2)	Such registration is called deemed registration in this Act.
	(3)	Deemed registration in one Australian jurisdiction does not of itself provide a basis for registration in another Australian jurisdiction.
25  Duration of deemed registration
	(1)	A person's deemed registration in an Australian jurisdiction continues until it is cancelled or suspended or otherwise ceases in accordance with this Part.
	(2)	A person's deemed registration in an Australian jurisdiction ceases if the person becomes substantively registered in the jurisdiction in connection with the occupation concerned.
	(3)	A person's deemed registration in an Australian jurisdiction ceases if the local registration authority of the jurisdiction refuses to grant registration, subject to any determination of the Australian Tribunal.
	(4)	A person's deemed registration in an Australian jurisdiction ceases if the person ceases to be substantively registered in every other participating jurisdiction mentioned in the notice as required by section 18(2)(c).
	(5)	A local registration authority of an Australian jurisdiction may cancel a person's deemed registration in the jurisdiction if the person requests cancellation.
	(6)	Deemed registration is not affected by postponement of the grant of substantive registration.
26  Activities under deemed registration
	(1)	A person who has deemed registration in an Australian jurisdiction may carry on the occupation in the jurisdiction as if the deemed registration were substantive registration in the jurisdiction.
	(2)	However, the person may do so only:
	(a)	within the limits conferred by the person's substantive registration in New Zealand; and
	(b)	within the limits conferred by the person's deemed registration in the Australian jurisdiction; and 
	(c)	subject to any conditions or undertakings applying to the person's registration in New Zealand, unless waived by the local registration authority of the Australian jurisdiction under this section; and 
	(d)	subject to any conditions applying to the person's deemed registration.
	(3)	Without limiting anything in this Division:
	(a)	the person may not carry on the occupation in the Australian jurisdiction without complying with any requirements regarding insurance, fidelity funds, trust accounts and the like that are designed to protect the public, clients, customers or others; and 
	(b)	a person who has deemed registration in an occupation in the Australian jurisdiction is subject to any disciplinary provisions and arrangements that are applicable to persons who are substantively registered in the jurisdiction; and 
	(c)	references in the law of the Australian jurisdiction to persons registered in an occupation under the law of the jurisdiction (however expressed) extend to persons who have deemed registration for the occupation under this Act.
	(4)	However, the local registration authority of the Australian jurisdiction may waive any condition imposed under the law of New Zealand, or any undertaking given to the local registration authority of New Zealand, if it thinks it appropriate in the circumstances.
	(5)	The local registration authority of the Australian jurisdiction may impose conditions as if deemed registration were substantive registration, but it must not impose conditions that are more onerous than would be imposed in similar circumstances (having regard to relevant qualifications and experience) if it were registration effected apart from this Part, unless they correspond to conditions or undertakings that apply to the person's registration in New Zealand or that are necessary to achieve equivalence of occupations.

Division 4—Equivalent occupations
27  Equivalent occupations
		The equivalence of occupations carried on in different participating jurisdictions is, for the purposes of this Act, to be determined in accordance with this Part.
28  General principle
	(1)	An occupation for which persons may be registered in New Zealand is taken to be equivalent to an occupation for which persons may be registered in an Australian jurisdiction if the activities authorised to be carried out under each registration are substantially the same (whether or not this result is achieved by means of the imposition of conditions).
	(2)	Conditions may be imposed on registration under this Part so as to achieve equivalence between occupations in different participating jurisdictions.
	(3)	This section has effect subject to any relevant declarations in force under this Division.
29  Declarations as to equivalent occupations
	(1)	This Part is to be given effect in accordance with relevant declarations (if any) made under this Division regarding equivalent occupations.
	(2)	If a declaration made by the Australian Tribunal under section 30 and a declaration made by Ministers under section 31 are inconsistent, the ministerial declaration prevails.
	(3)	A declaration under this Part does not affect the registration of any person already registered (except in the case of a declaration made by the Australian Tribunal in relation to that person specifically).
30  Declarations by Australian Tribunal
	(1)	On a review, the Australian Tribunal may make an order that a person who is registered in a particular occupation in New Zealand is or is not entitled to registration in an Australian jurisdiction in a particular occupation, and may specify or describe conditions that will achieve equivalence.
	(2)	On a review, the Australian Tribunal may make a declaration that occupations carried on in New Zealand and an Australian jurisdiction are not equivalent, but only if the Australian Tribunal is satisfied that:
	(a)	the activities involved in the occupations are not substantially the same (even with the imposition of conditions); or
	(b)	registration in New Zealand should not entitle registered persons to carry on a particular activity or class of activity in an Australian jurisdiction, where:
	(i)	the activity or class of activity is a material part of the practice of a person registered in New Zealand for the occupation; and
	(ii)	the activity or class of activity, if carried out by a person not conforming to the appropriate standards, could reasonably be expected to expose persons in the Australian jurisdiction to a real threat to their health or safety or could reasonably be expected to cause significant environmental pollution (including air, water, noise or soil pollution); and
	(iii)	it is not practicable to protect the health or safety of such persons from that threat or the environment from such pollution by regulating the manner in which services in the occupation are provided.
	(3)	The Registrar or other proper officer of the Australian Tribunal must cause a notice setting out the terms of a declaration under this section to be promptly published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette.
	(4)	A declaration made on the basis of paragraph (2)(b) has effect for no longer than 12 months, and the local registration authority must promptly notify appropriate authorities in each other participating jurisdiction of the declaration.

Part 4—Exclusions and exemptions
  
43  References to endorsing a proposed regulation
	(1)	For the purposes of this Part, a jurisdiction endorses a regulation if the designated person for the jurisdiction publishes a notice in the official gazette of the jurisdiction setting out and endorsing the terms of the regulation before it is made.
	(2)	However, the making of a recommendation by a Minister to the Governor-General for the making of a regulation amounts to endorsement of the regulation by the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth is taken to have endorsed the regulation for the purposes of this Part if the regulation is in fact made.
44  Exclusions
	(1)	This Act does not affect laws of an Australian jurisdiction specified or described in Schedule 1, to the extent that Schedule 1 indicates that they are excluded from the operation of this Act.
	(2)	The Governor-General may make regulations amending Schedule 1.
	(3)	A regulation may not be made for the purposes of this section unless all of the then participating jurisdictions have endorsed the regulation.
	(4)	However:
	(a)	if such a regulation merely omits or reduces the extent of an exclusion of a law of a State from Schedule 1, the regulation may be made if the State has endorsed the regulation; or
	(b)	if such a regulation amends Part 2 of Schedule 1 by substituting or adding a law of a State that relates to a matter referred to in paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (d) of subclause 1(1) of Part 1 of that Schedule, the regulation may be made if the State has endorsed the regulation.
45  Permanent exemptions
	(1)	This Act does not affect the operation of laws of an Australian jurisdiction specified or described in Schedule 2, to the extent that Schedule 2 indicates that they are exempt from the operation of this Act.
	(2)	Such an exemption may be limited or unlimited in its application. If a law is specified or described in Schedule 2 without any limitation, it is taken to be wholly exempt from the operation of this Act.
	(3)	The Governor-General may make regulations amending Schedule 2.
	(4)	A regulation may not be made for the purposes of this section unless all of the then participating jurisdictions have endorsed the regulation.
	(5)	However:
	(a)	if such a regulation relates solely to one or more laws specified or described in Schedule 3 and will not take effect within 5 years after the commencement of section 48, the regulation may be made if at least two-thirds of the then participating jurisdictions have endorsed the regulation; or
	(b)	if such a regulation merely omits or reduces the extent of an exemption of a law of a State from Schedule 2, the regulation may be made if the State has endorsed the regulation.
46  Temporary exemptions
	(1)	This Act does not:
	(a)	apply to the sale in an Australian jurisdiction of exempt goods; or
	(b)	affect the operation of exempt laws of an Australian jurisdiction relating to a particular kind of goods.
	(2)	For the purposes of this section, goods or laws are exempt if the goods are of a kind, or the laws are, for the time being declared by or under an Act or regulation of the jurisdiction to be exempt from the operation of this Act.
	(3)	Any such exemptions have effect only if they are substantially for the purpose of protecting the health and safety of persons in the jurisdiction or preventing, minimising or regulating environmental pollution (including air, water, noise or soil pollution) in the jurisdiction.
	(4)	No such exemption operates (together with the period of any previous exemption) for longer than a period of 12 months or an aggregate period of 12 months.
47  Continuation of temporary exemptions to enable implementation of ministerial agreements
	(1)	The purpose of this section is to create a mechanism to provide an additional period not exceeding 12 months for legislative or other action to be taken to implement a ministerial agreement arising out of consideration of an exemption under section 46. However, this subsection does not provide grounds for invalidating any regulations made for the purposes of this section.
	(2)	This Act does not:
	(a)	apply to the sale in an Australian jurisdiction of exempt goods; or
	(b)	affect the operation of exempt laws of an Australian jurisdiction relating to a particular kind of goods.
	(3)	For the purposes of this section, goods or laws are exempt if the goods are of a kind, or the laws are, for the time being declared by regulations under this Act to be exempt from the operation of this Act.
	(4)	The Governor-General may make regulations for the purposes of this section, but any such regulations may be made only if they have the effect of continuing or reviving, wholly or partly, and with or without modification, the effect of an exemption under section 46.
	(5)	Such a modification may only:
	(a)	in the case of an exemption relating to goods:
	(i)	limit the circumstances in which the goods are exempt; or
	(ii)	provide that the exemption does not apply if certain standards or conditions are complied with in relation to the goods; or
	(b)	in the case of an exemption relating to a law:
	(i)	modify the operation of the law while the exemption operates; or
	(ii)	provide that the exemption does not apply in relation to particular goods if certain standards or conditions are complied with in relation to the goods.
	(6)	The regulations may discontinue any exemption under this section.
	(7)	A regulation may not be made for the purposes of this section unless at least two-thirds of the then participating jurisdictions have endorsed the regulation.
	(8)	No exemption under this section operates (together with the period of any previous such exemption) for longer than a period of 12 months or an aggregate period of 12 months after the corresponding exemption under section 46 ceases to operate.
	(9)	In this section:
ministerial agreement means an agreement of Ministers of participating jurisdictions made in relation to goods or laws that are the subject of an exemption under section 46.
48  Special exemptions
	(1)	This Act does not affect the operation of laws of an Australian jurisdiction that relate to goods and that are specified or described in Schedule 3, to the extent that Schedule 3 indicates that they are exempt from the operation of this Act.
	(2)	Such an exemption operates for no longer than a period of 12 months after the commencement of this section, but may be extended in whole or in part by the regulations from time to time by one or more further periods each not exceeding 12 months.
	(3)	A regulation may not be made for the purposes of subsection (2) if the exemption has expired or has otherwise ceased to be in force.
	(4)	The Governor-General may make regulations amending Schedule 3 for the purposes of subsection (2) or (6).
	(5)	A regulation may not be made for the purposes of this section unless at least two-thirds of the then participating jurisdictions have endorsed the regulation.
	(6)	However, if such a regulation merely omits any matter relating to an exemption that has expired or has otherwise ceased to be in force, the regulation may be made if the Commonwealth has endorsed the regulation.
49  Exemptions relating to occupations
	(1)	This Act does not affect the operation of laws of an Australian jurisdiction that relate to occupations and that are specified or described in Schedule 4, to the extent that Schedule 4 indicates that they are exempt from the operation of this Act.
	(2)	The Governor-General may make regulations amending Schedule 4.
	(3)	A regulation may not be made for the purposes of this section unless all of the then participating jurisdictions have endorsed the regulation.
	(4)	However, if such a regulation amends Schedule 4 by omitting a law of a State, the regulation may be made if the State has endorsed the regulation.

51  Application of Trans-Tasman mutual recognition principle
	(1)	The Trans-Tasman mutual recognition principle and the provisions of this Act may be taken into consideration in proceedings of any kind and for any purpose.
	(2)	Nothing in this Act or the Mutual Recognition Act 1992 prevents a person from relying on the Trans-Tasman mutual recognition principle in relation to more than one Australian jurisdiction.
52  Machinery provisions regarding limitations etc.
		In cases where Part 3 provides that conditions or undertakings that apply or are relevant to registration in New Zealand also apply or are relevant to registration in an Australian jurisdiction, they are to be construed with any necessary adaptations, including the following (where appropriate and so far as practicable):
	(a)	references to New Zealand are to be read as references to the Australian jurisdiction;
	(b)	references to officers or authorities of New Zealand are to be read as references to the corresponding officers or authorities of the Australian jurisdiction.
53  Determining place of production
