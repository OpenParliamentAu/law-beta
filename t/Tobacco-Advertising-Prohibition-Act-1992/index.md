             (3)  Part 5 commences on 1 July 1993.

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Object

             (1)  This Act is intended to limit the exposure of the public to messages and images that may persuade them:

                     (a)  to start smoking, or to continue smoking; or

                     (b)  to use, or to continue using, tobacco products.

             (2)  The object is to improve public health.

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Act extends to external Territories

                   This Act extends to all the external Territories.

##### <a id="4A"></a>4A  Act not to apply so as to exceed Commonwealth power

             (1)  Unless the contrary intention appears, if a provision of this Act:

                     (a)  would, apart from this section, have an invalid application; but

                     (b)  also has at least one valid application;

it is the Parliament’s intention that the provision is not to have the invalid application, but is to have every valid application.

             (2)  Despite subsection (1), the provision is not to have a particular valid application if:

                     (a)  apart from this section, it is clear, taking into account the provision’s context and the purpose or object underlying this Act, that the provision was intended to have that valid application only if every invalid application, or a particular invalid application, of the provision had also been within the Commonwealth’s legislative power; or

                     (b)  the provision’s operation in relation to that valid application would be different in a substantial respect from what would have been its operation in relation to that valid application if every invalid application of the provision had been within the Commonwealth’s legislative power.

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not limit the cases in which a contrary intention may be taken to appear for the purposes of subsection (1).

             (4)  This section applies to a provision of this Act, whether enacted before, at or after the commencement of this section.

             (5)  This section is in addition to, and not in derogation of, section 15A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

                    <a name="invalid-applic"></a>**_invalid application_**, in relation to a provision, means an application because of which the provision exceeds the Commonwealth’s legislative power.

                    <a name="valid-applic"></a>**_valid application_**, in relation to a provision, means an application which, if it were the provision’s only application, would be within the Commonwealth’s legislative power.

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Act binds the Crown

             (1)  This Act binds the Crown in right of the Commonwealth, of each of the States, of the Australian Capital Territory, of the Northern Territory and of Norfolk Island.

             (2)  The Crown in a capacity covered by subsection (1) is not liable to be prosecuted for an offence against, or arising out of, this Act.

                   Chapter 2 (other than Part 2.5) of the _Criminal Code_ applies to all offences against this Act.

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Operation of State and Territory laws

             (1)  This Act does not exclude or limit the operation of a tobacco advertising law of a State or Territory that is capable of operating concurrently with this Act.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  particular conduct constitutes an offence against this Act; and

                     (b)  apart from this Act, that conduct also constitutes an offence against a tobacco advertising law of a State or Territory;

this Act does not exclude or limit the application of that law to that conduct.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  either:

                              (i)  particular conduct is permitted by section 14, 16, 17, 18, 19 or 20; or

                             (ii)  a person could, in respect of particular conduct, establish a defence referred to in section 21 or 22; and

                     (b)  apart from this Act, that conduct constitutes an offence against a tobacco advertising law of a State or Territory;

this Act does not exclude or limit the application of that law to that conduct.

Exception—political discourse

          (1A)  To remove any doubt, it is declared that if:

                     (a)  something (**_the advertisement_**) does not promote, and is not intended to promote, any particular tobacco product or particular range of tobacco products; and

                     (b)  the advertisement does not promote, and is not intended to promote, smoking; and

                     (c)  the advertisement relates solely to government or political matters;

the advertisement is not a tobacco advertisement for the purposes of this Act.

Use of name of manufacturer etc.

          (1B)  Without limiting the scope of paragraphs (1A)(a) and (b), the use in an advertisement of the whole name of a manufacturer, distributor or retailer of tobacco products does not, of itself, constitute:

                     (a)  promotion of a tobacco product or range of tobacco products for the purposes of paragraph (1A)(a); or

                     (b)  promotion of smoking for the purposes of paragraph (1A)(b).

Exception—words etc. on products, packaging and business documents

                     (a)  on a tobacco product; or

                     (b)  on the packaging of a tobacco product; or

                     (c)  as part of the standard wording of an invoice, statement, order form, letterhead, business card, cheque, manual, or other document, ordinarily used in the normal course of the business of a manufacturer, distributor or retailer of tobacco products;

do not, when so appearing, constitute a tobacco advertisement (but this does not prevent a still or moving picture, or other visual image, of a tobacco product, of the packaging of a tobacco product, or of a document referred to in paragraph (c), from being a tobacco advertisement).

Exception—words etc. on premises of manufacturers

             (3)  Words, signs or symbols that appear in or on land or buildings occupied by a manufacturer of tobacco products do not, when so appearing, constitute a tobacco advertisement (but this does not prevent a still or moving picture, or other visual image, of words, signs or symbols that so appear from being a tobacco advertisement).

Exceptions—management advertisements and certain advertisements as to availability of products

          (3A)  To remove any doubt, it is declared that the following do not constitute tobacco advertisements:

                     (a)  the doing of anything that is, or apart from this Act would be, required to be done by any other law of the Commonwealth or by any law of a State or Territory;

                     (b)  an advertisement (for example, an advertisement for staff or calling for tenders), relating to the internal management of the business of a manufacturer, distributor or retailer of tobacco products, that does not promote a tobacco product or smoking;

                     (c)  an advertisement by a manufacturer, distributor or retailer of tobacco products indicating that tobacco products, or tobacco products of a particular kind, are available from the manufacturer, distributor or retailer, as the case may be, provided that the advertisement does not:

                             (ii)  contain any other matter that would enable any individual product to be identified; or

                            (iii)  promote, or give publicity to, any individual product;

                     (d)  the taking of any action to prevent a product from causing injury to anyone, including action:

                              (i)  to recall a product; or

                             (ii)  to disclose a defect in, or a dangerous characteristic of, a product; or

                            (iii)  to disclose circumstances in which the use of a product is or may be dangerous; or

                            (iv)  to disclose procedures for disposing of a product; or

                             (v)  to tell people who have bought a product that the product will be repaired or replaced, or that the price of the product will be refunded.

Exception—non‑tobacco product having the same name as a tobacco product

          (3B)  If:

                     (a)  apart from this subsection, something (**_the advertisement_**) that relates to a non‑tobacco product would, technically, be a tobacco advertisement because the name, or part of the name, of the non‑tobacco product is the same as, or substantially similar to, the name, or part of the name, of:

                              (i)  a tobacco product; or

                             (ii)  the manufacturer, distributor or retailer of a tobacco product; and

                     (b)  the manufacturer of the non‑tobacco product is not associated in any way with the manufacturer of the tobacco product;

then, despite subsection (1), the advertisement is not a tobacco advertisement for the purposes of this Act.

Related bodies corporate taken to be associated with each other

          (3C)  Without limiting the circumstances in which 2 persons would, apart from this subsection, be taken to be associated with each other for the purposes of subsection (3B), 2 bodies corporate that are related to each other are taken to be associated with each other for the purposes of that subsection.

Exception—certain advertisements for non‑tobacco products

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  apart from this subsection, something (**_the advertisement_**) would, technically, be a tobacco advertisement because it gives publicity to, or otherwise promotes:

                              (i)  the purchase or use of a tobacco product or a range of tobacco products referred to in paragraph (1)(b); or

                             (ii)  the whole or a part of a trade mark registered as mentioned in paragraph (1)(c) in respect of goods that are or include tobacco products; or

                            (iii)  the whole or a part of a design registered as mentioned in paragraph (1)(d) in respect of articles that are or include tobacco products; or

                            (iv)  the whole or a part of the name of a person referred to in paragraph (1)(e); or

                             (v)  any words or designs, or combination of words and designs, associated as mentioned in paragraph (1)(f) with a tobacco product or a range of tobacco products; and

                     (b)  either:

                              (i)  if subparagraph (a)(i), (ii), (iii) or (v) applies, a tobacco product or tobacco products of a kind referred to in the subparagraph were sold in Australia on or before 1 January 1995; or

                             (ii)  if subparagraph (a)(iv) applies, the person referred to in that subparagraph was in existence under that name on 1 January 1995 or at a time before that date; and

                     (c)  the advertisement does not explicitly promote, or give publicity to, any particular tobacco product or particular range of tobacco products; and

                     (d)  the advertisement is not an advertisement in respect of whose publication section 21 would have applied if paragraphs (1)(c) and (d) of that section had not been enacted; and

                     (e)  the advertisement:

                              (i)  explicitly promotes, or gives publicity to; or

                             (ii)  appears on, or on the packaging of;

                            a product that is covered by a notice in force under subsection (5);

then, despite subsection (1), the advertisement is not a tobacco advertisement for the purposes of this Act.

Specification of classes of products for the purposes of subsection (4)

             (5)  For the purposes of subsection (4), the Minister may, by notice published in the _Gazette_, specify a class of products if, and only if:

                     (a)  the Minister is satisfied that:

                              (i)  the products are not tobacco products; and

                             (ii)  the products, or similar or substantially similar products, were available for purchase from a place in Australia before 1 April 1992; and

                     (b)  the Minister is satisfied that not specifying the class of products would cause significant financial detriment to the manufacturer of products in the class or to some other person involved in the distribution or sale of products in the class.

Note:          Section 29 provides for the making of applications to have classes of products specified in notices under this subsection.

When a notice under subsection (5) comes into force

             (6)  A notice under subsection (5) comes into force:

                     (a)  on the day when it is published in the _Gazette_; or

                     (b)  if a later day is specified in the notice as the day when it is to come into force—on that later day.

Exception—anti‑smoking advertisements

             (7)  If:

                     (a)  apart from this subsection, something (**_the advertisement_**) would, technically, be a tobacco advertisement; and

                     (b)  it is clear from the advertisement that its sole or principal purpose is to discourage smoking or the use of tobacco products;

then, despite subsection (1), the advertisement is not a tobacco advertisement for the purposes of this Act.
