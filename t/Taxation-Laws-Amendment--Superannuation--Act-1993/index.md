- SECT 13

  13\. After section 27A of the Principal Act the following section is

Special rules for death benefits

(Outline of section)

  &quot;27AAA.(1) This section:

  (a) defines the types of payments that are treated as death benefits for the

purpose of the rules providing for taxing of ETPs; and

  (b) provides concessional treatment for death benefits that are paid in

relation to dependants.

(Table of death benefits)

  &quot;(2) Table 1 sets out the payments that are death benefits for the purposes

of this section. In applying the table, the dependant's concessions provided

by this section are ignored in deciding whether a payment is covered by a

particular ETP paragraph.

                           and is made within the period

                           specified in subsection (7)

(Dependant's concession for Items 1 and 3)

  &quot;(3) In the case of a death benefit covered by Item 1 or 3 in Table 1, the

amount that would otherwise be an ETP in relation to the deceased taxpayer is

to be reduced by such amount (if any) as the Commissioner considers

appropriate having regard to the extent to which dependants of the deceased

taxpayer may reasonably be expected to benefit from the estate. However, the

ETP is not to be reduced to an amount less than the notional excessive

component (if any) that applies to the death benefit under subsection (5).

(Dependant's concession for Items 2 and 4)

  &quot;(4) This subsection applies if a death benefit covered by Item 2 or 4 in

Table 1 is paid to a taxpayer who was a dependant of the deceased person

referred to in the relevant ETP paragraph, either at the time of the deceased

person's death or at the time of payment of the death benefit. The amount that

would otherwise be an ETP in relation to the taxpayer is not to exceed the

notional excessive component (if any) that applies to the death benefit under

subsection (5).

(Notional excessive component of a death benefit)

  &quot;(5) The notional excessive component of a death benefit is the amount that

would be worked out under Division 14 as the excessive component of the death

benefit if the whole of the death benefit were treated as an ETP for the

purposes of that Division.

(Required link with deceased person for Item 4 death benefit)

  &quot;(6) In order to be covered by Item 4 in Table 1, the pension or annuity

that was commuted as mentioned in ETP paragraph (d) or (g) must be a pension

or annuity that:

  (a) before it became payable to the taxpayer, was payable to another person

who has died; or

  (b) became payable to the taxpayer because of the death of another person.

(Period for paying Item 4 death benefit)

  &quot;(7) In order to be covered by Item 4 in Table 1, the payment must be made:

- SECT 58

  58\. After section 6 of the Principal Act the following sections are

inserted:

Interpretation: defined benefit superannuation scheme

  &quot;6A.(1) Subject to subsection (2), a defined benefit superannuation scheme

is a scheme under which:

  (a) one or more members of the scheme are entitled, on retirement, to be

paid a benefit defined, wholly or in part, by reference to either or both of

the following:

    (i) the amount of the member's annual salary:

      (A) at the date of the member's retirement; or

      (B) at a date before retirement; or

      (C) averaged over a period of employment before retirement;

    (ii) a specified amount; and

  (b) if the scheme is not a public sector scheme-some or all of the

contributions under the scheme (out of which, together with earnings on those

contributions, the benefits are to be paid) are not paid into a fund, or

accumulated in a fund, in respect of any individual member but are paid into

and accumulated in a fund in the form of an aggregate amount.

  &quot;(2) A scheme embodied in the governing rules of a superannuation fund

(other than a scheme of the kind referred to in subsection (1)) is a defined

benefit superannuation scheme if a conversion notice has effect in relation to

the fund.

  &quot;(3) If the conversion notice is expressed to take effect on a day before

the day on which the notice is given, the scheme in question is taken to have

been a defined benefit superannuation scheme from the day on which the notice

is expressed to take effect.

  &quot;(4) Subsection (3) has effect regardless of the making of any assessment,

or the payment of any superannuation guarantee charge, in respect of a

contribution period that ended after the conversion notice took effect.

Interpretation: conversion notice

  &quot;6B.(1) A conversion notice is a written notice by the trustee of a

superannuation fund given to the Commissioner of Insurance and Superannuation

stating that the fund is to be treated as a defined benefit superannuation

scheme for the purposes of this Act.

  &quot;(2) Subject to subsection (4), a conversion notice takes effect in relation

to the fund on the day specified in the notice. Subject to subsection (4), the

trustee may, by written notice ('revocation notice') given to the Commissioner

of Insurance and Superannuation, revoke the conversion notice.

  &quot;(3) A conversion notice may be expressed to take effect on a day (whether

before or after the commencement of section 1 of the Taxation Laws Amendment

(Superannuation) Act 1993) that is not earlier than:

  (a) the first day of the year in which the notice is given; or

  (b) if the notice is given before 15 August in that year-the first day of

the preceding year.

  &quot;(4) A conversion notice or a revocation notice will not be effective

unless, before it is given, the trustee gives all employers contributing to

the fund for the benefit of employees written notice of:

  (a) the trustee's intention to give the notice; and

  (b) the proposed date of effect of the notice.

  &quot;(5) If an employer begins contributing to a superannuation fund for the

benefit of employees at a time when a conversion notice has effect in relation

to the fund, the trustee must give the employer written notice of:

  (a) the giving of the conversion notice; and

  (b) the date of effect of the notice;

within 30 days of the receipt by the trustee of the employer's first

contribution.

  &quot;(6) A notice under this section may be given by post.&quot;.
