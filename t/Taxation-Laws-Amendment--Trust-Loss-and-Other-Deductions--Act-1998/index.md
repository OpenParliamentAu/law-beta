### Division 265—Overview of Schedule

##### 265-5  What this Schedule is about

* * *

If there is a change in ownership or control of a trust or an abnormal trading in its units, it:

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•     may

be prevented from deducting its tax losses of earlier income years; and</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•     may

have to work out in a special way its net income and tax loss for the income

year; and</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•     may

be prevented from deducting certain amounts in respect of debts incurred in the

income year or earlier income years.</li>

This will not be the case if the trust is an excepted trust. However, if it became one by making a family trust election, a special tax may be payable on certain distributions and other amounts.

If a trust is involved in a scheme to take advantage of deductions, it may be prevented from making full use of them.

                              (i)  if the debt was incurred in an earlier income year—beginning on the day the debt was incurred and ending at the end of the income year; or

                             (ii)  if the debt was incurred in the income year—consisting of the income year; and

                     (c)  was not a widely held unit trust at all times in the test period; and

•   the conditions in section 266-45.

##### 266-40  The trust must pass 50% stake test 

                   The fixed trust must pass the 50% stake test for the test period.

             (1)  If the condition in section 266-40 is not met, the trust must satisfy the conditions in this section.

First condition

             (2)  At all times during the test period:

                     (a)  non-fixed trusts (other than family trusts) must have held fixed entitlements to a 50% or greater share of the income or a 50% or greater share of the capital of the trust; or

                     (b)  both:

                              (i)  a fixed trust or a company (which trust or company is the **_holding entity_**) must have held, directly or indirectly, all of the fixed entitlements to income and capital of the trust; and

                             (ii)  non-fixed trusts (other than family trusts) must have held fixed entitlements to a 50% or greater share of the income or a 50% or greater share of the capital of the holding entity.

Second condition

             (3)  The persons holding fixed entitlements to shares of the income, and the persons holding fixed entitlements to shares of the capital, of:

                     (a)  in a paragraph (2)(a) case—the trust; or

                     (b)  in a paragraph (2)(b) case—the holding entity;

at the beginning of the test period must have held those entitlements to those shares at all times during the test period.

Third condition

             (4)  At the beginning of the test period:

                     (a)  individuals must not have had more than a 50% stake in the income of the trust; or

                     (b)  individuals must not have had more than a 50% stake in the capital of the trust.

Fourth condition

             (5)  It must be the case that, for each non-fixed trust (other than an excepted trust) that, at any time in the test period, held directly or indirectly a fixed entitlement to a share of the income or capital of the trust:

                     (a)  if this section is being applied for the purposes of section 266-25—section 267-20 would not have prevented the non-fixed trust from deducting the tax loss concerned if it, rather than the fixed trust, had incurred the loss; or

                     (b)  if this section is being applied for the purposes of section 266-30—section 267-60 does not require the non-fixed trust to work out its net income and tax loss for the income year under Division 268; or

                     (c)  if this section is being applied for the purposes of section 266-35—section 267-25, or section 267-65, as the case requires, would not have prevented the non-fixed trust from deducting the amount concerned if it, rather than the fixed trust, would otherwise be entitled to deduct the amount.

##### 266-50  Deducting part of a tax loss

             (1)  If section 266-25 prevents the fixed trust from deducting a tax loss, it can deduct the part of the tax loss that is attributable to a part of the loss year.

             (2)  However, the trust can do this only if, assuming that that part of the loss year had been treated as the whole of the loss year for the purposes of sections 266-40 and 266-45, the trust would have been entitled to deduct the tax loss.

##### 266-55  Information about non-fixed trusts with interests in fixed trust

Notice about non-resident non-fixed trust

             (1)  The Commissioner may give the trustee of a fixed trust a notice in accordance with section 266-60 if the requirements of subsections (2) to (5) of this section are met.

First requirement

             (2)  In its return of income for an income year, the fixed trust:

                     (a)  must have deducted a tax loss from an earlier income year; or

                     (b)  must not have worked out its net income and tax loss for the income year under Division 268; or

                     (c)  must have deducted an amount in relation to a debt;

where it would not be allowed to deduct the tax loss or amount in respect of the debt, or would be required to work out its net income and tax loss under that Division, unless it met the conditions in section 266-45.

Second requirement

             (3)  In order to determine whether it meets the conditions in section 266-45, the Commissioner must need information about a non-fixed trust mentioned in subsection 266-45(5).

Third requirement

             (4)  When the Commissioner gives the notice:

                     (a)  a trustee of the non-fixed trust must be a non-resident; or

                     (b)  the central management and control of the non-fixed trust must be outside Australia.

Fourth requirement

             (5)  The Commissioner must give the notice before the later of:

                     (a)  5 years after the end of the income year mentioned in subsection (2); and

                     (b)  the end of the period during which the trustee of the fixed trust is required by section 262A to retain records in relation to that income year.

##### 266-60  Notices where requirements of section 266-55 are met

Information required

             (1)  The notice that the Commissioner may give if the requirements of subsections 266-55(2) to (5) are met must require the trustee to give the Commissioner specified information that is relevant to determining whether the requirements of subsection 266-45(5) are satisfied in relation to the non-fixed trust mentioned in subsections 266-55(3) and (4).

Trustee knowledge

             (2)  The information need not be within the knowledge of the trustee at the time the notice is given.

Period for giving information

             (3)  The notice must specify a period within which the trustee is to give the information. The period must not end earlier than 21 days after the day on which the Commissioner gives the notice.

Consequence of not giving the information

             (4)  If the trustee does not give the information within the period or within such further period as the Commissioner allows, the fixed trust is taken not to meet, and never to have met, the conditions in section 266-45.

Application of Division 268

             (5)  If, because of subsection (4), the fixed trust is required to work out under Division 268 its net income and tax loss for the income year mentioned in subsection 266-55(2), that Division is to be applied as if Subdivision 268-B required the income year to be divided into such periods as would result in the highest possible net income for the income year.

No offences or penalties

             (6)  To avoid doubt, subsections (4) and (5) do not cause the trustee of the fixed trust to commit any offence or be liable to any penalty under Part VII for deducting the amount concerned, or for not working out the trust’s net income and tax loss under Division 268, in its return.

#### Subdivision 266-C—Effect of change in ownership of unlisted widely held trust

##### 266-65  What this Subdivision is about

* * *

An unlisted widely held trust:

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•     cannot

deduct a tax loss from an earlier income year; or </li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•     has

to work out its net income and tax loss for the income year in a special way;

or</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•     cannot

deduct certain amounts in respect of debts;</li>

unless its ownership has been the same after any abnormal trading in its units and at the end of income years, during a certain period.

##### 266-130  Deducting part of a tax loss

             (1)  If section 266-110 prevents the trust from deducting a tax loss, it can deduct the part of the tax loss that is attributable to a part of the loss year.

             (2)  However, the trust can do this only if, assuming that that part of the loss year had been treated as the whole of the loss year for the purposes of section 266-125, the trust would have been entitled to deduct the tax loss.

             (3)  Also, the trust cannot deduct the part of the tax loss, or some of it, if section 266-135 (which deals with certain debt deductions) prevents it from doing so.

Trust must satisfy condition if debt deduction etc.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  there would have been no otherwise-deductible loss, or its amount would have been smaller, if the trust had not (after applying section 266-120) been able to deduct in the loss year an amount:

                              (i)  under section 51 or 63, or under section 8-1 or 25-35 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, in respect of the writing off of the whole or part of a debt as bad; or

                             (ii)  under subsection 63E(3) or (4) in respect of a debt/equity swap relating to the whole or part of a debt; and

                     (b)  the trust could only deduct the amount in respect of the debt because it passed the same business test as mentioned in paragraph 266-125(2)(b); and

                     (c)  the Commissioner considers that the trust passed the same business test as mentioned in that paragraph for the purpose, or for purposes including the purpose, of being able to deduct the amount because of that paragraph;

the trust cannot deduct the otherwise-deductible loss, or can only deduct the smaller amount mentioned in paragraph (a) of this section, unless it meets the condition in subsection (3).

* * *

##### 266-180  Information about family trusts with interests in other trusts

Notice about family trust

             (1)  The Commissioner may give the trustee of a trust (the **_primary trust_**) a notice in accordance with section 266-185 if the requirements of subsections (2) to (5) of this section are met.

First requirement

             (2)  In its return of income for an income year, the primary trust:

                     (a)  must have deducted a tax loss from an earlier income year; or

                     (b)  must not have worked out its net income and tax loss for the income year under Division 268; or

                     (c)  must have deducted an amount in relation to a debt;

where it would not be allowed to deduct the tax loss or amount in respect of the debt, or would be required to work out its net income and tax loss under that Division, if it did not meet a condition or conditions as mentioned in section 266-40, 266-45, 266-90, 266-125 or 266-165 (the **_conditions provision_**).

Second requirement

             (3)  The Commissioner must be satisfied that the primary trust would not meet the condition or conditions if one or more trusts were not family trusts.

Third requirement 

             (4)  When the Commissioner gives the notice, for at least one of the family trusts:

                     (a)  a trustee of the trust must be a non-resident; or

                     (b)  the central management and control of the trust must be outside Australia.

Fourth requirement

             (5)  The Commissioner must give the notice before the later of:

                     (a)  5 years after the end of the income year to which the return relates; and

                     (b)  the end of the period during which the trustee of the primary trust is required by section 262A to retain records in relation to that income year.

##### 266-185  Notices where requirements of section 266-180 are met

Information required

             (1)  The notice that the Commissioner may give if the requirements of subsections 266-180(2) to (5) are met must require the trustee of the primary trust to give the Commissioner specified information about conferrals of present entitlements to, and distributions of, income and capital, since the start of the test period mentioned in the conditions provision, by all of the family trusts meeting the requirements of paragraph 266-180(4)(a) or (b).

Trustee knowledge

             (2)  The information need not be within the knowledge of the trustee at the time the notice is given.

Period for giving information

             (3)  The notice must specify a period within which the trustee is to give the information. The period must not end earlier than 21 days after the day on which the Commissioner gives the notice.

Consequence of not giving the information

             (4)  If the trustee does not give the information within the period or within such further period as the Commissioner allows, the primary trust is taken not to meet, and never to have met, the condition or conditions in the conditions provision. 

             (5)  If, because of subsection (4), the fixed trust is required to work out under Division 268 its net income and tax loss for the income year mentioned in subsection 266-180(2), that Division is to be applied as if Subdivision 268-B required the income year to be divided into such periods as would result in the highest possible net income for the income year.

No offences or penalties

             (6)  To avoid doubt, subsections (4) and (5) do not cause the trustee of the primary trust to commit any offence or be liable to any penalty under Part VII for deducting the amount concerned, or for not working out the trust’s net income and tax loss under Division 268, in the trust’s return.

Commissioner discretion

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  after the test time, some or all of the threshold group cease to have a 50% stake in the income or capital of the trust at a particular time; and

                     (b)  having regard to the likely manner of exercise of any discretion of the trustee to distribute income or capital of the trust after the particular time and to any other relevant matter, the Commissioner considers it fair and reasonable that the individuals should be taken to have the stake at the particular time and at all later times in the test period;

             (2)  However, the trust can do this only if, assuming that that part of the loss year had been treated as the whole of the loss year for the purposes of sections 267-40 and 267-45, the trust would have been entitled to deduct the tax loss.

                     (a)  was a non-fixed trust at any time in the income year (the **_test period_**); and

                     (b)  was not an excepted trust at all times in the test period;

must work out its net income and tax loss for the income year under Division 268 (How to work out a trust’s net income and tax loss for the income year), unless it meets:

•   the condition in subsection 267-70(2) (if applicable); and

•   the condition in section 267-75.

To find out the meaning of **_excepted trust_**: see section 272-100.

##### 267-65  Non-fixed trust may be denied debt deduction

Type of trust to which this section applies

             (1)  This section applies to a trust that:

                     (a)  can deduct in the income year (the **_test period_**) an amount:

                              (i)  under section 51 or 63 in respect of the writing off of the whole or part of a debt, incurred in the income year, as bad; or

                             (ii)  under subsection 63E(3) or (4) in respect of a debt/equity swap relating to the whole or part of a debt incurred in the income year; and

                     (b)  was a non-fixed trust at any time in the test period; and

                     (c)  was not an excepted trust at all times in the test period.

Condition for deducting amount

             (2)  The trust cannot deduct the amount unless it meets

•   the condition in subsection 267-70(2) (if applicable); and

•   the condition in section 267-75.

##### 267-70  If there are individuals with more than a 50% stake in income or capital, more than a 50% stake in income or capital must be maintained

When trust must meet condition

             (1)  If at any time (the **_test time_**) in the test period, individuals (the **_threshold group_**) have more than a 50% stake in the income or capital of the trust, the trust must meet the condition in subsection (2).

To find out whether individuals have more than a 50% stake in the income or capital of the trust: see Subdivision 268-C.

Condition

             (2)  The condition is that, during the period beginning at the test time and finishing at the end of the test period, the same individuals (who must be some or all of the threshold group) must have more than a 50% stake in the income or the capital, respectively, of the trust.

Commissioner discretion

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  after the test time, some or all of the threshold group cease to have a 50% stake in the income or capital of the trust at a particular time; and

                     (b)  having regard to the likely manner of exercise of any discretion of the trustee to distribute income or capital of the trust after the particular time and to any other relevant matter, the Commissioner considers it fair and reasonable that the individuals should be taken to have the stake at the particular time and at all later times in the test period;

the individuals are taken to have that stake at the particular time and at all later times in the test period.

##### 267-75  Group must not begin to control trust

                   A group must not, during the test period, begin to control the trust directly or indirectly.

To find out what it means for a group to control the trust: see Subdivision 269-E.

#### Subdivision 267-D—Information about family trusts with interests in other trusts

##### 267-80  What this Subdivision is about

* * *

If a trust would only avoid the tax consequences of this Division because of interests held by a non-resident family trust, the Commissioner may require the trust to give certain information about the non-resident family trust. If it is not given, the trust does not avoid the tax consequences of this Division.

* * *

##### 267-85  Information about family trusts with interests in other trusts

Notice about family trust

             (1)  The Commissioner may give the trustee of a trust (the **_primary trust_**) a notice in accordance with section 267-90 if the requirements of subsections (2) to (5) of this section are met.

First requirement

             (2)  In its return of income for an income year, the primary trust:

                     (a)  must have deducted a tax loss from an earlier income year; or

                     (b)  must not have worked out its net income and tax loss for the income year under Division 268; or

                     (c)  must have deducted an amount in relation to a debt;

where it would not be allowed to deduct the tax loss or amount in respect of the debt, or would be required to work out its net income and loss under that Division, if it did not meet a condition or conditions as mentioned in section 267-40 or 267-70 (the **_conditions provision_**).

Second requirement

             (3)  The Commissioner must be satisfied that the primary trust would not meet the condition or conditions if one or more trusts were not family trusts.

Third requirement 

             (4)  When the Commissioner gives the notice, for at least one of the family trusts:

                     (a)  a trustee of the trust must be a non-resident; or

                     (b)  the central management and control of the trust must be outside Australia.

Fourth requirement

             (5)  The Commissioner must give the notice before the later of:

                     (a)  5 years after the end of the income year to which the return relates; and

                     (b)  the end of the period during which the trustee of the primary trust is required by section 262A to retain records in relation to that income year.

##### 267-90  Notices where requirements of section 267-85 are met

Information required

             (1)  The notice that the Commissioner may give if the requirements of subsections 267-85(2) to (5) are met must require the trustee to give the Commissioner specified information about conferrals of present entitlements to, and distributions of, income and capital, since the start of the test period mentioned in the conditions provision, by all of the family trusts meeting the requirements of paragraph 267-85(4)(a) or (b).

Trustee knowledge

             (2)  The information need not be within the knowledge of the trustee at the time the notice is given.

Period for giving information

             (3)  The notice must specify a period within which the trustee is to give the information. The period must not end earlier than 21 days after the day on which the Commissioner gives the notice.

Consequence of not giving the information

             (4)  If the trustee does not give the information within the period or within such further period as the Commissioner allows, the primary trust is taken not to meet, and never to have met, the condition or conditions in the conditions provision.

Application of Division 268

             (5)  If, because of subsection (4), the fixed trust is required to work out under Division 268 its net income and tax loss for the income year mentioned in subsection 267-85(2), that Division is to be applied as if Subdivision 268-B required the income year to be divided into such periods as would result in the highest possible net income for the income year.

No offences or penalties

             (6)  To avoid doubt, subsections (4) and (5) do not cause the trustee of the primary trust to commit any offence or be liable to any penalty under Part VII for deducting the amount concerned, or for not working out the trust’s net income and tax loss under Division 268, in the trust’s return.

### Division 268—How to work out a trust’s net income and tax loss for the income year

#### Subdivision 268-A—Overview of Division

##### 268-5  What this Division is about

* * *

This Division requires a trust’s net income and tax loss to be worked out in a special way. The income year is divided into periods as the basis for the calculation.

* * *

#### Subdivision 268-B—Dividing the income year into periods

##### 268-10  Income year of fixed trust to be divided into periods—first case

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a trust’s net income and tax loss for the income year are required by section 266-30 to be worked out under this Division; and

                     (b)  the trust did not meet the requirements of subsections 266-45(2) and (4);

the income year is divided into periods as follows.

             (2)  The first period starts at the start of the income year. Each later period starts immediately after the end of the previous period.

             (3)  The last period ends at the end of the income year. Each period (except the last) ends at the latest time that would result in the trust passing the 50% stake test for the whole of the period.

##### 268-15  Income year of fixed trust to be divided into periods—second case

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a trust’s net income and tax loss for the income year are required by section 266-30 to be worked out under this Division; and

                     (b)  the trust met the requirements of subsections 266-45(2) and (4);

the income year is divided into periods as follows.

             (2)  The first period starts at the start of the income year. Each later period starts immediately after the end of the previous period.

             (3)  The last period ends at the end of the income year. Each period (except the last) ends at the earliest of:

                     (a)  the latest time that would result in the persons holding fixed entitlements to shares of the income or shares of the capital of:

                              (i)  if the trust met the requirements of paragraph 266-45(2)(a)—the trust; or

                             (ii)  if the trust met the requirements of paragraph 266-45(2)(b)—the holding entity mentioned in that paragraph;

                            and the percentages of the shares that they hold, remaining the same during the whole of the period; and

                     (b)  the times that, for all of the non-fixed trusts (other than excepted trusts) holding directly or indirectly a fixed entitlement to a share of the income or capital of the trust at any time during the income year, are the latest times that would result in individuals having more than a 50% stake in their income or capital; and

                     (c)  the earliest time in the period when a group begins to control a non-fixed trust (other than an excepted trust) that holds directly or indirectly a fixed entitlement to a share of the income or capital of the trust at any time during the income year.

To find out when a group begins to control a trust: see Subdivision 269-E.

##### 268-20  Income year of widely held unit trust to be divided into periods

             (1)  If a trust’s net income and tax loss for the income year are required by section 266-80, 266-115 or 266-155 to be worked out under this Division, the income year is divided into periods as follows.

             (2)  The first period starts at the start of the income year. Each later period starts immediately after the end of the previous period.

             (3)  The last period ends at the end of the income year. Each period (except the last) ends at the earliest time at which there is an abnormal trading in the trust’s units, where the trust does not pass the 50% stake test in respect of the following times:

                     (a)  the beginning of the period;

                     (b)  immediately after the abnormal trading.

             (4)  However, if the trust is a listed widely held trust, what would otherwise be 2 or more successive periods are treated as a single period if during all of them the trust passed the same business test in relation to the time immediately before the end of the first of the successive periods.

##### 268-25  Income year of non-fixed trust to be divided into periods

             (1)  If a trust’s net income and tax loss for the income year are required by section 267-60 to be worked out under this Division, the income year is divided into periods as follows.

             (2)  The first period starts at the start of the income year. Each later period starts immediately after the end of the previous period.

             (3)  The last period ends at the end of the income year.

             (4)  If the condition in subsection 267-70(2) applies but the trust does not meet the condition, each period (except the last) ends at the earlier of:

                     (a)  the latest time, after the test time mentioned in that section, that would result in the same individuals having more than a 50% stake in the income or the capital, as the case requires, of the trust during the whole of the period; or

                     (b)  the earliest time when a group begins to control the trust directly or indirectly.

             (5)  If the condition in subsection 267-70(2) does not apply, or does apply and the trust meets the condition, each period (except the last) ends at the earliest time when a group begins to control the trust directly or indirectly.

#### Subdivision 268-C—Other steps in working out the net income and tax loss

##### 268-30  Calculate the notional loss or net income for each period

             (1)  A notional loss or notional net income of the trust must be worked out for each period into which the income year has been divided in accordance with Subdivision 268-B.

             (2)  The trust has a notional loss for a period if the deductions attributed to the period under section 268-35 exceed the assessable income attributed to the period under section 268-40\. The **_notional loss_** is the amount of the excess.

For a period during which the trust was in partnership, the notional loss is worked out under Subdivision 268-D.

             (3)  On the other hand, if that assessable income exceeds those deductions, the trust has a **_notional net income_** for the period, equal to the excess.

For a period during which the trust was in partnership, the notional net income is worked out under Subdivision 268-D.

             (4)  If the trust has a notional loss for _none_ of the periods in the income year, this Subdivision has no further application, and the trust’s net income for the income year is calculated in the usual way.

The usual way of working out net income is set out in section 95.

##### 268-35  How to attribute deductions to periods

             (1)  The trust’s deductions for the income year are attributed to periods in the income year as follows.

             (2)  The following deductions are attributed to each period in proportion to the length of the period:

                     (a)  deductions for depreciation;

See section 54, and Division 42 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

                     (b)  deductions for exploration or prospecting expenditure, or allowable capital expenditure, in connection with mining or quarrying, if the trust has elected that the deductions not be limited by the available assessable income;

See Divisions 10, 10AAA and 10AB of Part III, and Division 330 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997._

                     (c)  deductions for expenditure, deductions for which are spread over 2 or more years, but not:

                              (i)  deductions for exploration or prospecting expenditure, or capital expenditure, in connection with mining or quarrying; or

See Divisions 10, 10AAA and 10AB of Part III, and Division 330 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

                             (ii)  full year deductions (see subsection (5));

                     (d)  deductions for expenditure of capital monies in connection with an Australian film.

See section 124ZAFA.

             (3)  All other deductions (except full year deductions) are attributed to periods as if each period were an income year.

             (4)  Full year deductions are not attributed to any of the periods. They are brought in at a later stage of the process of calculating the trust’s net income for the income year.

             (5)  These are **_full year deductions_**:

                     (a)  deductions for bad debts under section 51 (Losses and outgoings), or under section 8-1 (about general deductions) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_;

                     (b)  deductions for bad debts under section 63 (Bad debts), or under section 25-35 (about bad debts) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, or for losses on debt/equity swaps under section 63E;

                     (c)  deductions, so far as they are allowable under section 51, or under Division 8 (which is about deductions) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, because Subdivision H (Period of deductibility of certain advance expenditure) of Division 3 of Part III applies to the trust in relation to the income year;

                     (d)  deductions allowable under section 78 (Gifts, pensions etc.) or 78B (Promoters recoupment tax) or under Division 30 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_;

                     (e)  deductions for payments of pensions, gratuities or retiring allowances under section 25-50 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_;

                      (f)  deductions for tax losses of earlier income years;

See sections 79E, 79F, 80, 80AAA and 80AA, and Division 36 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

                     (g)  deductions for allowable capital expenditure in connection with mining or quarrying, except so far as the trustee has elected that the deductions not be limited by the available assessable income;

See Divisions 10, 10AAA and 10AB of Part III, and Division 330 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

                     (h)  deductions for exploration or prospecting expenditure in connection with mining or quarrying, except so far as the trustee has elected that the deductions not be limited by the available assessable income;

See Divisions 10, 10AAA and 10AB of Part III, and Division 330 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_

                      (i)  deductions for Income Equalization Deposits.

See Division 16C of Part III.

             (6)  However, a deduction for the balance of capital expenditure is _not_ a full year deduction if the deduction results from the disposal, loss, lapse, termination of use or destruction of the property.

See section 59, and subsection 330-485(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

##### 268-40  How to attribute assessable income to periods

             (1)  The trust’s assessable income for the income year is attributed to periods in the income year as follows.

             (2)  The following amounts are attributed to periods so far as they are reasonably attributable to those periods:

                     (a)  amounts included in the trust’s assessable income under section 97 (Beneficiary of a trust estate not under a legal disability); or

                     (b)  amounts included in the trust’s assessable income under section 98A (Non-resident beneficiaries assessable in respect of certain income).

             (3)  The following items of assessable income are attributed to each period in proportion to the length of the period:

                     (a)  insurance recoveries for loss of livestock or trees;

See section 26B, and section 385-130 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

                     (b)  amounts included in assessable income as a result of elections relating to the forced disposal of livestock; 

See sections 36, 36AAA and 36AA, and Subdivision 385-E and section 385-160 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

                     (c)  recoupment of mains electricity connection expenditure.

See section 70A, and item 1.16 in section 20-30, which lists deductions for which recoupments are assessable under Subdivision 20-A, of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

             (4)  An amount included in the trust’s assessable income under section 26BA (Double wool clips), or under section 385-185 (Election to defer including profit on second wool clip) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, is attributed to the period when the wool would ordinarily have been shorn.

             (5)  An amount included in the trust’s assessable income that is a dividend under:

                     (a)  section 65 (Payments to associated persons); or

                     (b)  section 108 (Loans to shareholders and associates); or

                     (c)  section 109 (Excessive payments to shareholders and associates);

is attributed to the period when the amount was paid or credited, whichever occurred first.

             (6)  All other items of assessable income (except full year amounts) are attributed to periods as if each period were an income year.

             (7)  **_Full year amounts_** are amounts referred to in paragraphs (2)(a) and (b), so far as they are not reasonably attributable to a period. They are brought in at a later stage of the process of calculating the trust’s net income for the income year.

##### 268-45  How to calculate the trust’s net income for the income year

             (1)  The trust’s **_net income_** for the income year is worked out as follows.

             (2)  Add up the notional net incomes (if any) worked out under section 268-30 or 268-70.

Note:          A notional **_loss_** for a period is _not_ taken into account, but counts towards the trust’s tax loss for the income year.

             (3)  Add the full year amounts referred to in subsection 268-40(7) (if any).

             (4)  Subtract the trust’s full-year deductions of these kinds:

                     (a)  deductions for bad debts under section 51 (Losses and outgoings), or under section 8-1 (about general deductions) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_;

                     (b)  deductions for bad debts under section 63 (Bad debts), or under section 25-35 (about bad debts) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_;

                     (c)  deductions, so far as they are allowable under section 51, or under Division 8 (which is about deductions) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, because Subdivision H (Period of deductibility of certain advance expenditure) of Division 3 of Part III applies to the trust in relation to the income year;

unless they exceed the total of the notional net incomes and the full year amounts. (If they equal or exceed that total, the trust does not have a net income for the income year.)

             (5)  If an amount remains, subtract from it the trust’s other full year deductions, in the order shown in subsection 268-35(5), unless they exceed the amount remaining. (If they equal or exceed that amount, the trust does not have a net income for the income year.)

             (6)  The amount (if any) remaining is the trust’s **_net income_** for the income year.

##### 268-50  How to calculate the trust’s section 79E loss for the income year

             (1)  For the purposes of section 79E (General domestic losses of post-1989 years of income), instead of working out the trust’s loss for the year under subsection (1) of that section, it is worked out as follows.

             (2)  Total the notional losses worked out under section 268-30 or 268-70.

             (3)  Add to the total in subsection (2) the amount (if any) by which the trust’s full year deductions of these kinds:

                     (a)  deductions for bad debts under section 51 (Losses and outgoings);

                     (b)  deductions for bad debts under section 63 (Bad debts);

                     (c)  deductions, so far as they are allowable under section 51 of this Act because Subdivision H (Period of deductibility of certain advance expenditure) of Division 3 of Part III applies to the trust in relation to the income year;

exceed the total of:

                     (d)  the notional net incomes (if any); and

To work out the notional net income: see sections 268-30 and 268-70.

                     (e)  the full year amounts referred to in section 268-40 (if any).

             (4)  If the trust derived exempt income, subtract its net exempt income as defined in subsection 79E(12).

             (5)  Any amount remaining is the trust’s loss for the income year.

To find out _how much_ of the loss can be deducted in later income years, see Division 266 or 267.

To find out _how_ to deduct it, see section 79E.

##### 268-55  How to work out the trust’s film loss for the income year

             (1)  For the purposes of section 79F (Film losses of post-1989 years of income), instead of working out the trust’s film loss for the year under subsection (1) of that section, it is worked out as follows.

             (2)  Apply subsections 268-50(2) and (3), making the following changes:

                     (a)  take into account assessable film income (as defined in subsection 79F(12)), but not any other assessable income;

                     (b)  take into account film deductions (as defined in subsection 79F(12)), but not any other allowable deductions.

             (3)  If the trust derived exempt film income (as defined in subsection 79E(12)), subtract from the amount worked out under subsection (2) of this section the trust’s net exempt film income (as defined in subsection 79E(12)).

             (4)  Apply section 268-50.

             (5)  The trust’s film loss for the income year is the amount worked out under subsection (3), to the extent that it is not greater than the amount worked out under subsection (4).

##### 268-60  How to work out the trust’s section 36-10 tax loss for the income year

             (1)  For the purposes of Division 36 (Tax losses of earlier income years) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, instead of working out the trust’s tax loss for the year under section 36-10 of that Act, it is worked out as follows.

             (2)  Total the notional losses.

             (3)  Add the amount (if any) by which the trust’s full year deductions of these kinds:

                     (a)  deductions for bad debts under section 8-1 (about general deductions) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_;

                     (b)  deductions for bad debts under section 25-35 ( about bad debts) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_;

                     (c)  deductions, so far as they are allowable under Division 8 (which is about deductions) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ because Subdivision H (Period of deductibility of certain advance expenditure) of Division 3 of Part III applies to the trust in relation to the income year;

exceed the total of:

                     (d)  the notional net incomes (if any); and

To work out the notional net income: see sections 268-30 and 268-70.

                     (e)  the full year amounts referred to in section 268-40 (if any).

             (4)  If the trust derived exempt income, subtract its net exempt income as defined in section 36-20 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

             (5)  Any amount remaining is the trust’s tax loss for the income year.

To find out _how much_ of the tax loss can be deducted in later income years, see Division 266 or 267.

To find out _how_ to deduct it, see section 36-15 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

##### 268-65  How to work out the section 375-805 film component of the trust’s tax loss for the income year

             (1)  For the purposes of Subdivision 375-G (Film losses) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, instead of working out the film component of a tax loss of the trust for the income year under section 375-805 of that Act, it is worked out as follows.

             (2)  Apply subsections 268-60(2) and (3), making the following changes:

                     (a)  take into account assessable film income (as defined in subsection 375-805(3) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_), but not any other assessable income;

                     (b)  take into account film deductions (as defined in subsection 375-805(2) of that Act), but not any other allowable deductions.

             (3)  If the trust derived exempt film income (as defined in subsection 375-805(5) of that Act), subtract from the amount worked out under subsection (2) of this section the trust’s net exempt film income (as defined in subsection 375-805(4) of that Act).

             (4)  Apply section 268-60.

             (5)  The film component of the tax loss of the trust for the income year is the amount worked out under subsection (3), to the extent that it is not greater than the amount worked out under subsection (4).

#### Subdivision 268-D—Rules that supplement Subdivision 268-C if the trust is in partnership 

##### 268-70  How to calculate the trust’s notional loss or net income for a period when the trust was a partner

             (1)  This section applies if at any time during a period the trust was a partner in one or more partnerships.

             (2)  The trust has a notional loss for the period if the total (the **_loss total_**) of:

                     (a)  the deductions attributed to the period under section 268-35; and

                     (b)  the trust’s share of each notional loss (if any) of a partnership for the period;

exceeds the total (the **_income total_**) of:

                     (c)  the assessable income attributed to the period under section 268-40; and

                     (d)  the trust’s share of each notional net income (if any) of a partnership for the period.

The **_notional loss_** is the amount of the excess.

Note:          A notional loss is taken into account in working out the trust’s tax loss under section 268-50 or 268-60.

             (3)  On the other hand, if the income total exceeds the loss total, the trust has a **_notional net income_** for the period, equal to the excess.

Note:          A notional net income is taken into account in working out the trust’s net income under section 268-45.

             (4)  If the trust has a notional net income for _all_ periods in the income year, this Subdivision has no further application, and the trust’s net income for the income year is worked out in the usual way.

The usual way of working out net income is set out in section 95.

##### 268-75  How to calculate the trust’s share of a partnership’s notional loss or notional net income for a period if both entities have the same income year

             (1)  This section applies if at any time during a period the trust is a partner in a partnership that has an income year that starts and ends when the trust’s income year starts and ends.

             (2)  The partnership’s notional loss or notional net income for the period is worked out in the same way as the notional loss or notional net income of a trust.

             (3)  The trust’s share is calculated by dividing:

                     (a)  the trust’s interest in the partnership’s net income or partnership loss of the income year;

by:

                     (b)  the amount of that net income or partnership loss;

and expressing the result as a percentage.

             (4)  However, if the partnership had neither a net income nor a partnership loss, the trust’s share is a percentage that is fair and reasonable having regard to the extent of the trust’s interest in the partnership.

##### 268-80  How to calculate the trust’s share of a partnership’s notional loss or notional net income for a period if the entities have different income years

             (1)  This section applies if at any time during a period the trust is a partner in a partnership that has an income year that starts and ends at a different time from when the trust’s income year starts and ends.

             (2)  So much of the partnership’s net income or partnership loss of an income year as was derived during the period is a notional net income or notional loss of the partnership for the period. (For the purposes of this subsection, the partnership’s net income or partnership loss is calculated without taking account of the partnership’s full year deductions for that income year.)

Note:          The partnership’s full year deductions are dealt with in section 268-85.

             (3)  The trust’s share is calculated by dividing:

                     (a)  the trust’s interest in the partnership’s net income or partnership loss of the income year;

by:

                     (b)  the amount of that net income or partnership loss;

and expressing the result as a percentage.

##### 268-85  Trust’s full year deductions include a share of partnership’s full year deductions

             (1)  This section applies if at any time during the income year the trust is a partner in a partnership that has one or more full year deductions for the income year of the partnership that corresponds to the income year of the trust.

             (2)  The partnership’s full year deductions are treated as full year deductions of the trust, but only to the extent of the trust’s share. 

             (3)  If the partnership’s income year is the same as the trust’s, the trust’s share is calculated by dividing:

                     (a)  the trust’s interest in the partnership’s net income or partnership loss of the income year;

by:

                     (b)  the amount of that net income or partnership loss;

and expressing the result as a percentage.

             (4)  However, if the partnership had neither a net income nor a partnership loss, the trust’s share is a percentage that is fair and reasonable having regard to the extent of the trust’s interest in the partnership.

             (5)  If the partnership’s income year does not start and end at the same time as the trust’s income year, the trust’s share is a percentage that is fair and reasonable having regard to all relevant circumstances.

#### Subdivision 269-B—Abnormal trading

##### 269-10  Trading

                   A **_trading_** in units in a unit trust occurs if there is an issue, redemption or transfer of, or other dealing in, the units.

##### 269-15  Abnormal trading—general

             (1)  There is an **_abnormal trading_** in units in a unit trust if there is a trading in the units that is abnormal having regard to all relevant factors, including:

                     (a)  the timing of the trading, when compared to the normal timing for trading in its units; and

                     (b)  the number of units traded, when compared to the normal number of units traded; and

                     (c)  any connection between the trading and any other trading in units in the trust; and

                     (d)  any connection between the trading and a tax loss or other deduction of the trust.

             (2)  There may also be an **_abnormal trading_** under any of the following provisions.

##### 269-20  Abnormal trading—suspected acquisition or merger

                   There is an **_abnormal trading_** in units in a unit trust if a trading occurs in its units that the trustee knows or reasonably suspects is part of an acquisition of the trust or merger of the trust with another trust.

##### 269-25  Abnormal trading—5% of units in a single transaction

                   There is an **_abnormal trading_** in units in a unit trust (other than a wholesale widely held trust) if 5% or more of the units are traded in one transaction.

##### 269-30  Abnormal trading—suspected 5% of units in a series of transactions

             (1)  There is an **_abnormal trading_** in units in a unit trust (other than a wholesale widely held trust) if the trustee knows or reasonably suspects that a person, or a person and one or more associates of the person, have acquired or redeemed 5% or more of the units in 2 or more transactions and would not have done so if the trust did not have a tax loss or other deduction.

             (2)  For the purposes of other provisions of this Schedule, the abnormal trading occurs at the time of the particular transaction that causes the 5% figure to be exceeded.

##### 269-35  Abnormal trading—20% of units traded, issued or redeemed over 60 day period

             (1)  There is an **_abnormal trading_** in units in a unit trust (other than a wholesale widely held trust) if more than 20% of the units on issue at the end of any 60 day period were traded during the period.

             (2)  For the purposes of other provisions of this Schedule, the abnormal trading occurs at the end of the 60 day period.

##### 269-40  Abnormal trading—50% stake not maintained

             (1)  There is an **_abnormal trading_** in units in a wholesale widely held trust during a period if the trustee knows or reasonably suspects that the same persons did not hold more than 50% of its units at the beginning and end of the period.

             (2)  For the purposes of other provisions of this Schedule, the abnormal trading occurs immediately before the end of the period.

##### 269-45  Time at which trustee to have knowledge or suspicion

                   For the purposes of section 269-20, 269-30 or 269-40, the trustee must have the knowledge or reasonable suspicion mentioned in that section:

                     (a)  if the section is being applied in determining for the purposes of section 268-20 whether an abnormal trading occurred—at some time during the income year mentioned in that section; or

                     (b)  if it is being applied in determining for the purposes of any other provision whether an abnormal trading occurred during a period—at some time during the period.

##### 269-47  Abnormal trading where holding trust

Holding trust and subsidiary trust

             (1)  If a unit trust has fixed entitlements directly or indirectly to all of the income and capital of another unit trust:

                     (a)  the first trust is a **_holding trust_** of the second; and

                     (b)  the second is a **_subsidiary trust_** of the first.

Abnormal trading causing or ending holding-subsidiary relationship

             (2)  The transaction that causes a trust to become, or to cease to be, a holding trust of a subsidiary trust (the**_bottom subsidiary trust)_** is an **_abnormal trading_** in units in the bottom subsidiary trust unless:

                     (a)  the holding trust is itself a subsidiary trust of one or more holding trusts (each of which is a **_higher holding trust_**); and

                     (b)  immediately before and after the transaction, the bottom subsidiary trust is a subsidiary trust of one or more of the higher holding trusts.

Abnormal trading while holding-subsidiary relationship exists

             (3)  While one or more trusts are holding trusts of the same subsidiary trust, there is an **_abnormal trading_** in units in the subsidiary trust if and only if, and at the time at which, there is an abnormal trading in units in the holding trust that is not itself a subsidiary trust of another holding trust.

##### 269-49  No abnormal trading where proportionate issue of units

                   If the issue of units in a unit trust to existing unit holders does not cause each unit holder’s proportion of the total fixed entitlements to shares of the income and capital of the trust to change, then, except for the purposes of section 269-20, the issue is disregarded in determining whether there has been an abnormal trading in units in the unit trust.

#### Subdivision 269-C—Passing the 50% stake test etc.

##### 269-50  More than a 50% stake in income or capital

More than a 50% stake in income

             (1)  If there are individuals who have (between them), directly or indirectly, and for their own benefit, fixed entitlements to a greater than 50% share of the income of a trust, those individuals have **_more than a 50% stake_** in the income of the trust.

More than a 50% stake in capital

             (2)  If there are individuals who have (between them), directly or indirectly, and for their own benefit, fixed entitlements to a greater than 50% share of the capital of the trust, those individuals have **_more than a 50% stake_** in the capital of the trust.

##### 269-55  Passing the 50% stake test

             (1)  If, at all times during a period, or at 2 times:

                     (a)  the same individuals have more than a 50% stake in the income of a trust; and

                     (b)  the same individuals (who may be different from those in paragraph (a)) have more than a 50% stake in the capital of the trust;

the trust **_passes the 50% stake test_** for the period or in respect of the 2 times.

             (2)  If a trust is a widely held unit trust it is taken to **_pass the 50% stake test_** for a period or in respect of 2 times if it is reasonable to assume that the requirements of paragraphs (1)(a) and (b) are satisfied in respect of the period or the 2 times.

#### Subdivision 269-D—Pattern of distributions test

##### 269-60  Pattern of distributions test

                   A trust **_passes the pattern of distributions test_** for an income year if, before the end of 2 months after the end of the income year:

                     (a)  the trust distributed directly or indirectly to the same individuals, for their own benefit, a greater than 50% share of all test year distributions of income (see subsection 269-65(1)); and

                     (b)  the trust distributed directly or indirectly to the same individuals (who may be different from those in paragraph (a)), for their own benefit, a greater than 50% share of all test year distributions of capital (see subsection 269-65(3)).

##### 269-65  Test year distribution of income or capital

Test year distribution of income

             (1)  A **_test year distribution of income_** is the total of all distributions of income made by the trust in any of the following periods, provided the period does not start more than 6 years before the start of the income year:

                     (a)  the period from the start of the income year until 2 months after its end;

                     (b)  if the trust distributed income before the trigger year (see subsection (2))—the income year, before the trigger year, that is closest to the trigger year;

                     (c)  if paragraph (b) does not apply and the trust distributed income in the trigger year—the trigger year;

                     (d)  if neither paragraph (b) nor paragraph (c) applies—the income year, closest to the trigger year, in which the trust distributed income;

                     (e)  each intervening income year (if any) between the one in paragraph (a) and the one in paragraph (b), (c) or (d).

Trigger year

             (2)  If this Subdivision is being applied for the purposes of section 267-20, the **_trigger year_** is the loss year mentioned in that section. If it is being applied for the purposes of section 267-25, the **_trigger year_** is the year in which the debt mentioned in that section was incurred.

Test year distribution of capital

             (3)  Subsection (1) applies in the same way to distributions of capital made by the trust, to determine what is a **_test year distribution of capital_**.

##### 269-70  When individual receives different percentages

                   For the purposes of section 269-60, if the trust does not distribute to an individual the same percentage of income or capital for every test year distribution, the trust is taken to have distributed to the individual, for every test year distribution, the smallest percentage that it distributed to the individual for any of the test year distributions.

##### 269-75  Incomplete distributions

                   For the purposes of section 269-60, if, before the end of 2 months after the end of the income year:

                     (a)  the trust has distributed directly or indirectly the whole or part of a test year distribution of income or test year distribution of capital to a company, partnership or trust (the **_entity_**); and

                     (b)  an amount (the **_undistributed amount_**) consisting of the whole or part of the income or capital so distributed to the entity satisfies the following requirements:

                              (i)  the amount has not been distributed by the entity; and

                             (ii)  an individual, directly or indirectly, and for his or her own benefit, has a fixed entitlement to a share of the amount;

the entity is taken to have distributed the share of the undistributed amount to the individual immediately before the end of 2 months after the end of the income year.

##### 269-80  Where individual’s death or marriage breakdown

             (1)  For the purposes of section 269-60, if:

                     (a)  the trust distributes, directly or indirectly to an individual as mentioned in that section, income or capital that is included in a test year distribution; and

                     (b)  a later distribution of income or capital is made that is included in the same or a different test year distribution; and

                     (c)  either the individual dies before the later distribution is made or:

                              (i)  before it is made, there is a breakdown in the marriage (see section 272-140) of the individual; and

                             (ii)  after the breakdown, no distribution of income or capital of the trust, that is included in a test year distribution, is made directly or indirectly to the individual; and

                            (iii)  it is reasonable to assume that the breakdown in the marriage is the reason for no such distribution being made;

then subsections (2) and (3) apply.

             (2)  No income or capital distributed to the individual by the trust, directly or indirectly as mentioned in section 269-60, is to be included in any test year distribution.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  the requirements of subsection (1) are met because the individual has died; and

                     (b)  immediately before his or her death, the individual had directly or indirectly, and for his or her own benefit, a fixed entitlement to a share of the income or capital of the trust; and

                     (c)  after the individual’s death, the fixed entitlement is held by a person as trustee of the individual’s estate or by a person who received it as a beneficiary of the estate;

no income or capital distributed to the person as such a trustee or beneficiary, directly or indirectly as mentioned in section 269-60, is to be included in any test year distribution.

##### 269-85  Arrangements to pass pattern of distributions test

             (1)  The trust is taken for the purposes of section 269-60 not to have distributed, directly or indirectly to an individual, and for the individual’s own benefit, a share of a test year distribution of income or capital of the trust if the condition in subsection (2) is met.

             (2)  The condition is that an arrangement was entered into where:

                     (a)  the arrangement in some way (directly or indirectly) related to, affected or depended for its operation on the share or its value; and

                     (b)  the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the arrangement was to ensure that the trust would meet the condition in subsection 267-30(2).

#### Subdivision 269-E—Control a non-fixed trust

##### 269-95  Control a non-fixed trust

Basic meaning

             (1)  Subject to this section, a group (see subsection (5)) **_controls a non-fixed trust_** if:

                     (a)  the group has the power, by means of the exercise of a power of appointment or revocation or otherwise, to obtain beneficial enjoyment (directly or indirectly) of the capital or income of the trust; or

                     (b)  the group is able (directly or indirectly) to control the application of the capital or income of the trust; or

                     (c)  the group is capable, under a scheme, of gaining the beneficial enjoyment in paragraph (a) or the control in paragraph (b); or

                     (d)  the trustee is accustomed, under an obligation or might reasonably be expected, to act in accordance with the directions, instructions or wishes of the group; or

                     (e)  the group is able to remove or appoint the trustee; or

                      (f)  the group acquires more than a 50% stake in the income or capital of the trust.

Replacement group after death etc.

             (2)  The consequences set out in subsection (3) apply if:

                     (a)  a group (the **_original group_**) ceases to control a non-fixed trust only because of the death, incapacitation or breakdown in the marriage of the individual comprising, or an individual included in, the group; and

                     (b)  another group (the **_replacement group_**) begins to control the trust within the following period (whether or not any other group controlled the trust in the interim):

                              (i)  one year after the death, incapacitation or breakdown in the marriage; or

                             (ii)  such longer period as the Commissioner determines in relation to the death, incapacitation or breakdown in the marriage; and

                     (c)  the replacement group consists of:

                              (i)  if the individual who died or became incapacitated or whose marriage broke down comprised the original group—one or more individuals who are members of the individual’s family (see section 272-95); or

                             (ii)  in any other case—one or more such individuals together with all of the persons who were members of the original group, other than any individual who has died or become incapacitated or whose marriage has broken down; and

                     (d)  the replacement group began to control the trust only because of the death, incapacitation or breakdown in the marriage of the individual; and

                     (e)  disregarding any individual who died or became incapacitated or whose marriage broke down and the one or more individuals covered by paragraph (c)—the beneficiaries of the trust immediately before the original group ceased to control the trust are the beneficiaries of the trust immediately after the replacement group begins to control the trust.

Consequences of subsection (2)

             (3)  For the purposes of subsection (2), the consequences are that:

                     (a)  the replacement group is taken to have controlled the trust from the time when the original group began to control it until the time when the replacement group actually began to control it; and

                     (b)  the original group is taken _not_ to have controlled the trust; and

                     (c)  if:

                              (i)  a person or persons (other than a replacement group) began to control the trust at some time during the period from the time the original group ceased to control the trust until the replacement group began to do so; and

                             (ii)  the person or persons began to control the trust only because of the death, incapacitation or breakdown in the marriage of the individual; and

                            (iii)  the control did not continue after the replacement group began to control the trust;

                            the person or persons are taken _not_ to have controlled the trust.

Deemed absence of control

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  at a particular time, a group controls a non-fixed trust; and

                     (b)  the Commissioner, having regard to:

                              (i)  the identity of the beneficiaries of the trust at any time before and at any time after the group began to control the trust; and

                             (ii)  all other relevant circumstances;

                            considers that it is reasonable that the group be taken not to control the trust at the particular time;

the group is taken _not_ to control the trust at the particular time.

Group

             (5)  A **_group_** is:

                     (a)  a person; or

                     (b)  a person and one or more associates; or

                     (c)  2 or more associates of a person.

#### Subdivision 269-F—Same business test

##### 269-100  Passing the same business test

Basic meaning

             (1)  A listed widely held trust **_passes the_** **_same business test_** during a period (the **_same business test period_**) in relation to a time (the **_test time_**) if throughout the same business test period it carries on the same business as it carried on immediately before the test time.

Relevance of being a trust

             (2)  The mere fact of being a trust does not mean that the trust cannot carry on a business.

First exception

             (3)  However, the trust does _not_ pass the same business test if, at any time during the same business test period, it derives assessable income from:

                     (a)  a business of a kind that it did not carry on before the test time; or

                     (b)  a transaction of a kind that it had not entered into in the course of its business operations before the test time.

Second exception

             (4)  The trust also does _not_ pass the same business test if, before the test time, it:

                     (a)  started to carry on a business it had not previously carried on; or

                     (b)  in the course of its business operations, entered into a transaction of a kind that it had not previously entered into;

and did so for the purpose, or for purposes including the purpose, of being taken to have carried on throughout the same business test period the same business as it carried on immediately before the test time.

Third exception

             (5)  So far as the test is applied for the purpose of section 266-115 (Listed widely held trust may be required to work out its net income and tax loss in a special way) and section 268-20 (Widely held unit trust’s income year to be divided into periods), the trust also does _not_ pass the test if, at any time during the same business test period, it incurs expenditure:

                     (a)  in carrying on a business of a kind that it did not carry on before the test time; or

                     (b)  as a result of a transaction of a kind that it had not entered into in the course of its business operations before the test time.

### Division 270—Schemes to take advantage of deductions

##### 270-5  What this Division is about

* * *

A trust may be prevented from making any use of deductions, or full use of deductions in an income year, if a scheme to take advantage of the deductions exists.

##### 270-10  Schemes to take advantage of deductions

Basic case

             (1)  The consequences set out in section 270-15 result if:

                     (a)  a deduction is allowable to a trust for the income year; and

                     (b)  under a scheme, the following happen (in any order):

                              (i)  the trust derives an amount of assessable income (the **_scheme assessable income_**) in the income year; and

                             (ii)  an outsider to the trust (see section 270-25) directly or indirectly provides a benefit (see section 270-20) to the trustee, to a beneficiary in the trust or to an associate of the trustee or of a beneficiary; and

Note:       The benefit may constitute all or any of the scheme assessable income.

                            (iii)  the trustee, a beneficiary in the trust or an associate of the trustee or of a beneficiary, directly or indirectly provides a benefit to the outsider to the trust or to an associate of the outsider (other than an associate covered by any of paragraphs 270-25(1)(a) to (f)); and

Note:       The benefit may constitute all or any of the deduction.

                     (c)  it is reasonable to conclude that:

                              (i)  the trust derived the scheme assessable income; or

                             (ii)  the outsider provided the benefit as mentioned in subparagraph (b)(ii); or

                            (iii)  the trustee, beneficiary or associate provided the benefit as mentioned in subparagraph (b)(iii);

                            wholly or partly, but not merely incidentally, because the deduction would be allowable; and

                     (d)  the trust is not an excepted trust under paragraph 272-100(b), (c) or (d).

Special case

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  under a scheme, a person who, before the scheme was entered into, was an outsider to a trust becomes:

                              (i)  the trustee of the trust; or

                             (ii)  a person with a fixed entitlement to a share of the income or capital of the trust; and

                     (b)  if the person had not ceased to be an outsider to the trust, the requirements of subsection (1) would have been satisfied in relation to the scheme;

the requirements of subsection (1) are taken to have been satisfied in relation to the scheme.

##### 270-15  Tax consequences of schemes

                   If the requirements of subsection 270-10(1) are satisfied, the consequences are that:

                     (a)  to the extent (if any) that the deduction mentioned in paragraph 270-10(1)(a) relates exclusively, or may appropriately be related, to the scheme assessable income, the deduction is not allowable; and

                     (b)  if the net income of the trust is less than the scheme assessable income or there is no net income—the trust has a net income equal to, or the net income is increased so that it equals, the scheme assessable income; and

                     (c)  paragraph (b) and the scheme assessable income are disregarded in working out any tax loss incurred by the trust in the income year; and

                     (d)  if paragraph (b) applies and the deduction mentioned in paragraph 270-10(1)(a) is for a tax loss—paragraph (b) and the scheme assessable income are disregarded in working out any deduction in respect of the tax loss allowable after the income year.

##### 270-20  Benefit

                   A **_benefit_** is:

                     (a)  money, a dividend or property (whether tangible or intangible); or

                     (b)  a right or entitlement (whether or not property); or

                     (c)  services; or

                     (d)  the extinguishment, forgiveness, release or waiver of a debt or other liability; or

                     (e)  the doing of anything that results in the derivation of assessable income; or

                      (f)  anything that, disregarding the preceding paragraphs, is a benefit or advantage.

##### 270-25  Outsider to trust

Outsider to family trust

             (1)  If the trust mentioned in paragraph 270-10(1)(a) is a family trust, an **_outsider to the trust_** is a person other than:

                     (a)  the trustee of the trust; or

                     (b)  a person with a fixed entitlement to a share of the income or capital of the trust; or

                     (c)  the individual specified in the trust’s family trust election; or

                     (d)  a member of the individual’s family; or

                     (e)  a company, partnership or trust that made an interposed entity election to be included in the individual’s family group, where the election was in force (including before it was made) when the scheme mentioned in paragraph 270-10(1)(b) commenced; or

                      (f)  a fixed trust, company or partnership (an **_entity_**) where, at all times while the scheme mentioned in paragraph 270-10(1)(b) was being carried out:

                              (i)  the individual specified in the trust’s family trust election; or

                             (ii)  one or more members of the individual’s family; or

                            (iii)  the trustees of one or more family trusts, provided the individual is specified in the family trust election of each of those family trusts;

                            or any combination of the above, had fixed entitlements, directly or indirectly, and for their own benefit, to all of the income and capital of the entity.

Outsider to non-family trust

             (2)  If the trust mentioned in paragraph 270-10(1)(a) is not a family trust, an **_outsider to the trust_** is a person other than:

                     (a)  the trustee of the trust; or

                     (b)  a person with a fixed entitlement to a share of the income or capital of the trust.

### Division 272—Interpretation

#### Subdivision 272-A—Fixed entitlement to share of income or capital

##### 272-5  Fixed entitlement to share of income or capital of a trust

             (1)  If, under a trust instrument, a beneficiary has a vested and indefeasible interest in a share of income of the trust that the trust derives from time to time, or of the capital of the trust, the beneficiary has a **_fixed entitlement_** to that share of the income or capital.

Case where interest not defeasible

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  a person holds units in a unit trust; and

                     (b)  the units are redeemable or further units are able to be issued; and

                     (c)  if units in the unit trust are listed for quotation in the official list of an approved stock exchange—the units held by the person will be redeemed, or any further units will be issued, for the price at which other units of the same kind in the unit trust are offered for sale on the approved stock exchange at the time of the redemption or issue; and

                     (d)  if the units are not listed as mentioned in paragraph (c)—the units held by the person will be redeemed, or any further units will be issued, for a price determined on the basis of the net asset value, according to Australian accounting principles, of the unit trust at the time of the redemption or issue;

then the mere fact that the units are redeemable, or that the further units are able to be issued, does not mean that the person’s interest, as a unit holder, in the income or capital of the unit trust is defeasible.

Deemed fixed entitlement

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  a beneficiary with an interest in a share of income that the trust derives from time to time, or of the capital of a trust, does not have a fixed entitlement to the share; and

                     (b)  the Commissioner considers that the beneficiary should be treated as having the fixed entitlement, having regard to:

                              (i)  the circumstances in which the entitlement is capable of not vesting or the defeasance can happen; and

                             (ii)  the likelihood of the entitlement not vesting or the defeasance happening; and

                            (iii)  the nature of the trust;

the beneficiary has the fixed entitlement.

##### 272-10  Fixed entitlement to share of income or capital of a company

             (1)  If a shareholder in a company holds shares carrying the right to receive some or all of the dividends that may be paid by the company, the shareholder has a **_fixed entitlement_** to a share of the income of the company equal to the percentage of the total dividends represented by the dividends that the shareholder has a right to receive.

             (2)  If a shareholder in a company holds shares carrying the right to receive the whole or part of any distribution of paid-up capital of the company in the event of any return of capital to shareholders, the shareholder has a **_fixed entitlement_** to a share of the capital of the company equal to the percentage of the total distribution represented by the amount that the shareholder has a right to receive.

##### 272-15  Fixed entitlement to share of income or capital of a partnership

             (1)  If, under a partnership agreement:

                     (a)  a partner is entitled to a share of income that the partnership derives from time to time, or of the capital of the partnership; and

                     (b)  the share is not able to be varied;

the partner has a **_fixed entitlement_** to that share of the income or capital.

Deemed fixed entitlement

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  a partner does not have a fixed entitlement to a share of income that the partnership derives from time to time, or of the capital of a partnership, only because the partner’s share of the income or capital is able to be varied; and

                     (b)  the Commissioner considers that the partner should be treated as having the fixed entitlement, having regard to:

                              (i)  the circumstances in which the share is able to be varied; and

                             (ii)  the likelihood of the variation happening; and

                            (iii)  the nature of the partnership;

the partner has the fixed entitlement.

##### 272-20  Fixed entitlement to share of income or capital held indirectly

                   A person holds a fixed entitlement to a share of the income or capital of a company, partnership or trust **_indirectly_** if the person holds the entitlement indirectly through fixed entitlements to shares of the income or capital, respectively, of interposed companies, partnerships or trusts.
