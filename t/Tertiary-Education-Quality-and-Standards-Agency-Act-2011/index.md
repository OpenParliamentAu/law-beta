##### <a id="15"></a>15  Principle of reflecting risk

                   TEQSA complies with the principle of reflecting risk if its exercise of the power has regard to:

                     (a)  the entity’s history, including the history of:

                              (i)  its scholarship, teaching and research; and

                             (ii)  its students’ experiences; and

                            (iii)  its financial status and capacity; and

                            (iv)  its compliance with the Threshold Standards, this Act, this Act’s associated provisions and other laws regulating higher education; and

                     (b)  matters relating to the risk of the entity not complying with the Threshold Standards, this Act or this Act’s associated provisions in the future, including:

                              (i)  its internal quality assurance mechanisms; and

                             (ii)  its financial status and capacity.

##### <a id="16"></a>16  Principle of proportionate regulation

                   TEQSA complies with the principle of proportionate regulation if its exercise of the power is in proportion to:

                     (a)  any non‑compliance; or

                     (b)  risk of future non‑compliance;

by the entity with the Threshold Standards, this Act or this Act’s associated provisions.

                     (c)  the authorised officer purports to execute, or present to another person, a document that purports to be a form of warrant under that section that the authorised officer knows:

                              (i)  has not been approved by a magistrate under that section; or

                             (ii)  departs in a material particular from the terms of a warrant signed by a magistrate under that section; or

for an order that the wrongdoer pay the Commonwealth a pecuniary penalty.

             (1)  If, under a civil penalty provision, an act or thing is required to be done within a particular period or before a particular time, then the obligation to do that act or thing continues (even if the period has ended or the time has passed) until the act or thing is done.

             (2)  A person commits a separate contravention of the civil penalty provision in respect of each day (including a day of the making of a relevant civil penalty order or any subsequent day) the person refuses or fails to comply with that requirement.

             (3)  The Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Court may make a single order to pay a pecuniary penalty for all the contraventions described in subsection (2), but the penalty must not exceed the sum of the maximum penalties that could be ordered if a separate penalty were ordered for each of the contraventions.

##### <a id="120"></a>120  Mistake of fact

             (1)  A person is not liable to have a civil penalty order made against the person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision if:

                     (a)  at or before the time of the conduct constituting the contravention, the person:

                              (i)  considered whether or not facts existed; and

                             (ii)  was under a mistaken but reasonable belief about those facts; and

                     (b)  had those facts existed, the conduct would not have constituted a contravention of the civil penalty provision.

             (2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), a person may be regarded as having considered whether or not facts existed if:

                     (a)  the person had considered, on a previous occasion, whether those facts existed in the circumstances surrounding that occasion; and

                     (b)  the person honestly and reasonably believed that the circumstances surrounding the present occasion were the same, or substantially the same, as those surrounding the previous occasion.

             (3)  A person who wishes to rely on subsection (1) or (2) in proceedings for a civil penalty order bears an evidential burden in relation to that matter.

##### <a id="121"></a>121  Civil proceedings after criminal proceedings

                   The Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Court must not make a civil penalty order against a person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision if the person has been convicted of an offence constituted by conduct that is substantially the same as the conduct constituting the contravention.

##### <a id="122"></a>122  Criminal proceedings during civil proceedings

             (1)  Proceedings for a civil penalty order against a person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision are stayed if:

                     (a)  criminal proceedings are started or have already been started against the person for an offence; and

                     (b)  the offence is constituted by conduct that is substantially the same as the conduct alleged to constitute the contravention.

             (2)  The proceedings for the order may be resumed if the person is not convicted of the offence. Otherwise, the proceedings for the order are dismissed.

##### <a id="123"></a>123  Criminal proceedings after civil proceedings

                   Criminal proceedings may be started against a person for conduct that is substantially the same as conduct constituting a contravention of a civil penalty provision regardless of whether a civil penalty order has been made against the person.

##### <a id="124"></a>124  Evidence given in proceedings for civil penalty not admissible in criminal proceedings

                   Evidence of information given, or evidence of production of documents, by an individual is not admissible in criminal proceedings against the individual if:

                     (a)  the individual previously gave the evidence or produced the documents in proceedings for a civil penalty order against the individual for a contravention of a civil penalty provision (whether or not the order was made); and

                     (b)  the conduct alleged to constitute the offence is substantially the same as the conduct that was claimed to constitute the contravention.

However, this does not apply to a criminal proceeding in respect of the falsity of the evidence given by the individual in the proceedings for the civil penalty order.
