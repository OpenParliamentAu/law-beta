case requires, of the car fringe benefits that relate to the car ascertained

under subsection (2) of this section exceeds the taxable value, or the

aggregate of the taxable values, as the case requires, that would have been

have applied, for the purposes of ascertaining that taxable value, or the

aggregate of those taxable values, as the case requires, as if that election

had not been made.

business journeys undertaken during the holding period in the car if, and only

is reduced under subsection (1):

regard shall be had only to the index numbers published in terms of the new

reference base.

relation to a year of tax would, if it were calculated to 4 decimal places,

end with a number greater than 4, the factor ascertained in accordance with

that subsection in relation to that year of tax shall be taken to be the

factor calculated to 3 decimal places in accordance with that subsection and

increased by 0.001.&quot;.

the employment of the employee in recognition of the current recognised long

service period does not exceed the amount calculated in accordance with the

log

book records kept in previous log book year of tax

the car, the substantiation rules shall be taken to be complied with in

relation to the car if, and only if:

     (ii)  the percentage that represents a reasonable estimate of the

underlying business percentage applicable to the car in relation to the

recipient for the holding period;

the following provisions have effect:

  (c)  the employer shall be treated as if he or she had, in the return,

specified, in respect of the car, the reduced percentage instead of the

excessive percentage;

specifies, or purports to specify, in respect of the car, the excessive

percentage in accordance with the condition set out in subparagraph 65F (b)

        (i)-the employer shall be treated as if he or she had, in the return for 

that subsequent year of tax, specified, in respect of the car, the reduced

percentage instead of the excessive percentage.

that represents a reasonable estimate of the underlying business percentage

applicable to the car in relation to the recipient for the holding period.&quot;.

Deductions not allowable for private component of contributions for fringe

benefits etc.

  &quot;51AJ. (1) Where:

  (a)  any of the following benefits is provided in respect of the employment

of an employee of an employer:

      (i)  an airline transport benefit;

     (ii)  a board benefit;

     (iii)  a loan benefit;

     (iv)  a property benefit;

     (v)  a residual benefit;

  (b)  the benefit is:

      (i)  a fringe benefit; or

     (ii)  a benefit that, but for paragraph (g) of the definition of 'fringe

benefit' in subsection 136 (1) of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986,

would be a fringe benefit;

  (c)  in the case of a loan benefit-the taxpayer, being the recipient or the

employee, incurs interest (in this section called the 'recipients interest')

in respect of the loan;

  (d)  in the case of a benefit other than a loan benefit-the taxpayer, being

the recipient or the employee, incurs consideration (in this section called

the 'recipients contribution') to the provider or to the employer in respect

of the provision of the recipients transport, the recipients meal, the

recipients property or the recipients benefit, as the case may be;

  (e)  it would be concluded that, in calculating the amount of the recipients

interest, or the amount of the recipients contribution, as the case may be,

the provider or the employer made an allowance for a particular level of

application or use of the benefit in producing assessable income of the

taxpayer; and

  (f)  it would be concluded that the amount of the recipients interest, or

the amount of the recipients contribution, as the case may be, would have been

greater if it had been calculated without making that allowance;

the following provisions have effect:

  (g)  if the extent of the application or use of the benefit concerned in

producing assessable income of the taxpayer is equal to, or less than, that

level-a deduction is not allowable to the taxpayer under this Act in respect

of the recipients interest or the recipients contribution;

  (h)  if the extent of the application or use of the benefit concerned in

producing assessable income of the taxpayer exceeds that level-the amount of

the deduction that, but for this section, has been allowed or would be

allowable to the taxpayer under this Act in respect of the recipients interest

or the recipients contribution shall not exceed the amount calculated in

accordance with the formula:

                                     D - A

    where:

      D  is the amount of the deduction that, but for this section, would

have

been allowable to the taxpayer under this Act in respect of the amount of the

recipients interest or the amount of the recipients contribution if it had

been calculated without making that allowance; and

      A  is the amount of that allowance.

and in the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 have the same respective

meanings in this section as they have in that Act.&quot;.

subsection (1) the following word and paragraph:

     &quot;or  (c)  in relation to an eligible transport payment-a transport

the

employee in the course of performing duties as an employee of the employer;

       'eligible transport payment' means a payment (in this definition

called

the 'current payment') in respect of which all of the following conditions are

satisfied:

        (a)  the current payment is a transport allowance payment, or a car

expense reimbursement payment, paid in respect of particular travel (in this

definition called the 'current travel') of an employee;

        (b)  the current payment was paid under an industrial instrument that

was in force on 29 October 1986;

        (c)  the aggregate of:

            (i)  the current payment; and

           (ii)  any other transport allowance payments or car expense

reimbursement payments, as the case may be, payable under the industrial

instrument in respect of the current travel;

payable in respect of the current travel under the industrial instrument if no

alterations had been made to the industrial instrument after 29 October 1986;

        (d)  if the aggregate of:

            (i)  the current payment; and

           (ii)  any other transport allowance payments or car expense

reimbursement payments, as the case may be, payable under the industrial

instrument in respect of the current travel;

          exceeds the total amount of transport allowance payments or car

expense reimbursement payments, as the case may be, that would have been

payable in respect of the current travel if the amounts had been determined at

the rates applicable on 29 October 1986-the whole of the excess is

attributable to increases determined solely by reference to matters contained

in the industrial instrument on 29 October 1986;

      'substantiation sections' means sections 82KUA, 82KUB, 82KUC, 82KUD,

82KW

(other than subsection (3)), 82KZ and 82KZA;

      'transport allowance payment' means:

        (a)  a payment by way of an allowance paid or payable by an employer

to

an employee for the sole purpose of enabling the employee to incur transport

expenses in respect of travel in the course of performing duties as an

employee of the employer; or

        (b)  so much of a payment by way of an allowance paid or payable by

an

employer to an employee for the principal purpose of enabling the employee to

incur such expenses as is paid or payable for that purpose;

       but does not include any part of any payment by way of a travel

allowance;

      'transport expense' means an outgoing incurred in connection with

transport and includes depreciation in respect of property used in connection

with transport, but does not include an outgoing in respect of accommodation,

in respect of the purchase of food or drink or in respect of expenditure

incidental to transport;&quot;;

  (d)  by inserting after subsection (1) the following subsection:

     &quot;(1A) For the purposes of the definition of 'eligible transport payment'

in subsection (1):

     (a)  where an industrial instrument (in this paragraph called the

'substituted instrument') has come into force in substitution for another

industrial instrument (in this paragraph called the 'original instrument'),

the substituted instrument shall be taken to be a continuation of the original

instrument;

     (b)  alterations made to an industrial instrument after 29 October 1986

shall be taken to have been made on 29 October 1986 if:

         (i)  the alterations were made pursuant to an application made on or

before 29 October 1986 that sought increases in transport allowance payments

or car expense reimbursement payments; and

        (ii)  if the application was amended after 29 October 1986-the

alterations made to the industrial instrument did not result in increases in

transport allowance payments or car expense reimbursement payments that were

greater than increases in those payments sought by the application as at 29

October 1986; and

     (c)  where, as a result of alterations after 29 October 1986 to an

industrial instrument (not being alterations that are deemed by paragraph (b)

to have been made on 29 October 1986), an additional amount is paid to an

employee under the instrument as a transport allowance payment or car expense

reimbursement payment in respect of travel undertaken before the date on which

the alterations were made:

         (i)  the additional amount is not an eligible transport payment; and

        (ii)  the question of whether any other transport allowance payment

or

car expense reimbursement payment in respect of that travel is an eligible

transport payment shall be determined as if the additional amount had not been

paid or payable in respect of the travel.&quot;;

  (e)  by omitting from subsection (3) &quot;or an employment-related expense&quot; and

substituting &quot;, an employment-related expense or a transport expense&quot;; and

  (f)  by inserting after subsection (5) the following subsection:

     &quot;(5A) A reference in this Subdivision to section 82KUD being applied

includes a reference to that section being applied by virtue of subparagraph

82KZBA (1) (e) (iii).&quot;.

inserted in Subdivision F of Division 3 of Part III:

No substantiation required for eligible expenses relating to eligible

transport

payments in certain circumstances

  &quot;82KZBA. (1) Where:

  (a)  one or more eligible transport payments are paid to a taxpayer in a

year of income; and

  (b)  the total of the eligible expenses in relation to the eligible

transport payment or payments incurred by the taxpayer during any year of

income and claimed by the taxpayer as deductions in respect of any year of

income does not exceed the amount of the eligible transport payment, or the

total of the amounts of the eligible transport payments, as the case may be;

then, unless the taxpayer elects that this section not apply in relation to

the eligible transport payment or eligible transport payments, the following

provisions have effect:

  (c)  subject to subparagraph (e) (iii), the substantiation sections do not

apply, and shall be deemed never to have applied, in relation to the taxpayer

in relation to any of those eligible expenses;

  (d)  those eligible expenses shall not be treated as relevant expenses for

the purposes of section 82KZB;

  (e)  if those eligible expenses consist of, or include, car expenses, or

parts of car expenses, incurred in a year of income that relate to a car:

      (i)  nothing in this section prevents the taxpayer making an election

that section 82KX apply in relation to the car in relation to the year of

income;

     (ii)  the taxpayer is not entitled to elect that subsection 82KW (2) or

(3) apply in relation to the car in relation to the year of income;

     (iii)  if:

        (A) the taxpayer does not elect that section 82KX apply in relation

to

the car in relation to the year of income; and

        (B) a part (in this paragraph called the 'eligible expense part') of

a

car expense incurred by the taxpayer in the year of income relating to the car

is one of those eligible expenses;

       the amount of a deduction allowable under this Act to the taxpayer in

respect of the car expense is the sum of:

        (C) if, apart from this paragraph, section 82KUD would be applied for

the purpose of determining the amount of a deduction allowable under this Act

in respect of so much of that car expense as is not an eligible expense-the

amount of the deduction that would have been calculated under section 82KUD if

that section had applied to the whole of the car expense; and

        (D) the amount of the deduction that, apart from this Subdivision,

would have been allowable under this Act to the taxpayer in respect of the

eligible expense part of that car expense; and

     (iv)  for the purposes of this Subdivision (including section 82KUD as

applied by subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph), the number of kilometres

travelled by the car during the year of income in the course of travel to

which the eligible transport payment or eligible transport payments relate

shall not be counted as travel by the car in the course of producing

assessable income of the taxpayer.

  &quot;(2) Where:

  (a)  a taxpayer has incurred a transport expense during a year of income;

and

  (b)  at the time of making an assessment in respect of income of the person

of the year of income, the Commissioner is of the opinion that, at a later

time, circumstances will exist because of which subsection (1) will apply in

relation to the whole or a part of the transport expense;

the Commissioner may, in making the assessment, apply this Act as if those

circumstances existed at the time of making the assessment.

  &quot;(3) Where this Act has, because of subsection (2), been applied on the

basis that a circumstance that did not exist at the time of making the

assessment would exist at a later time and the Commissioner, after making the

assessment, becomes satisfied that the circumstance will not exist, then,

notwithstanding section 170, the Commissioner may amend the assessment at any

time for the purposes of ensuring that this Act shall be taken always to have

applied on the basis that that circumstance did not exist.

Relief from certain substantiation requirements where taxpayer had a

reasonable

expectation that substantiation would not be required

  &quot;82KZBB. (1) Where:

  (a)  any of the following subparagraphs applies in relation to an expense

incurred by a taxpayer in a year of income:

      (i)  documentary evidence of the expense was not obtained by, or on

behalf of, the taxpayer;

     (ii)  the taxpayer did not make, as mentioned in subsection 82KZ (2), an

entry in a travel diary in relation to the expense;

     (iii)  the taxpayer did not retain, for the retention period:

        (B)  a travel diary relating to the travel to which the expense

relates; 

  (b)  the failure to obtain or retain the documentary evidence, to make the

entry, or to retain the travel diary, occurred only because:

      (i)  if the expense is a car expense-the taxpayer, at the time the

expense was incurred, had a reasonable expectation that he or she would be

entitled to claim a deduction under section 82KX in relation to the car to

which the expense relates in relation to the year of income;

     (ii)  if the expense is a relevant expense within the meaning of section

82KZB-the taxpayer, at the time the expense was incurred, had a reasonable

expectation that the total amount that would be allowable as deductions under

this Act in respect of relevant expenses, within the meaning of section 82KZB,

incurred by the taxpayer during the year of income would not exceed $300 or

such higher amount as is prescribed for the purposes of subsection 82KZB (2);

or

     (iii)  if the expense is a transport expense-the taxpayer, at the time

the

expense was incurred, had a reasonable expectation that subsection 82KZBA (1)

would apply in relation to the whole or a part of the expense;

  (c)  all of the following conditions are satisfied:

      (i)  a special circumstance occurred:

        (A) after the expense was incurred; and

        (B) during the year of income;

     (ii)  at the time the expense was incurred, the taxpayer did not know,

and

could not reasonably have been expected to have known, that the special

circumstance would occur;

     (iii)  it is reasonable to assume that, if the special circumstance had

not occurred:

        (A) if subparagraph (b) (i) applies-the taxpayer would have been

entitled to claim a deduction under section 82KX as mentioned in that

subparagraph;

        (B) if subparagraph (b) (ii) applies-the total amount that would be

allowable as deductions under this Act in respect of relevant expenses, within

the meaning of section 82KZB, incurred by the taxpayer during the year of

income would not have exceeded $300 or such higher amount as is prescribed for

the purposes of subsection 82KZB (2); or

        (C) if subparagraph (b) (iii) applies-subsection 82KZBA (1) would

have

applied in relation to the whole or a part of the expense referred to in that

subparagraph;

  (d)  if subparagraph (b) (i) applies-the taxpayer is not entitled to claim a

deduction under section 82KX in relation to the car to which the expense

relates in relation to the year of income; and

  (e)  the Commissioner is satisfied that, because of the circumstances

referred to in paragraphs (b) and (c), it would be unreasonable to expect the

taxpayer:

      (i)  to have obtained or retained documentary evidence in relation to

the

expense; or

     (ii)  to have made an entry in a travel diary in relation to the expense

or to have retained the travel diary relating to the travel to which the

expense relates;

    as the case may be;

the following provisions have effect:

  (f)  if the expense is a car expense-section 82KUA and paragraphs 82KW (2)

        (b) and (ba) and 82KZA (1) (aa) and (a) and (3) (ba), (c) and (d) do not

apply, and shall be deemed never to have applied, in relation to the expense;

  (g)  if the expense is an expense other than a car expense-section 82KZ and

paragraphs 82KZA (1) (a) and (c) and (3) (c), (d) and (f) do not apply, and

shall be deemed never to have applied, in relation to the expense.

  &quot;(2) For the purposes of this Subdivision, where:

  (a)  odometer records maintained by or on behalf of a taxpayer in relation

to a car in relation to a period during a year of income would, apart from

this subsection, be incomplete because of a failure to enter particulars of

the odometer reading at the commencement of the period or, if the first use of

the car in the course of producing assessable income of the taxpayer occurred

during that period, at the commencement of that use;

  (b)  the failure occurred only because:

      (i)  the taxpayer, at the commencement of that period or use, had a

reasonable expectation that the taxpayer would be entitled to claim a

deduction under section 82KX in relation to the car in relation to the year of

income;

     (ii)  the taxpayer, at the commencement of that period or use, had a

reasonable expectation that the total amount that would be allowable as

deductions under this Act in respect of relevant expenses, within the meaning

of section 82KZB, incurred by the taxpayer during the year of income would not

exceed $300 or such higher amount as is prescribed for the purposes of

subsection 82KZB (2); or

     (iii)  the taxpayer, at the commencement of that period or use, had a

reasonable expectation that subsection 82KZBA (1) would apply in relation to

the whole or a part of all of the car expenses incurred, in gaining or

producing assessable income of the taxpayer, in relation to the car after the

commencement of that period or use and during the year of income;

  (c)  all of the following conditions are satisfied:

      (i)  a special circumstance occurred:

        (A) after the commencement of that period or use; and

        (B) during the year of income;

     (ii)  at the time the expense was incurred, the taxpayer did not know,

and

could not reasonably have been expected to have known, that the special

circumstance would occur;

     (iii)  it is reasonable to assume that, if the special circumstance had

not occurred:

        (A) if subparagraph (b) (i) applies-the taxpayer would have been

entitled to claim a deduction under section 82KX as mentioned in that

subparagraph;

        (B) if subparagraph (b) (ii) applies-the total amount that would be

allowable as deductions under this Act in respect of relevant expenses, within

the meaning of section 82KZB, incurred by the taxpayer during the year of

income would not have exceeded $300 or such higher amount as is prescribed for

the purposes of subsection 82KZB (2); or

        (C) if subparagraph (b) (iii) applies-subsection 82KZBA (1) would

have

applied as mentioned in that subparagraph;

  (d)  if subparagraph (b) (i) applies-the taxpayer is not entitled to claim a

deduction under section 82KX in relation to the car in relation to the year of

income;

  (e)  the Commissioner is satisfied that, because of the circumstances

referred to in paragraphs (b) and (c), it would be unreasonable to expect the

taxpayer to have recorded the odometer reading at the commencement of that

period or use; and

  (f)  before the date of lodgment of the taxpayer's return for the year of

income, or within such further time as the Commissioner allows, the taxpayer

sets out in the odometer records:

      (i)  a reasonable estimate of the odometer reading; and

     (ii)  a declaration signed by the taxpayer that, to the best of his or

her

knowledge and belief, the estimate is reasonable;

the following provisions have effect:

  (g)  the odometer records shall be deemed to be, and to have been, at all

times after the commencement of that period, complete odometer records

maintained by or on behalf of the taxpayer in relation to the car for that

period;

  (h)  the retention period in relation to the odometer records shall be

deemed to commence at the time the first entry was made in the odometer

records.

  &quot;(3) In this section, a reference to the time a taxpayer incurred an

expense, being an expense constituted by depreciation in respect of property

is, notwithstanding subsection 82KT (3), a reference to the time when the

taxpayer acquired the property.&quot;.
