             (2)  On and after the proclamation day, the Maternity Leave Act continues to apply to her in relation to the confinement in respect of which the leave was granted as if Tourism Australia were a prescribed authority for the purposes of that Act.

##### <a id="16"></a>16  Maternity leave starting after proclamation day
