             (4)  However, an application to receive the allowance is to be made:

                     (a)  within 6 months after the student died; or

                     (b)  within a longer period allowed by the Secretary in special circumstances.

# Chapter 2B—Student Financial Supplement Scheme

## Part 2B.1—Establishment of scheme

### Division 1—Preliminary

##### <a id="1061ZW"></a>1061ZW  Object of this Chapter

                   The object of this Chapter is to establish a Student Financial Supplement Scheme enabling certain tertiary students to obtain a repayable financial supplement by entering into a contract for that purpose with a financial corporation that participates in the scheme.

##### <a id="1061ZX"></a>1061ZX  Outline of the scheme

             (1)  The scheme provides for the reduction of the rate of youth allowance, austudy payment or pensioner education supplement payable to a person who obtains financial supplement.

             (2)  The scheme contains provisions under which the amount of supplement that the person is eligible to obtain depends on the total rate of youth allowance, austudy payment or pensioner education supplement that the person chooses to receive. Those provisions allow the person to choose to repay some or all of the youth allowance, austudy payment or pensioner education supplement, or to receive a lower rate of payment of such an allowance, payment or supplement, in order to receive a higher amount of financial supplement.

             (3)  The scheme provides that the person is not liable to pay interest to the financial corporation in respect of financial supplement received by the person, but provides for payment by the Commonwealth, without cost to the person, to the financial corporation of a subsidy that includes an amount in lieu of interest.

             (4)  The scheme provides for the amount of the financial supplement that has to be repaid under a contract to be indexed on 1 June in the year next following the year in which the contract is entered into, and on 1 June in each later year. The amount by which the supplement is increased by indexation is owed by the person to the Commonwealth and not to the financial corporation.

             (5)  Under the scheme, the person is entitled, but not required, to make early repayments in respect of the supplement during the period of the contract. The scheme provides for a discount for any repayments made before the end of that period.

             (6)  The scheme provides that, if financial supplement paid to a person is not repaid in full before the end of the period of the contract, the obligation to repay the outstanding amount of the supplement is transferred to the Commonwealth, and the indexed amount is repayable by the person to the Commonwealth through the taxation system when the person’s income reaches a specified level.

### Division 2—Eligibility to obtain financial supplement

##### <a id="1061ZY"></a>1061ZY  Eligibility to obtain financial supplement

                   A person is eligible to obtain financial supplement for a period (an **_eligibility period_**) that is a year or a part of a year if:

                     (a)  the person is undertaking, or intending to undertake, a tertiary course at an educational institution throughout the period; and

                     (b)  the person does not undertake a course of primary or secondary education at any time during the period; and

                     (c)  the person is a category 1 student or a category 2 student in respect of the period; and

                     (d)  the amount of financial supplement that the person is eligible to obtain under Division 6 for the year is not less than the minimum amount of financial supplement.

##### <a id="1061ZZ"></a>1061ZZ  Category 1 student

             (1)  A person is a **_category 1 student_** in respect of a period if, throughout the period, one or more of the payments referred to in this section are payable to the person.

             (2)  The payment may be youth allowance if:

                     (a)  the person’s youth allowance general rate is more than zero; and

                     (b)  the youth allowance is payable because the person is undertaking full-time study.

             (3)  The payment may be austudy payment if the person’s austudy payment general rate is more than zero.

             (4)  The payment may be pensioner education supplement.

##### <a id="1061ZZA"></a>1061ZZA  Category 2 student

             (1)  A person is a **_category 2 student_** in respect of a period if:

                     (a)  the person is not a category 1 student in respect of the period; and

                     (b)  throughout the period the person is undertaking full-time study; and

                     (c)  throughout the period youth allowance at the youth allowance general rate is not payable to the person, and is not so payable only because of the operation of:

                              (i)  Module F (the parental income test) of the Youth Allowance Rate Calculator in section 1067G; or

                             (ii)  Module G (the family actual means test) of that Calculator; and

                     (d)  where throughout the period youth allowance at the youth allowance general rate is not payable to the person only because of the operation of Module F of that Calculator—the person’s combined parental income for the appropriate tax year under Submodule 4 of that Module is throughout the period less than the person’s modified parental income free area; and

                     (e)  where throughout the period youth allowance at the youth allowance general rate is not payable to the person only because of the operation of Module G of that Calculator—the actual means of the person’s family under that Module is throughout the period less than the person’s modified parental income free area; and

                      (f)  neither section 1061ZZAA nor 1061ZZAB applies to the person.

             (2)  For the purposes of paragraphs (1)(d) and (e), the person’s **_modified parental income free area_** is the indexed amount that would be the person’s parental income free area under point 1067G-F22 if the amount of $23,400 that was specified in paragraph 1067G-F22(a) when that paragraph was enacted had been $54,949.

                    <a name="princip-sum"></a>**_principal sum_** means the principal sum immediately before the repayment time.

What constitutes indexation amount

             (4)  The indexation amount referred to in subsection (2) is the amount of the excess referred to in paragraph (2)(b).

If discount does not exceed indexation amount

             (6)  If:

                     (a)  an indexation amount existed in respect of the contract immediately before the repayment time; and

                     (b)  the discount to which the person is entitled in respect of the relevant repayment is equal to or less than the indexation amount;

the amount outstanding under the contract is taken to be reduced by the discount.

#### Submodule 2—Persons to whom family actual means test applies

General provision

  1067G-G2  Subject to point 1067G-G3, the family actual means test applies to a person who:

                     (a)  claims or receives youth allowance; and

                     (b)  is not independent; and

                     (c)  has a parent who is a designated parent.

Exceptions

 1067G-G3(1)  The family actual means test does not apply to a person:

                     (a)  while a family member of the person is receiving exceptional circumstances relief payment; or

                     (b)  for so much of the calendar year in which the relief payment is received as follows the cessation of the relief payment.

             (2)  In subpoint (1):

                    <a name="except-circumst-relief-payment"></a>**_exceptional circumstances relief payment_** means:

                     (a)  exceptional circumstances relief payment under the _Farm Household Support Act 1992_; or

                     (b)  drought relief payment under that Act as in force immediately before the commencement of the _Farm Household Support Amendment (Restart and Exceptional Circumstances) Act 1997_.

#### Submodule 3—Identification of appropriate tax year

Meaning of appropriate tax year

  1067G-G4  The **_appropriate tax year_** in relation to a person for a youth allowance payment period is:

                     (a)  the base tax year for the period; or

                     (b)  if a determination of a tax year is made by the Secretary under point 1067G-G6 in relation to the person in respect of the period—the tax year specified in the determination.

Person who may request Secretary to determine appropriate tax year

 1067G-G5(1)  This point applies to a person who claims or receives youth allowance if the following conditions are satisfied.

             (2)  The first condition is that, except for this point, youth allowance:

                     (a)  would not be payable to the person because the rate of youth allowance is calculated to be nil; or

                     (b)  would be calculated to be payable at a reduced rate.

             (3)  The second condition is that the person gives to the Secretary, in writing:

                     (a)  evidence, or an estimate, that the amount of the actual means of the person’s family for the tax year (the **_following tax year_**) immediately after the base tax year is substantially less than it was in the base tax year:

                              (i)  because of a circumstance or event that is beyond the control of the person and the person’s family members; or

                             (ii)  because the person or a family member of the person is undertaking full-time study in the following tax year; or

                            (iii)  because a designated parent of the person has ceased to be a parent of the kind referred to in paragraph 10B(3)(c), (d), (e), (f) or (g); and

                     (b)  if subparagraph (a)(i) applies—evidence of the circumstance or event concerned;

and, if the person gives an estimate as referred to in paragraph (a), the person agrees, in writing, to the person’s rate of youth allowance being recalculated if the actual means of the person’s family for the following tax year exceed the amount of the estimate.

             (4)  For the purposes of subparagraph (3)(a)(i), an expected decrease in the profitability of a business is not ordinarily to be taken to be a circumstance or event that is beyond the control of the person and the person’s family members.

             (5)  The third condition is that the person’s family actual means are unlikely to increase beyond the amount evidenced, or estimated, under paragraph (3)(a) for the 2 years beginning on the later of the following days:

                     (a)  1 January in the following tax year; or

                     (b)  the day on which the amount of the family’s actual means was reduced.

Making of request

 1067G-G6(1)  A person to whom point 1067G-G5 applies may request the Secretary, in accordance with a form approved by the Secretary, to make a determination under this point in relation to a youth allowance payment period.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  the person makes such a request; and

                     (b)  the youth allowance payment period to which the request relates ends on or after the later of:

                              (i)  the day on which the request is made; or

#### Submodule 4—Actual means of person’s family

How to work out the actual means of person’s family

 1067G-G7(1)  To work out the actual means of the family of a person (the **_claimant/recipient_**) for the appropriate tax year, first calculate, in accordance with this Submodule, the actual means of the claimant/recipient and the actual means of each family member of the claimant/recipient and then apply the formula in subpoint 1067G-G13(1) using the results of those calculations.

             (2)  A reference in any of the following provisions of this Submodule to a **_relevant person_** is a reference to the claimant/recipient or a family member of the claimant/recipient.

Meaning of actual means

 1067G-G8(1)  Subject to point 1067G-G9, the **_actual means_** of a relevant person for the appropriate tax year is an amount equal to the total spending and savings of the person in that tax year.

             (2)  An amount of spending or savings is taken to have been spent or saved in the appropriate tax year if the Secretary considers that the amount should be so taken.

Amounts not included in actual means of a relevant person

 1067G-G9(1)  This point applies in working out the actual means, for the appropriate tax year, of a relevant person.

             (2)  The following amounts spent or saved in the appropriate tax year by the person are not included in the actual means of the person:

                     (a)  spending or savings from any income assistance received by the person in that tax year;

                     (b)  spending for the maintenance of:

                              (i)  a child of the person if the person does not have legal responsibility for the day-to-day care, welfare and development of the child; or

                             (ii)  $5,274, less the amount of the boarding allowance;

                     (d)  spending in boarding away from home a family member who:

                              (i)  is a secondary student; and

                             (ii)  is not independent; and

                            (iii)  is required to live away from home;

                            to the extent of the lesser of:

                            (iv)  the amount of the spending; and

                             (v)  $5,274, less the amount of the person’s after-tax income concession (if any) for the student under point 1067G-G11;

                     (e)  if the person has a disability—spending to acquire, or modify, property to assist the person to cope with the disability;

                      (f)  spending or savings from any arm’s length loan received by the person in that tax year;

                     (g)  spending to repay a loan received by the person in that tax year that is not an arm’s length loan, or to pay interest on the loan;

                     (h)  spending or savings from the proceeds of any liquidation of assets of the person that were held at the beginning of that year;

                      (i)  spending or savings from the amount of any windfall gain that is not a gift to the person;

                      (j)  spending or savings, of not more than $6,000, from income that is exempt income under item 1.4 of the table in section 51-5 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_;

                     (k)  spending or savings from any part of a lump sum compensation payment made to the person on which tax is not payable under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ or the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

             (3)  Also, the actual means of the person do not include the following amounts:

                     (a)  subject to subpoint (4), an amount equal to the amount of the income or resources of a business of the person that is deductible under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, or the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ because the amount was, or will be, necessarily incurred in carrying on the business;

                     (b)  an amount equal to the amount of any reduction in liquid assets of the person held at the beginning of the appropriate tax year and not accounted for by spending of a kind referred to in subpoint (2).

             (4)  The reference in paragraph (3)(a) to the amount of the income or resources of a business of the person that is deductible does not include:

                     (a)  the amount of any losses from the business that are carried forward from a tax year earlier than the appropriate tax year; or

                     (b)  the amount of a contribution to a superannuation fund, in relation to the business, that exceeds:

                              (i)  for an employee—the minimum contribution for the employee under the _Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992_; or

                             (ii)  for a person engaged otherwise than as an employee—the lesser of $3,000 and the total amount of the contributions for the person, and each family member of the person, for the appropriate tax year.

Amounts not included in actual means of a family member of claimant/recipient

 1067G-G10  In working out the actual means, for the appropriate tax year, of a family member of the claimant/recipient, being a family member of a kind referred to in subparagraph 23(15)(b)(i), (ii) or (iii), spending or savings from any income of the family member from independent employment (except so much of such spending or savings as exceeds $6,000) is not included.

After-tax income concession for secondary student

 1067G-G11(1)  This point explains how a relevant person’s after-tax income concession for a secondary student referred to in subparagraph 1067G-G9(2)(d)(v) is worked out.

             (2)  The purpose of the concession is to compensate the family of a secondary student who is required to live away from home for the additional expenditure incurred in maintaining the student while he or she is required to live away from home. The compensation is effected by reducing the actual means of the family by an amount calculated by reference to the additional amount of youth allowance that is payable because the student is required to live away from home.

             (3)  Accordingly, a relevant person’s **_after-tax income concession_** is the amount worked out using the formula:
