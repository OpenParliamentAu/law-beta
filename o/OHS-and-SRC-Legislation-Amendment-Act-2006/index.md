(2)        This item applies if:

                     (a)  the extension commencement occurs on a day in a financial year (the **_relevant financial year_**), other than on the 1 July that is the start of that financial year; and

                     (b)  a body corporate (the **_licensee_**), in relation to which a licence under Part VIII of the SRC Act is in force on the extension commencement, becomes an employer for the purposes of the OHS Act on the extension commencement because of an amendment or amendments made by this Schedule.

_Note:       If the extension commencement is on the 1 July that is the start of a financial year, the licence fee imposed by section 104A of the SRC Act will cover recoupment of costs incurred in carrying out functions under both the SRC Act and OHS Act in relation to the licensee and that year.

(6)        The SRC Act applies in relation to the licence fee as if it were a licence fee under section 104A of that Act.

(7)        The licence fee is in addition to the licence fee for which the licensee is liable under section 104A of the SRC Act in relation to the relevant financial year.
