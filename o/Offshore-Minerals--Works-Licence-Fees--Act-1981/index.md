##### <a id="1"></a>1  Short title [_see_ Note 1]

                   This Act may be cited as the _Offshore Minerals (Works Licence Fees) Act 1981_.

##### <a id="2"></a>2  Commencement [_see_ Note 1]

                   This Act shall come into operation on the day on which the _Minerals (Submerged Lands) Act 1981_ comes into operation.

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Interpretation

             (1)  In this Act:

                    <a name="year"></a>**_year_**, in relation to the term of a works licence, means:

                     (a)  the period of 12 months commencing on (and including) the day on which the provisional grant of the licence is properly accepted; or

                     (b)  a period of 12 months commencing on (and including) an anniversary of that day; or

                     (c)  a period of less than 12 months that:

                              (i)  commences on (and includes):

                                        (A)  the day on which the provisional grant of the licence is properly accepted; or

                                        (B)  an anniversary of that day; and

                             (ii)  ends at the end of the term of the licence.

             (2)  Expressions used in this Act that are used in the _Offshore Minerals Act 1994_ have, unless the contrary intention appears, the same meaning as they have in that Act.

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Works licence fees

             (1)  A works licence holder must pay to the Designated Authority, in respect of each year of the term of the licence, a fee calculated at the rate prescribed by the regulations for each hectare or part of a hectare of the works area.

             (2)  The works area for a works licence is the area specified in the licence under paragraph 278(1)(c) of the _Offshore Minerals Act 1994_.

             (3)  Subject to subsection (4), the amount of the fee is to be calculated at the prescribed rate for each hectare or part of a hectare of the licence area.

             (4)  The prescribed rate is not to exceed $100 per hectare or part of a hectare.

##### <a id="4A"></a>4A  Holder liable to pay fee

             (1)  The licence holder is liable to pay the fee.

             (2)  If the licence has 2 or more holders, the holders are jointly and severally liable to pay the fee.

##### <a id="4B"></a>4B  Time for payment

                   The fee for a year becomes payable one month after the day on which the year begins.

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Penalty for late payment

                   Where the liability of the holder of a works licence to pay a fee referred to in section 4 is not discharged at or before the time when the fee is payable, there is payable to the Designated Authority by the holder an additional amount calculated at the rate of one‑third of 1% per day upon the amount of the fee from time to time remaining unpaid, to be computed from the time when the fee became payable until it is paid.

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Fees and penalties debts due to Commonwealth

             (1)  A fee under section 4, and an amount payable under section 5, are debts due by the holder of a works licence to the Commonwealth and are recoverable in a court of competent jurisdiction.

             (2)  Fees and other amounts referred to in subsection (1) received by the Designated Authority shall be deemed to be received by the Designated Authority on behalf of the Commonwealth.

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Regulations

                   The Governor‑General may make regulations prescribing matters:

                     (a)  required or permitted by this Act to be prescribed; or
