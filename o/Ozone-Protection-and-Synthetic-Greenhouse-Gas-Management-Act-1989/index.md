## An Act to provide for measures to protect the ozone layer and to minimise emissions of SGGs

## Part I—Preliminary

##### <a id="1"></a>1  Short title [_see_ Note 1]

                   This Act may be cited as the _Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989_.

##### <a id="2"></a>2  Commencement [_see_ Note 1]

                   This Act commences on the day on which it receives the Royal Assent.

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Objectives

                   The objectives of this Act are:

                     (a)  to institute, for the purpose of giving effect to Australia’s obligations under the Vienna Convention and the Montreal Protocol, a system of controls on the manufacture, import and export of substances that deplete ozone in the atmosphere; and

                     (b)  to institute, and to provide for the institution of, specific controls on the manufacture, import, export, distribution and use of products that contain such substances or use such substances in their operation; and

                     (c)  to use the best endeavours to encourage Australian industry to:

                              (i)  replace ozone depleting substances; and

                             (ii)  achieve a faster and greater reduction in the levels of production and use of ozone depleting substances than are provided for in the Vienna Convention and the Montreal Protocol;

                            to the extent that such replacements and achievements are reasonably possible within the limits imposed by the availability of suitable alternate substances, and appropriate technology and devices; and

                     (d)  to provide controls on the manufacture, import, export and use of SGGs, for the purposes of giving effect to Australia’s obligations under the Framework Convention on Climate Change; and

                     (e)  to promote the responsible management of scheduled substances so as to minimise their impact on the atmosphere.

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Saving of certain State and Territory laws

                   It is the intention of the Parliament that this Act is not to affect the operation of a law of a State or of a Territory that makes provision with respect to the protection of ozone in the atmosphere and is capable of operating concurrently with this Act.

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Act to bind the Crown

             (1)  This Act binds the Crown in right of the Commonwealth, of each of the States, of an internal Territory that has been established as a body politic and of Norfolk Island.

             (2)  Nothing in this Act renders the Crown in right of the Commonwealth, of a State, of an internal Territory or of Norfolk Island liable to be prosecuted for an offence.

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Extension to external Territories

                   This Act extends to all the external Territories.

##### <a id="6A"></a>6A  Application of the _Criminal Code_

 Chapter 2 (other than Part 2.5) of the _Criminal Code_ applies to all offences against this Act.

##### <a id="26"></a>26  Start of first HCFC quota period

             (1)  If the Minister becomes aware that in any year (the **_excess year_**) the total quantity of HCFCs, expressed in ODP tonnes, involved in regulated HCFC activities engaged in by licensees is more than 90% of the HCFC industry limit for that year, the Minister must publish a notice in the _Gazette_.

             (2)  A notice must:

                     (a)  specify the 1 January next following the date of the notice as the start of the first HCFC quota period; and

                     (b)  contain a statement to the effect that every licence is subject to the conditions mentioned in subsection 18(1) and explaining the effect of those conditions; and

                     (c)  specify the base year to be used in allocating HCFC quotas to licensees during the first HCFC quota period.

             (3)  The base year to be specified in a notice is the last calendar year before the excess year.

##### <a id="27"></a>27  Application for quota

             (1)  An application for a quota must:

                     (a)  be in a form approved by the Minister; and

                     (b)  be given to the Minister.

             (2)  The approved form of application may provide for verification by statutory declaration of statements made in an application.

             (3)  An application may only be made by a licensee.

##### <a id="28"></a>28  Allocation of quota

             (1)  Subject to this section and section 29, the Minister may, on an application made in accordance with section 27, allocate a quota to the applicant.

             (2)  The Minister must determine the size of each quota in accordance with section 31 or 32, as the case requires.

             (3)  In deciding whether or not to allocate a quota, the Minister:

                     (a)  must have regard to Australia’s international obligations, and the policies of the Commonwealth Government, in relation to the manufacture, importation or consumption of scheduled substances; and

                     (b)  may have regard to any other matters he or she thinks relevant.

             (4)  A quota is allocated by written notice given to the applicant.

             (5)  The notice must:

                     (a)  specify the size of the quota; and

                     (b)  state whether it is an HCFC quota or a reserve HCFC quota; and

                     (c)  in the case of an HCFC quota—specify the quota period for which it is allocated; and

                     (d)  in the case of a reserve HCFC quota—specify the period (not longer than 12 months) for which it is allocated.

             (6)  If the Minister refuses to allocate a quota, the Minister must notify the applicant in writing of the refusal and of the reasons for it.

##### <a id="29"></a>29  Limits on power to allocate reserve HCFC quotas

             (1)  The Minister must not allocate a reserve HCFC quota unless satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist.

             (2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), exceptional circumstances exist if, and only if:

                     (a)  the use of the relevant HCFC is essential for medical, veterinary, defence or public safety purposes; and

                     (b)  there is no practicable alternative to that use; and

                     (c)  without the allocation, the HCFC will not be available, in the quantities required for that use, within a reasonable period.

             (3)  The Minister must not allocate a reserve HCFC quota for a year, or part of a year, if the sum of the amounts of all other reserve HCFC quotas allocated for that year, or any part of that year, equals the reserve HCFC quota limit for that year.

##### <a id="30"></a>30  Duration of quotas

             (1)  An HCFC quota stays in force until the end of the quota period for which it is allocated, unless it stops being in force for any other reason before then.

             (2)  A reserve HCFC quota stays in force until the end of the period specified in it under paragraph 28(5)(d), unless it stops being in force for any other reason before then.

##### <a id="31"></a>31  HCFC quota sizes

             (1)  The size of an HCFC quota allocated to a licensee for a quota period is to be worked out using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2005C00439/Html/186CBA6D9593ABD0CA25703B001D0CA9/$FILE/image002.gif)

where:

                    <a name="ala"></a>**_ALA_**(amount of licensee’s activities) means the sum of the quantities of HCFCs, expressed in ODP tonnes, involved in regulated HCFC activities carried out under the licence during the base year by:

                     (a)  the licensee; or

                     (b)  if the licence was transferred to the licensee—the licensee and the transferor.

                    <a name="aia"></a>**_AIA_**(amount of industry activities) means the sum of the quantities of HCFCs, expressed in ODP tonnes, involved in regulated HCFC activities carried out by all licensees during the base year.

                    <a name="il"></a>**_IL_**(industry limit) means the sum of the HCFC industry limits for each year of the quota period.

             (2)  In this section:

                    <a name="base-year"></a>**_base year_** means:

                     (a)  in relation to an allocation for the first HCFC quota period—the base year specified in the notice under section 26; and

                     (b)  in relation to an allocation for any other HCFC quota period—the penultimate calendar year before the start of that quota period.

##### <a id="32"></a>32  Reserve HCFC quota sizes

                   In determining the amount of each reserve HCFC quota allocated for a year, or part of a year, the Minister must ensure that the sum of that amount and the amounts of all other reserve HCFC quotas allocated for that year, or any part of that year, is not more than the reserve HCFC quota limit for that year.

##### <a id="33"></a>33  Reserve HCFC quotas: variation or revocation

             (1)  The Minister may vary or revoke a reserve HCFC quota if satisfied that the exceptional circumstances on which its allocation was based have changed or no longer exist.

             (2)  A variation or revocation takes effect when a written notice of it is given to the licensee to whom the quota was allocated.

             (3)  The Minister must not vary a reserve HCFC quota allocated to a licensee by increasing the amount of the quota if the increased amount could not have been allocated to the licensee under section 29.

##### <a id="34"></a>34  Quotas cease when licences cease

                   A quota allocated to a licensee stops being in force when the licensee’s licence is cancelled, or stops being in force for any other reason.

##### <a id="35"></a>35  Transfer of quotas

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a licensee is allocated a quota; and

                     (b)  the Minister transfers the licence under section 19B;

the unused part of the quota is taken to have been allocated to the transferee on the date of the transfer.

             (2)  A licensee may, without transferring his or her licence, transfer a quota, or part of a quota, allocated to the licensee to another licensee.

             (3)  A transfer mentioned in subsection (2) has no effect until the transferor notifies the Minister of the transfer.

             (4)  A notice must:

                     (a)  state the transferee’s name, address and licence number; and

                     (b)  specify the amount of quota transferred.

             (5)  After a transfer mentioned in subsection (2) takes effect:

                     (a)  the transferred quota, or part of a quota, is taken to have been allocated to the transferee; and

                     (b)  if part of a quota is transferred—the transferor is taken to have been allocated the untransferred part of the quota.

             (6)  A transfer mentioned in subsection (2) only has effect to the extent to which it relates to a quota that has not been used, or to an unused part of a quota.

             (7)  In this section:

                    <a name="quota"></a>**_quota_** does not include a reserve HCFC quota.

Non-methane hydrocarbon species, which consist of a large number of chemical substances, have both natural and anthropogenic sources, and play a direct role in tropospheric photochemistry and an indirect role in stratospheric photochemistry.

(b)   Nitrogen substances

                (i)  <u>Nitrous oxide (N</u><u>2O)</u>

The dominant sources of N2O are natural, but anthropogenic contributions are becoming increasingly important. Nitrous oxide is the primary source of stratospheric NOx, which play a vital role in controlling the abundance of stratospheric ozone.

               (ii)  <u>Nitrogen oxides (NO</u><u>x)</u>

Ground-level sources of NOx play a major direct role only in tropospheric photochemical processes and an indirect role in stratosphere photochemistry, whereas injection of NOx close to the tropopause may lead directly to a change in upper tropospheric and stratospheric ozone.

(c)   Chlorine substances

                (i)  <u>Fully halogenated alkanes, e.g. CC1</u><u>4, CFC1</u><u>3 (CFC-11), CF</u><u>2C1</u><u>2 (CFC-12), C</u><u>2F</u><u>3C1</u><u>3 (CFC-113), C</u><u>2F</u><u>4C1</u><u>2 (CFC-114)</u>

Fully halogenated alkanes are anthropogenic and act as a source of C10x, which plays a vital role in ozone photochemistry, especially in the 30-50 km altitude region.

               (ii)  <u>Partially halogenated alkanes, e.g. CH</u><u>3C1, CHF</u><u>2C1 (CFC-22), CH</u><u>3CC1</u><u>3, CHFC1</u><u>2 (CFC-21)</u>

The sources of CH3C1 are natural, whereas the other partially halogenated alkanes mentioned above are anthropogenic in origin. These gases also act as a source of stratospheric C10x.

(d)   Bromine substances

<u>Fully halogenated alkanes, e.g. CF</u><u>3Br</u>

These gases are anthropogenic and act as a source of Br0x, which behaves in a manner similar to C10x.

(e)   Hydrogen substances

                (i)  <u>Hydrogen (H</u><u>2)</u>

Hydrogen, the source of which is natural and anthropogenic, plays a minor role in stratospheric photochemistry.

               (ii)  Water (H20)

Water, the source of which is natural, plays a vital role in both tropospheric and stratospheric photochemistry. Local sources of water vapour in the stratosphere include the oxidation of methane and, to a lesser extent, of hydrogen.

1.    Any Party that is a developing country and whose annual calculated level of consumption of the controlled substances in Annex A is less than 0.3 kilograms per capita on the date of the entry into force of the Protocol for it, or any time thereafter until 1 January 1999, shall, in order to meet its basic domestic needs, be entitled to delay for ten years its compliance with the control measures set out in Articles 2A to 2E, provided that any further amendments to the adjustments or Amendment adopted at the Second Meeting of the Parties in London, 29 June 1990, shall apply to the Parties operating under this paragraph after the review provided for in paragraph 8 of this Article has taken place and shall be based on the conclusions of that review.

1 bis.  The Parties shall, taking into account the review referred to in paragraph 8 of this Article, the assessments made pursuant to Article 6 and any other relevant information, decide by 1 January 1996, through the procedure set forth in paragraph 9 of Article 2:

(a)   With respect to paragraphs 1 to 6 of Article 2F, what base year, initial levels, control schedules and phase-out date for consumption of the controlled substances in Group I of Annex C will apply to Parties operating under paragraph 1 of this Article;

(b)   With respect to Article 2G, what phase-out date for production and consumption of the controlled substances in Group II of Annex C will apply to Parties operating under paragraph 1 of this Article; and

(c)   With respect to Article 2H, what base year, initial levels and control schedules for consumption and production of the controlled substance in Annex E will apply to Parties operating under paragraph 1 of this Article.

(b)   For controlled substances under Annex B, the average of its annual calculated level of consumption for the period 1998 to 2000 inclusive or a calculated level of consumption of 0.2 kilograms per capita, whichever is the lower, as the basis for determining its compliance with the control measures.

4.    If a Party operating under paragraph 1 of this Article, at any time before the control measures obligations in Articles 2A to 2H become applicable to it, finds itself unable to obtain an adequate supply of controlled substances, it may notify this to the Secretariat. The Secretariat shall forthwith transmit a copy of such notification to the Parties, which shall consider the matter at their next Meeting, and decide upon appropriate action to be taken.

5.    Developing the capacity to fulfil the obligations of the Parties operating under paragraph 1 of this Article to comply with the control measures set out in Articles 2A to 2E, and any control measures in Articles 2F to 2H that are decided pursuant to paragraph 1 bis of this Article, and their implementation by those same Parties will depend upon the effective implementation of the financial co-operation as provided by Article 10 and the transfer of technology as provided by Article 10A.

6.    Any Party operating under paragraph 1 of this Article may, at any time, notify the Secretariat in writing that, having taken all practicable steps it is unable to implement any or all of the obligations laid down in Articles 2A to 2E, or any or all obligations in Articles 2F to 2H that are decided pursuant to paragraph 1 bis of this Article, due to the inadequate implementation of Articles 10 and 10A. The Secretariat shall forthwith transmit a copy of the notification to the Parties, which shall consider the matter at their next Meeting, giving due recognition to paragraph 5 of this Article and shall decide upon appropriate action to be taken.

7.    During the period between notification and the Meeting of the Parties at which the appropriate action referred to in paragraph 6 above is to be decided, or for a further period if the Meeting of the Parties so decides, the non-compliance procedures referred to in Article 8 shall not be invoked against the notifying Party.

8.    A Meeting of the Parties shall review, not later than 1995, the situation of the Parties operating under paragraph 1 of this Article, including the effective implementation of financial co-operation and transfer of technology to them, and adopt such revisions that may be deemed necessary regarding the schedule of control measures applicable to those Parties.

*       Where a range of ODPs is indicated, the highest value in that range shall be used for the purposes of the Protocol. The ODPs listed as a single value have been determined from calculations based on laboratory measurements. Those listed as a range are based on estimates and are less certain. The range pertains to an isomeric group. The upper value is the estimate of the ODP of the isomer with the highest ODP, and the lower value is the estimate of the ODP of the isomer with the lowest ODP.

# Schedule 3E—Framework Convention on Climate Change

_Note:       See the definition of Framework Convention on Climate Change in subsection 7(1)._

UNITED NATIONS FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE

<u>The Parties to this Convention</u>,

<u>Acknowledging</u> that change in the Earth’s climate and its adverse effects are a common concern of humankind,

<u>Concerned</u> that human activities have been substantially increasing the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, that these increases enhance the natural greenhouse effect, and that this will result on average in an additional warming of the Earth’s surface and atmosphere and may adversely affect natural ecosystems and humankind,

<u>Noting</u> that the largest share of historical and current global emissions of greenhouse gases has originated in developed countries, that per capita emissions in developing countries are still relatively low and that the share of global emissions originating in developing countries will grow to meet their social and development needs,

<u>Aware</u> of the role and importance in terrestrial and marine ecosystems of sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases,

<u>Noting</u> that there are many uncertainties in predictions of climate change, particularly with regard to the timing, magnitude and regional patterns thereof,

<u>Acknowledging</u> that the global nature of climate change calls for the widest possible cooperation by all countries and their participation in an effective and appropriate international response, in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities and their social and economic conditions,

<u>Recalling</u> the pertinent provisions of the Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, adopted at Stockholm on 16 June 1972,

<u>Recalling  also</u> that States have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental and developmental policies, and the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction,

<u>Reaffirming</u> the principle of sovereignty of States in international cooperation to address climate change,

<u>Recognizing</u> that States should enact effective environmental legislation, that environmental standards, management objectives and priorities should reflect the environmental and developmental context to which they apply, and that standards applied by some countries may be inappropriate and of unwarranted economic and social cost to other countries, in particular developing countries,

<u>Recalling</u> the provisions of General Assembly resolution 44/228 of 22 December 1989 on the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, and resolutions 43/53 of 6 December 1988, 44/207 of 22 December 1989, 45/212 of 21 December 1990 and 46/169 of 19 December 1991 on protection of global climate for present and future generations of mankind,

<u>Recalling  also</u> the provisions of General Assembly resolution 44/206 of 22 December 1989 on the possible adverse effects of sealevel rise on islands and coastal areas, particularly low-lying coastal areas and the pertinent provisions of General Assembly resolution 44/172 of 19 December 1989 on the implementation of the Plan of Action to Combat Desertification,

<u>Recalling  further</u> the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, 1985, and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, 1987, as adjusted and amended on 29 June 1990,

<u>Noting</u> the Ministerial Declaration of the Second World Climate Conference adopted on 7 November 1990,

<u>Conscious</u> of the valuable analytical work being conducted by many States on climate change and of the important contributions of the World Meteorological Organization, the United Nations Environment Programme and other organs, organizations and bodies of the United Nations system, as well as other international and intergovernmental bodies, to the exchange of results of scientific research and the coordination of research,

<u>Recognizing</u> that steps required to understand and address climate change will be environmentally, socially and economically most effective if they are based on relevant scientific, technical and economic considerations and continually re-evaluated in the light of new findings in these areas,

<u>Recognizing</u> that various actions to address climate change can be justified economically in their own right and can also help in solving other environmental problems,

<u>Recognizing  also</u> the need for developed countries to take immediate action in a flexible manner on the basis of clear priorities, as a first step towards comprehensive response strategies at the global, national and, where agreed, regional levels that take into account all greenhouse gases, with due consideration of their relative contributions to the enhancement of the greenhouse effect,

<u>Recognizing</u> further that low-lying and other small island countries, countries with low-lying coastal, arid and semi-arid areas or areas liable to floods, drought and desertification, and developing countries with fragile mountainous ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change,

<u>Recognizing</u> the special difficulties of those countries, especially developing countries, whose economies are particularly dependent on fossil fuel production, use and exportation, as a consequence of action taken on limiting greenhouse gas emissions,

<u>Affirming</u> that responses to climate change should be coordinated with social and economic development in an integrated manner with a view to avoiding adverse impacts on the latter, taking into full account the legitimate priority needs of developing countries for the achievement of sustained economic growth and the eradication of poverty,

<u>Recognizing</u> that all countries, especially developing countries, need access to resources required to achieve sustainable social and economic development and that, in order for developing countries to progress towards that goal, their energy consumption will need to grow taking into account the possibilities for achieving greater energy efficiency and for controlling greenhouse gas emissions in general, including through the application of new technologies on terms which make such an application economically and socially beneficial,

<u>Determined</u> to protect the climate system for present and future generations,

<u>Have  agreed</u> as follows:

ARTICLE 1

2.         The specific needs and special circumstances of developing country Parties, especially those that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, and of those Parties, especially developing country Parties, that would have to bear a disproportionate or abnormal burden under the Convention, should be given full consideration.

3.         The Parties should take precautionary measures to anticipate, prevent or minimize the causes of climate change and mitigate its adverse effects. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing such measures, taking into account that policies and measures to deal with climate change should be cost-effective so as to ensure global benefits at the lowest possible cost. To achieve this, such policies and measures should take into account different socio-economic contexts, be comprehensive, cover all relevant sources, sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases and adaptation, and comprise all economic sectors. Efforts to address climate change may be carried out cooperatively by interested Parties.

4.         The Parties have a right to, and should, promote sustainable development. Policies and measures to protect the climate system against human-induced change should be appropriate for the specific conditions of each Party and should be integrated with national development programmes, taking into account that economic development is essential for adopting measures to address climate change.

5.         The Parties should cooperate to promote a supportive and open international economic system that would lead to sustainable economic growth and development in all Parties, particularly developing country Parties, thus enabling them better to address the problems of climate change. Measures taken to combat climate change, including unilateral ones, should not constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction on international trade.

(a)        Each of these Parties shall adopt national <u><sup>1</sup></u><sup>/</sup> policies and take corresponding measures on the mitigation of climate change, by limiting its anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and protecting and enhancing its greenhouse gas sinks and reservoirs. These policies and measures will demonstrate that developed countries are taking the lead in modifying longer-term trends in anthropogenic emissions consistent with the objective of the Convention, recognizing that the return by the end of the present decade to earlier levels of anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol would contribute to such modification, and taking into account the differences in these Parties’ starting points and approaches, economic structures and resource bases, the need to maintain strong and sustainable economic growth, available technologies and other individual circumstances, as well as the need for equitable and appropriate contributions by each of these Parties to the global effort regarding that objective. These Parties may implement such policies and measures jointly with other Parties and may assist other Parties in contributing to the achievement of the objective of the Convention and, in particular, that of this subparagraph;

(b)        In order to promote progress to this end, each of these Parties shall communicate, within six months of the entry into force of the Convention for it and periodically thereafter, and in accordance with Article 12, detailed information on its policies and measures referred to in subparagraph (a) above, as well as on its resulting projected anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol for the period referred to in subparagraph (a), with the aim of returning individually or jointly to their 1990 levels these anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol. This information will be reviewed by the Conference of the Parties, at its first session and periodically thereafter, in accordance with Article 7;

(c)        Calculations of emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases for the purposes of subparagraph (b) above should take into account the best available scientific knowledge, including of the effective capacity of sinks and the respective contributions of such gases to climate change. The Conference of the Parties shall consider and agree on methodologies for these calculations at its first session and review them regularly thereafter;

(d)        The Conference of the Parties shall, at its first session, review the adequacy of subparagraphs (a) and (b) above. Such review shall be carried out in the light of the best available scientific information and assessment on climate change and its impacts, as well as relevant technical, social and economic information. Based on this review, the Conference of the Parties shall take appropriate action, which may include the adoption of amendments to the commitments in subparagraphs (a) and (b) above. The Conference of the Parties, at its first session, shall also take decisions regarding criteria for joint implementation as indicated in subparagraph (a) above. A second review of subparagraphs (a) and (b) shall take place not later than 31 December 1998, and thereafter at regular intervals determined by the Conference of the Parties, until the objective of the Convention is met;

(e)        Each of these Parties shall:

(i)         coordinate as appropriate with other such Parties, relevant economic and administrative instruments developed to achieve the objective of the Convention; and

(ii)        identify and periodically review its own policies and practices which encourage activities that lead to greater levels of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol than would otherwise occur;

(f)        The Conference of the Parties shall review, not later than 31 December 1998, available information with a view to taking decisions regarding such amendments to the lists in annexes I and II as may be appropriate, with the approval of the Party concerned;

(g)        Any Party not included in annex I may, in its instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, or at any time thereafter, notify the Depositary that it intends to be bound by subparagraphs (a) and (b) above. The Depositary shall inform the other signatories and Parties of any such notification.

3.         The developed country Parties and other developed Parties included in annex II shall provide new and additional financial resources to meet the agreed full costs incurred by developing country Parties in complying with their obligations under Article 12, paragraph 1\. They shall also provide such financial resources, including for the transfer of technology, needed by the developing country Parties to meet the agreed full incremental costs of implementing measures that are covered by paragraph 1 of this Article and that are agreed between a developing country Party and the international entity or entities referred to in Article 11, in accordance with that Article. The implementation of these commitments shall take into account the need for adequacy and predictability in the flow of funds and the importance of appropriate burden sharing among the developed country Parties.

4.         The developed country Parties and other developed Parties included in annex II shall also assist the developing country Parties that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change in meeting costs of adaptation to those adverse effects.

5.         The developed country Parties and other developed Parties included in annex II shall take all practicable steps to promote, facilitate and finance, as appropriate, the transfer of, or access to, environmentally sound technologies and know-how to other Parties, particularly developing country Parties, to enable them to implement the provisions of the Convention. In this process, the developed country Parties shall support the development and enhancement of endogenous capacities and technologies of developing country Parties. Other Parties and organizations in a position to do so may also assist in facilitating the transfer of such technologies.

6.         In the implementation of their commitments under paragraph 2 above, a certain degree of flexibility shall be allowed by the Conference of the Parties to the Parties included in annex I undergoing the process of transition to a market economy, in order to enhance the ability of these Parties to address climate change, including with regard to the historical level of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol chosen as a reference.

7.         The extent to which developing country Parties will effectively implement their commitments under the Convention will depend on the effective implementation by developed country Parties of their commitments under the Convention related to financial resources and transfer of technology and will take fully into account that economic and social development and poverty eradication are the first and overriding priorities of the developing country Parties.

8.         In the implementation of the commitments in this Article, the Parties shall give full consideration to what actions are necessary under the Convention, including actions related to funding, insurance and the transfer of technology, to meet the specific needs and concerns of developing country Parties arising from the adverse effects of climate change and/or the impact of the implementation of response measures, especially on:

(a)        Small island countries;

(b)        Countries with low-lying coastal areas;

(c)        Countries with arid and semi-arid areas, forested areas and areas liable to forest decay;

(i)         Land-locked and transit countries.

Further, the Conference of the Parties may take actions, as appropriate, with respect to this paragraph.

9.         The Parties shall take full account of the specific needs and special situations of the least developed countries in their actions with regard to funding and transfer of technology.

10.        The Parties shall, in accordance with Article 10, take into consideration in the implementation of the commitments of the Convention the situation of Parties, particularly developing country Parties, with economies that are vulnerable to the adverse effects of the implementation of measures to respond to climate change. This applies notably to Parties with economies that are highly dependent on income generated from the production, processing and export, and/or consumption of fossil fuels and associated energy-intensive products and/or the use of fossil fuels for which such Parties have serious difficulties in switching to alternatives.
