## An Act to provide for measures to protect the ozone layer and to minimise emissions of SGGs

## Part I—Preliminary

##### <a id="1"></a>1  Short title [_see_ Note 1]

                   This Act may be cited as the _Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989_.

##### <a id="2"></a>2  Commencement [_see_ Note 1]

                   This Act commences on the day on which it receives the Royal Assent.

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Objectives

                   The objectives of this Act are:

                     (a)  to institute, for the purpose of giving effect to Australia’s obligations under the Vienna Convention and the Montreal Protocol, a system of controls on the manufacture, import and export of substances that deplete ozone in the atmosphere; and

                     (b)  to institute, and to provide for the institution of, specific controls on the manufacture, import, export, distribution and use of products that contain such substances or use such substances in their operation; and

                     (c)  to use the best endeavours to encourage Australian industry to:

                              (i)  replace ozone depleting substances; and

                             (ii)  achieve a faster and greater reduction in the levels of production and use of ozone depleting substances than are provided for in the Vienna Convention and the Montreal Protocol;

                            to the extent that such replacements and achievements are reasonably possible within the limits imposed by the availability of suitable alternate substances, and appropriate technology and devices; and

                     (d)  to provide controls on the manufacture, import, export and use of SGGs, for the purposes of giving effect to Australia’s obligations under the Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol; and

             (1)  The Minister must not allocate a reserve HCFC quota unless satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist.

             (2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), exceptional circumstances exist if, and only if:

                     (a)  the use of the relevant HCFC is essential for medical, veterinary, defence or public safety purposes; and

                     (b)  there is no practicable alternative to that use; and

                     (c)  without the allocation, the HCFC will not be available, in the quantities required for that use, within a reasonable period.

             (3)  The Minister must not allocate a reserve HCFC quota for a year, or part of a year, if the sum of the amounts of all other reserve HCFC quotas allocated for that year, or any part of that year, equals the reserve HCFC quota limit for that year.

##### <a id="30"></a>30  Duration of quotas

             (1)  An HCFC quota stays in force until the end of the quota period for which it is allocated, unless it stops being in force for any other reason before then.

                   In determining the amount of each reserve HCFC quota allocated for a year, or part of a year, the Minister must ensure that the sum of that amount and the amounts of all other reserve HCFC quotas allocated for that year, or any part of that year, is not more than the reserve HCFC quota limit for that year.

##### <a id="33"></a>33  Reserve HCFC quotas: variation or revocation

             (1)  The Minister may vary or revoke a reserve HCFC quota if satisfied that the exceptional circumstances on which its allocation was based have changed or no longer exist.

             (2)  A variation or revocation takes effect when a written notice of it is given to the licensee to whom the quota was allocated.

             (3)  The Minister must not vary a reserve HCFC quota allocated to a licensee by increasing the amount of the quota if the increased amount could not have been allocated to the licensee under section 29.

                     (a)  a licensee is allocated a quota; and

                     (b)  the Minister transfers the licence under section 19B;

the unused part of the quota is taken to have been allocated to the transferee on the date of the transfer.

             (2)  A licensee may, without transferring his or her licence, transfer a quota, or part of a quota, allocated to the licensee to another licensee.

             (3)  A transfer mentioned in subsection (2) has no effect until the transferor notifies the Minister of the transfer.

             (4)  A notice must:

                     (a)  state the transferee’s name, address and licence number; and

                     (b)  specify the amount of quota transferred.

             (5)  After a transfer mentioned in subsection (2) takes effect:

                     (a)  the transferred quota, or part of a quota, is taken to have been allocated to the transferee; and

                     (b)  if part of a quota is transferred—the transferor is taken to have been allocated the untransferred part of the quota.

             (6)  A transfer mentioned in subsection (2) only has effect to the extent to which it relates to a quota that has not been used, or to an unused part of a quota.

4.  The following chemical substances of natural and anthropogenic origin, not listed in order of priority, are thought to have the potential to modify the chemical and physical properties of the ozone layer.

(a)   Carbon substances

             (i)  <u>Carbon monoxide (CO)</u>

Carbon monoxide has significant natural and anthropogenic sources, and is thought to play a major direct role in tropospheric photochemistry, and an indirect role in stratospheric photochemistry.

            (ii)  <u>Carbon dioxide (CO</u><u>2)</u>

Carbon dioxide has significant natural and anthropogenic sources, and affects stratospheric ozone by influencing the thermal structure of the atmosphere.

           (iii)  <u>Methane (CH</u><u>4)</u>

Methane has both natural and anthropogenic sources, and affects both tropospheric and stratospheric ozone.

           (iv)  <u>Non‑methane hydrocarbon species</u>

Non‑methane hydrocarbon species, which consist of a large number of chemical substances, have both natural and anthropogenic sources, and play a direct role in tropospheric photochemistry and an indirect role in stratospheric photochemistry.

(b)   Nitrogen substances

                (i)  <u>Nitrous oxide (N</u><u>2O)</u>

The dominant sources of N2O are natural, but anthropogenic contributions are becoming increasingly important. Nitrous oxide is the primary source of stratospheric NOx, which play a vital role in controlling the abundance of stratospheric ozone.

               (ii)  <u>Nitrogen oxides (NO</u><u>x)</u>

Ground‑level sources of NOx play a major direct role only in tropospheric photochemical processes and an indirect role in stratosphere photochemistry, whereas injection of NOx close to the tropopause may lead directly to a change in upper tropospheric and stratospheric ozone.

(c)   Chlorine substances

                (i)  <u>Fully halogenated alkanes, e.g. CCl</u><u>4, CFCl</u><u>3 (CFC‑11), CF</u><u>2Cl</u><u>2 (CFC‑12), C</u><u>2F</u><u>3Cl</u><u>3 (CFC‑113), C</u><u>2F</u><u>4Cl</u><u>2 (CFC‑114)</u>

Fully halogenated alkanes are anthropogenic and act as a source of ClOx, which plays a vital role in ozone photochemistry, especially in the 30‑50 km altitude region.

               (ii)  <u>Partially halogenated alkanes, e.g. CH</u><u>3Cl, CHF</u><u>2Cl (CFC‑22), CH</u><u>3CCl</u><u>3, CHFCl</u><u>2 (CFC‑21)</u>

The sources of CH3Cl are natural, whereas the other partially halogenated alkanes mentioned above are anthropogenic in origin. These gases also act as a source of stratospheric ClOx.

(d)   Bromine substances

<u>Fully halogenated alkanes, e.g. CF</u><u>3Br</u>

These gases are anthropogenic and act as a source of BrOx, which behaves in a manner similar to ClOx.

(e)   Hydrogen substances

                (i)  <u>Hydrogen (H</u><u>2)</u>

Hydrogen, the source of which is natural and anthropogenic, plays a minor role in stratospheric photochemistry.

               (ii)  Water (H2O)

Water, the source of which is natural, plays a vital role in both tropospheric and stratospheric photochemistry. Local sources of water vapour in the stratosphere include the oxidation of methane and, to a lesser extent, of hydrogen.
