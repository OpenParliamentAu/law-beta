Application for secondary petroleum production licence—determination of rate of royalty

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  a person has applied for a primary petroleum production licence; and

                     (b)  before or after the grant of the primary petroleum production licence, the person applies for a secondary petroleum production licence;

the Joint Authority must, by written instrument, determine the rate of royalty payable in relation to petroleum recovered, whether under the primary petroleum production licence or under the secondary petroleum production licence.

             (3)  The rate must not be less than 11%, nor more than 12.5%, of the value at the wellhead of that petroleum.

             (4)  Before determining the rate of royalty payable, the Joint Authority must:

                     (a)  give the person an opportunity to confer with the Designated Authority about the rate; and

                     (b)  give the Designated Authority an opportunity to report to the Joint Authority about any such conferring; and

                     (c)  consider the Designated Authority’s report.

             (5)  A determination under subsection (2) is not a legislative instrument for the purposes of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_.

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Reduction of royalty—potentially uneconomic wells

Scope

             (1)  This section applies if the Designated Authority is satisfied that the rate of recovery of petroleum from a well has become so reduced that, having regard to the rate or rates of royalty applicable under section 6, 7 or 8, further recovery of petroleum from that well would be uneconomic.

Reduction of royalty

             (2)  The Joint Authority may, by written instrument, determine that the royalty in relation to any or all of the petroleum recovered from that well on or after a date specified in the determination is to be such lower rate as is specified in the determination.

             (3)  The Joint Authority may, by written instrument, revoke or vary a determination under subsection (2), and the revocation or variation applies to petroleum recovered on or after such date as is specified in the instrument.

             (3)  The Designated Authority must comply with a direction under subsection (1).

             (4)  A direction under subsection (1) is not a legislative instrument for the purposes of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_.

##### <a id="15"></a>15  Provisional payment of royalty

             (1)  If, in relation to petroleum recovered during a royalty period, the value of the petroleum has not been agreed or determined under section 12, the Designated Authority may determine a provisional value.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  a provisional value of any petroleum has been determined under subsection (1); and

                     (b)  the value of that petroleum has not yet been agreed or determined under section 12;

Adjustment

             (2)  If the determined royalty is greater than the provisional royalty, the difference is payable by the registered holder concerned.

             (3)  If the determined royalty is less than the provisional royalty, the difference is to be:

                     (a)  deducted from any amount subsequently payable under this Act by the registered holder concerned; or

                     (b)  if no amount is likely to be subsequently payable under this Act by the registered holder concerned—refunded to the registered holder.
