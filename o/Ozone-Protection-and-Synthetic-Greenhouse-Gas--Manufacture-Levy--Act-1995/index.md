##### <a id="2B"></a>2B  Carbon dioxide equivalence of an amount of an SGG

             (1)  For the purposes of this Act, the carbon dioxide equivalence of an amount of an SGG that is a greenhouse gas is the amount of the SGG multiplied by a value specified in the regulations in relation to that kind of SGG.

             (2)  For the purposes of this Act, the carbon dioxide equivalence of an amount of an SGG that is not a greenhouse gas is zero.

                     (a)  if the quarter is in a fixed charge year—the per unit charge applicable under subsection 100(1) of the _Clean Energy Act 2011_ for the issue of a carbon unit with a vintage year of that fixed charge year; or
