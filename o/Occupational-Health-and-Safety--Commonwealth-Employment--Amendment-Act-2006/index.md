##### <a id="16A"></a>16A  Development of health and safety management arrangements

             (1)  In developing or varying health and safety management arrangements, an employer must have regard to any advice of the Commission on the matter (whether the advice has been given to that employer, or to employers generally).

             (2)  An employee of an employer who is holding consultations to develop or vary health and safety management arrangements may be represented in the consultations by one of the following if the employee so requests:

                     (a)  another employee of the employer;

                     (b)  an employee representative in relation to the employee.

             (3)  To avoid doubt, if an employee of an employer is represented under subsection (2), this does not prevent the employee, an employee mentioned in paragraph (2)(a) or any other employee of the employer from being involved in the consultations.

##### <a id="16B"></a>16B  Certificate evidencing employee representative’s entitlement to be involved in consultations

             (1)  If the Chief Executive Officer of Comcare is satisfied, on application by an employee representative, that an employee in relation to the employee representative has requested:

                     (a)  that the employee representative represent the employee in consultations held by an employer in the course of developing or varying health and safety management arrangements; and

                     (b)  that the identity of the employee not be revealed;

the Chief Executive Officer may issue a certificate to the effect that the employee representative is entitled to represent the employee in such consultations.

             (2)  The application must be in the prescribed form.

             (3)  The certificate must not identify any of the employees concerned. However, it must identify the employee representative, the employer and the proposed consultations.

             (4)  An employee representative in relation to whom a certificate has been issued must not reveal the identity of an employee whom the employee representative is authorised by the certificate to represent.

             (5)  The certificate ceases to have effect at the earlier of:

                     (a)  the time when the Chief Executive Officer of Comcare considers that each of the employees who requested to be represented by the employee representative in consultations identified by the certificate has requested that the certificate cease to have effect; and

                     (b)  the end of the 12 month period that started when the certificate was issued.

             (6)  If a certificate ceases to have effect under paragraph (5)(a), the Chief Executive Officer of Comcare must notify the employee representative, and the employer, in writing.

             (7)  A notification under subsection (6) is not a legislative instrument.

             (8)  A certificate is, for all purposes of this Act, prima facie evidence of the matters stated in it.

             (9)  The Chief Executive Officer of Comcare may delegate to the Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Comcare his or her power under subsection (1). The delegation must be in writing.

           (10)  Nothing in this section implies that an employee representative in respect of whom a certificate has not been issued cannot represent employees in consultations with the employer of those employees.

## 13  Subsection 20(1)

Repeal the subsection (including the note), substitute:

             (1)  A person who erects or installs any plant in a workplace for the use of employees at work must take all reasonably practicable steps to ensure that the plant is not erected or installed in such a manner that:

                     (b)  the process of erection or installation is unsafe for, or constitutes a risk to the health of, employees at the workplace where the plant is erected or installed.

Note:          A person who breaches subsection (1) may be subject to civil action or a criminal prosecution (see Schedule 2).

## 14  Paragraph 21(2)(a)

Repeal the paragraph, substitute:

                     (a)  agreed on between the employer and employees (or their representatives under paragraph 16A(2)(a) or (b)) of the employer; or

## 15  Subsections 24(1) to (3)

Repeal the subsections, substitute:

             (1)  An employee may request his or her employer to:

                     (a)  establish designated work groups in respect of employees of the employer; or

                     (b)  vary designated work groups that have already been established.

          (1A)  An employee representative in respect of an employee of an employer may, if requested by the employee, request the employer to:

                     (a)  establish designated work groups in respect of employees of the employer; or

                     (b)  vary designated work groups that have already been established.

             (2)  The employer must, within 14 days after receiving a request under subsection (1) or (1A), enter into consultations to establish or vary (as the case requires) designated work groups with:

                     (a)  the employer’s employees; and

                     (b)  if an employee of the employer requests that the employer enter into consultations with an employee representative in relation to the employee—that employee representative.

             (3)  If an employer believes that designated work groups should be varied, the employer may at any time enter into consultations about the variation with:

                     (a)  the health and safety representative of each designated work group proposed to be varied; and

                     (b)  if an employee in a designated work group proposed to be varied requests that the employer also enter into such consultations with an employee representative in relation to the designated work group—that employee representative.

## 16  After section 24

Insert:

##### <a id="24A"></a>24A  Consultations on designated work groups are health and safety management arrangement consultations

                   For the purposes of this Act, consultations under section 24 are taken to be consultations to develop health and safety management arrangements. However, for the purposes of developing health and safety management arrangements as described in paragraph 16(2)(d), it is not sufficient for an employer merely to hold consultations under section 24.

##### <a id="24B"></a>24B  List of designated work groups

             (1)  An employer must:

                     (a)  prepare and keep up to date a written list of all designated work groups comprising employees performing work for the employer; and

the employer of the employees in the designated work group must invite nominations from all employees in the group for election as the health and safety representative of the group.

             (2)  If the office of health and safety representative is vacant and the employer has not invited nominations within a further reasonable time that is no later than 6 months after the vacancy occurred, the Commission may direct the employer in writing to do so.

             (3)  A direction by the Commission under subsection (2) is not a legislative instrument.

             (4)  If there is more than one candidate for election at the close of the nomination period, the employer must conduct, or arrange for the conduct of, an election at the employer’s expense.

             (5)  An election conducted or arranged to be conducted under subsection (4) must be conducted in accordance with regulations made for the purposes of this subsection if this is requested by the lesser of:

                     (a)  100 employees normally in the designated work group; or

                     (b)  a majority of the employees normally in the designated work group.

             (6)  If there is only one candidate for election at the close of the nomination period, that person is taken to have been elected.

                     (b)  ensure that the list is available for inspection by investigators and the employees at all reasonable times.

             (2)  The list is not a legislative instrument.

##### <a id="25C"></a>25C  Employees must be notified of selection etc. of health and safety representative

             (1)  The employer of employees in a designated work group must, by written instrument:

                     (a)  notify those employees of a vacancy in the office of health and safety representative for the designated work group within a reasonable time after the vacancy arises; and

## 19  Section 26

Repeal the section, substitute:

##### <a id="26"></a>26  Term of office

             (1)  A health and safety representative for a designated work group holds office for the period specified in the health and safety management arrangements applying to the employees in the designated work group, but is eligible to be selected for further terms of office.

             (2)  If a period is not specified in health and safety management arrangements applying to the designated work group, the term of office is 2 years.

             (3)  This section is subject to sections 26A and 31.

##### <a id="26A"></a>26A  Casual vacancy

                   If a person (the **_retiring representative_**) ceases to hold office as a health and safety representative before the end of the person’s term of office, the person selected to fill the vacancy holds office:

                     (a)  if the vacancy occurred more than 6 months before the retiring representative’s term of office ended—for the remainder of the retiring representative’s term; and

                     (b)  if the vacancy occurred within the period of 6 months before the retiring representative’s term of office ended—for the remainder of the retiring representative’s term and for the next term of office.

## 20  Subsection 29(8)

Omit “the Commission”, substitute “Comcare”.

Insert:

          (2B)  Subsections 25A(3) to (8) apply to the election.

Note:          Subsections 25A(1) and (2) do not apply in relation to deputy health and safety representatives because the selection of a deputy is optional, not required, for each designated work group.

          (2C)  The following provisions apply to a deputy health and safety representative in the same way as they apply to a health and safety representative:

                     (a)  section 31 (resignation etc. of health and safety representative);

                     (b)  section 32 (disqualification of health and safety representatives).

             (3)  Subject to subsection (4), a health and safety committee established under subsection (1) or (2) is to be constituted and to operate in accordance with the health and safety management arrangements applying to the employer’s employees.

             (4)  The number of members of a health and safety committee chosen by the employer to represent the interests of the employer must not exceed the number of members chosen by the employees to represent the interests of the employees.

                   If:

                     (a)  Comcare has been requested to advise an employer, employee or contractor about an occupational health and safety matter; and
