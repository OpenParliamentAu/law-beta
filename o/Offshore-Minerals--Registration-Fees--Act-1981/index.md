	(3)	For the purpose of calculating the fee payable under subsection (1) in respect of a section 338 document or a section 339 document that is lodged for registration, the value, as determined by the Joint Authority, of any approved exploration works to be carried out in pursuance of the document shall be deducted:
	(a)	where the fee is to be calculated in accordance with paragraph (1)(a)—from the value referred to in that paragraph; and

	(5A)	The amount prescribed for the purposes of subsection (5) is not to exceed $20,000.
	(6)	Where the Joint Authority is satisfied that a prior agreement referred to in subsection (4) was not entered into, or is not proposed to be entered into, substantially for the purpose of avoiding or reducing the registration fees that would, but for the issue of a certificate under this paragraph, be payable under subsection (1) or (2) for the lodgment for registration of a section 338 document or a section 339 document that was entered into or is to be entered into to give effect to the prior agreement, the Joint Authority may, on an application in writing made at any time by a person who is or proposes to be a party to the prior agreement, grant a certificate that the Joint Authority is so satisfied.
