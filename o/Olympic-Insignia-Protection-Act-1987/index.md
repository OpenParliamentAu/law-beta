                     (a)  in the case of the design of the olympic symbol—at any time; or

                     (b)  in the case of a registered olympic design or registered torch and flame design—during the protection period in relation to that design;

                              (i)  any article to which the design or any fraudulent or obvious imitation of it has been applied in infringement of the monopoly in the design; or

                             (ii)  any article:

                                        (A)  to which the design or any fraudulent or obvious imitation of it has been applied; and

                                        (B)  that has been imported into Australia in infringement of the monopoly in the design.

             (2)  A person does not infringe the monopoly in a protected design by virtue of the application of paragraph (1)(c) or subparagraph (1)(e)(i) in relation to an article if, at the time when the person did the act that, but for this subsection, would have constituted the infringement, the person did not intend that the article would be used in Australia at a later time by any person.

             (3)  Subject to subsection (4), if a person infringes the monopoly in a protected design:

                     (a)  the AOC; or

                     (b)  a holder of a licence in relation to the design whose interests have been, are or would be affected by the infringement;

may bring an action or proceeding against the person in the Federal Court for infringement of the monopoly in the design.

             (4)  An action or proceeding for infringement of the monopoly in a protected design shall not be instituted by the holder of a licence in relation to the design without the consent of the AOC.

             (5)  Where:

             (7)  The Registrar shall, on the application of the AOC made in accordance with an approved form, reduce the duration of the protection period in relation to a registered olympic design.

                     (a)  may, on the application of a person having a sufficient interest in the subject matter of the application, allow the person to be joined as a respondent to the application; and

                     (b)  must allow the CEO to appear and be heard.

the court may order the objector to pay to the designated owner or other respondent compensation, in the amount determined by the court, for any part of that loss or damage that is attributable to any period beginning on or after the day on which the application under section 41 was made.

if the CEO is required or allowed to retain control of the goods under any other law of the Commonwealth.

##### <a id="61"></a>61  Insufficient security

                   If security given under subsection 54(3) by the objector or objectors who gave notice under section 52 is not sufficient to meet the expenses incurred by the Commonwealth as a result of the action taken by the CEO under this Division because of the notice, the amount of the difference between those expenses and the amount of security:

                     (a)  is a debt due by the objector, or by the objectors jointly and severally, to the Commonwealth; and
