                     (b)  permitted to be carried out by or under the licence.

Tax

             (6)  The fee imposed by this section is imposed as a tax.

Note:          For collection of fees, see Part 6.7 of the _Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006_.

## Part 4—Miscellaneous

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Regulations

                   The Governor-General may make regulations for the purposes of this Act.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Transitional provisions

                   Schedule 1 has effect.

# Schedule 1—Transitional provisions

_Note:       See section 8._

##### <a id="1"></a>1  Pre-commencement entries etc.

             (1)  Despite the repeal of the _Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Registration Fees) Act 1967_, that Act continues to apply, in relation to an entry made before the commencement of this clause, as if that repeal had not happened.

             (2)  Item 3 of the table in subsection 5(2) of this Act, and items 2, 4 and 6 of the table in subsection 6(2) of this Act, have effect as if each reference in those items to section 6 of this Act included a reference to subsection 4(5) of the repealed _Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Registration Fees) Act 1967_.

             (3)  Item 4 of the table in subsection 5(2) of this Act has effect as if the reference in that item to section 5 of this Act included a reference to subsection 4(2) of the repealed _Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Registration Fees) Act 1967_.

##### <a id="2"></a>2  Transitional—regulations

             (1)  This clause applies to regulations if:

                     (a)  the regulations were in force immediately before the commencement of this clause; and

                     (b)  the regulations were made for the purposes of a particular provision of the _Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Registration Fees) Act 1967_.

             (2)  The regulations have effect, after the commencement of this clause, as if:

                     (a)  they had been made for the purposes of the corresponding provision of this Act; and

                     (b)  any requirement imposed by this Act or the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ in relation to the making of the regulations (including a requirement about the form of words) had been satisfied.

             (3)  Subclause (2) does not prevent the regulations continuing to have effect for the purposes of a particular provision of the _Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Registration Fees) Act 1967_ as that Act continues to apply after its repeal because of clause 1 of this Schedule.

             (4)  For the purposes of this clause, in determining whether a provision is a corresponding provision:

                     (a)  regard must be had to the substance of the provision; and

                     (b)  if the provision appears to have expressed the same idea in a different form of words for the purpose of using a clearer style—disregard the difference.

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Re-enactment of the _Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Registration Fees) Act 1967_

                   This Act re-enacts the _Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Registration Fees) Act 1967_ with certain modifications.

Note:          Section 15AC of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ provides that if an Act has expressed an idea in a particular form of words, and a later Act appears to have expressed the same idea in a different form of words for the purpose of using a clearer style, the ideas shall not be taken to be different merely because different forms of words were used.
