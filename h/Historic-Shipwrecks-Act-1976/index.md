  2\. DR  LLOYD  DOUGLAS  THOMSON,  M.V.O., Australian Ambassador to the<lf> Netherlands, acting on behalf of the Government of the Commonwealth of<lf> Australia, hereinafter referred to as "Australia":<lf> HAVING  REGARD  TO  THE  FACT:<lf>   A. That vessels that belonged to the Dutch "VEREENIGDE  OOSTINDISCHE<lf> COMPAGNIE" known as the V.O.C., hereinafter referred to as "the V.O.C.", were<lf> wrecked on or off the coast of Western Australia;<lf>   B. That the Netherlands, by virtue of article 247 of the 1798 Constitution of<lf> the Batavian Republic, is the present legal successor to the V.O.C.:<lf> AGREE  AS  FOLLOWS:<lf>   Article 1: The Netherlands, as successor to the property and assets of<lf> the V.O.C., transfers all its right, title and interest in and to wrecked<lf> vessels of the V.O.C. lying on or off the coast of the State of Western<lf> Australia and in and to any articles thereof to Australia which shall accept<lf> such right, title and interest.<lf> <p>  Article 2: For the purpose of this Agreement, the expression<lf> "articles" means any part of vessels as referred to in article 1, that have<lf> become or have been detached or removed therefrom, as well as the fittings,<lf> goods and other property, wherever situated, that were installed or carried on<lf> those vessels.<lf> <p>  Article 3: Australia shall make no claim on the Netherlands for<lf> reimbursement of any costs incurred in searching for any of the vessels referred <lf> to in article 1 of this Agreement or in recovering any articles from those<lf> vessels.<lf> <p>  Article 4: Australia recognizes that the Netherlands has a continuing<lf> interest, particularly for historical and other cultural purposes, in articles<lf> recovered from any of the vessels referred to in article 1 of this Agreement.<lf> <p>  Accordingly Australia shall set up a Committee to determine the disposition<lf> and subsequent ownership of the recovered articles between the Netherlands,<lf> Australia and the State of Western Australia.<lf> <p>  Article 5: The Committee referred to in article 4 of this Agreement<lf> shall be set up within 90 days after the entry into force of the Agreement and<lf> shall comprise two persons nominated by the Netherlands and two persons<lf> nominated by Australia. These persons shall have the scientific and cultural<lf> expertise appropriate for the discharge of their functions.<lf> <p>  Article 6: The Committee shall determine the disposition of the<lf> recovered articles in accordance with the principles which have been agreed upon <lf> by Australia and the Netherlands and are set out in the Arrangement signed by<lf> Australia and the Netherlands and attached to this document.<lf> <p>  Article 7: Expenditure incurred by the Committee in the performance of<lf> its work shall be shared between the two Parties represented on the Committee,<lf> the share to be borne by the Netherlands being one third and that by Australia<lf> two thirds provided that-<lf>   (I) each Party shall bear the costs of travel by the Committee members<lf>        nominated by it,<lf>          (II) the costs of communications by a party to the Committee shall be borne by<lf>        the despatching Party, and<lf>          (III) the expenses of transportation of articles distributed in accordance<lf>        with determinations of the Committee shall be borne by the recipients of the<lf>        articles.<lf>  <p>         Article 8: If the members of the Committee referred to in article 4 of<lf> this Agreement cannot come to an agreement on the disposition of particular<lf> articles, Australia and the Netherlands shall appoint an independent consultant<lf> to report on the matter in issue and the report shall be referred to the<lf> Committee for re-consideration of the matter. The cost of the report shall be<lf> shared between the two Parties represented on the Committee, the share to be<lf> borne by the Netherlands being one third and that by Australia two thirds.<lf> <p>  Article 9: If, on considering the consultant's report on a matter, the<lf> members of the Committee cannot come to an agreement on the disposition of the<lf> recovered articles, the matter will be referred to the Government of the Kingdom <lf> of the Netherlands and the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia, which<lf> will settle the matter by negotiation.<lf> <p>  Article 10: This Agreement shall enter into force on the date of the<lf> signatures of both Parties.<lf> <p>  DONE at The Hague this sixth day of November in the year One thousand nine<lf> hundred and seventy-two in two originals in the English language.<lf> <p>ARRANGEMENT  SETTING  OUT  THE  GUIDING  PRINCIPLES  FOR  THE  COMMITTEE  TO<lf> DETERMINE  THE  DISPOSITION  OF  MATERIAL  FROM  THE  SHIPWRECKS  OF  DUTCH<lf>      EAST  INDIA  COMPANY  VESSELS  OFF  THE  COAST  OF  WESTERN  AUSTRALIA<lf>                                  THE  COMMITTEE<lf> Responsibility<lf>   The Committee's responsibility will embrace all material recovered from<lf> the wrecks-whether recovered before or after the coming into operation of the<lf> Western Australian Museum Act in December 1964 which contains provisions for<lf> vesting in the Museum title to the wrecks of the Batavia, the Gilt Dragon, the<lf> Zuytdorp and Zeewyk.<lf> <p>Conduct of Business<lf>   The Committee is small enough to meet if occasion demands but most of its work <lf> could be done by correspondence.<lf> <p>General Principles<lf> Representative collections<lf>   The cost of recovery (including treatment) is likely to exceed by far the<lf> intrinsic or antiquarian sale-value of material recovered. The Government of<lf> Western Australia is spending considerable sums on this work ($92,000 in the<lf> last financial year) and estimates that the total cost will be $2,000,000 or<lf> more. Although a division would not be warranted by consideration of cash value<lf> alone, the historic, educational, scientific and international considerations<lf> are such as to make the deposition of representative collections in the museums<lf> of the Netherlands and Australia most desirable. The remainder of the material<lf> would be held in the Western Australian Museum.<lf> <p>Considerations governing the partition of archaeological collections<lf>   In modern archaeological practice sites are no longer regarded merely as a<lf> source of important individual items, but rather as a body of material whose<lf> collective value far outweighs the importance of the individual pieces and in<lf> which the relationship of the individual objects within the sample are a major<lf> part of its historical value. Accordingly, the sharing of material from an<lf> archaeological site is best regarded as the accommodation in several localities<lf> of a corporate entity rather than its division into parts.<lf> <p>  If the decision is made that the contents of an archaeological site are to be<lf> apportioned between two or more institutions, the first principle to be observed <lf> is that the total assemblage should be capable of reassembly to allow further<lf> statistical and scholarly analysis. It follows, therefore, that unnecessary<lf> splitting of a sample of closely similar objects capable of statistical<lf> treatment should be avoided and, where samples are accommodated in more than one <lf> institution, those institutions should contract not to disperse them further<lf> and, moreover, to agree to allow samples to be brought together for analysis and <lf> study as required. The second principle is that where unique or rare objects,<lf> themselves, form a meaningful assemblage within the whole, this assemblage<lf> should not be split or, if split, perfect replicas be made to complete the<lf> assemblage. As in the case of the division of statistical samples an agreement<lf> should be made between the recipients to reconstitute the original assemblage if <lf> it is required for scholarly research.<lf> <p>Treatment of material recovered<lf>   The contents of the ancient shipwrecks of the Dutch East India Company include <lf> abundant statistical samples such as coin, bricks, objects of pottery, elephant<lf> tusks, and so on. There are also many articles which are less abundant but which <lf> are duplicated many times over. Many of these are ship fittings such as cannon,<lf> anchors, cannon balls, etc. There are also other articles which are relatively<lf> rare, or even unique, in the deposits (e.g. articles possessed by crew members,<lf> or passengers, such as barber's instruments, navigational instruments,<lf> ornaments, etc.). Most articles are fragmentary and in need of immediate<lf> chemical conservation and stabilization in the laboratory as soon as they are<lf> recovered. This treatment cannot await distribution.<lf> <p>Operating Principles<lf> Code of Operation<lf>   The Committee will operate by reviewing proposals for distribution made, from<lf> time to time, by the Director of the Western Australian Museum; it could decide<lf> that the proposed samples be increased or decreased in content in the light of<lf> the total material collected and other factors.<lf> <p>General aims<lf>   In its deliberations the Committee will have, as its general aim, the purpose<lf> of ensuring that representative series of statistical samples and sufficient<lf> examples of the rarer objects will be deposited in the museums of the<lf> Netherlands and Australia to convey the variety and contents of each wreck to<lf> both the public and to scholars while, at the same time, ensuring that major<lf> projects of scholarly research will not be impeded by overfragmentation of the<lf> collection. Dispersal in this way, among separate repositories will also help to <lf> ensure the permanent safety of representative material in the event of the<lf> destruction of any one repository.<lf> <p>Statistical samples<lf>   Most material so far recovered from the vessels are samples capable of<lf> statistical treatment.<lf> <p>  A representative collection of the contents of each statistical sample should<lf> be made available to a museum of the Netherlands Government and a museum of the<lf> Commonwealth Government. Thus, in the case of coin, for example, both the<lf> Netherlands and Commonwealth Governments would receive as complete a series as<lf> possible representing the mintings and values contained within each of the<lf> wrecks. These will provide their museums with ample material of this class of<lf> objects for display purposes and sufficient to enable a scholar to make the<lf> initial qualitative studies which would possibly lead him to a more detailed<lf> statistical treatment of the bulk sample retained in the Western Australian<lf> Museum.<lf> <p>Less common or rare objects<lf>   In order to ensure that both the Netherlands and Commonwealth Governments<lf> acquire, in due course, representative collections of the less common and even<lf> unique objects, the following procedure will be adopted. Since the relationships <lf> of such objects to the whole sample cannot be known until excavation is<lf> complete, the distribution of specimens of this nature cannot be considered<lf> during the continuing process of recovery. However, at reasonable intervals (of<lf> say two or three years) it should be possible to assemble a representative<lf> sample with fair certainty that all duplicates of any rare object present in a<lf> particular excavation should have been recovered and their nature taken into<lf> consideration during the deliberations of the Committee.<lf> <p>THE  HAGUE,<lf> 6th November, 1972<lf> </lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf>
