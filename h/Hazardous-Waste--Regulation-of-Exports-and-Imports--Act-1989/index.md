##### <a id="17"></a>17  Grant of Basel import permits and Basel export permits

          (1A)  This section applies if the permit sought by a permit application is a Basel import permit or a Basel export permit.

             (1)  Subject to this Division, the Minister must grant the permit sought by a permit application if the Minister is satisfied:

                     (a)  that dealing with the hazardous waste concerned in accordance with the import proposals or export proposals would be consistent with the environmentally sound management of the hazardous waste; and

                     (b)  if the permit sought is a Basel export permit authorising the export of hazardous waste to a particular foreign country:

                              (i)  that the competent authority of the country has given written consent to the grant of the permit; and

                             (ii)  that the consent was given in accordance with Article 6 of the Basel Convention; and

                    (ba)  if the permit sought is a Basel export permit—that the hazardous waste will be allowed to be transported through any foreign country through which the waste is proposed to be transported; and

                     (c)  that, having regard to:

                              (i)  the applicant’s financial viability; and

                             (ii)  the applicant’s previous record in relation to environmental matters; and

             (5)  The Minister may decide not to grant the permit if the permit sought is a Basel export permit and the Minister thinks that:

                     (a)  the hazardous waste could be disposed of safely and efficiently by using a facility in Australia; and

                    (aa)  such a disposal would be consistent with the environmentally sound management of the waste; and

                     (b)  having regard to the desirability of using facilities in Australia for the disposal of hazardous waste, the waste should be disposed of by using that facility rather than in accordance with the export proposals.

             (6)  The Minister must not grant a Basel export permit or a Basel import permit if the Minister is satisfied that the grant could result in hazardous waste being brought into Antarctica.

             (7)  The Minister must not grant a Basel export permit authorising the export of hazardous waste to a foreign country that is not a party to the Basel Convention.

                              (i)  the applicant’s financial viability; and

                             (ii)  the applicant’s previous record in relation to environmental matters; and

                            (iii)  any other relevant matters;

                            the applicant is a suitable person to be granted a Basel transit permit; and

                     (b)  the Minister is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances.

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not apply if the Minister is satisfied that carrying out the export proposals would be inconsistent with the environmentally sound management of the hazardous waste.

             (4)  In deciding whether there are exceptional circumstances for the purposes of subsection (2), the Minister must have regard to the following:

                     (a)  whether there will be a significant risk of injury or damage to human beings or the environment if the Minister decides not to grant the permit;

                     (b)  whether the waste is needed for research into improving the management of hazardous waste;

_Section 4_

_Note        The following text incorporates corrections made by the Rectifications of 4 November 1992 and 16 May 1994, and amendments made by Decision IV/9 of the Fourth Conference of the Parties to the Convention._

PREAMBLE

The Parties to this Convention,

<u>Aware</u> of the risk of damage to human health and the environment caused by hazardous wastes and other wastes and the transboundary movement thereof,

<u>Mindful</u> of the growing threat to human health and the environment posed by the increased generation and complexity, and transboundary movement of hazardous wastes and other wastes,

<u>Mindful also</u> that the most effective way of protecting human health and the environment from the dangers posed by such wastes is the reduction of their generation to a minimum in terms of quantity and/or hazard potential,

<u>Convinced</u> that States should take necessary measures to ensure that the management of hazardous wastes and other wastes including their transboundary movement and disposal is consistent with the protection of human health and the environment whatever the place of their disposal,

<u>Noting</u> that States should ensure that the generator should carry out duties with regard to the transport and disposal of hazardous wastes and other wastes in a manner that is consistent with the protection of the environment, whatever the place of disposal,

<u>Fully recognizing</u> that any State has the sovereign right to ban the entry or disposal of foreign hazardous wastes and other wastes in its territory,

<u>Recognizing also</u> the increasing desire for the prohibition of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal in other States, especially developing countries,

<u>Convinced</u> that hazardous wastes and other wastes should, as far as is compatible with environmentally sound and efficient management, be disposed of in the State where they were generated,

<u>Aware also</u> that transboundary movements of such wastes from the State of their generation to any other State should be permitted only when conducted under conditions which do not endanger human health and the environment, and under conditions in conformity with the provisions of this Convention,

<u>Considering</u> that enhanced control of transboundary movement of hazardous wastes and other wastes will act as an incentive for their environmentally sound management and for the reduction of the volume of such transboundary movement,

<u>Convinced</u> that States should take measures for the proper exchange of information on and control of the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes and other wastes from and to those States,

<u>Noting</u> that a number of international and regional agreements have addressed the issue of protection and preservation of the environment with regard to the transit of dangerous goods,

<u>Taking into account</u> the Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (Stockholm, 1972), the Cairo Guidelines and Principles for the Environmentally Sound Management of Hazardous Wastes adopted by the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) by decision 14/30 of 17 June 1987, the Recommendations of the United Nations Committee of Experts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods (formulated in 1957 and updated biennially), relevant recommendations, declarations, instruments and regulations adopted within the United Nations system and the work and studies done within other international and regional organizations,

<u>Mindful</u> of the spirit, principles, aims and functions of the World Charter for Nature adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations at its thirty-seventh session (1982) as the rule of ethics in respect of the protection of the human environment and the conservation of natural resources,

<u>Affirming</u> that States are responsible for the fulfilment of their international obligations concerning the protection of human health and protection and preservation of the environment, and are liable in accordance with international law,

<u>Recognizing</u> that in the case of a material breach of the provisions of this Convention or any protocol thereto the relevant international law of treaties shall apply,

<u>Aware</u> of the need to continue the development and implementation of environmentally sound low-waste technologies, recycling options, good house-keeping and management systems with a view to reducing to a minimum the generation of hazardous wastes and other wastes,

<u>Aware also</u> of the growing international concern about the need for stringent control of transboundary movement of hazardous wastes and other wastes, and of the need as far as possible to reduce such movement to a minimum,

<u>Concerned</u> about the problem of illegal transboundary traffic in hazardous wastes and other wastes,

<u>Taking into account also</u> the limited capabilities of the developing countries to manage hazardous wastes and other wastes,

<u>Recognizing</u> the need to promote the transfer of technology for the sound management of hazardous wastes and other wastes produced locally, particularly to the developing countries in accordance with the spirit of the Cairo Guidelines and decision 14/16 of the Governing Council of UNEP on Promotion of the transfer of environmental protection technology,

<u>Recognizing also</u> that hazardous wastes and other wastes should be transported in accordance with relevant international conventions and recommendations,

<u>Convinced also</u> that the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes and other wastes should be permitted only when the transport and the ultimate disposal of such wastes is environmentally sound, and

<u>Determined</u> to protect, by strict control, human health and the environment against the adverse effects which may result from the generation and management of hazardous wastes and other wastes,

HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:

<u>Article 17</u>

<u>Amendment of the Convention</u>

                   1.  Any Party may propose amendments to this Convention and any Party to a protocol may propose amendments to that protocol. Such amendments shall take due account, <u>inter alia</u>, of relevant scientific and technical considerations.

                   2.  Amendments to this Convention shall be adopted at a meeting of the Conference of the Parties. Amendments to any protocol shall be adopted at a meeting of the Parties to the protocol in question. The text of any proposed amendment to this Convention or to any protocol, except as may otherwise be provided in such protocol, shall be communicated to the Parties by the Secretariat at least six months before the meeting at which it is proposed for adoption. The Secretariat shall also communicate proposed amendments to the Signatories to this Convention for information.

                   3.  The Parties shall make every effort to reach agreement on any proposed amendment to this Convention by consensus. If all efforts at consensus have been exhausted, and no agreement reached, the amendment shall as a last resort be adopted by a three-fourths majority vote of the Parties present and voting at the meeting, and shall be submitted by the Depositary to all Parties for ratification, approval, formal confirmation or acceptance.

                   4.  The procedure mentioned in paragraph 3 above shall apply to amendments to any protocol, except that a two-thirds majority of the Parties to that protocol present and voting at the meeting shall suffice for their adoption.

                   5.  Instruments of ratification, approval, formal confirmation or acceptance of amendments shall be deposited with the Depositary. Amendments adopted in accordance with paragraphs 3 or 4 above shall enter into force between Parties having accepted them on the ninetieth day after the receipt by the Depositary of their instrument of ratification, approval, formal confirmation or acceptance by at least three-fourths of the Parties who accepted them or by at least two thirds of the Parties to the protocol concerned who accepted them, except as may otherwise be provided in such protocol. The amendments shall enter into force for any other Party on the ninetieth day after that Party deposits its instrument of ratification, approval, formal confirmation or acceptance of the amendments.

                   6.  For the purpose of this Article, “Parties present and voting” means Parties present and casting an affirmative or negative vote.

<u>Article 18</u>

<u>Adoption and Amendment of Annexes</u>

                   1.  The annexes to this Convention or to any protocol shall form an integral part of this Convention or of such protocol, as the case may be and, unless expressly provided otherwise, a reference to this Convention or its protocols constitutes at the same time a reference to any annexes thereto. Such annexes shall be restricted to scientific, technical and administrative matters.

                   2.  Except as may be otherwise provided in any protocol with respect to its annexes, the following procedure shall apply to the proposal, adoption and entry into force of additional annexes to this Convention or of annexes to a protocol:

     (a)  Annexes to this Convention and its protocols shall be proposed and adopted according to the procedure laid down in Article 17, paragraphs 2, 3 and 4;

     (b)  Any Party that is unable to accept an additional annex to this Convention or an annex to any protocol to which it is party shall so notify the Depositary, in writing, within six months from the date of the communication of the adoption by the Depositary. The Depositary shall without delay notify all Parties of any such notification received. A Party may at any time substitute an acceptance for a previous declaration of objection and the annexes shall thereupon enter into force for that Party;

     (c)  On the expiry of six months from the date of the circulation of the communication by the Depositary, the annex shall become effective for all Parties to this Convention or to any protocol concerned, which have not submitted a notification in accordance with the provision of subparagraph (b) above.

                   3.  The proposal, adoption and entry into force of amendments to annexes to this Convention or to any protocol shall be subject to the same procedure as for the proposal, adoption and entry into force of annexes to the Convention or annexes to a protocol. Annexes and amendments thereto shall take due account, <u>inter alia</u>, of relevant scientific and technical considerations.

                   4.  If an additional annex or an amendment to an annex involves an amendment to this Convention or to any protocol, the additional annex or amended annex shall not enter into force until such time as the amendment to this Convention or to the protocol enters into force.

<u>Article 19</u>

<u>Verification</u>

                        Any Party which has reason to believe that another Party is acting or has acted in breach of its obligations under this Convention may inform the Secretariat thereof, and in such an event, shall simultaneously and immediately inform, directly or through the Secretariat, the Party against whom the allegations are made. All relevant information should be submitted by the Secretariat to the Parties.

<u>Article 20</u>

<u>Settlement of Disputes</u>

                   1.  In case of a dispute between Parties as to the interpretation or application of, or compliance with, this Convention or any protocol thereto, they shall seek a settlement of the dispute through negotiation or any other peaceful means of their own choice.

                   2.  If the Parties concerned cannot settle their dispute through the means mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the dispute, if the parties to the dispute agree, shall be submitted to the International Court of Justice or to arbitration under the conditions set out in Annex VI on Arbitration. However, failure to reach common agreement on submission of the dispute to the International Court of Justice or to arbitration shall not absolve the Parties from the responsibility of continuing to seek to resolve it by the means referred to in paragraph 1.

                   3.  When ratifying, accepting, approving, formally confirming or acceding to this Convention, or at any time thereafter, a State or political and/or economic integration organization may declare that it recognizes as compulsory <u>ipso facto </u>and without special agreement, in relation to any Party accepting the same obligation:

     (a)  submission of the dispute to the International Court of Justice; and/or

     (b)  arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in Annex VI.

Tests

The potential hazards posed by certain types of wastes are not yet fully documented; tests to define quantitatively these hazards do not exist. Further research is necessary in order to develop means to characterise potential hazards posed to man and/or the environment by these wastes. Standardized tests have been derived with respect to pure substances and materials. Many countries have developed national tests which can be applied to materials listed in Annex I, in order to decide if these materials exhibit any of the characteristics listed in this Annex.
