##### <a id="1"></a>1  Short title [_see_ Note 1]

##### <a id="2"></a>2  Commencement [_see_ Note 1]

                   This Act commences on the day on which the _Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995_ commences.

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Interpretation

                   Unless the contrary intention appears, expressions used in this Act have the same meanings as in the _Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995_.

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Application of this Act to events occurring before the commencement of the _Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995_

             (1)  This Act only applies in relation to an amount of compensation fixed by a judgment or settlement if the judgment or settlement is made on or after the day on which the _Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995_ commences.

             (2)  This Act only applies in relation to an amount of compensation payable under a reimbursement arrangement if the reimbursement arrangement was made on or after the day on which the _Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995_ commences.

             (3)  This Act applies in relation to such a judgment, settlement or reimbursement arrangement even if it is made in respect of an injury that occurred before that day.

             (4)  In its application in respect of an injury that occurred before that day, this Act is capable of applying in relation to a particular payment of an eligible benefit whether the payment was made before, on or after that day.

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Charge on compensation in respect of reimbursements for professional services

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a reimbursement arrangement has been made in respect of an injury to a compensable person; and

                     (b)  the person is entitled, under the reimbursement arrangement, to compensation by way of reimbursement of expenses as those expenses are incurred, being expenses relating to the professional services rendered to the person in the course of treatment of, or as a result of, the injury.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  medicare benefit has been paid in respect of a professional service rendered to the person; and

                     (b)  under the reimbursement arrangement, the person is entitled to reimbursement of the whole or any part of the amount payable for the service;

there is payable to the Commonwealth a charge, in respect of the compensation, of an amount equal to the medicare benefit.

             (3)  The charge is payable by the person entitled to the reimbursement.

             (4)  This section has effect only so far as it is a law imposing taxation or dealing with the imposition of taxation within the meaning of section 55 of the Constitution.

Note:          So far as this section would not be a law imposing taxation or dealing with the imposition of taxation, see section 7 of the _Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995_.

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Charge on compensation amounts in respect of past payments of medicare benefit

             (1)  Subject to subsections (2), (3), (6) and (9), if:

                     (c)  a liability has not already arisen under section 5 in respect of that payment of medicare benefit;

there is payable to the Commonwealth a charge, in respect of the compensation, of an amount equal to the medicare benefit.

             (2)  Subject to subsection (3), if:

                     (a)  the judgment or settlement fixes the amount of compensation on the basis that liability for the injury should be apportioned between the compensable person and the compensation payer; and

                     (b)  as a result, the amount of compensation is less than it would have been if liability had not been so apportioned;

the amount payable to the Commonwealth under subsection (1) is reduced by the proportion corresponding to the proportion of liability for the injury that is apportioned to the compensable person by the judgment or settlement.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  the amount of compensation is fixed by a judgment that specifies an amount (the **_past medical care component_**), being a portion of the amount of compensation, to be a component for the medical expenses already incurred relating to the injury; and

                     (b)  the amount that, apart from this subsection, would be payable to the Commonwealth under this section exceeds the past medical care component;

the amount payable under subsection (1) is taken to be the past medical care component.

             (4)  The charge is payable by the compensable person.

                     (c)  an amount of compensation is fixed under the judgment or settlement during the period of the bulk payment agreement; and

                     (d)  the judgment or settlement determines all the outstanding liability of the compensation payer in relation to the claim.

             (7)  Subsection (6) does not apply in relation to a judgment or settlement of a kind referred to in that subsection if:

                     (a)  an amount of compensation was fixed under the judgment or settlement during the period of the bulk payment agreement; and

                     (b)  at the time the judgment or settlement was made, it purported to determine all the outstanding liability of the compensation payer in relation to the claim; and

                     (c)  another judgment or settlement in respect of the claim is made after the end of the period of the bulk payment agreement.

             (8)  Subsection (6) does not affect the validity of a payment of money pursuant to a notice under section 24 of the _Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995_ if the payment occurred before the amount of compensation was fixed under the judgment or settlement referred to in that subsection.
