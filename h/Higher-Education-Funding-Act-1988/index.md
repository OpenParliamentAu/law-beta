                              (i)  stating that the student asks the Commonwealth, if the student is undertaking the course as a contributing student on the census date for the course for a semester and has made a student payment for the course:

                                        (A)  to lend to the student an amount (the **_formula amount_**) worked out using the following formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00257/Html/6f8718c2-0a4f-4b13-8e46-631b3e03957b_files/image005.gif)

                                        (B)  to apply the money lent in paying to the institution, in discharge of the student’s liability to pay the remainder of the assessed contribution (see subsection (1B)), the amount of that assessed contribution outstanding after deducting from that assessed contribution the amount of the student payment; and

                             (ii)  stating that the student asks the Commonwealth if, having made one or more student payments in respect of the course, the student is undertaking the course in a later semester as a contributing student on the census date for the course without having made a student payment in respect of the course in that semester  on or before the census date for the course for that semester:

                                        (A)  to lend to the student an amount equal to the unpaid part of the assessed contribution; and

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00257/Html/6f8718c2-0a4f-4b13-8e46-631b3e03957b_files/image006.gif)

                   This amount is the **_formula amount_**(see sub-subparagraph (1A)(c)(i)(A)).

                   The amount that the Commonwealth will pay to the institution to discharge the student’s liability is $1350, ie:

### Division 3—Discharge by Commonwealth of students’ liabilities for contributions

##### <a id="57"></a>57  Commonwealth to discharge students’ liabilities

             (1)  Where a student in relation to a course of study at an institution is liable to pay a contribution to the institution in respect of that course of study in respect of a semester, the following provisions of this section apply.

             (2)  If the student has made a payment in respect of the contribution in accordance with subparagraph 41(1)(a)(i) and has complied with subparagraph 41(1)(a)(ii), the Commonwealth shall, as a benefit to the student, pay to the institution an amount equal to the remainder (if any) of the contribution in discharge of the student’s liability to pay that remainder of the contribution.

             (3)  If the student has not made a payment in respect of the contribution in accordance with subparagraph 41(1)(a)(i) but has complied with paragraph 41(1)(b) and section 41B, the Commonwealth shall, as a benefit to the student, lend to the student an amount equal to the unpaid part of the contribution and apply the amount so lent in making a payment to the institution in discharge of the student’s liability to pay the unpaid part of the contribution.

          (3A)  If the student has not:

                     (a)  made a payment in respect of a contribution in accordance with subparagraph 41(1)(a)(i); or

                     (b)  complied with paragraph 41(1)(b);

but the student has:

                     (c)  made a payment in respect of the contribution in accordance with paragraph 41(1A)(a) (the **_student payment_**); and

                     (d)  complied with section 41B;

the Commonwealth must, as a benefit to the student:

                     (e)  lend to the student an amount worked out using the formula in sub‑subparagraph 41(1A)(c)(i)(A) (the **_formula amount_**) and apply the amount so lent in making a payment to the institution in partial discharge of the student’s liability to pay the unpaid part of the contribution; and

                      (f)  pay to the institution, in discharge of the remainder of the student’s liability, an amount (the **_discount amount_**) worked out using the following formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00257/Html/6f8718c2-0a4f-4b13-8e46-631b3e03957b_files/image009.gif)

Example: If the student’s contribution for the course of study is $2,350 and the student makes a payment of $1,000, the amount that the Commonwealth will lend to the student is $1,017, ie:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00257/Html/6f8718c2-0a4f-4b13-8e46-631b3e03957b_files/image010.gif)

                This amount is the**_formula amount_**(seeparagraph (3A)(e)).

                The amount that the Commonwealth will pay to the institution to discharge the student’s liability is $1,350, ie:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00257/Html/6f8718c2-0a4f-4b13-8e46-631b3e03957b_files/image007.gif)

                The amount that the Commonwealth will pay to the institution comprises the sum of the amount the Commonwealth will lend to the student, ie $1,017 (the formula amount) and the student discount that the student receives for making the student payment ($333).

                The value of the discount to the student for making the student payment is calculated as follows:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00257/Html/6f8718c2-0a4f-4b13-8e46-631b3e03957b_files/image008.gif)

                This amount is the **_discount amount_** (see paragraph (3A)(f)).

          (3B)  If:

                     (a)  the student has made a student payment as provided for in subsection (3A); and

                     (b)  the student continues undertaking the course of study and, in a later semester, does not make a student payment in respect of the later semester as provided for in subparagraph 41(1A)(c)(ii), the Commonwealth must, as a benefit to the student:

                              (i)  lend to the student an amount equal to the unpaid part of the contribution; and

                             (ii)  apply the amount so lent in making a payment to the institution in discharge of the student’s liability to pay the unpaid part of the contribution.

          (3C)  If an amount worked out by using the formula in subsection (3A) is an amount made up of dollars and cents, then:

                     (a)  if the amount of cents in the amount is 50—the amount is to be rounded up to the nearest dollar; and

                     (b)  in any other case—the amount is to be rounded up or down to the nearest dollar.

             (4)  The Commonwealth may make advances to an institution on account of an amount that is expected to become payable by the Commonwealth to the institution under this section.

##### <a id="58"></a>58  Institutions to provide information to Minister

                   An institution shall give to the Minister, if and when required by the Minister to do so, such information in its possession relating to students in relation to designated courses of study at the institution in a semester (not being information as to the name or address of a student) as the Minister reasonably requires for the purposes of this Part.

             (3)  The Minister must not make a declaration under subsection (2) that would result in an institution becoming an eligible private institution.

             (4)  For the purposes of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_, a declaration under subsection (2) that amends the table in subsection (1) by way of repealing part of that table is taken to be an Act that repeals that part of the table.

##### <a id="106N"></a>106N  Calculation of accumulated HEC debt

             (1)  If a person incurred a semester debt or debts before 1 June in a year (the **_relevant date_**) but after 1 June in the immediately preceding year, the person incurs on the relevant date an **accumulated HEC debt** to the Commonwealth of an amount equal to:

                     (a)  that debt; or

                     (b)  the total of those debts;

less any amounts paid before the relevant date in reduction of that debt or those debts.

             (2)  If on 1 June in a year (**_relevant date_**) a person owes to the Commonwealth:

                     (a)  a semester debt or debts incurred before 1 June in the immediately preceding year (the **_earlier date_**); and

                     (b)  a semester debt or debts incurred after the earlier date;

the person incurs on the relevant date an accumulated HEC debt that is made up of:

                     (c)  the adjusted accumulated HEC debt of the person at the earlier date (see subsection (3)) multiplied by the factor worked out under subsection (5); and

                     (d)  the debt or debts referred to in paragraph (b).

          (2A)  A person cannot incur an accumulated HEC debt on 1 June 2006 or on 1 June in any later year.

Note:          A person’s accumulated HELP debt, worked out under section 140‑25 of the _Higher Education Support Act 2003_, for the financial year starting on 1 July 2005 can include an amount for the person’s accumulated HEC debt incurred on 1 June 2005: see Part 3 of Schedule 1 to the _Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 2003_.

             (3)  For the purposes of paragraph (2)(c), the **adjusted accumulated HEC debt of the person at the earlier date** is the amount worked out by using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00257/Html/6f8718c2-0a4f-4b13-8e46-631b3e03957b_files/image011.gif)

where:

                    <a name=""></a>**_A_** is the accumulated HEC debt of the person as at the earlier date;

                    <a name=""></a>**_B_** is the sum of:

                     (a)  any HEC assessment debt or HEC assessment debts of the person assessed on or after the earlier date and before the relevant date, excluding any such HEC assessment debt of the person assessed as a result of a return given before the earlier date; and

                     (b)  any HEC assessment debt or HEC assessment debts of the person assessed on or after the relevant date as a result of a return given before the relevant date;

                    <a name=""></a>**_C_**is any amount, or the sum of any amounts, by which the person’s accumulated HEC debt at the earlier date is to be reduced because of any payment or payments made (otherwise than in discharge of an HEC assessment debt) on or after the earlier date and before the relevant date.

                    <a name=""></a>**_D_** is any amount, or the sum of any amounts, by which (whether as a result of an increase in the person’s taxable income of a year of income or otherwise) any HEC assessment debt of the person is increased by an amendment of the relevant assessment made on or after the earlier date and before the relevant date; and

                    <a name=""></a>**_E_** is any amount, or the sum of any amounts, by which (whether as a result of a reduction in the person’s taxable income of a year of income or otherwise) any HEC assessment debt of the person is reduced by an amendment of the relevant assessment made on or after the earlier date and before the relevant date.

             (4)  For the purposes of subsection (3), an assessment or an amendment of an assessment is taken to have been made on the day specified in the notice of assessment or notice of amended assessment (as the case may be) as the date of that notice.

             (5)  The factor to be used for the purposes of paragraph (2)(c) in calculating the accumulated HEC debt of a person at 1 June in a year is the number (calculated to 3 decimal places) worked out, as at the date on which the index number in respect of the March quarter immediately preceding that 1 June was first published, by dividing the sum of:

                     (a)  the index number in respect of that March quarter; and

                     (b)  the index numbers in respect of the 3 quarters that immediately preceded that quarter;

by the sum of:

                     (c)  the index number in respect of the March quarter immediately preceding 1 June in the year that next preceded that year; and

                     (d)  the index numbers in respect of the 3 quarters that immediately preceded that last‑mentioned quarter.

             (6)  Subject to subsection (7), if at any time, whether before or after the commencement of this section, the Australian Statistician has published or publishes an index number in respect of a quarter in substitution for an index number previously published by the Australian Statistician in respect of that quarter, the publication of the later index number is to be disregarded for the purposes of this section.

             (7)  If, at any time, whether before or after the commencement of this section, the Australian Statistician has changed or changes the reference base for the Consumer Price Index, then, for the purposes of the application of this section after the change took place or takes place, regard is to be had only to index numbers published in terms of the new reference base.

             (8)  If the factor worked out in accordance with subsection (5) in calculating the accumulated HEC debt of a person at 1 June in a year would, if it were calculated to 4 decimal places, end with a number greater than 4, the factor worked out in accordance with that subsection in making that calculation is taken to be the factor calculated to 3 decimal places in accordance with that subsection and increased by 0.001.

             (9)  The Commissioner must cause to be published before 1 June in each year the factor worked out in accordance with subsection (5) (as affected by subsection (8)) in relation to the calculation of the accumulated HEC debt of a person at that date.

           (10)  If, apart from this subsection, the accumulated HEC debt of a person at 1 June in a year would be an amount consisting of a number of whole dollars and a number of cents, the number of cents must be disregarded.

           (11)  In this section:

                    <a name="index-number"></a>**_index number_**, in relation to a quarter, means the All Groups Consumer Price Index number, being the weighted average of the 8 capital cities, published by the Australian Statistician in respect of that quarter.

##### <a id="106O"></a>106O  Accumulated HEC debt discharges earlier debts

             (1)  The accumulated HEC debt that a person incurs on 1 June in a year (**_relevant date_**) discharges, or discharges the unpaid part of:

                     (a)  any accumulated HEC debt that the person incurred on the preceding 1 June (**_earlier date_**); and

                     (b)  any semester debt that was incurred by the person on or after the earlier date and before the relevant date.

             (2)  Nothing in subsection (1) affects the application of section 106L or 106N.

## Part 5A.3—Discharge of Indebtedness

### Division 1—Voluntary discharge of indebtedness

##### <a id="106P"></a>106P  Voluntary payments in respect of debts

             (1)  Subject to this Division, if a person owes a debt to the Commonwealth under this Chapter, the person may at any time make a payment in respect of that debt.

             (2)  The payment must be made to the Commissioner. 

##### <a id="106PA"></a>106PA  Repayment of debt under this Chapter

             (1)  This section applies in relation to the repayment of any debt under this Chapter other than an HEC assessment debt.

             (3)  The debtor is taken to pay off the total debt if he or she pays in respect of the debt an amount worked out by using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00257/Html/6f8718c2-0a4f-4b13-8e46-631b3e03957b_files/image012.gif)

             (4)  Subject to subsection (5), if a person pays an amount of $500 or more in part settlement of a debt, the outstanding amount of the debt is to be reduced by the amount worked out by using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00257/Html/6f8718c2-0a4f-4b13-8e46-631b3e03957b_files/image013.gif)

Example:    If a person owes a semester debt of $1,700, and the person makes a payment of $600, the debt is to be reduced by an amount of $660 (i.e. $600 x 1.1), leaving a balance of $1,040 ($1,700 – $660) to be paid.

             (5)  Subsections (3) and (4) do not apply in respect of a payment in respect of a debt if, in addition to that debt, the debtor owes an HEC assessment debt to the Commonwealth.

             (6)  If an amount worked out by using the formula in subsection (3) or (4) is an amount made up of a number of dollars and cents, then:

                     (a)  if the amount of cents in the amount is 50—the amount is to be rounded up to the nearest dollar; and

                     (b)  in any other case—the amount is to be rounded up or down to the nearest dollar.

### Division 1A—Voluntary repayments of accumulated HEC debt

             (2)  A person who has made an election under subsection (1) may, at any time before the person becomes liable to pay an amount under section 106PC, revoke the election by notice in writing in an approved form to the Commissioner.

##### <a id="106PC"></a>106PC  Voluntary payments in respect of accumulated HEC debt

          (1A)  Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to the 1997‑98 year of income or any later year of income.

                     (b)  the HEC repayment income of the person in respect of a year of income:

                              (i)  exceeds the prescribed amount for the year of income for the purposes of this section (see subsection (3)); but

                     (c)  on 1 June immediately preceding the making of an assessment in respect of the person’s income of that year of income, the person had an accumulated HEC debt;

the person is liable to pay in accordance with this Chapter to the Commonwealth in reduction of his or her relevant debt (see subsection (3)) an amount equal to so much of that relevant debt as does not exceed 2% of the person’s HEC repayment income.

             (2)  On the person first becoming liable to pay an amount to the Commonwealth under subsection (1), an additional amount equal to 10% of the person’s relevant debt is taken to have been paid in reduction of that debt.

             (3)  In subsections (1) and (2):

                    <a name="relev-debt"></a>**_relevant debt_** in relation to a person means:

                     (a)  subject to paragraph (b) of this subsection—the person’s accumulated HEC debt referred to in paragraph (1)(c); or

                     (b)  if an amount or amounts have been paid in reduction of that debt, or an amount is taken (under subsection (2)) to have been paid in reduction of that debt, or an amount or amounts have been assessed under section 106T to be payable in respect of that debt—the amount (if any) remaining after deducting from that debt the amount so paid or taken to have been paid or the sum of the amounts so paid or assessed to be payable.

             (4)  A reference in paragraph (3)(b) to an amount assessed under section 106T to be payable in respect of a person’s accumulated HEC debt is, if the amount has been increased or reduced by an amendment of the relevant assessment, a reference to the increased or the reduced amount (as the case may be).

             (5)  For the purposes of this section, the prescribed amount is:

                     (a)  in the case of the year of income ending 30 June 1996—$20,000; or

                     (b)  in the case of a subsequent year of income—the number of whole dollars of the amount worked out by using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00257/Html/6f8718c2-0a4f-4b13-8e46-631b3e03957b_files/image014.gif)

                            where:

                              (i)  an accumulated HEC debt; or

                            (iii)  both; and

                     (b)  that debt or those debts had not been discharged before the bankruptcy date.

Debts related to pre‑bankruptcy period are provable

             (2)  Subject to subsection (5), the following are taken to be provable debts for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act:

                     (a)  the pre‑bankruptcy part of the bankrupt’s accumulated HEC debt;

                     (b)  the unpaid part of the semester debt, or of each of the semester debts.

Note 1:       An accumulated HEC debt and a semester debt can be discharged and replaced by a new accumulated HEC debt through the operation of sections 106N and 106O.

Note 2:       If an accumulated HEC debt, or a semester debt that the bankrupt incurred before the bankrupt’s bankruptcy date, is discharged and replaced in this way:

(a)           it ceases to be a provable debt; and

(b)           subsections (6) and (7) of this section can apply to the new accumulated HEC debt; and

(c)           for that purpose, a pre‑bankruptcy part for the bankrupt’s new accumulated HEC debt is calculated under subsections (8) and (9).

             (3)  To avoid doubt, the following are taken not to be provable debts for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act:

                     (a)  the bankrupt’s accumulated HEC debt (apart from the pre‑bankruptcy part of that debt);

                     (b)  any semester debt incurred by the bankrupt on or after the bankrupt’s bankruptcy date.

                     (a)  the pre‑bankruptcy part of the bankrupt’s accumulated HEC debt; or

                     (b)  a semester debt mentioned in subsection (1);

is taken for the purposes of this Part to be money that the bankrupt has directed to be applied in payment of that debt.

No release on discharge from bankruptcy

             (5)  Section 153 of the Bankruptcy Act does not operate to release the bankrupt from the following:

                     (a)  all or any part of the accumulated HEC debt;

                     (b)  a semester debt mentioned in subsection (1).

Replacement of accumulated HEC debt

                     (a)  subsections (2) to (5) apply to an accumulated HEC debt (the **_old HEC debt_**) of the bankrupt (including because of a previous application of this subsection or subsection (7)); and

                     (b)  the old HEC debt is discharged under section 106O because the bankrupt incurred another accumulated HEC debt (the **_replacement HEC debt_**) under section 106N;

then:

                     (c)  after the replacement HEC debt is incurred, those subsections apply (subject to any later application of this subsection) to the replacement HEC debt instead of the old HEC debt; and

                     (d)  for that purpose:

                              (i)  a proof of debt under the Bankruptcy Act in relation to the pre‑bankruptcy part of the old HEC debt (including because of a previous application of this subsection or subsection (7)) is taken to relate, to the extent of that proof, to the pre‑bankruptcy part of the replacement HEC debt; and

                             (ii)  if at the time the old HEC debt is discharged under section 106O, a semester debt of the bankrupt is also discharged under that section—a proof of debt under the Bankruptcy Act in relation to the semester debt is taken to relate, to the extent of that proof, to the pre‑bankruptcy part of the replacement HEC debt.

Replacement of semester debt only

             (7)  If:

                     (a)  immediately before the bankrupt’s bankruptcy date, the bankrupt had:

                              (i)  one or more undischarged semester debts (an **_old semester debt_**); and

                             (ii)  no undischarged accumulated HEC debt; and

                     (b)  on or after the bankruptcy date, the unpaid part of an old semester debt is discharged under section 106O because the bankrupt incurred an accumulated HEC debt (the **_new HEC debt_**) under section 106N;

then:

                     (c)  after the new HEC debt is incurred, subsections (2) to (5) apply (subject to any later application of subsection (6)) to the new HEC debt instead of the old semester debt; and

                     (d)  for that purpose, a proof of debt under the Bankruptcy Act in relation to the old semester debt is taken to relate to the pre‑bankruptcy part of the new HEC debt.

             (8)  Subject to subsection (9), the **_pre‑bankruptcy part_** of a bankrupt’s accumulated HEC debt is the amount that would be the bankrupt’s relevant debt calculated in accordance with subsections 106Q(2) and (3), if:

                     (a)  that amount was calculated as at the time immediately before the bankrupt’s bankruptcy date; and

                     (b)  the reference in paragraph 106Q(2)(a) to the person’s accumulated HEC debt referred to in paragraph (1)(b) were a reference to the person’s accumulated HEC debt on the 1 June immediately preceding the bankruptcy date.

             (9)  If:

                     (a)  immediately before the bankrupt’s bankruptcy date, the bankrupt had one or more undischarged semester debts; and

                     (b)  at a time (the **_discharge time_**) on or after the bankruptcy date, the unpaid part of those debts (the **_discharged amount_**) was discharged because of the operation of section 106O;

then:

                     (c)  if the bankrupt did not have an accumulated HEC debt immediately before the discharge time—the **_pre‑bankruptcy part_** of the bankrupt’s accumulated HEC debt is equal to the discharged amount; or

                     (d)  otherwise—the **_pre‑bankruptcy part_** of the bankrupt’s accumulated HEC debt is taken to be increased at the discharge time by an amount equal to the discharged amount.

If, before the commencement, the Minister referred a matter to the old ARC under paragraph 27(1)(b) of the old EET Act and the old ARC had not finished dealing with that reference by the commencement, the new ARC is to continue dealing with that reference after the commencement as if it were a request for advice in relation to the matter under subsection 6(2) of the new Act.

## 3  Continued effect of Ministerial directions and guidelines

A direction or guideline in force under subsection 29(1) of the old EET Act immediately before the commencement has effect after the commencement as if it were a direction under subsection 7(1) of the new Act.

## 4  Continued effect of funding approvals given in relation to old ARC‑administered schemes

If, in relation to an old ARC‑administered scheme, an approval under subsection 23(1) or (1A) of the old HEF Act was in force immediately before the commencement in respect of a year to which Division 1 of Part 7 of the new Act applies, that approval has effect after the commencement as if it were an approval under section 51 of the new Act that was made in accordance with the requirements of that Act.

## 5  Continued effect of funding recommendations made in relation to old ARC‑administered schemes

(1)       If:

                     (a)  in relation to an old ARC‑administered scheme, the old ARC made a recommendation to the Minister before the commencement in relation to whether a particular approval under subsection 23(1) or (1A) of the old HEF Act should be given in respect of a year to which Division 1 of Part 7 of the new Act applies; and

                     (b)  the Minister has not given the approval, or refused to give the approval, before the commencement;

the Minister must deal with the recommendation after the commencement as if the old HEF Act (and instruments made under it) were still in force.

(2)       If, after the commencement, the Minister decides to give the approval, that approval has effect as if it were an approval under section 51 of the new Act that was made in accordance with the requirements of that Act.

## 6  Funding rules for 2001

(1)       If, in relation to an old ARC‑administered scheme, guidelines developed by the old ARC and approved by the Minister for the year 2001 (whether those guidelines also cover a later year or years) were in force immediately before the commencement, those guidelines have effect after the commencement as if they were funding rules made by the Board and approved by the Minister under and in accordance with Subdivision D of Division 1 of Part 7 of the new Act.

(2)       Subsection 59(1) does not apply to require the new ARC to make guidelines under that section for the year 2001.

## 7  Funding split determination for 2001

If a law of the Commonwealth in force immediately before the commencement refers to a kind of institution and defines that kind of institution by reference to a definition in the _Employment, Education and Training Act 1988_, then, despite its repeal, Part 1 of that Act is taken to continue in force after the commencement for the purposes of that law of the Commonwealth.

_Tax Laws Amendment (Repeal of Inoperative Provisions) Act 2006 
 (No. 101, 2006)_

## Schedule 6

## 1  Application of Schedule 1 and 2 amendments

Except as mentioned in items 2 and 3, the repeals and amendments made by Schedules 1 and 2 apply:

                     (a)  so far as they affect assessments—to assessments for the 2006‑07 income year and all later income years; and

                     (b)  otherwise—to acts done or omitted to be done, or states of affairs existing, after the commencement of the repeals and amendments.

## 6  Object

The object of this Part is to ensure that, despite the repeals and amendments made by this Act, the full legal and administrative consequences of:

                     (a)  any act done or omitted to be done; or

                     (b)  any state of affairs existing; or

                     (c)  any period ending;

before such a repeal or amendment applies, can continue to arise and be carried out, directly or indirectly through an indefinite number of steps, even if some or all of those steps are taken after the repeal or amendment applies.

## 7  Making and amending assessments, and doing other things, in relation to past matters

Even though an Act is repealed or amended by this Act, the repeal or amendment is disregarded for the purpose of doing any of the following under any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_):

                     (a)  making or amending an assessment (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

                     (b)  exercising any right or power, performing any obligation or duty or doing any other thing (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

Example 1: On 31 July 1999, Greg Ltd lodged its annual return under former section 160ARE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The return stated that the company had a credit on its franking account and that no franking deficit tax was payable for the 1998‑99 franking year. Under former section 160ARH of that Act, the Commissioner was taken to have made an assessment consistent with the return.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of Part IIIAA of that Act, the Commissioner concludes that Greg Ltd fraudulently overfranked dividends it paid during the 1998‑99 franking year, and had a franking account deficit for that franking year. As a result, the Commissioner considers that franking deficit tax and a penalty by way of additional tax are payable.

                   The Commissioner can amend the assessment under former section 160ARN of that Act, because item 7 of this Schedule disregards the repeal of that section for the purposes of making an assessment in relation to the 1998‑99 franking year. Item 7 will also disregard the repeal of Division 11 of former Part IIIAA to the extent necessary for the Commissioner to assess Greg Ltd’s liability to a penalty by way of additional tax.

                   Despite the repeal of sections 160ARU and 160ARV, item 9 will ensure that the general interest charge will accrue on the unpaid franking deficit tax and penalty until they are paid.

                   Item 7 will also preserve Greg Ltd’s right, under former section 160ART of that Act, to object against the Commissioner’s amended assessment (including the penalty), since the objection is the exercise of a right in relation to a franking year that ended before the repeal of Part IIIAA.

Example 2: During the 1997‑98 income year, Duffy Property Ltd withheld amounts from its employees’ wages as required by former Divisions 1AAA and 2 of Part VI of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The company failed to notify the Commissioner of those amounts, and failed to remit them to the Commissioner.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of those Divisions, the Commissioner discovers that the withheld amounts have not been remitted. The company’s records are incomplete and the Commissioner is unable to completely ascertain the extent of its liability for the withheld amounts. Under section 222AGA of that Act, the Commissioner makes an estimate of the liability.

                   Item 7 will disregard the repeal of section 220AAZA of that Act (which empowered the Commissioner to recover the amount of the estimate). Even though the estimate is made after the repeal, it relates to amounts withheld before the repeal.

## 8  Saving of provisions about effect of assessments

If a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act deals with the effect of an assessment, the repeal or amendment is disregarded in relation to assessments made, before or after the repeal or amendment applies, in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

## 9  Saving of provisions about general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty

If:

                     (a)  a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act provides for the payment of:

                              (i)  general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty (all within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_); or

                             (ii)  interest under the _Taxation (Interest on Overpayments and Early Payments) Act 1983_; and

                     (b)  in a particular case, the period in respect of which the charge, penalty or interest is payable (whether under the provision or under the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_) has not begun, or has begun but not ended, when the provision is repealed or amended;

then, despite the repeal or amendment, the provision or part continues to apply in the particular case until the end of the period.

## 10  Repeals disregarded for the purposes of dependent provisions

If the operation of a provision (the **_subject provision_**) of any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_) made under any Act depends to any extent on an Act, or a provision of an Act, that is repealed by this Act, the repeal is disregarded so far as it affects the operation of the subject provision.

## 11  Schedule does not limit operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_

This Schedule does not limit the operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.
