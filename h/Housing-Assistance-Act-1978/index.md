THE STATEOF TASMANIA of the seventh part.

WHEREAS—

(A)    the Commonwealth and the States of Australia have from time to time entered into agreements for the purpose of the provision by the States with financial assistance from the Commonwealth of housing for persons who are in need of governmental assistance if their housing requirements are to be met;

(B)     the Ministers of the respective governments who are responsible for housing have agreed upon the provision of rental housing assistance and home purchase assistance in the States during the three financial years commencing on the first day of July 1978;

(C)     the Ministers have also established principles that are to apply to the provision of housing assistance under this Agreement, namely—

                 (a)   housing assistance will—

                              (i)  facilitate home ownership for those able to afford it but not able to gain it through the private market;

                             (ii)  provide adequate rental housing for those of the community who are deemed to be in need of governmental assistance at a price that is within their capacity to pay;

                            (iii)  provide assistance for home ownership and assistance with rental accommodation in the most efficient way and thus to exclude from eligibility those not in need, to minimise continued availability of assistance to those no longer in need and to accord benefits which are designed so that assistance being provided is related to the particular family’s or individual’s current economic and social circumstances;

                 (b)   benefits which are available are offset to the minimum extent practicable by poor location of dwellings, an inadequate range of choice of dwellings and stigmatisation of those who are to receive benefits;

                 (c)   there will be clear recognition of the separate but complementary roles of—

                              (i)  construction and acquisition of dwellings;

                             (ii)  management of the rental operation; and

                            (iii)  sales of dwellings;

                 (d)   maximum social benefit will be sought from previous investment in housing; and

                 (e)   the States will be able to exercise maximum autonomy and flexibility in the administrative arrangements necessary to achieve these principles;

(D)    it is proposed that in order to implement the agreement of the Ministers the Commonwealth will grant to the States financial assistance under section 96 of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution and that the terms and conditions on which the grant of financial assistance should be made are those set out in this Agreement;

(E)     the Commonwealth and the States wish to vary in certain respects the agreements which have been entered into as aforesaid; and

(F)     the Parliament of the Commonwealth has authorised the execution by and on behalf of the Commonwealth of this Agreement and the making of advances to the States in accordance with its provisions:

NOW IT IS HEREBY AGREED as follows:

(2)   Notwithstanding that in this Agreement all the State of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania are named as parties, this Agreement shall operate as an agreement between the Commonwealth and the State or States in respect of which it comes into force as fully and effectually as if the State or States named as parties.

2.  Acts and things provided for by this Agreement which have been done or carried out by or with respect to a State in accordance with and in anticipation of its coming into force in respect of that State shall be deemed to have been done or carried out under this Agreement as if it were in force at the relevant time or times in respect of that State.

(2)   Where in an existing Housing Agreement included in the Schedule, including any amendment of that Agreement made by this Agreement, the word ‘State’ or the expression ‘the States’ means a State or the States in respect of which that Agreement is in force, that word and that expression shall, for the purposes of the operation of that Agreement, as amended by this Agreement, mean respectively a State or the States in respect of which this Agreement has come into force.

4.  (1)   In this Agreement—

‘the Minister’ means the Minister of State of the Commonwealth for the time being responsible for the administration of this Agreement for the Commonwealth; and

(2)   A reference in this Agreement to a Minister includes a Minister or other member of the Federal Executive Council or Minister of the relevant State, as the case may require, acting on behalf of or for the time being acting for the Minister referred to.

5.  In this Agreement, unless the contrary intention appears or the context otherwise requires—

‘financial year’ means a period of twelve months commencing on the first day of July;

‘housing’ means residential housing including dwellings and other forms of residential accommodation;

‘the existing Housing Agreements’ means the Agreements set out in the Schedule and where the singular is used means such one or other of those Agreements as the context requires.

6.  In this Agreement, unless the contrary intention appears—

     (a)  a reference to a Part or to a clause is to a Part or to a clause of this Agreement, as the case may be;

     (b)  a reference to a sub-clause is, unless otherwise indicated, to the relevant sub-clause of the clause in which the reference appears;

     (c)  the Schedule referred to is the Schedule to this Agreement;

9.  Of the total amount of the advances by the Commonwealth to the State under this Agreement in respect of a financial year, portion (referred to as advances for rental housing assistance) shall be for allotment by the State for the provision of rental housing in accordance with Part V and the other portion (referred to as advances for home purchase assistance) shall be for payment into the Home Purchase Assistance Account established by the State for application in accordance with Part VI.

10.   (1)   Each State shall, not later than the thirtieth day of November preceding the beginning of a financial year of this Agreement, inform the Minister of the amounts that the State wishes the Commonwealth to advance it under this Agreement in respect of the financial year for rental housing assistance and home purchase assistance programs of the State and at the same time shall provide estimates of financial performance and planned programs for that year.

(2)   After consultation with the State Ministers of the States and after considering State requirements and practices but without regard to any operating surpluses on rental housing assistance operations under previous housing arrangements and under this Agreement or on the operations of the Home Builders’ Accounts or the Home Purchase Assistance Account under those arrangements or under this Agreement, the Minister shall determine the total amount to be advanced to the State under this Agreement in respect of the financial year.
