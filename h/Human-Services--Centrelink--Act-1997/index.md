_Human Services Legislation Amendment Act 2005 (No. 111, 2005)_

## Schedule 1

## 62  Definitions

(1)        In this Part:

**_amend_** includes repeal and remake.

**_Board_** means the Board within the meaning of the old law.

**_Centrelink_** means the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency.

**_CEO_** means the Chief Executive Officer of Centrelink.

**_Chairman_** means the Chairman of the Board.

**_commencement time_** means the time when this Part commences.

                     (a)  includes:

                              (i)  a contract, deed, undertaking or agreement; and

                             (ii)  a notice, authority, order or instruction; and

                            (iii)  an instrument made under an Act or regulations; but

                     (b)  does not include an Act or regulations.

**_old law_** means the _Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency Act 1997_ as in force before the commencement time.

(2)        In this Part, unless a contrary intention is expressed, a reference to a law (however described) is a reference to a law of the Commonwealth.

## 63  CEO to continue

The person who was the CEO immediately before the commencement time continues to be the CEO immediately after the commencement time and holds office as if:

                     (a)  his or her appointment by the Board under section 29 of the old law (the **_first appointment_**) were terminated immediately before the commencement time; and

                     (b)  he or she were appointed for the remainder of the term of his or her first appointment by the Minister under Division 2 of Part 3 of the new law immediately after the commencement time.

## 64  Operation of laws—things done by, or in relation to, Centrelink

(1)        If, before the commencement time, a thing was done by, or in relation to, Centrelink, the Board or the Chairman, then, for the purposes of the operation of any law after the commencement time, the thing is taken to have been done by, or in relation to, the CEO.

(2)        For the purposes of subitem (1), a thing done before the commencement time under a provision amended by this Schedule has effect from that time as if it were done under that provision as amended. However, this is not taken to change the time at which the thing was actually done.

(3)        The Minister may, by writing, determine that subitem (1):

                     (a)  does not apply in relation to a specified thing done by, or in relation to, Centrelink, the Board or the Chairman; or

                     (b)  applies as if the reference in that subitem to the CEO were a reference to the Commonwealth or to Centrelink.

A determination under this subitem has effect accordingly.

(4)        The regulations may provide for a thing specified in a determination under paragraph (3)(a) to be taken to have been done by, or in relation to, a person or body other than the CEO, the Commonwealth or Centrelink.

(5)        To avoid doubt, for the purposes of this item, doing a thing includes making an instrument.

(6)        A determination made under subitem (3) is not a legislative instrument.

## 65  References in instruments

                     (b)  the instrument contains a reference to Centrelink (however described), the Board or the Chairman;

the instrument has effect from the commencement time as if the reference to Centrelink, the Board or the Chairman were a reference to the CEO.

(2)        The Minister may, by writing, determine that subitem (1):

                     (a)  does not apply in relation to a specified reference; or

                     (b)  applies as if the reference in that subitem to the CEO were a reference to the Commonwealth or to Centrelink.

A determination under this subitem has effect accordingly.

(3)        The regulations may provide that an instrument containing a reference specified in a determination under paragraph (2)(a) has effect from the commencement time as if the reference were a reference to a person or body other than the CEO, the Commonwealth or Centrelink.

(4)        A determination made under subitem (2) is not a legislative instrument.

## 66  Transfer of records

At the commencement time, the records and documents of Centrelink become the records and documents of the CEO.

## 67  Financial statements and other reporting requirements

Financial statements

(1)        If:

                     (a)  immediately before the commencement time, a law required Centrelink, the Board or the Chairman to provide financial statements for a period; and

                     (b)  the period ends after the commencement time;

the CEO must, within 3 months after the commencement time, provide the statements for so much of the period as occurs before the commencement time.

Other reporting requirements

(2)        If:

                     (a)  immediately before the commencement time, a law required Centrelink, the Board or the Chairman to provide a report (other than financial statements) for a period; and

                     (b)  the period ends after the commencement time;

the CEO must provide the report, as required, for so much of the period as occurs before the commencement time.

(3)        If:

                     (a)  under subitem (2), the CEO is required to provide a report for a part of a period; and

                     (b)  the CEO is also required to provide a similar report for the remainder of the period;

the CEO may meet the requirements in a single report for the period.

Outstanding reporting requirements

(4)        If:

                     (a)  a law required Centrelink, the Board or the Chairman to provide a report (whether financial statements or otherwise) for a period that ended before the commencement time; and

                     (b)  the report has not been provided by the commencement time;

the CEO must provide the report as required.

## 68  Substitution of parties to proceedings

If, immediately before the commencement time, any proceedings to which Centrelink, the Board or the Chairman was a party were pending in any court or tribunal, then, from the commencement time, the CEO is substituted for Centrelink, the Board or the Chairman as a party to the proceedings.

## 69  Constitutional safety net—acquisition of property

(1)        If:

                     (a)  a provision of this Schedule would result in an acquisition of property; and

                     (b)  the provision would not be valid, apart from this item, because a particular person has not been compensated;

the Commonwealth must pay that person:

                     (c)  a reasonable amount of compensation agreed on between the person and the Commonwealth; or

                     (d)  failing agreement—a reasonable amount of compensation determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.

(2)        Any damages or compensation recovered, or other remedy given, in a proceeding begun otherwise than under this item must be taken into account in assessing compensation payable in a proceeding begun under this item and arising out of the same event or transaction.

(3)        In this item:

**_acquisition of property_** has the same meaning as in paragraph 51(xxxi) of the Constitution.

## 70  Delegation by Minister

(1)        The Minister may, by writing, delegate all or any of his or her powers and functions under this Part to:

                     (a)  the Secretary of the Department; or

                     (b)  an SES employee, or acting SES employee, in the Department; or

                     (c)  the CEO.

(2)        In exercising or performing powers or functions under a delegation, the delegate must comply with any directions of the Minister.

(3)        A power delegated to the CEO under subitem (1) must not be sub-delegated under subsection 12(3) of the new law.

## 71  Regulations

(1)        The Governor-General may make regulations prescribing matters:

                     (a)  required or permitted by this Schedule to be prescribed; or

                     (b)  necessary or convenient to be prescribed for carrying out or giving effect to this Schedule.
