_(a)_     Subsection 2(3) provides as follows:

                 (3)   If Schedule 2 to the _Reform of Employment Services (Consequential Provisions) Act 1997_ does not commence before the day on which this Act receives the Royal Assent, the amendment of the definition of **_eligible employment services provider_** in subsection 6(1) of the _Privacy Act 1988_ made by this Act commences immediately after the commencement of Schedule 2 to the _Reform of Employment Services (Consequential Provisions) Act 1997_.
