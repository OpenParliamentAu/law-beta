_(a)_     Subsection 2(3) provides as follows:

                 (3)   If Schedule 2 to the _Reform of Employment Services (Consequential Provisions) Act 1997_ does not commence before the day on which this Act receives the Royal Assent, the amendment of the definition of **_eligible employment services provider_** in subsection 6(1) of the _Privacy Act 1988_ made by this Act commences immediately after the commencement of Schedule 2 to the _Reform of Employment Services (Consequential Provisions) Act 1997_.

         The Reform of Employment Services (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1997 was never enacted. Therefore the amendment made by Schedule 4 (item 3) of this Act will not commence.

_(b)_ The _Hearing Services and AGHS Reform Act 1997_ was amended by Schedule 3 (item 216) only of the _Corporations (Repeals, Consequentials and Transitionals) Act 2001_, subsection 2(3) of which provides as follows:

                 (3)   Subject to subsections (4) to (10), Schedule 3 commences, or is taken to have commenced, at the same time as the _Corporations Act 2001_.

_(c)_ Subsection 2(1) (item 38) of the _Statute Law Revision Act 2005_ provides as follows:

                 (1)   Each provision of this Act specified in column 1 of the table commences, or is taken to have commenced, in accordance with column 2 of the table. Any other statement in column 2 has effect according to its terms.
