###### Schedule 1—Transitional provisions

<h7 class="ActHead7">Part 1—Transitional arrangement for students under the Higher Education Contribution Scheme</h7>

## 1  Student contribution amounts for students under the Higher Education Contribution Scheme

(1)        If:

                     (a)  a person is enrolled with an institution in a unit of study that forms part of a course of study that the person started before 1 January 2005; and

                     (b)  the period over which the person is undertaking the unit ends on or before 31 December 2008; and

                     (c)  the person is a contributing student within the meaning of Chapter 4 of the _Higher Education Funding Act 1988_; and

                     (d)  the course is a designated course of study within the meaning of that Chapter; and

                      (f)  the person:

                              (i)  is entitled to HECS-HELP assistance for the unit; or

                             (ii)  would be entitled to HECS-HELP assistance for the unit but for paragraph 90-1(a) or (c), or paragraphs 90-1(a) and (c), of the _Higher Education Support Act 2003_; and

                     (g)  the person has neither:

                              (i)  discontinued his or her enrolment in the course since that commencement (see item 2); nor

                             (ii)  completed the requirements of the course;

then:

                     (h)  if the institution is not (apart from this item) a higher education provider—the institution is taken, for the purposes of the application of the _Higher Education Support Act 2003_ in relation to the person and the unit, to be a higher education provider; and

                      (i)  if subparagraph (f)(ii) applies and the person is not an excepted student—the person is taken, for the purposes of that Act, to be entitled to HECS-HELP assistance for the unit; and

                      (j)  the person is taken, for the purposes of that Act, to be a Commonwealth supported student in relation to the unit; and

                     (k)  the person’s student contribution amount for the unit is taken, for the purposes of that Act, not to exceed the amount that would be worked out under section 93-5 of that Act if the maximum student contribution amount for a place in the unit were worked out under item 3.

(2)        However, this item does not apply if the person has notified an appropriate officer of the institution, under subsection 36-5(3) of the _Higher Education Support Act 2003_, that he or she does not wish to be a Commonwealth supported student in relation to the unit.

(3)        In this item:

**_excepted student_** has the meaning given by subsection 41(3) of the _Higher Education Funding Act 1988_.

## 2  Discontinuance of enrolments

A person is not taken, for the purposes of subparagraph (1)(g)(i) of item 1, to have discontinued his or her enrolment in a course of study merely because:

                     (a)  the person has taken leave of absence from, or has deferred, the course, with the approval of the institution with which the person is undertaking the course; or

                     (b)  the person transfers his or her enrolment in the course to another course of study at the same level with the same or another institution or higher education provider; or

                     (c)  circumstances have occurred that are specified in the guidelines under item 4 as not amounting to a discontinuance of enrolment.

## 3  Maximum student contribution amounts for places

(1)        If a person to whom item 1 applies started the course of study in question before 1 January 1997, the **_maximum student contribution amount for a place_** in the unit is $2,830.

(2)        If a person to whom item 1 applies started the course of study in question on or after 1 January 1997, the **_maximum student contribution amount for a place_** in the unit is the amount specified in the following table in relation to the funding cluster in which the unit is included.
