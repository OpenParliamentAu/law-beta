##### <a id="11"></a>11  Allocation among the States of specific grants

                   The Minister, in authorising specific grants to be made in a grant year, is to ensure that the amounts of those grants are allocated among the States in accordance with their needs as determined by the Minister.

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Allocation among the States of untied grants in first grant year

             (1)  For the purposes of this section, the Australian Capital Territory is not to be taken to be a State.

             (2)  Subject to sections 6 and 15, the Minister in authorising untied grants in the first grant year is to ensure that the amounts of those grants are allocated among the States in accordance with this section.

             (3)  Subject to subsection (6), $146,000,000 is to be allocated among the States in the proportions determined by the Minister to be appropriate but so that no State is allocated less than $7,300,000.

             (5)  Subject to subsection (6), the balance of the amounts is to be allocated among the States in the proportions determined by the Minister to be appropriate.

             (6)  Where grants to a State cannot be authorised in the first grant year because there is no housing agreement with the State in force in that year, the amounts that the Minister determines would have been allocated for untied grants to that State in that year under subsections (3), (4) and (5) are to be dealt with as follows:

                     (a)  where advances to that State that may be retained by that State in accordance with arrangements under section 17 were made out of the amounts—the amount of the advances is to be so retained by that State;

                     (b)  the amounts, less the amount retained under paragraph (a), may be allocated in that year among such of the States and the Australian Capital Territory with which a housing agreement is in force in that year, and in such proportions, as the Minister determines to be appropriate.

             (7)  This section does not affect the operation of any priority provision in a housing agreement.

##### <a id="13"></a>13  Allocation among the States of untied grants after first grant year

             (1)  For the purposes of this section:

                     (a)  a State is not to be taken to be a State in a grant year if a housing agreement with the State was not made before that year; and

                     (b)   except for the purposes of subsection (5A), the Australian Capital Territory is not to be taken to be a State before 1 July 1993.

             (2)  Subject to sections 6 and 15, the Minister, in authorising untied grants to be made after the first grant year, is to ensure that the amounts of those grants are allocated among the States in accordance with this section.

             (3)  In each grant year, $146,000,000 is to be allocated among the States as far as practicable on an equal per capita basis but so that no State is allocated less than $7,300,000.

             (4)  In the second grant year, $208,038,000 is to be allocated among the States in accordance with Schedule 3.

             (5)  In the third grant year, $102,466,000 is to be allocated among the States in accordance with Schedule 3.

          (5A)  In the fourth grant year not more than $75,000,000 may be allocated to such of the States as the Minister considers appropriate, having regard to proposals for employment generation in the housing industry submitted by State Ministers.

          (5B)  In the fifth grant year not more than $25,000,000 may be allocated to such of the States as the Minister considers appropriate, having regard to proposals for employment generation in the housing industry submitted by State Ministers.

             (6)  Where, because of paragraph (1)(a), part of an amount referred to in subsection (4) or (5) is not allocated under the subsection in a grant year, the part may be allocated in the year among such of the States and, where a housing agreement with the Australian Capital Territory is in force in the year, that Territory, and in such proportions, as the Minister determines to be appropriate.

             (7)  Subject to subsection (7B), the balance of the amounts to be allocated in accordance with this section in each grant year is to be allocated among the States as far as practicable on an equal per capita basis.

          (7A)  If the operation of subsection (5A) or (5B) has resulted in a State gaining, in respect of the fourth or fifth grant year, a smaller or larger share of untied grants than the share to which it would otherwise have been entitled, subsection (7B) applies to that State.

          (7B)  The Minister is to ensure that the allocation of untied grants in respect of the sixth and seventh grant years is such as to ensure that the total amount of untied grants allocated to a State to which this subsection applies in respect of the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh grant years is as nearly as practicable what it would have been if subsections (5A) and (5B) had not operated.

             (8)  This section does not affect the operation of any priority provision in a housing agreement.

##### <a id="14"></a>14  Payments for research, development and evaluation

             (1)  Where the money appropriated by the Parliament for the purpose of making payments under this Act in a grant year exceeds $456,504,000, the Minister may approve payments in that year of such amounts as the Minister determines, not exceeding $100,000, for the purpose of research, development and evaluation in relation to housing assistance.

             (2)  A payment is to be made on terms and conditions determined by the Minister.

##### <a id="15"></a>15  Grants to be matched by State

             (1)  In this section:

                    <a name="state-expenditur"></a>**_State expenditure_**, in relation to a State and a grant year, means the total amount that the State has used or proposes to use in respect of that year in relation to housing out of money that is, under a housing agreement with the State, matching funds.

             (2)  The Minister, in authorising untied grants to a State in a grant year, is to ensure that they do not reach an amount that would result in their not being matched, in accordance with the housing agreement with the State, by the State expenditure for the year.

          (2A)  Despite subsection (2), the Minister may, in respect of the sixth or seventh grant year, authorise untied grants to a particular State, even if the Minister cannot ensure that the State will match the grants in accordance with the provision of its housing agreement corresponding to paragraph 13(2)(b) of the form of housing agreement in Schedule 1.

             (3)  Where the amount allocated under section 12 or 13 to a State in respect of a grant year exceeds the amount of untied grants for that year that, because of subsection (2), can be authorised, the Minister may authorise the payment, out of the excess, of additional untied grants to such other of the States as the Minister determines to be appropriate.

             (4)  For the purposes of any provision of a housing agreement relating to the provision of matching funds by a State:

                     (a)  the total of the amounts received by the State under subsections 13(5A) and (5B) is to be taken to be allocated in equal amounts in respect of the sixth and seventh grant years; and

                     (b)  if:

                              (i)  the amount of a grant has not been fully paid to a State in a grant year; and

                             (ii)  the Minister, under subsection 7A(1), has determined that the amount remaining unpaid, or part of it, is to be carried over;

the amount of the grant is taken to be reduced by the amount remaining unpaid and the amount allocated to the State in respect of the next grant year is taken to be increased by the amount carried over.

##### <a id="15A"></a>15A  Grants to be matched by State—exception

             (1)  The Minister may determine in writing that, in respect of a grant year, a particular State is taken to have fulfilled its obligation to provide matching funds in accordance with the provision of its housing agreement corresponding to paragraph 13(2)(b) of the form of housing agreement in Schedule 1.

             (2)  A determination made under subsection (1) must be in relation to the fifth, sixth or seventh grant year.

             (3)  The Minister must not make the determination unless satisfied, after consulting with the State Minister of that State, that, in the circumstances, the State was unable to meet its obligation in respect of that grant year under that provision.

             (4)  The determination has effect for the purposes of the housing agreement.

             (5)  In deciding whether to make the determination, the Minister must have regard to the extent to which assistance provided by the State under the housing agreement reflects the principles set out in Recital (D) of the form of housing agreement in Schedule 1.

             (6)  The State Minister of that State must agree in writing to the determination being made.

             (7)  The determination made by the Minister must be tabled in each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after it is made.

##### <a id="16"></a>16  Reallocation or retention of specific grants

             (1)  Where:

                     (a)  the Minister has authorised specific grants to a State in a grant year; and

                     (b)  after consulting the State Minister, the Minister is satisfied, having regard to the amounts that the State is able to expend in respect of that year for specific assistance, that it would not be appropriate for the grants to be paid in full;

the Minister may:

                     (c)  vary the authorisation by reducing the total amount of the grants; or

                     (d)  so vary the authorisation and authorise such additional specific grants, not exceeding the reduction, as the Minister determines to be appropriate to such other of the States as the Minister determines to be appropriate.

             (2)  Where:

                     (a)  the Minister has authorised specific grants to a State in a grant year; and

                     (b)  after consulting the State Minister, the Minister is satisfied in respect of the grants or any of them that the State has contravened, or has acted in a manner that is inconsistent with, either or both of the following:

                              (i)  a housing agreement with the State;

                             (ii)  a guideline made under the agreement;

the Minister:

                     (c)  may revoke the authorisation; or

                     (d)  may vary the authorisation by reducing the amount authorised; or

                     (e)  may:

                              (i)  revoke the authorisation; and

                             (ii)  declare the amount authorised by the revoked authorisation to be available for reallocation; or

                      (f)  may:

                              (i)  vary the authorisation by reducing the amount authorised; and

                             (ii)  declare the amount of the reduction to be available for reallocation.

             (3)  Where the Minister declares an amount to be available for reallocation, the Minister may authorise additional specific grants, not exceeding the reduction, of such amounts as the Minister determines to be appropriate to such other of the States as the Minister determines to be appropriate.

##### <a id="17"></a>17  Advances

             (1)  The Minister may make arrangements for the making to a State, by way of financial assistance, of, and may authorise, advances on account of grants that are expected to become payable to the State during the first grant year.

             (2)  The arrangements are to provide for the effect on the advances of the following circumstances:

                     (a)  the making of a housing agreement with the State;

                     (b)  the failure of the State to make a housing agreement in the first grant year.

##### <a id="18"></a>18  Payments under the 1984 Act

Where:

                     (a)  a payment was made to a State under the 1984 Act after 30 June 1989 and before the commencement of section 4; and

                     (b)  the State enters into a housing agreement with the Commonwealth during the first grant year;

the payment is to be taken to have been an advance to the State under section 17 on account of:

                     (c)  in the case of a payment made for the purpose mentioned in paragraph 6(1)(a) of the 1984 Act—the appropriate specific grant; and

                     (d)  in the case of a payment made for a purpose mentioned in paragraph 6(1)(b) of the 1984 Act—an untied grant.

##### <a id="19"></a>19  Determinations to be in writing

·   ensure that housing assistance is, as far as possible, delivered equitably to persons resident in different forms of housing tenure.

In implementing this principle, assistance provided under the agreement will also reflect the following detailed principles:

(a)        Assistance Generally

The primary consideration in delivering housing assistance under this agreement shall be the needs of people.

In determining the eligibility of applicants for assistance under this agreement:

·   assistance shall seek to provide access to housing for those unable to obtain or maintain affordable finance for adequate and appropriate housing purchase from the private sector or from other sources outside of the agreement;

·   assistance provided shall be available to all sections of the community irrespective of age, sex, marital status, race, religion, disability or life situation. Persons who need support to live in the community shall be eligible for assistance. It is recognised, however, that such support is not a responsibility under this agreement;

·   priority in granting assistance shall be determined by the need for assistance;

·   any limits on eligibility for assistance shall be based primarily on financial circumstances. In determining this, the level of income, the value of relevant assets and the income from them, the number of dependent children and costs arising from disability or other special circumstances, shall be taken into account; and

·   to ensure consistency in the application of these eligibility principles, limits of eligibility shall be reviewed at appropriate intervals of time.

In the delivery of housing assistance, as far as is possible, people should be given an equal choice between the different forms of housing assistance programs under this agreement.

Housing assistance programs developed under this agreement shall be designed so that maximum social benefit is derived from previous investment in housing. Assistance shall be provided in a co‑ordinated and flexible manner to meet the changing employment and other needs and circumstances of people receiving assistance. To this end and where appropriate:

·   housing assistance provided under this agreement should be co‑ordinated with housing and accommodation assistance programs outside this agreement;

·   the provision of assistance for people shall be co‑ordinated between the specific purpose programs within the agreement and general housing assistance under the agreement; and

·   assistance shall facilitate the portability of waiting times for applicants for assistance, and the transfer of tenants, between regions and forms of assistance within a State, and, where practicable, between States.

(b)        Rental Housing

The provision of rental housing is a key element of this agreement.

People in rental housing shall have security of tenure. Subject to fulfilment by the tenant of the tenancy conditions, this principle of security of tenure shall operate in a State in accordance with this Recital to ensure that:

·   tenants are not to be forced to leave their home because of actions inconsistent with this agreement by a State. Where a tenant is required to move from one dwelling to another by a State, a choice of dwellings and locations appropriate to the tenant’s needs is to be provided;

·   a physical and locational environment appropriate to the tenant’s needs is provided; and

·   recognition is accorded to the rights of applicants and tenants and other users of assistance.

Programs and funding arrangements under this agreement should seek to develop the public housing sector as a viable and diversified form of housing choice and refrain from discrimination.

Programs and funding arrangements under this agreement shall be developed so as to increase progressively the availability of rental housing to a level commensurate with the need for it in the community.

Rental housing should reflect general community housing standards and should be accessible to community and other services. Poor location of dwellings, an inadequate range of choice of dwellings, and stigmatisation of the status of rental housing tenants should be avoided to the maximum extent practicable.

Rental housing stock should, as far as possible, be designed to cater for the needs and preferences of current and likely future applicants.

The design, style and siting of rental housing will, to the maximum extent practicable:

·   reflect the need for access to employment opportunities and services;

·   reflect the need for accessibility and suitability for habitation by people with disabilities, Aboriginals, youth, the elderly or other identified groups; and

·   support the energy conservation policies of the governments.

(c)        Income Related Assistance to Tenants

Assistance measures in the public rental sector should be co‑ordinated with assistance to private tenants and should recognise the income support nature of the assistance and the inter‑relationship of this assistance with Commonwealth assistance to pensioners and other beneficiaries under the Social Security Act 1947.

(d)        Implementation

States will be able to exercise maximum autonomy and flexibility in developing the administrative arrangements necessary to achieve these principles;

(E)       the Ministers referred to in Recital (C) recognise the relationship between the principles and policies reflected in this agreement and the need to co‑ordinate these with those affecting home purchasers and tenants including tenants in private housing and in emergency and supported accommodation;

(F)       it is proposed that in order to implement the agreement of the Ministers, the Commonwealth will grant to the States financial assistance under Section 96 of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution and like assistance to the Northern Territory of Australia and the Australian Capital Territory and that the terms and conditions on which the grant of financial assistance should be made are those set out in this agreement;

(G)       the Commonwealth and the States have decided that the agreement referred to in Recital (B) shall, save as provided for by subclause 1 (3) of this agreement, cease to operate on and from the first day of July 1989; and

(H)       the Parliament of the Commonwealth has authorised the execution by and on behalf of the Commonwealth of this agreement and the provision of financial assistance to the States in accordance with its provisions.

13 (1)  In relation to untied assistance a State will provide from its own resources and apply funds (“matching funds”) in accordance with this Part.

13  (4)  A State may, as agreed by the Minister and State Minister, count as grant matching funds in a year, amounts provided by it in the previous year in accordance with paragraph 13 (2) (a) in excess of the level of matching funds required in subclause 13 (3) for that year, up to a limit of 10 per cent of the funds so required to be provided in that previous year.

13  (5)  A State will have to pay no more in matching funds relating to the first $1028.176 million of financial assistance provided:

(a)   in any of the years referred to in subclause 13 (3) than would have been paid had the allocation and matching fund requirements to apply for the said fourth year been applied in any of those years; and

(b)   in any year than would have been required had the level of untied assistance been $792.931 million.

13 (6)  Except as to the first year, for which proposals shall be agreed by the Minister and State Minister by the thirty first day of December, a State shall, by the thirty first day of March preceding the second and each succeeding year of this agreement, furnish of the Commonwealth, in a reasonable form to be determined by the Minister after consultation with the State Minister, proposals for agreement by the Minister for the provision of matching funds during that year.

13 (7)  Grant matching funds shall be:

(a)   paid into the Rental Capital Account by regular monthly instalments or as otherwise agreed between the Minister and State Minister; and

14.       Where a State in a year expends a specific housing assistance grant in accordance with the Commonwealth/State plan for that year, this expenditure shall not increase the level of matching funds required to be provided by that State in that year.

**PART VII—FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE ARRANGEMENTS**

15  (1)  Financial assistance in respect of a year of this agreement shall be made available to a State during that year by regular monthly instalments unless otherwise agreed between the Minister and State Minister.

15 (2)  If, following consultation with a State Minister, the Minister is of the opinion that it is appropriate to do so, the Minister may withhold a payment of financial assistance to a State which fails to comply with subclause 13 (6), or clause 38 until the State remedies that failure.

**PART VIII—HOME PURCHASE ASSISTANCE**

16.       The Home Purchase Assistance Account of each State, for the continuance of which clause 24 of the 1984 Agreement provided, shall continue to operate. The Australian Capital Territory shall open an Account by that name within the first year of this agreement. Each of those Accounts and related Accounts are in this Part referred to as **“the Account”** and elsewhere as **“the Home Purchase Assistance Account”**.

17.       This Account shall be:

(a)   credited with:

(i)    moneys received by the State in the course of home purchase assistance program operations;

(ii)   payments referred to in paragraph 23 (2) (f); and

(iii)  any other funds, not being Commonwealth financial assistance or State grant matching funds, which the State decides to apply to home purchase assistance programs under this agreement; and

(b)   debited with management costs and other outgoings, including repayments and payments under paragraphs 20 (1) (a) and 20 (1) (b), in respect of home purchase assistance program operations.

18.       The money in this Account shall be made available for use for home purchase assistance in accordance with this Part.

19.       A State shall develop and administer home purchase assistance programs, in accordance with Recital (D), having regard to the following principles:

(a)   the Account is to act as a basis and support for future home purchase. To this end a State shall ensure:

(i)    funds made available for use under clause 18 are to be used in a way which at least maintains their real value; and

(ii)   that funds paid into the Account in accordance with paragraph 23 (2) (f) are included in funds available for use in subparagraph 19 (a) (i); and

(iii)  that the amount of the funds available for use under paragraph 19 (a) (i) are reduced by the payments made under subparagraph 20 (1) (j);

(i)    a State shall maximise the use of funds from sources outside the agreement for loans to home purchasers;

(ii)   subsidy assistance is to be restricted to those who require it and for the period of their need and recovered except in cases of individual hardship. Where subsidy assistance is provided, the capacity of home purchasers to repay loans to the State is to be reviewed at least triennially with repayments to be adjusted or other action to be taken where necessary. In any year other than one in which there is a review, repayments are to be indexed by the Consumer Price Index or other appropriate indicator; and

(iii)  where a State wishes to provide subsidy assistance other than in accordance with subparagraph (ii), it may do so from funds provided by the State under subparagraph 17 (a) (iii);

(c)   a State shall maximise the effectiveness of assistance provided. To this end:

(i)    the amount of a loan shall take into account market conditions, including house prices, incomes and the size of a deposit; and

(ii)   loan repayments are to be related to the income of home purchasers, and to be affordable to those home purchasers. To this end, repayment ratios operating in the private market are to be taken into account. A State may reschedule repayments by a home purchaser in the event of individual hardship;

(d)   a State shall ensure maximum choice of assistance. To this end:

(i)    no class of persons, including single persons, shall be excluded from consideration;

(ii)   home purchase schemes are to be accessible to existing public tenants;

(iii)  where appropriate, shared ownership and rental purchase schemes are to be offered; and

(iv)  schemes developed under this principle shall be consistent with the provisions in clause 27 of this agreement; and

(e)   home purchase assistance under the agreement is to be related to other home purchase assistance programs operated by the Commonwealth and States.

20 (1)  Subject to subclause 20 (2), a State may use moneys in the Account in accordance with the principles set out in Recital (D) and clause 19 for:

(a)   making repayments of principal and payments of interest falling due in the then current year in respect of loan assistance by the Commonwealth to the State under previous housing arrangements which has been allocated for home purchase assistance under those arrangements;

(b)   making repayments of principal and payments of interest in respect of any State funds borrowed for the purpose of this Part allocated for home purchase assistance;

(c)   meeting expenditure by the State in providing and administering home purchase assistance;

(d)   facilitating borrowings of private bodies for home purchase assistance under this agreement, including participation in joint ventures and mortgage funds such as secondary mortgage market trusts;

(e)   making loans and grants to:

(i)    terminating building societies or co‑operative housing societies;

(ii)   a lending authority of the State approved by the State Minister;

(iii)  registered co‑operative organisations including permanent building societies approved by the State Minister;

(iv)  such other class or classes of bodies or organisations as are from time to time agreed upon between the Minister and State Minister; and

(v)   a class or classes of home purchasers,

for the provision of home purchase assistance;

(f)   financing the construction and purchase of dwellings, including the purchase of dwellings from home purchasers, and financing purchases by home purchasers who are borrowers;

(g)   purchasing housing, including private housing, for sale to rental purchasers and financing such sales;

(h)   the acquisition by the State of replacement housing of a value equal to the amount for which the State sells rental housing to home purchasers;

(i)    urban renewal, housing advisory services and research and policy development in relation to matters not funded by the Australian Housing Research Council;

(j)    making payments into the Rental Capital Account;

(k)   making loans to participants in shared ownership schemes; and

(l)    such other purposes as are from time to time agreed upon by the Minister and State Minister.

20  (2)  Moneys paid into the Account under paragraph 23 (2) (f) are to be used only for home purchase assistance programs approved by the Minister for public tenants and persons eligible for rental housing, with preference to be given to shared ownership schemes.

**PART IX—RENTAL HOUSING ASSISTANCE**

21.       A State will establish a Rental Capital Account (in this Part referred to as **“the Account”** and elsewhere as **“the Rental Capital Account”**) which shall be operated by the State in accordance with this Part. All moneys in the Account are to be fully expended or committed in the year in which they are credited to the Account.

(j)    to pay principal and interest falling due in a year on Commonwealth loans provided to the State under previous housing arrangements, the amount of the payments being phased in over three years with 50 per cent available in the first year, 75 per cent in the second year and 100 per cent in the third year or as agreed by the Minister and State Minister, having regard to the cash surplus on rental operations.

(a)   for the first three years of this agreement, the total of untied assistance and grant matching funds:

(i)    that would be paid into the Account in the fourth year of the agreement if the total of untied assistance to all the States for that year remained at the total for the first year of this agreement; or

(ii)   that is paid into the Account in each of those years,

as the State Minister determines; and

(b)   for the fourth year and succeeding years of this agreement, the total of untied assistance and grant matching funds paid into the Account in each of those years,

to be used by the State—

(c)   to provide funds to such non‑profit, charitable bodies, rental housing cooperatives, voluntary bodies, local government bodies and other housing management bodies or groups as are approved by the State Minister;

(d)   where agreed by the Minister and State Minister:

(i)    to lease;

(ii)   to subsidise leasing of; and

(iii)  to subsidise other arrangements not of a capital nature in relation to,

rental housing;

(f)   for payment into the Home Purchase Assistance Account, up to the level of 15 per cent of the amounts referred to in paragraphs 23 (2) (a) and 23 (2) (b);

(g)   to meet the costs associated with:

(i)    the consulting referred to in subclause 28 (5); and

(ii)   the provision of information in accord with subclause 38 (6); or

(h)   for any other purposes agreed upon between the Minister and State Minister.

23  (3)  Any part of the general allowance determined by the Minister under subclause 23 (2) for a State for a year which will not be fully expended or committed in that year for the purposes of that subclause shall be expended or committed in that year for the purposes of subclause 23 (1).

23  (4)  Where in any year the general allowance determined by the Minister under subclause 23 (2) is not fully expended or committed in the year for which it was determined, the amount of the general allowance for the succeeding year shall be increased by the amount of the general allowance not so expended or committed in the previous year up to a maximum of one half of the general allowance for that year.

24.       Any cash surplus of revenue over outgoings arising from rental operations in a year is to be applied to those operations or to the Rental Capital Account.

25.       The conditions of eligibility of persons for rental housing assistance shall be determined by the State in accordance with the principles set out in Recital (D) and so that priority in granting assistance is determined by the need for assistance. No class of persons including the classes of single persons and of young persons shall be excluded from consideration.

26 (1)  In determining rents for rental housing in accordance with the principles set out in Recital (D), a State shall fix rents having regard primarily to the costs to the State of providing that housing and to the capacity of tenants to afford to pay. To this end:

# The Schedule—Cost rent principles

Clause 26

The following principles are to be used to determine real cost rents for rental housing. The principles are not to be applied to the costs of individual dwellings but rather to the total cost pool of the rental stock. In allocating the total cost pool to individual tenancies, a State will have regard to variation in housing standards and locations within the constraints of available administrative arrangements for assessing these variations.

**Recovery of operating expenses**

**1.**  The costs to be recovered in this respect are ordinarily listed in the rental accounts of State housing authorities as yearly expenditure items. These include:

(a)   administration;

(b)   rates;

(c)   insurance;

(d)   specific operating expenses associated with particular types of units;

(e)   annual maintenance;

(f)   yearly allowance for rent arrears and debts written off;

(g)   yearly allowance for vacancies;

(h)   leasing expenses related to land and dwellings;

(i)    operating expenses of community facilities; and

(j)    any other operating costs agreed between the Minister and a State Minister.

**Interest Charges**

**2.**  The costs to be recovered by the State include:

(a)   interest payable by a State on loan funds invested by it in rental housing; and

(b)   a notional amount of interest on all Commonwealth and State grants invested in rental housing from and including 1989‑90\. That notional amount of interest is to be calculated at a rate taken as equivalent to the assessed secondary market yields published by the Reserve Bank of Australia in periodical Statistical Bulletins for the last business day of June preceding the commencement of the year in which the grants are paid into the Rental Capital Account.

**Depreciation**

**3.**  An amount with respect to depreciation is to be included in costs to be recovered. To this end:

(a)   the depreciation rate is to reflect a life of between 40‑75 years of the capital improvements on the land;

(b)   the value of capital improvement will be based on the estimated current capital improved value; and

(c)   the minimum annual depreciation rate will be not less than the rate resulting from a term of 75 years.
