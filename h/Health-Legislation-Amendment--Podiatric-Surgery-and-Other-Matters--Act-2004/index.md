             (2)  An application under subsection (1) in relation to the supply of pharmaceutical benefits at or from particular premises:

                     (a)  must be made in writing in a form approved by the Secretary; and

             (5)  If the Secretary requires the provision of information or the production of documents within a specified period and the information or documents are not provided or produced within that period, the Secretary may treat the application as having been withdrawn.

             (6)  When the Secretary makes a decision to grant or refuse an application under this section, the Secretary must cause notice in writing of that decision to be given to the applicant. If the Secretary decides to refuse an application, the notice must include reasons for the refusal.

                     (a)  the person granted that permission is to be treated for all purposes of this Act as if the person is, and, since the referral day in relation to the permission, had been, approved under section 90 as an approved pharmacist in relation to the pharmacy at those premises; and

                     (b)  any supply of pharmaceutical benefits at or from those premises by a pharmacist who is not an approved pharmacist after the referral day in relation to the permission and before the grant of that permission is to be treated as if it had been a supply of those pharmaceutical benefits by the person to whom the permission is granted; and

                     (a)  unless paragraph (b) applies—the day following the date of death of the deceased pharmacist to whom the application for permission related; or

                     (b)  if there has been a prior permission granted under this section in relation to the premises to which the permission relates—the day following the date the prior permission was revoked.

             (9)  A permission granted to a person under subsection (1) in relation to particular premises continues, unless it is sooner revoked, until that person or another person is approved by the Secretary under section 90 in respect of those premises.

           (10)  Nothing in this section authorises the Secretary to grant a permission under subsection (1) to a person to supply pharmaceutical benefits at or from particular premises at which the person is not permitted, under the law of the State or Territory in which the premises are situated, to carry on business.

           (11)  If:

                     (a)  probate of the will, or administration of the estate, of a deceased approved pharmacist is granted; and

                     (b)  the person granted a permission under subsection (1) in relation to the supply of pharmaceutical benefits at or from premises where that pharmacist carried on business is not, or is not included among persons who are, granted that probate or administration;

he or she must, as soon as he or she becomes aware of that fact, notify the Secretary in writing of that fact.

           (12)  If the Secretary becomes aware, either as a result of a notification under subsection (11) or otherwise, that:

                     (b)  the person granted a permission under subsection (1) is not, or is not included among persons who are, granted that probate or administration;

the Secretary must, by notice in writing given to the person granted that permission, revoke the permission.

           (13)  If a partnership agreement provides for the disposal of the pharmacy business of a deceased approved pharmacist to any surviving partner or partners, nothing in this section is to be taken to override the operation of the terms of that agreement.

## 14  After subsection 105AB(7)

Insert:

       (7AA)  An application may be made to the Tribunal for review of a decision of the Secretary:

                     (a)  under subsection 91(1) granting or refusing an application under section 91; or

                     (b)  under subsection 91(5) treating an application under section 91 as having been withdrawn; or
