             (6)  Long service leave granted in the circumstances set out in subsection (4) is to be taken so as to end immediately before the employee stops being an employee.

             (7)  For the purposes of this section, the rate of salary to be used in working out the full salary of an employee is the rate that would be applicable to the employee under section 20 of the Long Service Leave Act if:

                     (a)  that section applied to the employee; and

                     (b)  for the expression “section 16 or 17” in that section there were substituted the expression “section 17 of the _Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (Transfer of Assets and Abolition) Act 1996_”.
