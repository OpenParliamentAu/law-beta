             (4)  However, the Chief Executive Officer must not delegate powers or functions delegated to him or her under another Act if the delegation by the Chief Executive Officer would be inconsistent with the express provisions of that Act.

##### <a id="8AD"></a>8AD   Commonwealth consent to conferral of powers etc. on Chief Executive Officer by State and Territory laws

             (1)  A law of a State or Territory may confer powers or functions, or impose duties, on the Chief Executive Officer.

Note:          Section 8AF sets out when such a law imposes a duty on the Chief Executive Officer.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not authorise the conferral of a power or function, or the imposition of a duty, by a law of a State or Territory to the extent to which:

                     (a)  the conferral or imposition, or the authorisation, would contravene any constitutional doctrines restricting the duties that may be imposed on the Chief Executive Officer; or

                     (b)  the authorisation would otherwise exceed the legislative power of the Commonwealth.

             (3)  The Chief Executive Officer cannot exercise a power, or perform a duty or function, under a law of a State or Territory without the written approval of the Minister.

##### <a id="8AE"></a>8AE  How duty is imposed on Chief Executive Officer by State and Territory laws

Application

             (1)  This section applies if a law of a State or Territory purports to impose a duty on the Chief Executive Officer.

Note:          Section 8AF sets out when such a law imposes a duty on the Chief Executive Officer.

State or Territory legislative power sufficient to support duty

             (2)  The duty is taken not to be imposed by this Act (or any other law of the Commonwealth) to the extent to which:

                     (a)  imposing the duty is within the legislative powers of the State or Territory concerned; and

                     (b)  imposing the duty by the law of the State or Territory is consistent with the constitutional doctrines restricting the duties that may be imposed on the Chief Executive Officer.

Note:          If this subsection applies, the duty will be taken to be imposed by force of the law of the State or Territory (the Commonwealth having consented under section 8AD to the imposition of the duty by that law).

Commonwealth legislative power sufficient to support duty but State or Territory legislative powers are not

             (3)  If, to ensure the validity of the purported imposition of the duty, it is necessary that the duty be imposed by a law of the Commonwealth (rather than by the law of the State or Territory), the duty is taken to be imposed by this Act to the extent necessary to ensure that validity.

             (4)  If, because of subsection (3), this Act is taken to impose the duty, it is the intention of the Parliament to rely on all powers available to it under the Constitution to support the imposition of the duty by this Act.

             (5)  The duty is taken to be imposed by this Act in accordance with subsection (3) only to the extent to which imposing the duty:

                     (a)  is within the legislative powers of the Commonwealth; and

                     (b)  is consistent with the constitutional doctrines restricting the duties that may be imposed on the Chief Executive Officer.

             (6)  Subsections (1) to (5) do not limit section 8AD.

##### <a id="8AF"></a>8AF  When State and Territory laws impose a duty on Chief Executive Officer

                   For the purposes of sections 8AD and 8AE, a law of a State or Territory **_imposes a duty_** on the Chief Executive Officer if:

                     (a)  the law confers a power or function on the Chief Executive Officer; and

                     (b)  the circumstances in which the power or function is conferred give rise to an obligation on the Chief Executive Officer to exercise the power or to perform the function.

### Division 2—Appointment etc. of Chief Executive Officer

##### <a id="8AG"></a>8AG  Appointment

             (1)  There is to be a Chief Executive Officer of Medicare Australia.

             (2)  The Chief Executive Officer is to be appointed in writing by the Minister.

             (3)  The Chief Executive Officer holds office for the period specified in the instrument of appointment. The period must not exceed 5 years.

                     (c)  if the material can be transferred to a disk, tape or other storage device that:

                              (i)  is brought to the premises; or

                            operate the equipment or other facilities to copy the material to the storage device and take the storage device from the premises.

             (3)  Equipment may be seized under paragraph (2)(a) only if it is not practicable to put the material in documentary form as mentioned in paragraph (2)(b) or to copy the material as mentioned in paragraph (2)(c).

                     (a)  evidential material may be accessible by operating electronic equipment at the warrant premises; and

                     (b)  expert assistance is required to operate the equipment; and

                     (c)  if he or she does not take action under this subsection, the material may be destroyed, altered or otherwise interfered with;

                     (b)  the authorised officer or officer assisting believes, on reasonable grounds, that it is necessary to seize that evidential material in order to prevent its concealment, loss or destruction, or its use in committing, continuing or repeating the relevant offence or relevant civil contravention or the other relevant offence or relevant civil contravention;

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply if:

                     (a)  so advising the patient would prejudice the investigation in connection with which the powers were exercised; or

                    Penalty:  Imprisonment for 2 years.

Note:          Under subsection 4D(1) of the _Crimes Act 1914_, this penalty is only a maximum penalty for the offence. Subsection 4B(2) of that Act allows a court to impose an appropriate fine instead of, or in addition to, a term of imprisonment.

##### <a id="8ZQ"></a>8ZQ  Actions under this Part taken to be in performance of certain functions

             (1)  For the purposes of this Act, anything done under this Part for a purpose related to the _Health Insurance Act 1973_, including investigation of whether benefits are payable under that Act and investigation of compliance with that Act, is taken to have been done in the performance of the Chief Executive Officer’s medicare functions.

             (2)  A thing found at the premises may be moved to another place for examination or processing in order to determine whether it may be seized under a warrant if:

                     (a)  both of the following apply:

             (9)  The authorised officer or an officer assisting may operate equipment already at the warrant premises to carry out the examination or processing of a thing found at the premises in order to determine whether it is a thing that may be seized under the warrant if the authorised officer or officer assisting believes on reasonable grounds that:

                     (b)  the examination or processing can be carried out without damage to the equipment or the thing.
