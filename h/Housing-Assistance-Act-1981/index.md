##### <a id="7"></a>7  Loans

             (1)  Subject to this Act, the Minister may, during a year to which this Act applies, if an agreement has been entered into between the Commonwealth and a State in pursuance of this Act, authorize the making of loans to the State, by way of financial assistance, of such amounts as he determines to be appropriate, for expenditure by the State in respect of that year for any purpose related to housing in respect of which moneys paid under this section are permitted to be expended under the agreement.

             (2)  Loans shall be made on such terms and conditions as are specified in the agreement in relation to the loans.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Appropriation

             (1)  The Consolidated Revenue Fund is appropriated for the purpose of:

                     (a)  the making of grants amounting in the aggregate to $54,000,000 during each year to which this Act applies (other than the year commencing on 1 July 1985) for the purposes referred to in paragraphs 6(1)(a); and

                     (b)  the making of loans amounting in the aggregate to $146,000,000 during each year to which this Act applies (other than the years commencing on <st1:date style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x" year="1984" day="1" month="7">1 July 1984</st1:date> and <st1:date style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x" year="1985" day="1" month="7">1 July 1985</st1:date>).

             (2)  Grants and loans shall be made out of moneys appropriated, whether by this Act or another Act, for the purpose of making grants or loans, as the case may be.

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Allocation of grants and loans amongst States

             (1)  The Minister shall, in authorizing grants during a year to which this Act applies for the purposes referred to in paragraph 6(1)(a), ensure that:

                     (a)  the aggregate of the amounts of those grants is not less than the amount appropriated by this Act for those purposes in respect of that year; and

                     (b)  those amounts are allocated amongst the States on the basis of the respective needs of the States as determined by the Minister.

             (2)  Subject to section 10, the Minister shall, in authorizing grants during a year to which this Act applies for the purposes referred to in paragraph 6(1)(b), ensure that the amounts of those grants are allocated amongst the States on the same basis as the basis provided for in subsection (4) in respect of that year for the allocation amongst the States of the amounts of the loans referred to in that subsection.

             (3)  Subject to section 10, the Minister shall, in authorizing loans during a year to which this Act applies out of moneys appropriated by this Act, ensure that:

                     (a)  the aggregate of the amounts of those loans is not less than the amount appropriated by this Act for the purpose of making loans during that year; and

                     (b)  those amounts are allocated amongst the States:

                              (i)  in respect of the year commencing on 1 July 1981—in the proportions expressed by the percentages set out in Schedule 2; and

                             (ii)  in respect of any subsequent year to which this Act applies—in the proportions determined by the Minister, by writing signed by him, to be the appropriate proportions in respect of that year for the purposes of this subsection but so that no State is allocated in respect of that year an amount that, or amounts the sum of which, is less than $7,300,000.

             (4)  Subject to section 10, the Minister shall, in authorizing loans during a year to which this Act applies out of moneys appropriated by an Act other than this Act, ensure that the amounts of those loans are allocated amongst the States:

                     (a)  in respect of the year commencing on 1 July 1981—in the proportions expressed by the percentages set out in Schedule 2; and

                     (b)  in respect of any subsequent year to which this Act applies—in the proportions determined by the Minister, by writing signed by him, to be the appropriate proportions in respect of that year for the purposes of this subsection.

             (5)  The appropriate proportions to be determined by the Minister under subparagraph (3)(b)(ii) and paragraph (4)(b) for the allocation amongst the States of the amounts of the loans to be made during the years to which this Act applies other than the year commencing on 1 July 1981 shall be determined, as far as practicable, so as progressively to achieve the result that, if the operation of this Act and of each agreement entered into in pursuance of this Act were to be extended for the further period of 5 years next following the expiration of the period to which this Act applies, the amounts of the loans made would, in the year commencing on 1 July 1990, be allocated amongst the States on an equal per capita basis.

##### <a id="10"></a>10  Unmatched moneys

             (1)  If the Minister becomes satisfied in relation to a State, during a year to which this Act applies, that the aggregate of the amounts (in this section referred to as the **_amount notionally allocated for grants and loans to that State_**) that, but for this subsection, would constitute the total allocation to that State in respect of that year in respect of all moneys appropriated, whether by this Act or by another Act, for the purpose of making grants and loans to all the States under this Act during that year, exceeds the aggregate of the amounts (in this section referred to as the **_proposed matching expenditure of that State_**) that that State has expended or proposes to expend in relation to housing in respect of that year out of moneys that would constitute, in relation to that State, matching funds for the purpose of any agreement entered into in pursuance of this Act by that State, then, notwithstanding section 9:

                     (a)  the Minister shall, in authorizing grants and loans to that State during that year, ensure that the total of the amounts of the grants and loans made to that State does not exceed the amount so expended or proposed to be expended by that State; and

                     (b)  the Minister may authorize grants or loans, or grants and loans, of such amounts as he determines to be appropriate, to such of the States other than that State as he determines to be appropriate, being grants or loans, or grants and loans, that do not, in the aggregate, exceed the amount by which the amount notionally allocated for grants and loans to that State exceeds the proposed matching expenditure of that State.

             (2)  In subsection (1), a reference to a grant shall be construed as a reference to a grant made for a purpose referred to in paragraph 6(1)(b).

##### <a id="11"></a>11  Advances on account of moneys expected to become payable under sections 6 and 7

             (1)  The Minister may make arrangements for the making to a State, by way of financial assistance to the State, of advances on account of amounts that are expected to become payable to the State under section 6.

             (2)  The Minister may make arrangements for the making to a State, by way of financial assistance to the State, of advances on account of amounts that are expected to become payable to the State under section 7.

             (3)  Upon the execution of an agreement between the Commonwealth and a State in pursuance of this Act, this Act and the agreement apply, and shall be deemed at all relevant times to have applied, to and in relation to moneys paid to that State under subsection (1) or (2) as if those moneys had been paid under and in accordance with section 6 or 7, as the case requires.

             (4)  If a State has not, before 1 January 1982, entered into an agreement with the Commonwealth in pursuance of this Act, the State shall repay to the Commonwealth an amount equal to the aggregate of the amounts (if any) paid to the State under subsection (1) and of the amounts (if any) paid to the State under subsection (2).

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Authority to borrow

                   The Treasurer may, from time to time, in accordance with the provisions of the _Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act 1911_, or in accordance with the provisions of an Act authorizing the issue of Treasury Bills, borrow moneys for the purpose of making payments and advances to the States for the purposes of this Act (including moneys to meet the expenses of any such borrowing).

##### <a id="13"></a>13  Application of moneys borrowed

                   Moneys borrowed under section 12 shall be issued and applied only for the expenses of borrowing and for the purpose of making payments and advances to the States for the purposes of this Act.

##### <a id="15"></a>15  Annual report by Minister

                   The Minister shall, as soon as practicable after the end of each year to which this Act applies, cause to be laid before each House of the Parliament, a report relating to:

                     (a)  the operation of the agreements executed in pursuance of this Act; and

                     (b)  any other matter that the Minister considers relevant.

THE NORTHERN TERRITORY OF AUSTRALIA of the eighth part.

WHEREAS: 

(A)  the Commonwealth and the States of Australia have from time to time entered into agreements for the purpose of the provision by the States with financial assistance from the Commonwealth of housing for persons who are in need of governmental assistance if their housing requirements are to be met;

(B)  by an agreement dated the seventeenth day of October 1978, being the agreement authorised to be executed on behalf of the Commonwealth by the Housing Assistance Act 1978 of the Commonwealth Parliament and being the last of the agreements referred to in recital (A), provision was so made with respect to the three years commencing on the 1st July 1978;

(C)  the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory of Australia entered into an agreement dated the eleventh day of March 1980 in relation to the funding of welfare housing in the Northern Territory with respect to the two years commencing on the 1st July 1979;

(D)  the Ministers of the respective governments throughout Australia who are responsible for housing have agreed upon the provision of rental housing assistance and home purchase assistance in the various States and in the Northern Territory during the five years commencing on the 1st July 1981;

(E)  the Ministers have affirmed and augmented principles that apply to the provision of housing assistance under agreements of the nature aforesaid, namely—

(a)   housing assistance will—

(i)    facilitate home ownership for those able to afford it but not able to gain it through the private market;

(ii)   provide adequate rental housing for those of the community who are deemed to be in need of governmental assistance at a price that is within their capacity to pay; and

(iii)  provide assistance for home ownership and assistance with rental accommodation in the most efficient way and thus to exclude from eligibility those not in need, to minimise continued availability of assistance to those no longer in need and to accord benefits which are designed so that assistance being provided is related to the particular family’s or individual’s current economic and social circumstances;

(b)   benefits which are available are offset to the minimum extent practicable by poor location of dwellings, an inadequate range of choice of dwellings and stigmatisation of those who are to receive benefits;

(c)   clear recognition is accorded to the separate but complementary roles of—

(i)    construction and acquisition of dwellings;

(ii)   management of the rental operations; and

(iii)  sales of dwellings;

(d)   maximum social benefit is sought from previous investment in housing;

(e)   design, style and siting of public housing will to the maximum extent practicable—

(i)    support the energy conservation policies of the governments; and

(ii)   reflect the need for accessibility and suitability for habitation by handicapped persons;

(f)   tenant participation in public housing policies and estate management is encouraged; and

(g)   the States will be able to exercise maximum autonomy and flexibility in the administrative arrangements necessary to achieve these principles;

(F)   it is proposed that in order to implement the agreement of the Ministers the Commonwealth will grant to the States financial assistance under section 96 of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution and like assistance to the Northern Territory and that the terms and conditions on which the grant of financial assistance should be made are those set out in this agreement;

(G)  the Commonwealth and the States and the Northern Territory wish to vary in certain respects the operation of the agreements which have been entered into as aforesaid; and

(H)  the Parliament of the Commonwealth has authorized the execution by and on behalf of the Commonwealth of this agreement and the provision of financial assistance to the States in accordance with its provisions:

NOW IT IS HEREBY AGREED as follows:

PART I—OPERATION OF AGREEMENT

1.   (1)  This agreement shall come into force in respect of the Commonwealth and of a State when it has been signed on behalf of the Commonwealth and has been signed on behalf of the State with the authority of the Parliament of the State or, having been signed on behalf of the State without the authority, is approved by the Parliament of the States.

(2)   This agreement shall come into force in respect of the Commonwealth and the <st1:state><st1:place style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x">Northern Territory</st1:place></st1:state> when it has been signed on behalf of the Commonwealth and has been signed on behalf of the <st1:state><st1:place style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x">Northern Territory</st1:place></st1:state>.

(3)   Notwithstanding that in this agreement all the States of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania and the Northern Territory are named as parties, this agreement shall operate as an agreement between the Commonwealth and the party or parties in respect of which it comes into force as fully and effectually as if the party or parties in respect of which it comes into force were the only party or parties so named other than the Commonwealth.

2.  Acts and things provided for by this agreement which have been done or carried out by or with respect to a State or the Northern Territory in accordance with and in anticipation of its coming into force in respect of that State or Territory shall be deemed to have been done or carried out under this agreement as if it were in force at the relevant time or times in respect of that State, or that Territory, as the case may be.

PART II—PARTIES

3.   (1)  In this agreement, subject to this clause and except where the context otherwise indicates—

(a)   “the Commonwealth” means the Commonwealth of Australia as the party to this agreement;

(b)   each State named as a party in respect of which the agreement comes into force is referred to as a “State” and, except where the context otherwise indicates, “the States” means all of those States; and
