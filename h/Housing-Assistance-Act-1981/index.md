 AN AGREEMENT made the				day of					One thousand nine hundred and eighty- between&#151;
 THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA of the first part,
 THE STATE OF NEW SOUTH WALES of the second part,
 THE STATE OF VICTORIA of the third part,
 THE STATE OF QUEENSLAND of the fourth part,

<center>Back to Top</center>
 THE STATE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA of the fifth part,
 THE STATE OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA of the sixth part,
 THE STATE OF TASMANIA of the seventh part, and
 THE NORTHERN TERRITORY OF AUSTRALIA of the eighth part.
 WHEREAS: 
 (A)	the Commonwealth and the States of Australia have from time to time entered into agreements for the purpose of the provision by the States with financial assistance from the Commonwealth of housing for persons who are in need of governmental assistance if their housing requirements are to be met;
 (B)	by an agreement dated the seventeenth day of October 1978, being the agreement authorised to be executed on behalf of the Commonwealth by the Housing Assistance Act 1978 of the Commonwealth Parliament and being the last of the agreements referred to in recital (A), provision was so made with respect to the three years commencing on the 1st July 1978;
 (C)	the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory of Australia entered into an agreement dated the eleventh day of March 1980 in relation to the funding of welfare housing in the Northern Territory with respect to the two years commencing on the 1st July 1979;

 (ii)	provide adequate rental housing for those of the community who are deemed to be in need of governmental assistance at a price that is within their capacity to pay; and
 (iii)	provide assistance for home ownership and assistance with rental accommodation in the most efficient way and thus to exclude from eligibility those not in need, to minimise continued availability of assistance to those no longer in need and to accord benefits which are designed so that assistance being provided is related to the particular family's or individual's current economic and social circumstances;
 (b)	benefits which are available are offset to the minimum extent practicable by poor location of dwellings, an inadequate range of choice of dwellings and stigmatisation of those who are to receive benefits;
 (c)	clear recognition is accorded to the separate but complementary roles of&#151;
 (i)	construction and acquisition of dwellings;
 (ii)	management of the rental operations; and
 (iii)	sales of dwellings;
 (d)	maximum social benefit is sought from previous investment in housing;
 (e)	design, style and siting of public housing will to the maximum extent practicable&#151;
 (i)	support the energy conservation policies of the governments; and
 (ii)	reflect the need for accessibility and suitability for habitation by handicapped persons;
 (f)	tenant participation in public housing policies and estate management is encouraged; and
 (g)	the States will be able to exercise maximum autonomy and flexibility in the administrative arrangements necessary to achieve these principles;
 (F)	it is proposed that in order to implement the agreement of the Ministers the Commonwealth will grant to the States financial assistance under section&#160;96 of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution and like assistance to the Northern Territory and that the terms and conditions on which the grant of financial assistance should be made are those set out in this agreement;
 (G)	the Commonwealth and the States and the Northern Territory wish to vary in certain respects the operation of the agreements which have been entered into as aforesaid; and
