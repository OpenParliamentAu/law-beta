**Sale of dwellings under 1945 Agreement**

“14.       (1)   Each State may, if it so desires and at such price and on such terms as it thinks fit, sell any dwellings, but sales pursuant to this sub-clause shall not affect the obligation of the State under clause 6 of this agreement to repay and to pay interest on advances made under this agreement.

“(2)    Where a person to whom a dwelling could be sold is an eligible person who desires to purchase the dwelling from the Director in pursuance of the _War Service Homes Act_ 1918-1956 [_see_ Note 2] as amended from time to time, or to obtain an advance under that Act to enable him to purchase the dwelling, the State may, if requested so to do by the Director, sell the dwelling to the Director or that eligible person, in which event no amount of money shall be payable to the State by the Director or the eligible person, as the case may be, but the State shall transfer to the Director or to the eligible person, as the case may be, an estate in fee simple in the land on which the dwelling is erected, if the dwelling is erected on freehold land, or issue a Crown lease in perpetuity to the Director or to the eligible person, as the case may be, if the dwelling is erected on Crown land, subject in either case to the reservations, exceptions and conditions (if any) contained in the Crown Grant or Crown lease, as the case may be, and to such encumbrances, reservations, exceptions, covenants or conditions subject to which the sale is expressly made, and the amount of the State’s indebtedness to the Commonwealth under sub-clause (2) of clause 6 of this agreement shall as from the date of sale be reduced by the amount of the purchase price of the dwelling less the amount, if any, credited to the purchaser.”. 

(2)   The provisions of this clause shall not affect the operation of clause 14 of the 1945 Agreement in relation to sales of dwellings to which that agreement applies made by the State before the coming into force of this agreement in respect of the State.
