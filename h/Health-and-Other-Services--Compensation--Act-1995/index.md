	(1)	Despite any other provision of this Act, and despite the Charges Act, if the sum of all the amounts that are payable under this Act or the Charges Act in respect of the amount of compensation fixed by a judgment or settlement would, apart from this section, exceed the difference between:
	(a)	the amount of compensation fixed by the judgment or settlement; and
	(b)	the sum of the amounts (if any) payable under Part 3.14 of the Social Security Act 1991 in respect of the amount of compensation;
the sum of all the amounts that are payable under this Act or the Charges Act in respect of the amount of compensation is taken, for all purposes, to be the amount of the difference.
	(2)	For the avoidance of doubt, if there are no amounts of a kind referred to in paragraph (1)(b) payable in respect of the amount of compensation, the amount of the difference referred to in subsection (1) is taken to be the amount of compensation.
28  Payments to the Commonwealth
	(1)	If the Managing Director gives to a compensation payer a notice under section 24 or 25, the compensation payer must pay to the Commonwealth the amount specified in the notice within 28 days after the day on which the notice was given.

Penalty:	Imprisonment for 12 months.
Note:	Under subsection 4D(1) of the Crimes Act 1914, these penalties are only maximum penalties for the offences. Subsection 4B(2) of that Act allows a court to impose an appropriate fine instead of, or in addition to, a term of imprisonment. If a body corporate is convicted of one of these offences, subsection 4B(3) of that Act allows a court to impose a fine of an amount not greater than 5 times the maximum fine that the court could impose on an individual convicted of the same offence.
29  Recovery of amounts payable to the Commonwealth
	(1)	An amount that is payable to the Commonwealth under this Act or the Charges Act in respect of an amount of compensation is recoverable as a debt due to the Commonwealth.
	(2)	If:
	(a)	the amount is included in the amount specified in a notice under section 24 or 25; and
	(b)	the compensation payer or insurer to whom the notice was given fails to comply with section 28 in relation to the notice;
the amount so included is recoverable from the compensation payer or insurer to whom the notice was given.
	(3)	If the amount is payable in respect of an amount of compensation fixed by a judgment or settlement in relation to which there has been a failure to comply with section 23, the amount is recoverable from the compensation payer or insurer who failed so to comply.
	(4)	If the amount is payable in respect of an amount of compensation payable under a reimbursement arrangement in relation to which there has been a failure to comply with section 13, the amount is recoverable from the person who failed to comply with that section.
	(5)	A person’s liability to pay to the Commonwealth under subsection (3) or (4) amounts owing to the Commonwealth in respect of an amount of compensation is not affected by any payment of compensation by the person in relation to the claim for compensation.
	(6)	If the amount is payable in respect of an amount of compensation fixed by a settlement in relation to which there has been a failure to comply with section 22, the amount is recoverable from the notifiable person in relation to the claim for compensation.
	(7)	A person’s liability to pay to the Commonwealth under subsection (6) amounts owing to the Commonwealth in respect of an amount of compensation:
	(a)	is not affected by any payment of compensation by the person in relation to the claim for compensation; and
	(b)	does not affect the amount of compensation that the person is liable to pay; and
	(c)	does not give rise to any right of recovery in respect of any payments of the compensation that the person has made.
30  Notice of charge suspends liability to pay compensation etc.
	(1)	If an amount is recoverable under section 28 from a compensation payer in respect of an amount of compensation, the compensation payer is not liable to pay to the compensable person any amount of the compensation until the amount is paid to the Commonwealth, or until the end of the 28 day period for complying with section 28, whichever happens first.
	(2)	If an amount is recoverable under section 28 from an insurer in respect of an amount of compensation:
	(a)	the insurer is not liable to indemnify the compensation payer in respect of the compensation payer’s liability to pay to the compensable person any amount of the compensation; and
	(b)	the compensation payer is not liable to pay to the compensable person any amount of the compensation;
until the amount is paid to the Commonwealth, or until the end of the 28 day period for complying with section 28, whichever happens first.
31  Payment to the Commonwealth discharges liability
	(1)	Payment of an amount that a compensation payer is liable to pay to the Commonwealth under section 28 or subsection 29(3) or (4) operates, to the extent of the payment, as a discharge of:
	(a)	the compensation payer’s liability to the compensable person in respect of the amount of compensation; and
	(b)	the compensable person’s liability to pay to the Commonwealth amounts payable under this Act or the Charges Act in respect of the amount of compensation.
	(2)	Payment of the amount that an insurer is liable to pay to the Commonwealth under section 28 or subsection 29(3) or (4) operates, to the extent of the payment, as a discharge of:
	(a)	the insurer’s liability to indemnify the compensation payer in respect of the compensation payer’s liability to the compensable person in respect of the amount of compensation; and
	(b)	the compensation payer’s liability to the compensable person in respect of the amount of compensation; and
	(c)	the compensable person’s liability under this Act or the Charges Act to pay to the Commonwealth amounts payable under this Act in respect of the amount of compensation.
	(3)	A reference in this section to payment of an amount is a reference to payment by any person, other than the compensable person or a person acting on the compensable person’s behalf.
32  Offence to make payment before discharging liability to the Commonwealth
	(1)	If a judgment or settlement has been made in respect of an amount of compensation, a compensation payer or insurer must not pay to the compensable person any part of the compensation before the Managing Director has issued a notice under section 24 unless:
	(a)	the time within which the Managing Director must issue such a notice has expired; and
	(b)	if the Managing Director had given a notice under section 21, in respect of the claim for compensation, during the 6 months preceding the judgment or settlement—the insurer or compensation payer withholds from the compensable person an amount of compensation equal to the amount set out in the notice under paragraph 21(2)(b).
Penalty:	Imprisonment for 12 months.
	(1A)	Subsection (1) does not apply if the compensation payer or insurer makes an advance payment in respect of the compensation.
	(2)	If a compensation payer is liable under section 28 to pay an amount to the Commonwealth in respect of an amount of compensation, the compensation payer must not pay to the compensable person any part of the compensation unless:
	(a)	the Commonwealth has been paid the amount specified in the notice referred to in that section (whether or not it is paid by the compensation payer); or
	(b)	the 28 day period for complying with that section has expired, and a part of the amount of compensation equal to the amount specified in the notice has been withheld from the compensable person.
Penalty:	Imprisonment for 12 months.
	(3)	If the compensation payer is a member of a body that is a representative organisation in relation to the claim for compensation that gave rise to the amount of compensation becoming payable:
	(a)	the representative organisation; and
	(b)	any insurers of the representative organisation;
are subject to the same obligations under subsections (1) and (2) as the compensation payer.
	(4)	If an insurer is liable under section 28 to pay an amount to the Commonwealth in respect of an amount of compensation, the insurer must not pay to the compensable person any part of the compensation unless:
	(a)	the Commonwealth has been paid the amount specified in the notice referred to in that section (whether or not it is paid by the insurer); or
	(b)	the 28 day period for complying with that section has expired, and a part of the amount of compensation equal to the amount specified in the notice has been withheld from the compensable person.
Penalty:	Imprisonment for 12 months.
Note:	Under subsection 4D(1) of the Crimes Act 1914, these penalties are only maximum penalties for the offences. Subsection 4B(2) of that Act allows a court to impose an appropriate fine instead of, or in addition to, a term of imprisonment. If a body corporate is convicted of one of these offences, subsection 4B(3) of that Act allows a court to impose a fine of an amount not greater than 5 times the maximum fine that the court could impose on an individual convicted of the same offence.
	(5)	A compensation payer’s or insurer’s liability to pay to the Commonwealth amounts owing to the Commonwealth in respect of the amount of compensation is not affected by:
	(a)	payment of an amount of compensation prior to the making of a judgment, settlement or reimbursement arrangement in respect of the claim for compensation; or
	(b)	payment of an amount of compensation in contravention of this section.
	(6)	If a compensable person receives from a compensation payer or insurer a payment of an amount of compensation in contravention of this section, the compensation payer or insurer is not entitled to recover the amount from the compensable person.
33  Interest not payable on amount withheld
		If:
	(a)	a judgment or settlement has been made in respect of an amount of compensation; and
	(b)	a compensation payer or insurer has paid to the compensable person a part of the compensation, but withheld an amount referred to in paragraph 32(1)(b); and
	(c)	an Australian law would, apart from this section, make the compensation payer or insurer liable to pay interest on the sum withheld, because the sum is withheld after the judgment or settlement has been made;
despite that law, the compensation payer or insurer is not liable to pay that interest.
