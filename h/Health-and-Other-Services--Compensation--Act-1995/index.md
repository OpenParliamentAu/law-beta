	The _Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995_ came into operation on 1&#160;February 1996 (_see Gazette_ 1996, No. GN2). 
 _(b)_	The _Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995_ was amended by Schedule&#160;5 (items&#160;4-28) only of the _Aged Care (Consequential Provisions) Act 1997_, subsection 2(1) of which provides as follows:

	(1)	Subject to this section, this Act commences immediately after the commencement of the _Aged Care Act 1997_ (other than Division&#160;1 of that Act).

	The _Aged Care Act 1997_ (other than Division&#160;1 of Chapter&#160;1) commenced on 1&#160;October 1997 (_see Gazette_ 1997, No. GN37).
 _(c)_	The _Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995_ was amended by Schedule&#160;1 and Schedule&#160;3 (items&#160;3-7) only of the _Health and Other Services (Compensation) Legislation Amendment Act 2001_, subsections 2(1) and (4)(a) of which provide as follows:

	Schedule&#160;1 (item&#160;21) does not commence.
