                     (c)  an amount paid that is not required to be paid by or under an Australian law, other than such an amount the payment of which (whether on its own or in conjunction with other such payments) has the effect of extinguishing by agreement a claim for compensation; or

                     (e)  a payment of a kind, or in circumstances, prescribed by the regulations made for the purposes of this paragraph.

             (3)  For the purposes of paragraph (2)(a), an individual is taken to be insured or otherwise indemnified for liability in respect of the injury in question if:

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Application of this Act to events occurring before the commencement of this Act

             (1)  This Act only applies in relation to an amount of compensation fixed by a judgment or settlement if the judgment or settlement was made on or after the day on which this Act commences.

             (3)  This Act applies in relation to such a judgment, settlement or reimbursement arrangement even if it is made in respect of an injury that occurred before that day.

             (4)  In its application in respect of an injury that occurred before that day, this Act is capable of applying in relation to a particular payment of an eligible benefit whether the payment was made before, on or after that day.

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Crown to be bound

             (1)  This Act binds the Crown in all its capacities.

             (2)  Nothing in this Act renders the Crown in any of its capacities liable to be prosecuted.

##### <a id="6A"></a>6A  Application of the _Criminal Code_

                   Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ applies to all offences against this Act.

Note:          Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.

## Part 2—Consequences of compensation payments

### Division 1—Medicare benefit

_Note 1:    See also sections 5 and 6 of the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Care Charges Act 1995._

_Note 2:    The obligations under this Division may be affected by the operation of Part 3.14 of the Social Security Act 1991 (see section 27)._

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Reimbursement of amounts payable for professional services

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a reimbursement arrangement has been made in respect of an injury to a compensable person; and

                     (b)  the person is entitled, under the reimbursement arrangement, to compensation by way of reimbursement of expenses as those expenses are incurred, being expenses relating to the professional services rendered to the person in the course of treatment of, or as a result of, the injury.

             (2)  Despite Part II of the _Health Insurance Act 1973_, medicare benefit is not payable in respect of a professional service if, under the reimbursement arrangement, the whole or any part of the amount payable for the service has already been reimbursed before a claim for medicare benefit in respect of the service is made.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  medicare benefit has been paid in respect of a professional service rendered to the person; and

                     (b)  under the reimbursement arrangement, the person is entitled to reimbursement of the whole or any part of the amount payable for the service;

the person entitled to the reimbursement is liable to pay to the Commonwealth an amount equal to the medicare benefit.

             (4)  Subsection (3) has effect only so far as it is not a law imposing taxation within the meaning of section 55 of the Constitution.

Note:          So far as subsection (3) would be a law imposing taxation, see section 5 of the _Health and Other Services (Compensation) Care Charges Act 1995_.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Recovering past payments of medicare benefit from judgments and settlements

             (1)  Subject to subsections (2), (3), (6) and (9), if:

                     (a)  an amount of compensation is fixed under a judgment or settlement made in respect of an injury to a compensable person; and

                     (b)  medicare benefit has already been paid in respect of a professional service rendered to that person in the course of treatment of, or as a result of, the injury; and

                     (c)  a liability has not already arisen under section 7 in respect of that payment of medicare benefit;

there is payable to the Commonwealth an amount equal to the medicare benefit.

             (2)  Subject to subsection (3), if:

                     (a)  the judgment or settlement fixes the amount of compensation on the basis that liability for the injury should be apportioned between the compensable person and the compensation payer; and

                     (b)  as a result, the amount of compensation is less than it would have been if liability had not been so apportioned;

the amount payable to the Commonwealth under subsection (1) is reduced by the proportion corresponding to the proportion of liability for the injury that is apportioned to the compensable person by the judgment or settlement.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  the amount of compensation is fixed by a judgment that specifies an amount (the **_past medical care component_**), being a portion of the amount of compensation, to be a component for the medical expenses already incurred relating to the injury; and

                     (b)  the amount that, apart from this subsection, would be payable to the Commonwealth under this section exceeds the past medical care component;

the amount payable under subsection (1) is taken to be the past medical care component.

             (4)  The amount is payable by the compensable person.

             (5)  This section has effect only so far as it is not a law imposing taxation within the meaning of section 55 of the Constitution.

Note:          So far as this section would be a law imposing taxation, see section 6 of the _Health and Other Services (Compensation) Care Charges Act 1995_.

             (6)  Subject to subsections (7) and (8) and section 37, this section does not apply if:

                     (a)  the notifiable person in relation to the claim for compensation concerned has entered into a bulk payment agreement with the Chief Executive Medicare; and

                     (b)  the notifiable person has complied with all the conditions of the bulk payment agreement; and

                     (c)  an amount of compensation is fixed under the judgment or settlement during the period of the bulk payment agreement; and

                     (d)  the judgment or settlement determines all the outstanding liability of the compensation payer in relation to the claim.

             (7)  Subsection (6) does not apply in relation to a judgment or settlement of a kind referred to in that subsection if:

                     (a)  an amount of compensation is fixed under the judgment or settlement during the period of the bulk payment agreement; and

                     (b)  at the time the judgment or settlement was made, it purported to determine all the outstanding liability of the compensation payer in relation to the claim; and

                     (c)  another judgment or settlement in respect of the claim is made after the end of the period of the bulk payment agreement.

             (8)  Subsection (6) does not affect the validity of a payment of money pursuant to a notice under section 24 if the payment occurred before the amount of compensation was fixed under the judgment or settlement referred to in that subsection.

                     (b)  the amount that, apart from this subsection, would be payable to the Commonwealth under this section exceeds the past care component;

the amount payable under subsection (1) is taken to be the past care component.

             (4)  The amount is payable by the compensable person.

             (5)  This section has effect only so far as it is not a law imposing taxation within the meaning of section 55 of the Constitution.

Note:          So far as this section would be a law imposing taxation, see section 8 of the _Health and Other Services (Compensation) Care Charges Act 1995_.

             (8)  Subsection (6) does not affect the validity of a payment of money pursuant to a notice under section 24 if the payment occurred before the amount of compensation was fixed under the judgment or settlement referred to in that subsection.

             (9)  This section does not apply if:

                     (b)  the amount of compensation fixed by the judgment or settlement is a small amount; and

             (4)  The period cannot be extended if:

                     (a)  the notice in question under subsection 17(1) was given in relation to a claim for compensation in respect of which an amount of compensation under a judgment or settlement had already been fixed; and

                     (b)  the Chief Executive Medicare had not given a notice under section 21, in respect of the claim for compensation, during the 6 months preceding the day on which an amount of compensation was fixed under the judgment or settlement; and

             (5)  If the claimant does not give to the Chief Executive Medicare a statement as required by this section, all the professional services specified in the notice under subsection 17(2) are taken for the purposes of this Act and the Charges Act to have been rendered in the course of treatment of, or as a result of, the injury the claimant claims to have suffered.

             (6)  Subsection (5) does not operate, and is taken for the purposes of this Act and the Charges Act never to have operated, in relation to professional services specified in a notice under subsection 17(2) if the Chief Executive Medicare gives the claimant a notice under subsection (7).

             (7)  The Chief Executive Medicare must give the claimant a notice for the purposes of subsection (6) if:

                     (a)  apart from subsection (6), subsection (5) would operate so that all the services specified in a notice under subsection 17(2) would be taken for the purposes of this Act and the Charges Act to have been rendered in the course of treatment of, or as a result of, the injury the claimant claims to have suffered; and

                     (b)  an amount of compensation has been fixed under a judgment or settlement; and

                     (a)  an extension under section 18 or 19 must not be granted after the day on which the date for the hearing was set; and

                     (b)  any extension that:

                              (i)  was granted before the date for the hearing was set; and

                             (ii)  would, apart from this section, have extended the period in question beyond 28 days after the day on which the date for the hearing was set, or beyond the date set for the hearing;

the notifiable person may, within 28 days after that commencement, give to the Chief Executive Medicare a further notice in writing that contains all of the information and other matters that a notice under subsection (1) is required to contain under this section (as in force after that commencement).

             (6)  A notice under subsection (1) or (3A) must be signed by the notifiable person and the compensable person.

             (7)  This section does not apply if:

                     (a)  the amount of compensation represents, in whole or in part, a redemption of an entitlement to compensation by periodic payments; and

                     (b)  redemption of the compensable person’s entitlement to compensation in respect of future medical care needs, nursing home care needs or residential care needs relating to the injury is prohibited by law; and

                     (c)  inclusion of any amount fixed by a judgment or settlement in respect of expenses for past medical care needs, nursing home care needs or residential care needs relating to the injury is prohibited by law.

                     (b)  otherwise—the compensation payer;

written notice specifying the sum of the amounts (if any) that are payable to the Commonwealth under this Act or the Charges Act in respect of the amount of compensation.

          (1A)  A notice under subsection (1) is not required if the compensation payer or insurer makes an advance payment in respect of the compensation.

             (2)  The notice must also specify, in relation to each kind of eligible benefit that the Commonwealth has paid in respect of any service or care rendered or provided in the course of treatment of, or as a result of, the claimant’s injury, the sum of the amounts (if any) that will be payable to the Commonwealth under this Act or the Charges Act.

             (3)  The notice must not, in relation to any period covered by a notice under section 21 in respect of the claim, take account of any eligible benefits that were paid in respect of services or care not specified in the notice under section 21.

             (4)  The Chief Executive Medicare must give the notice to the notifiable person:

                     (a)  if the Chief Executive Medicare had not given a notice under section 21, in respect of the claim for compensation, during the 6 months preceding the day on which the amount of compensation was fixed under the judgment or settlement—within 3 months after the Chief Executive Medicare receives the notice under subsection 23(1); or

             (7)  Subject to subsections (8) and (9), if subsection (6) applies to a notice, the amount specified in the notice pursuant to paragraph 21(2)(b) is taken to be the amount set out for the purpose of subsection (2) of this section.

             (8)  Despite subsection (7), if:

                     (a)  subsection (6) applies to a notice; and

                     (b)  the judgment or settlement fixes the amount of compensation on the basis that liability for the injury should be apportioned between the compensable person and the compensation payer; and

             (9)  Despite subsection (7), if:

                     (a)  subsection (6) applies to a notice; and

                     (b)  the amount of compensation is fixed by a judgment that specifies an amount (the **_past expenses component_**), being a portion of the amount of compensation, to be a component for either or both of the following:

             (1)  If the Chief Executive Medicare receives a notice under section 13, the Chief Executive Medicare may give to:

                     (a)  if the notifiable person in relation to the claim for compensation from which the reimbursement arrangement referred to in section 13 resulted is an insurer—that insurer; or

                     (b)  otherwise—the compensation payer;

written notice specifying the sum of the amounts (if any) that are payable to the Commonwealth under this Act or the Charges Act in respect of the amount of compensation.

             (2)  The notice must also specify, in relation to each kind of eligible benefit that the Commonwealth has paid in respect of any service or care rendered or provided in the course of treatment of, or as a result of, the claimant’s injury, the sum of the amounts (if any) that will be payable to the Commonwealth under this Act or the Charges Act.

whichever period ends later.

             (6)  The Chief Executive Medicare must give a copy of the notice to the compensable person.

             (7)  A notice under section 21 is taken also to be a notice under this section given by the Chief Executive Medicare to the insurer or compensation payer (as the case requires), on a day worked out in accordance with subsection (8), if:

                     (a)  the notice under section 21 includes a statement of a kind referred to in subsection 21(8); and

                     (b)  a reimbursement arrangement has been made in relation to the claim.

                     (b)  in any other case—the day on which the reimbursement arrangement is made.

##### <a id="26"></a>26  Offences

             (1)  A person must not refuse or fail to comply with a requirement of section 13 or 23 that the person give a notice to the Chief Executive Medicare under that section.

                    Penalty:  Imprisonment for 6 months.

          (1A)  Subsection (1) does not apply if the person has a reasonable excuse.

Note:          The defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in subsection (1A). See subsection 13.3(3) of the _Criminal Code_.

          (1B)  An offence under subsection (1) is an offence of strict liability.

Note:          For strict liability, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

             (3)  For the purposes of subsection (1A), a person is not taken to have reasonable excuse for refusing or failing to comply with a requirement of section 13 or 23 to give a notice to the Chief Executive Medicare only because:

                     (a)  the information required to be contained in the notice is, or could be, subject to a claim of privilege that would prevent the information being given in evidence in proceedings before a court or tribunal; or

                     (b)  the person is under a contractual obligation that prevents the person giving the information required to be contained in the notice; or

                     (c)  an order of a court or tribunal prevents the person giving the information required to be contained in the notice; or

                     (d)  an Australian law prevents the person giving the information required to be contained in the notice.

             (4)  Without limiting subsection (3), a person is not excused from giving a notice under section 13 or 23 on the ground that the information required to be contained in the notice may tend to incriminate the person.

             (5)  In any criminal proceeding:

                     (a)  evidence of any information given under section 13 or 23; and

                     (b)  evidence of any information, document or thing obtained as a direct or indirect result of the person having given the information;

cannot be used against the person. However, this subsection does not apply to a proceeding for an offence against subsection (1) of this section, or an offence against section 137.1 of the _Criminal Code_ that relates to whichever of the sections mentioned in paragraph (a) of this subsection is relevant.

             (6)  If:

                     (a)  a person gives a notice to the Chief Executive Medicare under section 13 or 23; and

                     (b)  in so doing, the person would, apart from this section, contravene an Australian law;

the person is taken not to have contravened that law by giving the notice.

### Division 2—Payments to the Commonwealth in respect of amounts of compensation

_Note:       The obligations under this Division will not apply in circumstances covered by Division 3._

##### <a id="27"></a>27  Limit on total amount payable in respect of amounts of compensation

             (1)  Despite any other provision of this Act, and despite the Charges Act, if the sum of all the amounts that are payable under this Act or the Charges Act in respect of the amount of compensation fixed by a judgment or settlement would, apart from this section, exceed the difference between:

                     (a)  the amount of compensation fixed by the judgment or settlement; and

                     (b)  the sum of the amounts (if any) payable under Part 3.14 of the _Social Security Act 1991_ in respect of the amount of compensation;

the sum of all the amounts that are payable under this Act or the Charges Act in respect of the amount of compensation is taken, for all purposes, to be the amount of the difference.

             (2)  For the avoidance of doubt, if there are no amounts of a kind referred to in paragraph (1)(b) payable in respect of the amount of compensation, the amount of the difference referred to in subsection (1) is taken to be the amount of compensation.

##### <a id="28"></a>28  Payments to the Commonwealth

             (1)  If the Chief Executive Medicare gives to a compensation payer a notice under section 24 or 25, the compensation payer must pay to the Commonwealth the amount specified in the notice within 28 days after the day on which the notice was given.

             (2)  If the Chief Executive Medicare gives to an insurer a notice under section 24 or 25, the insurer must pay to the Commonwealth the amount specified in the notice within 28 days after the day on which the notice was given.

                    Penalty:  Imprisonment for 12 months.

Note:          Under subsection 4D(1) of the _Crimes Act 1914_, these penalties are only maximum penalties for the offences. Subsection 4B(2) of that Act allows a court to impose an appropriate fine instead of, or in addition to, a term of imprisonment. If a body corporate is convicted of one of these offences, subsection 4B(3) of that Act allows a court to impose a fine of an amount not greater than 5 times the maximum fine that the court could impose on an individual convicted of the same offence.

##### <a id="29"></a>29  Recovery of amounts payable to the Commonwealth

             (1)  An amount that is payable to the Commonwealth under this Act or the Charges Act in respect of an amount of compensation is recoverable as a debt due to the Commonwealth.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  the amount is included in the amount specified in a notice under section 24 or 25; and

                     (b)  the compensation payer or insurer to whom the notice was given fails to comply with section 28 in relation to the notice;

the amount so included is recoverable from the compensation payer or insurer to whom the notice was given.

             (3)  If the amount is payable in respect of an amount of compensation fixed by a judgment or settlement in relation to which there has been a failure to comply with section 23, the amount is recoverable from the compensation payer or insurer who failed so to comply.

             (4)  If the amount is payable in respect of an amount of compensation payable under a reimbursement arrangement in relation to which there has been a failure to comply with section 13, the amount is recoverable from the person who failed to comply with that section.

             (5)  A person’s liability to pay to the Commonwealth under subsection (3) or (4) amounts owing to the Commonwealth in respect of an amount of compensation is not affected by any payment of compensation by the person in relation to the claim for compensation.

             (6)  If the amount is payable in respect of an amount of compensation fixed by a settlement in relation to which there has been a failure to comply with section 22, the amount is recoverable from the notifiable person in relation to the claim for compensation.

             (7)  A person’s liability to pay to the Commonwealth under subsection (6) amounts owing to the Commonwealth in respect of an amount of compensation:

                     (a)  is not affected by any payment of compensation by the person in relation to the claim for compensation; and

                     (b)  does not affect the amount of compensation that the person is liable to pay; and

                     (c)  does not give rise to any right of recovery in respect of any payments of the compensation that the person has made.

##### <a id="30"></a>30  Notice of charge suspends liability to pay compensation etc.

             (1)  If an amount is recoverable under section 28 from a compensation payer in respect of an amount of compensation, the compensation payer is not liable to pay to the compensable person any amount of the compensation until the amount is paid to the Commonwealth, or until the end of the 28 day period for complying with section 28, whichever happens first.

             (2)  If an amount is recoverable under section 28 from an insurer in respect of an amount of compensation:

                     (a)  the insurer is not liable to indemnify the compensation payer in respect of the compensation payer’s liability to pay to the compensable person any amount of the compensation; and

                     (b)  the compensation payer is not liable to pay to the compensable person any amount of the compensation;

until the amount is paid to the Commonwealth, or until the end of the 28 day period for complying with section 28, whichever happens first.

##### <a id="31"></a>31  Payment to the Commonwealth discharges liability

             (1)  Payment of an amount that a compensation payer is liable to pay to the Commonwealth under section 28 or subsection 29(3) or (4) operates, to the extent of the payment, as a discharge of:

                     (a)  the compensation payer’s liability to the compensable person in respect of the amount of compensation; and

                     (b)  the compensable person’s liability to pay to the Commonwealth amounts payable under this Act or the Charges Act in respect of the amount of compensation.

             (2)  Payment of the amount that an insurer is liable to pay to the Commonwealth under section 28 or subsection 29(3) or (4) operates, to the extent of the payment, as a discharge of:

                     (b)  the compensation payer’s liability to the compensable person in respect of the amount of compensation; and

                     (c)  the compensable person’s liability under this Act or the Charges Act to pay to the Commonwealth amounts payable under this Act in respect of the amount of compensation.

             (3)  A reference in this section to payment of an amount is a reference to payment by any person, other than the compensable person or a person acting on the compensable person’s behalf.

##### <a id="32"></a>32  Offence to make payment before discharging liability to the Commonwealth

             (1)  If a judgment or settlement has been made in respect of an amount of compensation, a compensation payer or insurer must not pay to the compensable person any part of the compensation before the Chief Executive Medicare has issued a notice under section 24 unless:

                     (a)  the time within which the Chief Executive Medicare must issue such a notice has expired; and

                     (b)  if the Chief Executive Medicare had given a notice under section 21, in respect of the claim for compensation, during the 6 months preceding the the day on which an amount of compensation was fixed under the judgment or settlement—the insurer or compensation payer withholds from the compensable person an amount of compensation equal to the amount set out in the notice under paragraph 21(2)(b).

                    Penalty:  Imprisonment for 12 months.

          (1A)  Subsection (1) does not apply if the compensation payer or insurer makes an advance payment in respect of the compensation.

             (2)  If a compensation payer is liable under section 28 to pay an amount to the Commonwealth in respect of an amount of compensation, the compensation payer must not pay to the compensable person any part of the compensation unless:

                     (a)  the Commonwealth has been paid the amount specified in the notice referred to in that section (whether or not it is paid by the compensation payer); or

                     (b)  the 28 day period for complying with that section has expired, and a part of the amount of compensation equal to the amount specified in the notice has been withheld from the compensable person.

                    Penalty:  Imprisonment for 12 months.

             (3)  If the compensation payer is a member of a body that is a representative organisation in relation to the claim for compensation that gave rise to the amount of compensation becoming payable:

                     (a)  the representative organisation; and

                     (b)  any insurers of the representative organisation;

are subject to the same obligations under subsections (1) and (2) as the compensation payer.

             (4)  If an insurer is liable under section 28 to pay an amount to the Commonwealth in respect of an amount of compensation, the insurer must not pay to the compensable person any part of the compensation unless:

                     (a)  the Commonwealth has been paid the amount specified in the notice referred to in that section (whether or not it is paid by the insurer); or

                     (b)  the 28 day period for complying with that section has expired, and a part of the amount of compensation equal to the amount specified in the notice has been withheld from the compensable person.

                    Penalty:  Imprisonment for 12 months.

Note:          Under subsection 4D(1) of the _Crimes Act 1914_, these penalties are only maximum penalties for the offences. Subsection 4B(2) of that Act allows a court to impose an appropriate fine instead of, or in addition to, a term of imprisonment. If a body corporate is convicted of one of these offences, subsection 4B(3) of that Act allows a court to impose a fine of an amount not greater than 5 times the maximum fine that the court could impose on an individual convicted of the same offence.

             (5)  A compensation payer’s or insurer’s liability to pay to the Commonwealth amounts owing to the Commonwealth in respect of the amount of compensation is not affected by:

                     (a)  payment of an amount of compensation prior to the making of a judgment, settlement or reimbursement arrangement in respect of the claim for compensation; or

                     (b)  payment of an amount of compensation in contravention of this section.

             (6)  If a compensable person receives from a compensation payer or insurer a payment of an amount of compensation in contravention of this section, the compensation payer or insurer is not entitled to recover the amount from the compensable person.

##### <a id="33"></a>33  Interest not payable on amount withheld

                   If:

                     (a)  a judgment or settlement has been made in respect of an amount of compensation; and

                     (b)  a compensation payer or insurer has paid to the compensable person a part of the compensation, but withheld an amount referred to in paragraph 32(1)(b); and

                     (c)  an Australian law would, apart from this section, make the compensation payer or insurer liable to pay interest on the sum withheld, because the sum is withheld after the judgment or settlement has been made;

despite that law, the compensation payer or insurer is not liable to pay that interest.

             (3)  The notice must be given to the compensable person:

                     (b)  if the judgment or settlement was made before that commencement—before the advance payment in question is made and, in any case, within 28 days after that commencement.

##### <a id="33B"></a>33B  Advance payments

             (1)  A compensation payer or insurer may make an advance payment to the Commonwealth in respect of the compensation payable under a judgment or settlement if:

##### <a id="33C"></a>33C  Notice of past benefits

             (1)  If a compensation payer or insurer makes an advance payment, the Chief Executive Medicare must give to the compensable person a written notice setting out the total amount of eligible benefits paid by the Commonwealth in respect of services and care rendered or provided in the course of treatment of, or as a result of, the compensable person’s injury.

             (2)  The notice must not, in relation to the period covered by a statement given under section 18, take account of any eligible benefits that were paid in respect of services or care not specified in:

                     (a)  that statement; or

                     (b)  that statement as amended under section 23B.

##### <a id="33D"></a>33D  Time within which notice of past benefits must be given

             (1)  Subject to subsections (2) and (3), the notice under section 33C must be given within 3 months after:

                     (a)  the Chief Executive Medicare receives notice under section 23 indicating that the compensation payer or insurer intends to make an advance payment; or

                     (b)  the advance payment is made;

whichever is the later.

             (2)  If the Chief Executive Medicare gives a notice under subsection 23B(1) to the compensable person, the notice under section 33C need not be given until:

                     (a)  the end of the 3 month period referred to in subsection (1); or

                     (b)  the end of the period of 28 days after the Chief Executive Medicare accepts an amended statement under section 23B as being substantially correct;

whichever is the later.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  the Chief Executive Medicare has not given a notice under subsection 23B(1) to the compensable person; and

                     (b)  the period for giving a statement under section 18 has been extended under subsection 18(3); and

                     (c)  the date of expiry of the period of the extension is after the end of the 3 month period referred to in subsection (1);

the notice under section 33C must be given within 28 days after that date of expiry.

##### <a id="33H"></a>33H  Refunds from advance payments

             (1)  If the amount specified in the notice under section 33C is less than the amount of the advance payment, the difference is payable by the Commonwealth to the compensable person.

             (2)  The difference is payable on the last day on which the Chief Executive Medicare is required under section 33D to give the notice to the compensable person.

             (3)  An amount payable under this section is recoverable as a debt due to the compensable person.

##### <a id="33J"></a>33J  Additional payments to the Commonwealth

             (1)  If the amount specified in the notice under section 33C is greater than the amount of the advance payment, the difference is payable by the compensable person to the Commonwealth.

             (2)  The difference is payable 28 days after the day on which the notice was given to the compensable person.

             (3)  The notice must specify:

                     (a)  the amount that is payable to the Commonwealth; and

                     (b)  the day by which it must be paid.

             (4)  An amount payable under this section is recoverable as a debt due to the Commonwealth.

##### <a id="33K"></a>33K  Payment of the whole of the advance payment

             (1)  If the Chief Executive Medicare does not give a notice under section 33C to the compensable person on or before the day on which the Chief Executive Medicare is required to do so, the whole of the advance payment is payable by the Commonwealth to the compensable person on that day.

             (2)  The payment of the whole of the advance payment operates as a discharge of the compensable person’s liability to pay to the Commonwealth amounts payable under this Act or the Charges Act in respect of the compensation payable under the judgment or settlement in question.

##### <a id="33L"></a>33L  Advance payments to the Commonwealth discharge liability

                   The making of an advance payment by a compensation payer or insurer to the Commonwealth of the amount of compensation payable under a judgment or settlement operates, to the extent of the payment, as a discharge of:

                     (a)  the compensation payer’s or insurer’s liability to the compensable person in respect of the amount of compensation; and

                     (b)  the compensable person’s liability to pay to the Commonwealth amounts payable under this Act or the Charges Act in respect of the amount of compensation.

##### <a id="33M"></a>33M  Interest not payable on advance payments

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a compensation payer or insurer makes an advance payment to the Commonwealth of the amount of compensation payable under a judgment or settlement; and

                     (b)  an Australian law would, apart from this section, make the Commonwealth liable to pay interest on the advance payment, because the advance payment has been retained by the Commonwealth after the judgment or settlement has been made;

despite that law, the Commonwealth is not liable to pay that interest.

             (2)  If the Commonwealth is required to make a payment under section 33H or 33K, subsection (1) does not apply after the expiry of the period within which the payment must be made.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  a compensation payer or insurer makes an advance payment to the Commonwealth of the amount of compensation payable under a judgment or settlement; and

                     (b)  an Australian law would, apart from this section, make the compensation payer or insurer liable to pay interest on the advance payment, because the advance payment has not been paid to the compensable person after the judgment or settlement has been made;

despite that law, the compensation payer or insurer is not liable to pay that interest.

for the purposes of provisions of a kind referred to in paragraph (1)(b).

             (3)  Without limiting subsection (2), the determination may require the giving of information about settlements, judgments and reimbursement arrangements in relation to injuries that occur within the period to which the contract is expressed to apply, including:

                     (a)  in the case of a settlement—the full names of all the parties to the settlement; and

                     (b)  in the case of a judgment or reimbursement arrangement—the full names of all the parties to whom the judgment or reimbursement arrangement relates; and

                     (c)  the date of the settlement, judgment or reimbursement arrangement; and

                     (d)  in the case of a judgment or settlement—the amount of compensation to be paid under the judgment or settlement.

             (4)  Determinations under subsection (2) are disallowable instruments for the purposes of section 46A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.
