             (6)  Subsection (5) does not operate, and is taken for the purposes of this Act and the Charges Act never to have operated, in relation to professional services specified in a notice under subsection 17(2) if the Managing Director gives the claimant a notice under subsection (7).

                     (a)  apart from subsection (6), subsection (5) would operate so that all the services specified in a notice under subsection 17(2) would be taken for the purposes of this Act and the Charges Act to have been rendered in the course of treatment of, or as a result of, the injury the claimant claims to have suffered; and

             (8)  To avoid doubt, if:

                     (b)  a person paid that amount to the Commonwealth in relation to the claim; and

                     (c)  the Managing Director gave the claimant a notice under subsection (7); and

                     (d)  because of subsection (6), the amount paid exceeds the amount properly payable under this Act;

the amount of the excess is payable by the Commonwealth to the person.

             (9)  The Consolidated Revenue Fund is appropriated for the purposes of payments by the Commonwealth under subsection (8).

           (10)  Application may be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of a decision by the Managing Director to refuse to give a notice under subsection (7).

                     (c)  if the decision under reconsideration was a decision granting an extension—affirm the decision or vary the decision by granting a longer period; and

                     (d)  give to the claimant a notice stating the Managing Director’s decision on the reconsideration together with a statement of his or her reasons for the decision on the reconsideration.

             (4)  The Managing Director’s decision on reconsideration of the decision has effect as if it had been made under subsection 18(3).

##### <a id="20"></a>20  Effect of date of hearing on period for giving statement

                   If a court or compensation authority sets a date for the hearing to determine the claim for compensation:

                     (a)  an extension under section 18 or 19 must not be granted after the day on which the date for the hearing was set; and

                              (i)  was granted before the date for the hearing was set; and

                             (ii)  would, apart from this section, have extended the period in question beyond 28 days after the day on which the date for the hearing was set, or beyond the date set for the hearing;

                    Penalty:  Imprisonment for 6 months.

          (1A)  Subsection (1) does not apply if the person has a reasonable excuse.

Note:          The defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in subsection (1A). See subsection 13.3(3) of the _Criminal Code_.

          (1B)  An offence under subsection (1) is an offence of strict liability.

Note:          For strict liability, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

             (3)  For the purposes of subsection (1A), a person is not taken to have reasonable excuse for refusing or failing to comply with a requirement of section 13 or 23 to give a notice to the Commission only because:

                     (a)  the information required to be contained in the notice is, or could be, subject to a claim of privilege that would prevent the information being given in evidence in proceedings before a court or tribunal; or

                     (b)  the person is under a contractual obligation that prevents the person giving the information required to be contained in the notice; or

                     (c)  an order of a court or tribunal prevents the person giving the information required to be contained in the notice; or

                     (d)  an Australian law prevents the person giving the information required to be contained in the notice.

             (4)  Without limiting subsection (3), a person is not excused from giving a notice under section 13 or 23 on the ground that the information required to be contained in the notice may tend to incriminate the person.

             (5)  In any criminal proceeding:

                     (a)  evidence of any information given under section 13 or 23; and

                     (b)  evidence of any information, document or thing obtained as a direct or indirect result of the person having given the information;

cannot be used against the person. However, this subsection does not apply to a proceeding for an offence against subsection (1) of this section, or an offence against section 137.1 of the _Criminal Code_ that relates to whichever of the sections mentioned in paragraph (a) of this subsection is relevant.

             (6)  If:

                     (a)  a person gives a notice to the Commission under section 13 or 23; and

                     (b)  in so doing, the person would, apart from this section, contravene an Australian law;

the person is taken not to have contravened that law by giving the notice.

##### <a id="27"></a>27  Limit on total amount payable in respect of amounts of compensation

             (1)  Despite any other provision of this Act, and despite the Charges Act, if the sum of all the amounts that are payable under this Act or the Charges Act in respect of the amount of compensation fixed by a judgment or settlement would, apart from this section, exceed the difference between:

                     (a)  the amount of compensation fixed by the judgment or settlement; and

                     (b)  the sum of the amounts (if any) payable under Part 3.14 of the _Social Security Act 1991_ in respect of the amount of compensation;

the sum of all the amounts that are payable under this Act or the Charges Act in respect of the amount of compensation is taken, for all purposes, to be the amount of the difference.

             (2)  For the avoidance of doubt, if there are no amounts of a kind referred to in paragraph (1)(b) payable in respect of the amount of compensation, the amount of the difference referred to in subsection (1) is taken to be the amount of compensation.

##### <a id="28"></a>28  Payments to the Commonwealth

             (1)  If the Managing Director gives to a compensation payer a notice under section 24 or 25, the compensation payer must pay to the Commonwealth the amount specified in the notice within 28 days after the day on which the notice was given.

                    Penalty:  Imprisonment for 12 months.

Note:          Under subsection 4D(1) of the _Crimes Act 1914_, these penalties are only maximum penalties for the offences. Subsection 4B(2) of that Act allows a court to impose an appropriate fine instead of, or in addition to, a term of imprisonment. If a body corporate is convicted of one of these offences, subsection 4B(3) of that Act allows a court to impose a fine of an amount not greater than 5 times the maximum fine that the court could impose on an individual convicted of the same offence.

             (5)  A person’s liability to pay to the Commonwealth under subsection (3) or (4) amounts owing to the Commonwealth in respect of an amount of compensation is not affected by any payment of compensation by the person in relation to the claim for compensation.

             (7)  A person’s liability to pay to the Commonwealth under subsection (6) amounts owing to the Commonwealth in respect of an amount of compensation:

                     (a)  is not affected by any payment of compensation by the person in relation to the claim for compensation; and

                     (b)  does not affect the amount of compensation that the person is liable to pay; and

##### <a id="31"></a>31  Payment to the Commonwealth discharges liability

             (1)  Payment of an amount that a compensation payer is liable to pay to the Commonwealth under section 28 or subsection 29(3) or (4) operates, to the extent of the payment, as a discharge of:

##### <a id="32"></a>32  Offence to make payment before discharging liability to the Commonwealth

             (1)  If a judgment or settlement has been made in respect of an amount of compensation, a compensation payer or insurer must not pay to the compensable person any part of the compensation before the Managing Director has issued a notice under section 24 unless:

                     (a)  the time within which the Managing Director must issue such a notice has expired; and

                     (b)  if the Managing Director had given a notice under section 21, in respect of the claim for compensation, during the 6 months preceding the the day on which an amount of compensation was fixed under the judgment or settlement—the insurer or compensation payer withholds from the compensable person an amount of compensation equal to the amount set out in the notice under paragraph 21(2)(b).

                    Penalty:  Imprisonment for 12 months.

          (1A)  Subsection (1) does not apply if the compensation payer or insurer makes an advance payment in respect of the compensation.

             (2)  If a compensation payer is liable under section 28 to pay an amount to the Commonwealth in respect of an amount of compensation, the compensation payer must not pay to the compensable person any part of the compensation unless:

                     (a)  the Commonwealth has been paid the amount specified in the notice referred to in that section (whether or not it is paid by the compensation payer); or

                     (b)  the 28 day period for complying with that section has expired, and a part of the amount of compensation equal to the amount specified in the notice has been withheld from the compensable person.

                    Penalty:  Imprisonment for 12 months.

             (3)  If the compensation payer is a member of a body that is a representative organisation in relation to the claim for compensation that gave rise to the amount of compensation becoming payable:

                     (a)  the representative organisation; and

                     (b)  any insurers of the representative organisation;

are subject to the same obligations under subsections (1) and (2) as the compensation payer.

             (4)  If an insurer is liable under section 28 to pay an amount to the Commonwealth in respect of an amount of compensation, the insurer must not pay to the compensable person any part of the compensation unless:

                     (a)  the Commonwealth has been paid the amount specified in the notice referred to in that section (whether or not it is paid by the insurer); or

                     (b)  the 28 day period for complying with that section has expired, and a part of the amount of compensation equal to the amount specified in the notice has been withheld from the compensable person.

                    Penalty:  Imprisonment for 12 months.

Note:          Under subsection 4D(1) of the _Crimes Act 1914_, these penalties are only maximum penalties for the offences. Subsection 4B(2) of that Act allows a court to impose an appropriate fine instead of, or in addition to, a term of imprisonment. If a body corporate is convicted of one of these offences, subsection 4B(3) of that Act allows a court to impose a fine of an amount not greater than 5 times the maximum fine that the court could impose on an individual convicted of the same offence.

             (5)  A compensation payer’s or insurer’s liability to pay to the Commonwealth amounts owing to the Commonwealth in respect of the amount of compensation is not affected by:

                     (a)  payment of an amount of compensation prior to the making of a judgment, settlement or reimbursement arrangement in respect of the claim for compensation; or

                     (b)  payment of an amount of compensation in contravention of this section.

             (6)  If a compensable person receives from a compensation payer or insurer a payment of an amount of compensation in contravention of this section, the compensation payer or insurer is not entitled to recover the amount from the compensable person.

##### <a id="33"></a>33  Interest not payable on amount withheld

                   If:

                     (a)  a judgment or settlement has been made in respect of an amount of compensation; and

                     (b)  a compensation payer or insurer has paid to the compensable person a part of the compensation, but withheld an amount referred to in paragraph 32(1)(b); and

                     (c)  an Australian law would, apart from this section, make the compensation payer or insurer liable to pay interest on the sum withheld, because the sum is withheld after the judgment or settlement has been made;

despite that law, the compensation payer or insurer is not liable to pay that interest.

### Division 2A—Advance payments to the Commonwealth

             (3)  The notice must be given to the compensable person:

             (2)  The notice must not, in relation to the period covered by a statement given under section 18, take account of any eligible benefits that were paid in respect of services or care not specified in:

                     (a)  that statement; or

                     (b)  the advance payment is made;

whichever is the later.

             (2)  If the Managing Director gives a notice under subsection 23B(1) to the compensable person, the notice under section 33C need not be given until:

                     (a)  the end of the 3 month period referred to in subsection (1); or

                     (b)  the end of the period of 28 days after the Managing Director accepts an amended statement under section 23B as being substantially correct;

whichever is the later.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  the Managing Director has not given a notice under subsection 23B(1) to the compensable person; and

                     (b)  the period for giving a statement under section 18 has been extended under subsection 18(3); and

                     (c)  the date of expiry of the period of the extension is after the end of the 3 month period referred to in subsection (1);

the notice under section 33C must be given within 28 days after that date of expiry.

##### <a id="33H"></a>33H  Refunds from advance payments

             (1)  If the amount specified in the notice under section 33C is less than the amount of the advance payment, the difference is payable by the Commonwealth to the compensable person.

             (2)  The difference is payable on the last day on which the Commission is required under section 33D to give the notice to the compensable person.

             (3)  An amount payable under this section is recoverable as a debt due to the compensable person.

##### <a id="33J"></a>33J  Additional payments to the Commonwealth

             (1)  If the amount specified in the notice under section 33C is greater than the amount of the advance payment, the difference is payable by the compensable person to the Commonwealth.

             (2)  The difference is payable 28 days after the day on which the notice was given to the compensable person.

             (3)  The notice must specify:

                     (b)  the day by which it must be paid.

             (4)  An amount payable under this section is recoverable as a debt due to the Commonwealth.

##### <a id="33L"></a>33L  Advance payments to the Commonwealth discharge liability

                   The making of an advance payment by a compensation payer or insurer to the Commonwealth of the amount of compensation payable under a judgment or settlement operates, to the extent of the payment, as a discharge of:

                     (b)  the compensable person’s liability to pay to the Commonwealth amounts payable under this Act or the Charges Act in respect of the amount of compensation.

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a compensation payer or insurer makes an advance payment to the Commonwealth of the amount of compensation payable under a judgment or settlement; and

                     (b)  an Australian law would, apart from this section, make the Commonwealth liable to pay interest on the advance payment, because the advance payment has been retained by the Commonwealth after the judgment or settlement has been made;

despite that law, the Commonwealth is not liable to pay that interest.

             (2)  If the Commonwealth is required to make a payment under section 33H or 33K, subsection (1) does not apply after the expiry of the period within which the payment must be made.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  a compensation payer or insurer makes an advance payment to the Commonwealth of the amount of compensation payable under a judgment or settlement; and

                     (b)  an Australian law would, apart from this section, make the compensation payer or insurer liable to pay interest on the advance payment, because the advance payment has not been paid to the compensable person after the judgment or settlement has been made;

despite that law, the compensation payer or insurer is not liable to pay that interest.

### Division 3—Waiver of the requirements of this Part

                     (a)  an amount of compensation was fixed under the judgment or settlement before the start of the period of the bulk payment agreement; and

                     (b)  the judgment or settlement did not determine all the outstanding liability of the compensation payer in relation to the claim; and

             (5)  This section does not affect the validity of a payment of money pursuant to a notice under section 24 or 25 if the payment occurred before the amount of compensation was fixed under the judgment or settlement referred to in subsection (1).

         The _Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995_ came into operation on 1 February 1996 (_see Gazette_ 1996, No. GN2).

                 (1)   Subject to this section, this Act commences immediately after the commencement of the _Aged Care Act 1997_ (other than Division 1 of that Act).

         The _Aged Care Act 1997_ (other than Division 1 of Chapter 1) commenced on 1 October 1997 (_see Gazette_ 1997, No. GN37).
