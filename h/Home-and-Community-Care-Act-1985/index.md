(b)   such other amounts expended by the State, local governments and community organisations in respect of that first or second grant year (as the case may be) as the Commonwealth Minister and the State Minister agree should be taken into account for the purposes of this paragraph.

15\. (1)   Where a former Commonwealth‑funded project ceases to be provided in the first or second grant year, the State may reduce the State base in that grant year and, if that grant year is the first grant year, in the second grant year by an amount not exceeding the amount of expenditure in relation to the project included in the State base that was incurred otherwise than by the State.

(b)   such other amounts, including additional administrative expenses incurred by the State, as are agreed upon for the purposes of this paragraph by the Commonwealth Minister and the State Minister.

(a)   the eligible State expenditure incurred by the State in respect of the first grant year is less than the amount that would be required to be expended in order to attract the maximum amount of financial assistance payable in respect of that grant year pursuant to paragraph (1)(a), then, if the Commonwealth Minister is satisfied that the State has a firm program in place for the expenditure and that the cause of the short‑fall in expenditure lies generally outside the State’s control, the Commonwealth may provide additional financial assistance in respect of the second grant year of an amount not exceeding the unexpended balance of the maximum amount, upon the same terms as to matching as apply in respect of the first grant year; or

(b)   the whole amount specified in the Schedule as the maximum amount of additional financial assistance that may be paid by the Commonwealth in respect of the first or second grant year to another State or the Northern Territory does not become payable to that State or the Northern Territory, whether pursuant to an agreement made by the Commonwealth with that State or the Northern Territory in terms similar to this agreement or where there is no such agreement, the Commonwealth Minister may, by agreement between the Commonwealth Minister and the State Minister, increase the maximum amount payable to the State in respect of that grant year pursuant to sub‑clause (1) by the amount determined by the Commonwealth Minister to be the State’s share of the unexpended balance of the amount specified in relation to that other State or the Northern Territory.

(8)   When the agreed index in respect of the Commonwealth grant and in respect of the State expenditure may be calculated in respect of the first or second grant year, the provisional Commonwealth grant and the provisional State expenditure shall be considered by the Commonwealth Minister and the State Minister for the purposes of them agreeing, as required by sub‑clause (5), upon the Commonwealth grant and the State expenditure in respect of that grant year.

(9)   Any financial adjustment arising from differences between the provisional Commonwealth grant and the Commonwealth grant, and between the provisional State expenditure and the State expenditure for the first or second grant year shall, except where otherwise agreed between the Commonwealth Minister and the State Minister, be effected in the following grant year.

(10)   For the purposes of determining the Commonwealth grant and the State expenditure in respect of the second grant year there shall be taken into account any adjustments agreed by the Commonwealth Minister and the State Minister in respect of the preceding grant year.

(11)   The provisional Commonwealth grant and the provisional State expenditure shall comprise—

(i)   in respect of the first grant year—an amount ascertained in accordance with the formula (x<sub>1</sub>a<sub>1</sub>) + y<sub>1</sub> + z<sub>1</sub>; or

18\. (1)   Subject to sub‑clause (4), the Commonwealth will provide financial assistance to the State in respect of each grant year following the second grant year of an amount equal to the sum of—

(a)   the amount that is the product of the indexation factor and the amount of financial assistance paid to the State in the immediately preceding grant year; and

(b)   such other amounts as are agreed upon for the purposes of this paragraph by the Commonwealth Minister and the State Minister.

(2)   Subject to sub‑clause (4), the State will provide from its own resources and apply, or cause local governments and community organisations to provide from their own resources and apply, for expenditure in relation to approved projects in respect of each grant year following the second grant year of an amount equal to the sum of—

(3A)  Where a different number is agreed upon in accordance with paragraph (3) (b), that number shall, for the purposes of the operation of paragraphs (1) (a) and (2) (a), be substituted for the number 1.2 in respect of the first‑mentioned grant year.

(4)   In the event that the parties fail to agree on the continued operation of this agreement consequent upon a review conducted in the third or any subsequent grant year (in this sub‑clause referred to as the “relevant grant year”) pursuant to clause 31 then, in respect of each of the following 2 grant years—

(B)     where the grant year is the second succeeding grant year after the relevant grant year—the product of the adjustment factor and the amount calculated in accordance with sub‑sub‑paragraph (4) (b) (i) (A); and

(ii)   such other amounts as are agreed upon for the purposes of this sub‑paragraph by the Commonwealth Minister and the State Minister.

(5)   For the purposes of sub‑paragraphs (4) (a) (i) and (4) (b) (i), the adjustment factor in respect of each of the 2 grant years following the grant year during which the parties fail to agree is a number calculated in accordance with the formula—

(6)   Where the adjustment factor, as ascertained in accordance with sub‑clause (5), would, but for the operation of this sub‑clause, be less than one, that factor shall be taken to be one.

(7)   If the reference base for the Consumer Price Index or hourly award rates of pay index is changed, then, for the purpose of applying the formula referred to in sub‑clause (5) after the change is made, regard shall be had only to the index number provided in terms of the new reference base.

(ii)   details of projects, other than former Commonwealth‑funded projects, in relation to which the Commonwealth incurred expenditure in respect of the financial year beginning on 1 July 1984 and in respect of which the Commonwealth proposes to seek approval under sub‑clause 9 (1).

21.  Within 3 months of the date this agreement is signed (in respect of the first grant year) and by 1 March preceding the beginning of each succeeding grant year (other than the 2 grant years following a failure to agree as provided in clause 31), the State shall inform the Commonwealth, in a form agreed upon by the Commonwealth Minister and the State Minister, of the amounts of financial assistance that the State wishes the Commonwealth to provide to it in respect of the next 3 succeeding grant years and at the same time provide estimates of financial performance and planned programs for those grant years and revised estimates of that performance and those programs for the then current grant year.

22.  (1)        Subject to sub‑clauses (2) and (3), the Commonwealth Minister and the State Minister shall, in respect of each grant year, jointly approve, in accordance with the objective, principles and goals set out in clause 5, the allocation among approved projects of the total amount of financial assistance to be provided by the Commonwealth and the total amount of expenditure to be incurred by the State in respect of that grant year.

(2)   The Commonwealth Minister and the State Minister may, in accordance with the objective, principles and goals set out in clause 5, jointly approve the allocation to an approved project of financial assistance to be provided by the Commonwealth and of expenditure to be incurred by the State in respect of two or more grant years.

(3)   The State Minister may approve non‑significant increases or decreases in the allocation of funds in respect of an approved project during the period in respect of which an allocation has been approved.

23.  Financial assistance in respect of a grant year is to be provided by regular quarterly instalments unless otherwise agreed between the Commonwealth Minister and the State Minister, such instalments to be calculated in respect of the first and second grant years on the basis of the provisional Commonwealth grant in respect of the grant year, ascertained in accordance with clause 17.

24\. (1)   Subject to sub‑clause (2), the Commonwealth Minister may, at such times and in such amounts as the Commonwealth Minister thinks fit, make advances on account of financial assistance that may become payable to the State under this agreement.

(2)   Where in respect of a grant year the State makes advances from its own resources for the purpose of meeting or reimbursing expenditure for approved projects, the Commonwealth will make advances of the same amounts as to matching as would apply if the advances by the State were expenditure by the State from its own resources pursuant to clauses 14 and 16 or clause 18 (as the case may be) and the advances by the Commonwealth were financial assistance pursuant to clauses 13 and 16 or clause 18 (as the case may be) in respect of that grant year.

(3)   The amount or part of the amount of an advance made by the Commonwealth may be deducted from a payment of financial assistance that subsequently becomes payable.

(4)   The State shall ensure that an advance made by the Commonwealth is not used or applied except for the purpose of meeting or reimbursing, as the case may be, the expenditure to which the advance relates.

25.  During the first 3 grant years the Commonwealth Minister and the State Minister shall jointly develop standard terms and conditions to be attached by the State to payments made pursuant to this agreement to local governments and community organisations, which terms and conditions shall include the manner in which the approved project is to be provided, so as to ensure that the approved project meets its objective.

(d)   expend or cause to be expended, in respect of each grant year, not less than the amount calculated in accordance with clause 14 or clause 18 (as the case may be);

“the Commonwealth’s share” means the amount that bears to the value of the property the same proportion as the amount expended in relation to the acquisition of the property attributable to financial assistance bears to the total cost of acquiring the property.

27.  By the thirtieth day of November next occurring after the end of each grant year the State Minister will furnish to the Commonwealth Minister in respect of that grant year, in a form agreed upon by the Commonwealth Minister and the State Minister—

(a)   a statement giving particulars of the expenditure of financial assistance and of expenditure incurred by the State, local governments and community organisations, accompanied by a certificate of a person authorised by the State Minister and agreed upon by the Commonwealth Minister, certifying that—

29.  If, following consultation with the State Minister, the Commonwealth Minister is of the opinion that it is appropriate to do so, the Commonwealth Minister may withhold payment in whole or in part of financial assistance to the State where the State fails to comply with any of the conditions attached to the grant of financial assistance until the State remedies that failure.

31.  The operation of this agreement may be reviewed at any time (other than during the first 2 grant years) agreed upon by the Commonwealth Minister and the State Minister but, in any event, it shall be reviewed during every third grant year. If, upon undertaking a review, the parties agree to vary the operation of the agreement, then the agreement may be varied in the manner provided in clause 32, but should the parties fail to agree on the continued operation of this agreement then this agreement shall terminate at the end of the second succeeding grant year.

32\. (1)   The provisions of this agreement may be varied at any time by a further agreement in writing.
