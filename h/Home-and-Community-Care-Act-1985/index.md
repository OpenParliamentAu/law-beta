Subject to clauses 15 and 19, the State will provide from its own<lf> resources and apply, or cause local governments and community organisations to<lf> provide from their own resources and to apply, for expenditure in relation to<lf> approved projects in respect of the first and second grant years an amount<lf> equal to the sum of-<lf>   (a)  amounts expended in respect of the base year-<lf>         (i)  by the State, local governments and community<lf> organisations in relation to the provision of former Commonwealth-funded projects; and<lf>         (ii)  by the State and, to the extent determined by the<lf> State, local governments and community organisations in relation to the provision of other projects that, by the commencement of that first or second grant year (as the case may be), become approved projects,<lf> adjusted in accordance with clause 17; and<lf>   (b)  such other amounts expended by the State, local governments and community organisations in respect of that first or second grant year (as the case may be) as the Commonwealth Minister and the State Minister agree should be taken into account for the purposes of this paragraph.<lf>    15.(1) Where a former Commonwealth-funded project ceases to be provided in<lf> the first or second grant year, the State may reduce the State base in that<lf> grant year and, if that grant year is the first grant year, in the second grant<lf> year by an amount not exceeding the amount of expenditure in relation to the<lf> project included in the State base that was incurred otherwise than by the<lf> State.<lf>    (2) Where, pursuant to sub-clause (1) the State reduces the State base, the<lf> Commonwealth may reduce the Commonwealth base by an amount not exceeding the<lf> amount of any matching funds provided by the Commonwealth in respect of the<lf> expenditure referred to in sub-clause (1).<lf>    (3) Where, pursuant to sub-paragraph 14 (a) (ii) the State elects to include<lf> expenditure incurred by local governments and community organisations in<lf> relation to a particular project then the expenditure for the purpose of that<lf> sub-paragraph in relation to that project shall be the amounts expended in<lf> respect of that project in respect of the base year by the State, local<lf> governments and community organisations adjusted in accordance with clause 17.<lf>    16.(1) The Commonwealth will provide, in addition to base financial<lf> assistance pursuant to clause 13, the following financial assistance-<lf>   (a)  in respect of the first grant year-$3 for every $1 of eligible<lf> State expenditure incurred by the State in respect of the grant<lf> year, up to the maximum amount specified in relation to the State<lf> for that grant year in the Schedule or such other amount as may be<lf> paid by virtue of the operation of paragraph 3 (b); or<lf>   (b)  in respect of the second grant year-<lf>         (i)  $2 for every $1 of eligible State expenditure incurred<lf> by the State in respect of the grant year, up to the maximum<lf> amount specified in relation to the State for that grant year in the Schedule<lf> or such other amount as may be paid by virtue of the operation of paragraph 3<lf> (b); and<lf>         (ii)  an amount that may be paid in respect of that grant<lf> year by virtue of the operation of paragraph 3 (a).<lf>    (2) A reference in sub-clause (1) to the eligible State expenditure incurred<lf> by the State in respect of a grant year shall be read as a reference to an<lf> amount equal to the sum of-<lf>   (a)  the amount expended in respect of the grant year by-<lf>         (i)   the State from its resources in relation to the<lf> provision of approved projects;<lf>         (ii)  local governments and community organisations from<lf> their own resources in relation to the provision of former<lf> Commonwealth-funded projects; and<lf>         (iii) local governments and community organisations in<lf> relation to the provision of approved projects referred to in<lf> sub-paragraph 14 (a) (ii) where the State elects to include such expenditure<lf> pursuant to that sub-paragraph,<lf> in excess of the amount that is so expended pursuant to clause 14; and<lf>   (b)  such other amounts, including additional administrative<lf> expenses incurred by the State, as are agreed upon for the purposes<lf> of this paragraph by the Commonwealth Minister and the State Minister.<lf>    (3) In the event that-<lf>   (a)  the eligible State expenditure incurred by the State in<lf> respect of the first grant year is less than the amount that would<lf> be required to be expended in order to attract the maximum amount<lf> of financial assistance payable in respect of that grant year<lf> pursuant to paragraph (1) (a), then, if the Commonwealth Minister<lf> is satisfied that the State has a firm program in place for the<lf> expenditure and that the cause of the short-fall in expenditure<lf> lies generally outside the State's control, the Commonwealth may<lf> provide additional financial assistance in respect of the second<lf> grant year of an amount not exceeding the unexpended balance of the<lf> maximum amount, upon the same terms as to matching as apply in<lf> respect of the first grant year; or<lf>   (b)  the whole amount specified in the Schedule as the maximum<lf> amount of additional financial assistance that may be paid by the<lf> Commonwealth in respect of the first or second grant year to<lf> another State or the Northern Territory does not become payable to<lf> that State or the Northern Territory, whether pursuant to an<lf> agreement made by the Commonwealth with that State or the Northern<lf> Territory in terms similar to this agreement or where there is no<lf> such agreement, the Commonwealth Minister may, by agreement between<lf> the Commonwealth Minister and the State Minister, increase the<lf> maximum amount payable to the State in respect of that grant year<lf> pursuant to sub-clause (1) by the amount determined by the<lf> Commonwealth Minister to be the State's share of the unexpended<lf> balance of the amount specified in relation to that other State or<lf> the Northern Territory.<lf>    17.(1) In this clause-<lf>  "Commonwealth grant" means the Commonwealth grant referred to in sub-clause<lf> (5);<lf>  "provisional Commonwealth grant" means the provisional Commonwealth grant<lf> referred to in sub-clause (6);<lf>  "provisional State expenditure" means the provisional State expenditure<lf> referred to in sub-clause (6);<lf>  "State expenditure" means the State expenditure referred to in sub-clause (5);<lf>  "agreed index in respect of the provisional Commonwealth grant" and "agreed<lf> index in respect of the provisional State expenditure" means for the first or<lf> second grant year the figure ascertained in accordance with the formula-<lf>           0.75 (E) + 0.25 (G)<lf>                (F)        (H)<lf> where-<lf>   (a) E......is the estimate agreed between the Commonwealth<lf>       F<lf> Minister and the State Minister of the movement between the month<lf> of March of the grant year and the month of March of the preceding<lf> financial year in the index of weekly award rates of pay for adult<lf> wage and salary earners for all industries in Australia;

During the first 3 grant years the Commonwealth Minister and the State<lf> Minister shall jointly develop standard terms and conditions to be attached by<lf> the State to payments made pursuant to this agreement to local governments and<lf> community organisations, which terms and conditions shall include the manner in<lf> which the approved project is to be provided, so as to ensure that the approved<lf> project meets its objective.<lf>    26.(1) Financial assistance is granted upon the condition that the State<lf> will-<lf>   (a)  apply the financial assistance provided to it for the purpose<lf> of meeting or reimbursing expenditure incurred by the State in<lf> relation to the provision of approved projects in accordance with<lf> this agreement;<lf>   (b)  subject to paragraph (c), without undue delay pay to the local<lf> government or community organisation that is providing or<lf> sponsoring an approved project an amount equal to the amount of<lf> financial assistance provided to the State for expenditure in<lf> respect of that approved project;<lf>   (c)  not pay an amount to a local government or a community<lf> organisation unless the local government or community organisation<lf> accepts the amount upon the terms and conditions developed pursuant<lf> to clause 25 or (if no terms and conditions have been developed)<lf> upon the terms and conditions attached to the provision of<lf> financial assistance under this agreement;<lf>   (d)  expend or cause to be expended, in respect of each grant year,<lf> not less than the amount calculated in accordance with clause 14 or<lf> clause 18 (as the case may be);<lf>   (e)  not permit its expenditure under this agreement, vis-a-vis<lf> local governments and community organisations, to diminish unless<lf> otherwise agreed by the Commonwealth Minister and the State<lf> Minister; and<lf>   (f)  pay to the Commonwealth an amount that becomes payable<lf> pursuant to sub-clause (2).<lf>    (2) In the event that property of a non-expendable nature that was acquired<lf> by the State, a local government or a community organisation wholly or partly<lf> with financial assistance provided in respect of an approved project-<lf>   (a)  is disposed of;<lf>   (b)  ceases to be used in relation to the approved project or<lf> another approved project; or<lf>   (c)  is destroyed,<lf> the State shall pay to the Commonwealth the Commonwealth's share of the value of the property at the date of the happening of the event unless the Commonwealth Minister and the State Minister otherwise agree or unless, in the case where the property was acquired by a local government or community organisation, the State is unable to recover that share from the local government or community organisation.<lf>    (3) For the purpose of sub-clause (2)-<lf>  "the value of the property" means the amount agreed upon by the Commonwealth<lf> and the State or, in the absence of agreement the amount determined by a<lf> qualified valuer nominated by the Commonwealth Minister, as the value of the<lf> property; and<lf>  "the Commonwealth's share" means the amount that bears to the value of the<lf> property the same proportion as the amount expended in relation to the<lf> acquisition of the property attributable to financial assistance bears to the<lf> total cost of acquiring the property.<lf>    27\. By the thirtieth day of November next occurring after the end of each<lf> grant year the State Minister will furnish to the Commonwealth Minister in<lf> respect of that grant year, in a form agreed upon by the Commonwealth Minister<lf> and the State Minister-<lf>   (a)  a statement giving particulars of the expenditure of financial<lf> assistance and of expenditure incurred by the State, local<lf> governments and community organisations, accompanied by a<lf> certificate of a person authorised by the State Minister and agreed<lf> upon by the Commonwealth Minister, certifying that-<lf>         (i)  in relation to expenditure incurred by the State, the<lf> authorised person is of the opinion that the amounts shown as<lf> expended by the State were expended in accordance with this<lf> agreement;<lf>         (ii)  in relation to expenditure incurred by local<lf> governments and community organisations, the authorised person<lf> has received a certificate from a qualified accountant stating<lf> that the qualified accountant is of the opinion that amounts<lf> shown as expended by a local government or community<lf> organisation were expended by it in accordance with this<lf> agreement;<lf>   (b)  a statement specifying-<lf>         (i)   the operation of this agreement;<lf>         (ii)  the provision of approved projects; and<lf>         (iii) the manner in which financial assistance and State<lf> expenditure has been applied.<lf>    28\. If, following consultation with the State Minister, the Commonwealth<lf> Minister, in writing under the Commonwealth Minister's hand, informs the State<lf> Minister that the Commonwealth Minister is satisfied that the State has failed<lf> to ensure that an amount of financial assistance provided to the State has been<lf> applied for the purposes and in the manner provided for by this agreement with<lf> respect to that financial assistance, the State will repay the amount or such<lf> part of that amount as the Commonwealth Minister thinks reasonable to the<lf> Commonwealth.<lf>    29\. If, following consultation with the State Minister, the Commonwealth<lf> Minister is of the opinion that it is appropriate to do so, the Commonwealth<lf> Minister may withhold payment in whole or in part of financial assistance to<lf> the State where the State fails to comply with any of the conditions attached<lf> to the grant of financial assistance until the State remedies that failure.<lf>                   PART VII-SUPPLY OF INFORMATION<lf>    30.(1) As soon as practicable after this agreement enters into force, the<lf> Commonwealth Minister and the State Minister shall make arrangements for the<lf> development during the first 3 grant years of a home and community care<lf> information system (including the development of standard definitions of<lf> services and collection methods) for the purpose of effective planning and<lf> management of the program which can meet operating agency requirements.<lf>    (2) Having regard to clauses 10 and 11, the State shall collect and provide<lf> such information as the Commonwealth Minister and the State Minister agree is<lf> necessary for the operation of the information system.<lf>    (3) Pending the establishment of the information system, each party shall<lf> furnish to the other party such available information as the other party from<lf> time to time requires for the purposes of monitoring and reviewing the<lf> operation of the program.<lf>    (4) The Commonwealth Minister may make arrangements with the State Minister<lf> for the Commonwealth to provide assistance to the State in the collection and<lf> provision of information.<lf>    (5) In specifying the Commonwealth requirements for data collection and the<lf> development of an information system, the Commonwealth Minister shall have<lf> regard to the administrative practices and procedures of the State and shall<lf> ensure that collection requirements and provision of data by the State are kept<lf> to a minimum.<lf>    (6) In developing an information system pursuant to sub-clause (1) and in<lf> arranging for the collection and provision of information pursuant to<lf> sub-clause (2), the Commonwealth Minister and the State Minister shall have<lf> regard to the views of local governments and community organisations involved<lf> in service delivery and users in the design and implementation of the system<lf> and ensure that, where appropriate, information so collected is made available<lf> to those bodies.<lf>                   PART VIII-REVIEW AND VARIATION<lf>    31\. The operation of this agreement may be reviewed at any time (other than<lf> during the first 2 grant years) agreed upon by the Commonwealth Minister and<lf> the State Minister but, in any event, it shall be reviewed during every third<lf> grant year. If, upon undertaking a review, the parties agree to vary the<lf> operation of the agreement, then the agreement may be varied in the manner<lf> provided in clause 32, but should the parties fail to agree on the continued<lf> operation of this agreement then this agreement shall terminate at the end of<lf> the second succeeding grant year.<lf>    32.(1) The provisions of this agreement may be varied at any time by a<lf> further agreement in writing.<lf>    (2) A copy of an agreement or copies of the documents which constitute an<lf> agreement under sub-clause (1) shall be tabled in the Parliament of the<lf> Commonwealth within 15 sitting days from the date upon which the agreement is<lf> made.<lf>                PART IX-REPRESENTATION AND COMMUNICATIONS<lf>    33.(1) The Commonwealth shall, subject to sub-clause (2), be represented for<lf> the purposes of this agreement by the Department of Community Services and the<lf> Commonwealth Minister shall notify the State Minister of the address of that<lf> Department and of any change at any time of that address.<lf>    (2) In the event that the administration of this agreement for the<lf> Commonwealth is allocated to a Minister other than the Minister for Community<lf> Services, the Commonwealth shall be represented by the Department administered<lf> by that other Minister and that other Minister shall notify the State Minister<lf> of the address of that Department.<lf>    34\. The State shall be represented for the purposes of this agreement by the<lf> Department nominated by the State Minister and the State Minister shall notify<lf> the Commonwealth Minister of the address of that Department and of any change<lf> at any time of the Department or of the address.<lf>    35.(1) A notice or other communication under or in connection with this<lf> agreement shall be duly given if it is in writing signed by or on behalf of, or<lf> attributed to, the head or other authorised officer of the Department by which<lf> it is given and addressed to or delivered at the address of the Department to<lf> which it is directed.<lf>    (2) For the purposes of this clause writing includes a teleprinter or<lf> facsimile message and the address for such a message shall be the teleprinter<lf> or facsimile address of the receiving Department.<lf>    (3) A notice or other communication shall be given under this clause when it<lf> is received in the appropriate form by the Department to which it is directed.<lf>                               SCHEDULE                         Clause 16<lf>                                 First Grant Year       Second Grant Year<lf>                                                $                       $<lf>   New South Wales                      8,717,000              10,461,000<lf>   Victoria                             6,562,000               7,875,000<lf>   Queensland                           4,018,000               4,821,000<lf>   Western Australia                    2,218,000               2,661,000<lf>   South Australia                      2,180,000               2,616,000<lf>   Tasmania                               702,000                 843,000<lf>   Northern Territory                     218,000                 261,000<lf> IN WITNESS WHEREOF this agreement has been signed for and on behalf of the<lf> parties hereto respectively as at the day and year first above written.<lf> *2* S. 3 (4) and Schedule-The Home and Community Care Act 1985 was modified by Regulation 2 of the A.C.T.
