Note:          **_Improper discrimination_** is defined in subsection 66(1).

             (3)  An action of a registered organization will not be consistent with the principles of community rating if the action results in the undertaking of any activity that constitutes an improper discrimination against a person who seeks to become, or who is, a contributor to the health benefits fund conducted by the organization or against a dependant of such a person.

Note:          **_Improper discrimination_** is defined in subsection 66(1).

##### <a id="73AAI"></a>73AAI  Community rating condition concerning admission of persons as contributors and cancellations of membership

                     (c)  cancel the membership of a person as a contributor to the health benefits fund conducted by the organization;

if that refusal or cancellation amounts to improper discrimination against that person.

Note:          **_Improper discrimination_** is defined in subsection 66(1).

             (2)  In this section:

                    <a name="close-health-insur-product"></a>**_closed health insurance product_**, in relation to a registered organization, means a health insurance product of that organization that the organization has permanently closed to new or transferring contributors.

                     (a)  whether or not benefits are payable in accordance with an applicable benefits arrangement of the organization (whether or not modified by an election of the kind referred to in the condition set out in paragraph (ba) of Schedule 1); or

                     (b)  if benefits are payable in accordance with an applicable benefits arrangement of the organization (whether or not modified by an election of the kind referred to in the condition set out in paragraph (ba) of Schedule 1)—the amount of the benefits so payable; or

                     (d)  the amount of the contributions payable in respect of an applicable benefits arrangement of the organization;

have regard to any matter that would cause the determination to constitute improper discrimination in respect of any contributor, or any contributor included in a class of contributors, to whom or to which the determination relates.

Note:          **_Improper discrimination_** is defined in subsection 66(1).

##### <a id="73AAK"></a>73AAK  Limited exception from community rating for restricted membership organizations

                     (a)  the constitution and rules of a restricted membership organization may restrict membership of that organization in the manner set out in the paragraphs of the definition of **_restricted membership organization_** in subsection 4(1); and

                     (b)  any action taken solely to ensure that persons abide by the constitution and those rules so far as they relate to membership of the health benefits fund conducted by that organization is not a breach of these conditions.

##### <a id="73AAL"></a>73AAL  Discrimination on basis of place of residence

                   Nothing in this Act prevents a registered health benefits organization:

<o:p> </o:p>

Part 4—Amendments relating to lifetime health cover

National Health Act 1953

## 58  Subclause 1(2) of Schedule 2

Repeal the subclause, substitute:

             (2)  The amount of the increase is worked out as follows:

<sub><v:shape id="_x0000_i1026" style="WIDTH: 219.75pt; HEIGHT: 30.75pt" o:ole="" type="#_x0000_t75" coordsize="21600,21600"><v:imagedata o:title="" src="81CFE2794B2C6874CA256FD9001E12FC/$FILE/image003.wmz"></v:imagedata></v:shape></sub>

where:

                    <a name="base-rate"></a>**_base rate_** is the amount of contributions that would be payable for that hospital cover in respect of an adult beneficiary in respect of whom:

                     (a)  contributions are not increased under this Schedule; and

                     (b)  contributions are not decreased through providing financial benefits under a loyalty bonus scheme implemented in accordance with paragraph (ma) of Schedule 1; and

                     (c)  a discounted rate of contribution is not payable in accordance with paragraph (s) of Schedule 1.

                    <a name="lifetim-health-cover-ag"></a>**_lifetime health cover age_**, in relation to an adult beneficiary who takes out hospital cover after his/her Schedule 2 application day means:

                     (a)  if the beneficiary took out hospital cover before the 1 July next following the beneficiary’s birthday—the beneficiary’s age immediately before that birthday; and

                     (b)  if the beneficiary took out health cover on or after the 1 July next following the beneficiary’s birthday—the beneficiary’s age on that birthday.

Example:    Bill turns 36 years of age on 2 March 2004:

(a)           he takes out hospital cover, for the first time, on 1 April 2004\. Since he has taken the cover before the 1 July next following his birthday, he is treated as having a lifetime health cover age of 35\. If the hospital cover has a base rate of $1,000 per year, the amount of the increase in the base rate under this clause is therefore as follows:

<sub><v:shape id="_x0000_i1027" style="WIDTH: 153.75pt; HEIGHT: 30.75pt" o:ole="" type="#_x0000_t75" coordsize="21600,21600"><v:imagedata o:title="" src="81CFE2794B2C6874CA256FD9001E12FC/$FILE/image005.wmz"></v:imagedata></v:shape></sub>

(b)           alternatively, he takes out hospital cover, for the first time, on 1 September 2004\. Since he has taken the cover after the 1 July next following his birthday, he is treated as having lifetime health cover age of 36\. If the hospital cover has a base rate of $1,000 per year, the amount of the increase in the base rate under this clause is therefore as follows:

<sub><v:shape id="_x0000_i1028" style="WIDTH: 153.75pt; HEIGHT: 30.75pt" o:ole="" type="#_x0000_t75" coordsize="21600,21600"><v:imagedata o:title="" src="81CFE2794B2C6874CA256FD9001E12FC/$FILE/image007.wmz"></v:imagedata></v:shape></sub>

## 59  Saving provision

Despite the amendment of clause 1 of Schedule 2 to the _National Health Act 1953_ made by item 58 of this Schedule, clause 1 of Schedule 2 to the _National Health Act 1953_ as in force immediately before that amendment comes into effect continues to apply in relation to a person who first takes out hospital cover before the day on which that item comes into effect as if that amendment had never been made.

## 60  After paragraph 3(1)(a) of Schedule 2

Insert:

                    (ab)  days during which the adult beneficiary is overseas that form part of a continuous period overseas of more than one year;

## 61  Subparagraph 3(2)(a)(i) of Schedule 2

Omit “paragraph (1)(b)”, substitute “paragraph (1)(ab) or (b)”.

## 62  At the end of clause 3 of Schedule 2

Add:

             (3)  A person resident on Norfolk Island is taken, while the person so resides, to be overseas for the purposes of this Schedule.

             (4)  In determining whether a period during which an adult beneficiary is overseas is a continuous period, any period during which the adult beneficiary returns to Australia that is of less than 90 days’ duration counts as part of the period overseas.

## 63  Subclause 4(2) of Schedule 2

Repeal the subclause, substitute:

             (2)  A person is taken to have hospital cover:

                     (a)  if, at any time after 30 June 1999, the person was or is the holder of a gold card under the _Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986—_ for the duration of any period that the person held or holds the card; or

                     (b)  if the person is included in a class of persons specified in the regulations.

             (3)  In this clause:

                    <a name="gold-card"></a>**_gold card_** means a card that evidences a person’s entitlement to be provided with treatment in accordance with the Treatment Principles issued under section 90 of the _Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986_.
