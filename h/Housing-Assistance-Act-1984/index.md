THE NORTHERN TERRITORY OF AUSTRALIA of the eighth part.

WHEREAS: 

(A)    the Commonwealth and the States of Australia have from time to time entered into agreements for the purpose of the provision by the States with financial assistance from the Commonwealth of housing;

(B)     by an agreement between the Commonwealth, the States of Australia and the Northern Territory of Australia dated the twenty-third day of December 1981, being the agreement authorised to be executed on behalf of the Commonwealth by the Housing Assistance Act 1981 of the Commonwealth Parliament and being the last of the agreements referred to in Recital (A), provision was so made with respect to the five years commencing on the 1st July 1981;

(C)     the Ministers of the respective governments throughout Australia who are responsible for housing have agreed upon the provision of rental housing assistance and home purchase assistance in the various States and in the Northern Territory during the ten years commencing on the 1st July 1984;

(D)    the primary principle of this agreement is to ensure that every person in <st1:country-region><st1:place style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x">Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region> has access to adequate and appropriate housing at a price within his or her capacity to pay by seeking to:

<span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol">·</span>   alleviate housing-related poverty; and

<span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol">·</span>   ensure that housing assistance is, as far as possible, delivered equitably to persons resident in different forms of housing tenure;

in implementing this principle, assistance provided under the agreement will also reflect the following detailed principles:

(a)   Assistance Generally

the primary consideration in delivering housing assistance under this agreement will be the needs of people, rather than to attach assistance to particular dwellings or categories of dwellings;

housing assistance provided under this agreement will be available to all sections of the community irrespective of age, sex, marital status, race, religion, disability or life situation. However, priority in granting assistance shall be determined by the need for assistance;

in delivering housing assistance, as far as possible, people should be given an equal choice between the types of housing assistance available;

housing assistance programs developed under this agreement should be designed so that maximum social benefit is derived from previous investment in housing;

housing assistance provided under this agreement should be co-ordinated with housing assistance programs that are developed outside this agreement;

(b)   Public Rental Housing

programs and funding arrangements under this agreement should seek to develop the public housing sector as a viable and diversified form of housing choice and refrain from discrimination;

programs and funding arrangements under this agreement shall be developed so as to increase progressively the availability of public housing to a level commensurate with the need for it in the community;

public housing should reflect general community housing standards and should be accessible to community and other services. Poor location of dwellings, an inadequate range of choice of dwellings, and stigmatisation of the status of public tenants should be avoided to the maximum extent practicable;

public housing stock should, as far as possible, be designed to cater for the needs and preferences of current and likely future applicants;

clear recognition should be accorded to the separate but complementary roles of:

<span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol">·</span>   capital expenditure on constructing and acquiring dwellings;

<span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol">·</span>   financing of rental operations;

<span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol">·</span>   managing rental operations including assistance for tenants; and

<span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol">·</span>   sales of dwellings; 

the design, style and siting of public housing will, to the maximum extent practicable:

<span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol">·</span>   reflect the need for accessibility and suitability for habitation by disabled persons, Aboriginals, youth, the elderly, or other identified groups; and

<span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol">·</span>   support the energy conservation policies of the governments;

public housing authorities should ensure that tenants have maximum opportunity to participate in the management of their dwellings and estates and in the development of public housing policies;

(c)   Income-Related Assistance to Tenants

programs developed under this agreement should recognise the problems created by the inability of some tenants to afford adequate rental accommodation in both public and private rental sectors;

assistance measures in the public rental sector should be co-ordinated with assistance to private tenants and should recognise the income support nature of the assistance and the inter-relationship of this assistance with Commonwealth assistance to pensioners and other beneficiaries under the Social Security Act 1947;

(d)   Home Ownership Assistance

assistance under this agreement shall seek to provide home ownership opportunities for those unable to obtain or maintain affordable finance from the private sector or from other sources outside the agreement;

(e)   Implementation

the State will be able to exercise maximum autonomy and flexibility in developing the administrative arrangements necessary to achieve these principles;

(E)     the Ministers referred to in Recital (C) recognise the relationship between the principles and policies reflected in this agreement and the need to co-ordinate these with those affecting generally home purchasers and tenants including tenants in private housing and in emergency and supported accommodation;

(F)     it is proposed that in order to implement the agreement of the Ministers the Commonwealth will grant to the States financial assistance under section 96 of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution and like assistance to the Northern Territory and that the terms and conditions on which the grant of financial assistance should be made are those set out in this agreement;

(G)     the Commonwealth the States and the Northern Territory have decided that the agreement referred to in Recital (B) shall cease to operate on and from the first day of July 1984 and to vary in certain respects the operation of the agreements which have been entered into as aforesaid; and

(3)   The State may reschedule repayments by borrowers or rental purchasers in the event of hardship.

**PART X—RENTAL HOUSING ASSISTANCE**

**29.**  Funds available to a State during any year for its rental housing assistance program (for the purposes of this Part referred to as “rental housing assistance funds”) shall consist of

(a)   in respect of a year of this agreement, payments of loan assistance and grants that are made under this agreement for rental housing assistance; and

(b)   in respect of any year—

(i)    any surplus during the year of revenue, after allowing for rent forgone, over outgoings incurred or provided for, arising directly from rental housing operations of the State under this agreement or previous housing arrangements and to which this agreement applies;

(ii)   net proceeds from sale of rental housing and land acquired under previous housing arrangements or this agreement; and

(iii)   any other funds which the State allocates for rental housing assistance under this agreement.

**30.**  Without by this clause conveying any implication that funds are to be made available by the Commonwealth for, or are to be applied by a State for, any particular purpose or in order of priority, the purposes for which rental housing assistance funds may be used by the State in accordance with Recital (D) include the following—

(a)   to meet the costs of and associated with the acquisition, planning and development of land primarily for residential development;

(b)   to pay for the construction or acquisition of housing;

(f)   to engage in urban renewal activities related to public housing;

(g)   to allocate funds to local government bodies for the provision of rental housing where the State Minister considers that it would be more appropriate for such rental housing assistance to be carried out by those bodies;

(h)   to make payments for, or provide bridging finance for, the provision of open space, landscaping, community facilities and for costs associated with land development, including contributions to headworks and reticulation of services;

(i)    to undertake research and policy development in relation to matters not funded by the Australian Housing Research Council;

(j)    to undertake and participate in joint ventures, co-operative enterprises or similar arrangements in order that public housing developments may be integrated with private housing and to achieve a desirable socio-economic mixture of housing;

(k)   to lease housing from the private housing sector;

(l)    to provide housing advisory services related to public housing;

(m)  to provide rental subsidy for eligible persons renting private housing;

(n)   noting that the Commonwealth assists pensioners and other beneficiaries in the private rental market, to supplement, up to an amount determined in writing by the Minister in respect of each year, rental revenue reduced by the operation of clause 33 in respect of pensioners and other beneficiaries under the Social Security Act 1947;

(o)   expenditure in accordance with Part XI; and

(p)   any other purposes agreed upon between the Minister and the State Minister.

**31.**  The conditions of eligibility of persons for rental housing assistance shall be determined by the State in accordance with Recital (D) and so that priority in granting assistance is determined by the need for assistance.

**32.**  (1)        Subject to sub-clause (2) and clause 33, the State will in respect of its rental housing apply a policy of fixing rents at a level not less than that which would result from an application of the formula set out in the Second Schedule, and also review those rents at least annually.

(2)   If the State wishes, it may phase in the said policy over a period of three years or other period which takes into account the level of rents prevailing in the private rental market and is agreed to between the Minister and the State Minister.

**33.**  The State shall forego the collection of so much of rents fixed in accordance with clause 32 as it considers that tenants having regard primarily to their income are not able to afford to pay.

**34.**  (1)        A State may sell rental housing but such sales, if any, shall be in accordance with Recital (D) and subject to the following conditions—

(a)   all sales of housing shall be at market value or replacement cost at the time of the sale but not so as to preclude the State, if it so wishes, from providing a credit to the tenant in recognition of improvements that the tenant has made to the housing except that, in the case of any body, co-operative, group or other organisation which makes available rental housing provided under this agreement and in respect of which it is agreed between the Minister and State Minister, sales need not be at that value or cost;

(b)   in all sales of rental housing, the vendor is, at or prior to the date of the sale, to have received an amount calculated in accordance with paragraph (a);

(c)   in the case of a rental purchase, home purchase assistance funds are to be used to enable the vendor to receive an amount referred to in paragraph (b); and

(d)   net proceeds from sales of housing shall be applied to construct or purchase replacement housing which is to be included in rental housing for the purpose of this agreement.

(2)   The State will ensure that if any body, co-operative, group or other organisation which acquires housing with rental housing assistance funds or acquires at other than market value or replacement cost, rental housing from the State, sells, otherwise disposes of, or uses that housing for a purpose other than rental housing as provided for under this Part, it shall repay to the State an amount equal to the net proceeds from the sale, at market value or replacement cost, of that housing.

**PART XI—SPECIFIC HOUSING ASSISTANCE**

**35.**  The Minister may, in writing under his hand authorize, subject to guidelines made consistently with this agreement and agreed between the Minister and State Minister relating to the following programs including guidelines as to the provision of any funds by the State in relation to each program, grants to the State for expenditure on—

(i)    rental housing assistance for pensioners;

(ii)   rental housing assistance for Aboriginals;

(2)   Unless otherwise agreed by the Minister the net proceeds of sale of rental housing provided for a specific purpose or program with grants under this Part shall only be applied to provide rental housing for the same purpose or program.

(3)   This clause shall apply to rental housing that has been provided from grants made by the Commonwealth to a State under Part III of the Housing Assistance Act 1978 or under Part XI of the agreement referred to in Recital (B).

**PART XII—SUPERSESSION OF PREVIOUS HOUSING ARRANGEMENTS**

**37.**  The provisions of this agreement with respect to rental housing and home purchase assistance shall, except as provided herein, supersede the provisions of the existing Housing Agreements to the intent that this agreement will provide the arrangements between the Commonwealth and each State in relation to the provision of rental housing, including the sale of housing so provided, and to the provision of assistance for home purchasers under the previous housing arrangements and this agreement.

**PART XIII—OBSERVANCE OF AGREEMENT**

**38.**  The Commonwealth shall provide for or secure the performance by it and its authorities of the obligations of the Commonwealth under this agreement and each of the States shall provide for or secure the performance by the State and its authorities of the obligations of the State under this agreement.

**39.**  A State shall determine an agency or agencies (including bodies or organisations that are not authorities of the State) for the performance of this agreement on behalf of the State and acts and things that are done by or with respect to the agency or agencies so determined shall, for the purposes of this agreement, be deemed to have been done by or with respect to the State.

**40.**  If the Minister, in writing under his hand, informs the Treasurer of a State he is satisfied that the State has failed to ensure that an amount of financial assistance provided to the State has been applied for the purposes and in the manner provided for by this agreement with respect to that financial assistance, the State will repay that amount, or such part of that amount as the Minister thinks reasonable, to the Commonwealth.

**41.**  If a State fails for any reason to meet the requirement for the provision by it of matching funds in accordance with Part VI or Part XI with respect to any financial assistance that has been provided to it, the State will upon request by the Minister, in writing under his hand, repay to the Commonwealth the amount of that financial assistance or so much of that amount as is specified in the request.

# Second Schedule<o:p></o:p>

Clause 32

COST RENT FORMULA

The following formula is to be used to determine real cost rents for public rental accommodation. States are to charge rents at least equal to those resulting from the use of this formula. The formula is not to be applied to the costs of individual dwellings but rather to the total cost pool of the rental stock. In allocating the total cost rent pool to individual tenancies States will have regard to variation in housing standards and locations within the constraints of available administrative arrangements for assessing these variations.

1.     Recovery of operating expenses

The costs to be recovered in this area are ordinarily listed in the rental accounts of State housing authorities as yearly expenditure items. These include:

(a)   administration;

(b)   rates;

(c)   insurance;

(d)   specific operating expenses associated with particular types of units;

(e)   annual maintenance;

(f)   yearly allowance for rent arrears and debts written off;

(g)   yearly allowance for vacancies;

(h)   leasing expenses related to land and dwellings;

(i)    operating expenses of community facilities;

(j)    any other operating costs agreed between Federal and State Housing Ministers.

2.     Interest Charges

Interest payable on loan funds invested in public rental housing.

3.     Depreciation

(i)    depreciation rate is to reflect a life of between 40-75 years of the capital improvements on the land;

(ii)   the value of capital improvement will be based on the estimated current capital improved value;

(iii)  the minimum annual depreciation rate will be not less than the rate resulting from a term of 75 years.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF etc.
