 Section&#160;4
 AN AGREEMENT made the			day of				One thousand nine hundred and eighty-four between&#151;
 THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA of the first part,
 THE STATE OF NEW SOUTH WALES of the second part,
 THE STATE OF VICTORIA of the third part,
 THE STATE OF QUEENSLAND of the fourth part,
 THE STATE OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA of the fifth part,
 THE STATE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA of the sixth part,
 THE STATE OF TASMANIA of the seventh part, and
 THE NORTHERN TERRITORY OF AUSTRALIA of the eighth part.
 WHEREAS: 
 (A)	the Commonwealth and the States of Australia have from time to time entered into agreements for the purpose of the provision by the States with financial assistance from the Commonwealth of housing;
 (B)	by an agreement between the Commonwealth, the States of Australia and the Northern Territory of Australia dated the twenty-third day of December 1981, being the agreement authorised to be executed on behalf of the Commonwealth by the Housing Assistance Act 1981 of the Commonwealth Parliament and being the last of the agreements referred to in Recital (A), provision was so made with respect to the five years commencing on the 1st July 1981;
 (C)	the Ministers of the respective governments throughout Australia who are responsible for housing have agreed upon the provision of rental housing assistance and home purchase assistance in the various States and in the Northern Territory during the ten years commencing on the 1st July 1984;
 (D)	the primary principle of this agreement is to ensure that every person in Australia has access to adequate and appropriate housing at a price within his or her capacity to pay by seeking to:
 *	alleviate housing-related poverty; and
 *	ensure that housing assistance is, as far as possible, delivered equitably to persons resident in different forms of housing tenure;
 in implementing this principle, assistance provided under the agreement will also reflect the following detailed principles:
 (a)	Assistance Generally
 the primary consideration in delivering housing assistance under this agreement will be the needs of people, rather than to attach assistance to particular dwellings or categories of dwellings;
 housing assistance provided under this agreement will be available to all sections of the community irrespective of age, sex, marital status, race, religion, disability or life situation. However, priority in granting assistance shall be determined by the need for assistance;
 in delivering housing assistance, as far as possible, people should be given an equal choice between the types of housing assistance available;
 housing assistance programs developed under this agreement should be designed so that maximum social benefit is derived from previous investment in housing;
 housing assistance provided under this agreement should be co-ordinated with housing assistance programs that are developed outside this agreement;
 (b)	Public Rental Housing

<center>Back to Top</center>
 programs and funding arrangements under this agreement should seek to develop the public housing sector as a viable and diversified form of housing choice and refrain from discrimination;
 programs and funding arrangements under this agreement shall be developed so as to increase progressively the availability of public housing to a level commensurate with the need for it in the community;
 public housing should reflect general community housing standards and should be accessible to community and other services. Poor location of dwellings, an inadequate range of choice of dwellings, and stigmatisation of the status of public tenants should be avoided to the maximum extent practicable;
 public housing stock should, as far as possible, be designed to cater for the needs and preferences of current and likely future applicants;
 clear recognition should be accorded to the separate but complementary roles of:
 *	capital expenditure on constructing and acquiring dwellings;
 *	financing of rental operations;
 *	managing rental operations including assistance for tenants; and
 *	sales of dwellings; 
 the design, style and siting of public housing will, to the maximum extent practicable:
 *	reflect the need for accessibility and suitability for habitation by disabled persons, Aboriginals, youth, the elderly, or other identified groups; and
 *	support the energy conservation policies of the governments;
 public housing authorities should ensure that tenants have maximum opportunity to participate in the management of their dwellings and estates and in the development of public housing policies;
 (c)	Income-Related Assistance to Tenants
 programs developed under this agreement should recognise the problems created by the inability of some tenants to afford adequate rental accommodation in both public and private rental sectors;
 assistance measures in the public rental sector should be co-ordinated with assistance to private tenants and should recognise the income support nature of the assistance and the inter-relationship of this assistance with Commonwealth assistance to pensioners and other beneficiaries under the Social Security Act 1947;
 (d)	Home Ownership Assistance
 assistance under this agreement shall seek to provide home ownership opportunities for those unable to obtain or maintain affordable finance from the private sector or from other sources outside the agreement;
 (e)	Implementation
 the State will be able to exercise maximum autonomy and flexibility in developing the administrative arrangements necessary to achieve these principles;
 (E)	the Ministers referred to in Recital (C) recognise the relationship between the principles and policies reflected in this agreement and the need to co-ordinate these with those affecting generally home purchasers and tenants including tenants in private housing and in emergency and supported accommodation;
 (F)	it is proposed that in order to implement the agreement of the Ministers the Commonwealth will grant to the States financial assistance under section&#160;96 of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution and like assistance to the Northern Territory and that the terms and conditions on which the grant of financial assistance should be made are those set out in this agreement;
 (G)	the Commonwealth the States and the Northern Territory have decided that the agreement referred to in Recital (B) shall cease to operate on and from the first day of July 1984 and to vary in certain respects the operation of the agreements which have been entered into as aforesaid; and
 (H)	the Parliament of the Commonwealth has authorised the execution by and on behalf of the Commonwealth of this agreement and the provision of financial assistance to the States in accordance with its provisions.
 NOW IT IS HEREBY AGREED as follows:

**</center>

 Clause&#160;32
 <center>COST RENT FORMULA</center>
 The following formula is to be used to determine real cost rents for public rental accommodation. States are to charge rents at least equal to those resulting from the use of this formula. The formula is not to be applied to the costs of individual dwellings but rather to the total cost pool of the rental stock. In allocating the total cost rent pool to individual tenancies States will have regard to variation in housing standards and locations within the constraints of available administrative arrangements for assessing these variations.
 1.	Recovery of operating expenses
 The costs to be recovered in this area are ordinarily listed in the rental accounts of State housing authorities as yearly expenditure items. These include:
 (a)	administration;
 (b)	rates;
 (c)	insurance;
 (d)	specific operating expenses associated with particular types of units;
 (e)	annual maintenance;
 (f)	yearly allowance for rent arrears and debts written off;
 (g)	yearly allowance for vacancies;
 (h)	leasing expenses related to land and dwellings;
 (i)	operating expenses of community facilities;
 (j)	any other operating costs agreed between Federal and State Housing Ministers.
 2.	Interest Charges
 Interest payable on loan funds invested in public rental housing.
 3.	Depreciation
 (i)	depreciation rate is to reflect a life of between 40-75 years of the capital improvements on the land;
 (ii)	the value of capital improvement will be based on the estimated current capital improved value;
 (iii)	the minimum annual depreciation rate will be not less than the rate resulting from a term of 75 years.
