## An Act to establish the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Account, and for related purposes

## Preamble

                   The Parliament of Australia recognises the need for urgent action to redress the current decline, and to prevent further decline, in the quality of Australia’s natural environment.

                   There is a national crisis in land and water degradation and in the loss of biodiversity.

                   There is a need to conserve Australia’s environmental infrastructure, to reverse the decline in Australia’s natural environment and to improve the management of Australia’s natural resources.

                   There is a need for the Commonwealth to provide national leadership and work in partnership with all levels of government and the whole community, recognising, among other things, that many environmental issues and problems are not limited by State and Territory borders.

                   There is a need to integrate the objectives of environmental protection, sustainable agriculture and natural resources management consistent with the principles of ecologically sustainable development.

                   It is essential that government leadership be demonstrated, and that the Australian community be involved, in relation to these matters.

                   The Commonwealth Government should work cooperatively with State governments to achieve effective outcomes in matters relating to environmental protection, natural resources management and sustainable agriculture. Those cooperative working relationships should involve entering into inter‑governmental agreements which reflect the support of the States for the purposes of the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Account and promote the development of complementary policies and programs.

                   Australia’s rural community should have a key role in the ecologically sustainable management of Australia’s natural resources.

                   Australia’s natural environment is central to Australia’s and Australians’ health and non‑material well‑being and to Australia’s present and future economic prosperity. Accordingly, present and future generations of Australians will benefit from the ecologically sustainable management of the natural environment.

                   A comprehensive, integrated response to these matters is necessary. 

                   The above considerations are taken into account by the Parliament of Australia in enacting the law that follows.

## Part 2—The Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Account

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Account

                   There is continued in existence the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Account.

Note:          The Account was established by subsection 5(3) of the _Financial Management Legislation Amendment Act 1999_.

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Nature of the Account

                   The Account is a Special Account for the purposes of the _Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997_.

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Investments and income of the Account

Investments

             (1)  Amounts equal to income derived from the investment of an amount standing to the credit of the Account are to be credited to the Account.

Note:          An amount standing to the credit of the Account may be invested in accordance with the _Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997_.

Fixed income—uninvested amounts

             (2)  Within 28 days after the end of a financial year, there is to be credited to the Account, in respect of the financial year, an amount equal to the fixed‑income percentage of the uninvested amount standing to the credit of the Account as at the end of the financial year.

Fixed‑income percentage

             (3)  For the purposes of the application of subsection (2) to a particular financial year, the **_fixed‑income percentage_** is:

                     (a)  if the financial year begins on or before 1 July 2001:

                              (i)  8%; or

                             (ii)  if the Finance Minister, by written instrument made within 28 days after the end of the financial year, determines a higher percentage—that higher percentage; or

                     (b)  if the financial year begins on or after 1 July 2002:

                              (i)  the percentage equal to the rate of interest earned by the Commonwealth as at the end of the financial year on deposits held with the Reserve Bank of Australia; or

                             (ii)  if the Finance Minister, by written instrument made within 28 days after the end of the financial year, determines a higher percentage—that higher percentage.

Advances on account of fixed income

             (4)  During a financial year, the Finance Minister may, by written instrument, determine that a specified amount is to be credited to the Account by way of an advance on account of the amount that may be credited to the Account under subsection (2) in respect of the financial year. The determination has effect accordingly.

             (5)  For each $1 credited under subsection (4) in respect of a financial year, the amount credited under subsection (2) in respect of the financial year is to be reduced by $1.

             (6)  If, at the end of a financial year:

                     (a)  the total amount credited to the Account under subsection (4) in respect of the financial year;

exceeds:

                     (b)  the amount (if any) that would have been credited to the Account under subsection (2) in respect of the financial year if it were assumed that no amounts had been credited under subsection (4) in respect of the financial year;

an amount equal to the excess must be debited from the Account.

             (7)  In this section:

                    <a name="financ-minist"></a>**_Finance Minister_** means the Minister who administers the _Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997_.
