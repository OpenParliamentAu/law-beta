An Act to establish the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Reserve, and for related purposes
Do not delete : Chapter placeholder
Do not delete : Part placeholder
Do not delete : Division placeholder
Preamble
		The Parliament of Australia recognises the need for urgent action to redress the current decline, and to prevent further decline, in the quality of Australia’s natural environment.
		There is a national crisis in land and water degradation and in the loss of biodiversity.
		There is a need to conserve Australia’s environmental infrastructure, to reverse the decline in Australia’s natural environment and to improve the management of Australia’s natural resources.
		There is a need for the Commonwealth to provide national leadership and work in partnership with all levels of government and the whole community, recognising, among other things, that many environmental issues and problems are not limited by State and Territory borders.
		There is a need to integrate the objectives of environmental protection, sustainable agriculture and natural resources management consistent with the principles of ecologically sustainable development.
		It is essential that government leadership be demonstrated, and that the Australian community be involved, in relation to these matters.
		The Commonwealth Government should work cooperatively with State governments to achieve effective outcomes in matters relating to environmental protection, natural resources management and sustainable agriculture. Those cooperative working relationships should involve entering into inter-governmental agreements which reflect the support of the States for the purposes of the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Reserve and promote the development of complementary policies and programs.
		Australia’s rural community should have a key role in the ecologically sustainable management of Australia’s natural resources.
		Australia’s natural environment is central to Australia’s and Australians’ health and non-material well-being and to Australia’s present and future economic prosperity. Accordingly, present and future generations of Australians will benefit from the ecologically sustainable management of the natural environment.
		A comprehensive, integrated response to these matters is necessary. 
		The above considerations are taken into account by the Parliament of Australia in enacting the law that follows.

Do not delete : Division placeholder
4  Establishment of the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Reserve
		The Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Reserve is established.
5  Nature of the Reserve
	(1)	After the commencement of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997, the Reserve is a component of the Reserved Money Fund.
	(2)	Before the commencement of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997, the Reserve is a trust account for the purposes of section 62A of the Audit Act 1901.
	(3)	The Trust Fund established by the Audit Act 1901 is appropriated to the extent necessary to achieve the transition of the Reserve from the scheme of the Audit Act 1901 to the scheme of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997.
6  Investments and income of the Reserve
Investments
	(1)	Amounts equal to income derived from the investment of money in the Reserve are to be transferred to the Reserve from the Consolidated Revenue Fund.
Note 1:	Money in the Reserve may be invested in accordance with whichever of the following Acts is applicable:
(a)	the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997;
(b)	the Audit Act 1901.
Note 2:	Under section 81 of the Constitution, income from investments must be paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund.
Fixed income—uninvested money
	(2)	Within 28 days after the end of a financial year, there is to be transferred to the Reserve from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, in respect of the financial year, an amount equal to the fixed-income percentage of the uninvested money in the Reserve as at the end of the financial year.
Fixed-income percentage
	(3)	For the purposes of the application of subsection (2) to a particular financial year, the fixed-income percentage is:
	(a)	if the financial year begins on or before 1 July 2001:
	(i)	8%; or
	(ii)	if the Minister for Finance, by written instrument made within 28 days after the end of the financial year, determines a higher percentage—that higher percentage; or

	(ii)	if the Minister for Finance, by written instrument made within 28 days after the end of the financial year, determines a higher percentage—that higher percentage.
Advances on account of fixed income
	(4)	During a financial year, the Minister for Finance may, by written instrument, determine that a specified amount is to be transferred to the Reserve from the Consolidated Revenue Fund by way of an advance on account of the amount that may become transferable to the Reserve under subsection (2) in respect of the financial year. The determination has effect accordingly.
	(5)	For each $1 transferred under subsection (4) in respect of a financial year, the amount transferred under subsection (2) in respect of the financial year is to be reduced by $1.
	(6)	If:
	(a)	at the end of a financial year, the total amount transferred to the Reserve under subsection (4) in respect of the financial year;
exceeds:
	(b)	the amount (if any) that would have been transferred to the Reserve under subsection (2) in respect of the financial year if it were assumed that no amounts had been transferred under subsection (4) in respect of the financial year;
there is to be transferred to the Consolidated Revenue Fund from the Reserve an amount equal to the excess.
