## An Act to amend the _Native Title Act 1993_, and for related purposes

[_Assented to__27 July 1998_]

The Parliament of Australia enacts:

             (4)  Part 2 of Schedule 3 commences:

                     (a)  on the first day after the end of the period of 12 months after the commencement of Part 1 of Schedule 3; or

                     (b)  if, before the end of that period, a later day is fixed by Proclamation—on that later day.

             (5)  Subject to subsection (6), the remaining provisions of this Act commence on a day or days to be fixed by Proclamation.

###### Schedule 1—Amendments relating to acts affecting native title etc.

<h9 class="ActHead9">Native Title Act 1993</h9>

## 1  Paragraph 3(d)

After “past acts”, insert “, and intermediate period acts,”.

## 2  Section 4

Repeal the section, substitute:

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Overview of Act

Recognition and protection of native title

             (1)  This Act recognises and protects native title. It provides that native title cannot be extinguished contrary to the Act.

Topics covered

             (2)  Essentially, this Act covers the following topics:

                     (a)  acts affecting native title (see subsections (3) to (6));

                     (b)  determining whether native title exists and compensation for acts affecting native title (see subsection (7)).

Kinds of acts affecting native title

             (3)  There are basically 2 kinds of acts affecting native title:

                     (a)  **_past acts_** (mainly acts done before this Act’s commencement on 1 January 1994 that were invalid because of native title); and

                     (b)  **_future acts_** (mainly acts done after this Act’s commencement that either validly affect native title or are invalid because of native title).

Consequences of past acts and future acts

             (4)  For past acts and future acts, this Act deals with the following matters:

                     (a)  their validity;

                     (b)  their effect on native title;

                     (c)  compensation for the acts.

Intermediate period acts

             (5)  However, for certain acts (called **_intermediate period acts_**) done mainly before the judgment of the High Court in _Wik Peoples v Queensland_(1996) 187 CLR 1, that would be invalid because they fail to pass any of the future act tests in Division 3 of Part 2, or for any other reason because of native title, this Act provides for similar consequences to past acts.

Confirmation of extinguishment of native title

             (6)  This Act also confirms that many acts done before the High Court’s judgment, that were either valid, or have been validated under the past act or intermediate period act provisions, will have extinguished native title. If the acts are **_previous exclusive possession acts_** (see section 23B), the extinguishment is complete; if the acts are **_previous non-exclusive possession acts_** (see section 23F), the extinguishment is to the extent of any inconsistency.

Role of Federal Court and National Native Title Tribunal

             (7)  This Act also:

                     (a)  provides for the Federal Court to make determinations of native title and compensation; and

                     (b)  establishes a National Native Title Tribunal with power to:

                              (i)  make determinations about whether certain future acts can be done and whether certain agreements concerning native title are to be covered by the Act; and

                             (ii)  provide assistance or undertake mediation in other matters relating to native title; and

                     (c)  deals with other matters such as the keeping of registers and the role of representative Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander bodies.

## 3  Section 7

Repeal the section, substitute:

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Racial Discrimination Act

             (1)  This Act is intended to be read and construed subject to the provisions of the _Racial Discrimination Act 1975_.

             (2)  Subsection (1) means only that:

                     (a)  the provisions of the _Racial Discrimination Act 1975_ apply to the performance  of functions and  the exercise of powers conferred by or authorised by this Act; and

                     (b)  to construe this Act, and thereby to determine its operation, ambiguous terms should be construed consistently with the _Racial Discrimination Act 1975_ if that construction would remove the ambiguity.

             (3)  Subsections (1) and (2) do not affect the validation of past acts or intermediate period acts in accordance with this Act.

## 4  Paragraph 11(2)(a)

Repeal the paragraph, substitute:

                     (a)  in accordance with Division 2B (which deals with confirmation of past extinguishment of native title) or Division 3 (which deals with future acts etc. and native title) of Part 2; or

## 5  Paragraph 11(2)(b)

After “past acts”, insert “, or intermediate period acts,”.

## 6  Division 2 of Part 2 (heading)

Repeal the heading, substitute:

### Division 2—Validation of past acts

## 7  Before Subdivision A of Division 2 of Part 2

Insert:

#### Subdivision AA—Overview of Division

##### <a id="13A"></a>13A  Overview of Division

             (1)  In summary, this Division validates, or allows States and Territories to validate, certain acts that:

                     (a)  took place before 1 January 1994; and

                     (b)  would otherwise be invalid because of native title.

This Division also covers certain acts done after that day consisting of an extension or renewal etc. of an act done before that day.

             (2)  The acts validated are called **_past acts_**; they are defined in section 228.

             (3)  This Division also sets out the effect of such validation on native title. The effect varies depending on the nature of the act. For this purpose, different categories of past act are defined by sections 229 to 232.

## 8  At the end of subsection 15(1)

Add:

Note:          This subsection does not apply to the act if section 23C or 23G applies to the act.

## 9  Division 3 of Part 2

Repeal the Division, substitute:

### Division 2A—Validation of intermediate period acts etc.

#### Subdivision A—Overview of Division

##### <a id="21"></a>21  Overview of Division

             (1)  In summary, this Division validates, or allows States and Territories to validate, certain acts that:

                     (a)  took place on or after 1 January 1994 but on or before 23 December 1996; and

                     (b)  would otherwise be invalid to any extent because they fail to pass any of the future act tests in Division 3 of Part 2 or for any other reason because of native title.

             (2)  The acts are called **_intermediate period acts_**; they are defined in section 232A.

             (3)  For this validation to apply, before the act was done, there must have been:

                     (a)  a grant of a freehold estate or a lease (other than a mining lease); or

                     (b)  a public work;

over any of the land or waters concerned.

             (4)  The Division also sets out the effect of such validation on native title. The effect varies depending on the nature of the act. For this purpose, different categories of intermediate period act are defined by sections 232B to 232E.

             (5)  The structure of the Division is very similar to that of Division 2 (which deals with validation of past acts).

#### Subdivision B—Acts attributable to the Commonwealth

##### <a id="22A"></a>22A  Validation of Commonwealth acts

                   If an intermediate period act is an act attributable to the Commonwealth, the act is valid, and is taken always to have been valid.

##### <a id="22B"></a>22B  Effect of validation on native title

                   Subject to subsection 24EBA(6), if an intermediate period act is an act attributable to the Commonwealth:

                     (a)  if it is a category A intermediate period act to which subsection 232B(2), (3) or (4) (which deal with things such as the grant or vesting of freehold estates and certain leases) applies—the act extinguishes all native title in relation to the land or waters concerned; and

                     (b)  if it is a category A intermediate period act to which subsection 232B(7) (which deals with public works) applies:

                              (i)  the act extinguishes the native title in relation to the land or waters on which the public work concerned (on completion of its construction or establishment) was or is situated; and

                             (ii)  the extinguishment is taken to have happened when the construction or establishment began; and

                     (c)  if it is a category B intermediate period act that is wholly or partly inconsistent with the continued existence, enjoyment or exercise of the native title rights and interests concerned—the act extinguishes the native title to the extent of the inconsistency; and

                     (d)  if it is a category C intermediate period act or a category D intermediate period act—the non-extinguishment principle applies to the act.

Note:          This section does not apply to the act if section 23C or 23G applies to the act.

##### <a id="22C"></a>22C  Preservation of beneficial reservations and conditions

                   If:

                     (a)  an intermediate period act attributable to the Commonwealth contains a reservation or condition for the benefit of Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders; or

                     (b)  the doing of an intermediate period act attributable to the Commonwealth would affect rights or interests (other than native title rights and interests) of Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders (whether arising under legislation, at common law or in equity and whether or not rights of usage);

nothing in section 22B affects that reservation or condition or those rights or interests.

##### <a id="22D"></a>22D  Entitlement to compensation

             (1)  If an intermediate period act is an act attributable to the Commonwealth, the native title holders are entitled to compensation for the act.

Who pays compensation

             (2)  The compensation is payable by the Commonwealth.

##### <a id="22E"></a>22E  Where “just terms” invalidity

Section applies if acquisition of property other than on just terms

             (1)  This section applies if the invalidity (disregarding section 22A) of an intermediate period act attributable to the Commonwealth results from a paragraph 51(xxxi) acquisition of property by the Commonwealth from any person having been made otherwise than on paragraph 51(xxxi) just terms.

Entitlement to compensation

             (2)  The person is entitled to compensation from the Commonwealth for the acquisition in accordance with Division 5 and, if that compensation does not ensure that the acquisition is made on paragraph 51(xxxi) just terms, to such additional compensation from the Commonwealth as is necessary to ensure that it is.

##### <a id="22EA"></a>22EA  Requirement to notify: mining rights

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  an act that is attributable to the Commonwealth consists of:

                              (i)  the creation of a right to mine; or

                             (ii)  the variation of such a right to extend the area to which it relates; or

                            (iii)  the extension of the period for which such a right has effect, other than under an option or right of extension or renewal created by the lease, contract or other thing whose grant or making created the right to mine; and

                     (b)  the act took place at any time during the period from the beginning of 1 January 1994 until the end of 23 December 1996; and

                     (c)  at any time before the act was done, either:

                              (i)  a grant of a freehold estate or a lease was made covering any of the land or waters affected by the act; or

                             (ii)  a public work was constructed or established on any of the land or waters affected by the act;

the Commonwealth must, before the end of 6 months after this section commences:

                     (d)  give notice containing the details set out in subsection (2) to any registered native title body corporate, any registered native title claimant and any representative Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander body, in relation to any of the land or waters affected by the act; and

                     (e)  notify the public in the determined way of the details set out in subsection (2).

Details

             (2)  The details are:

                     (a)  the date on which the act was done; and

                     (b)  the kind of mining involved; and

                     (c)  sufficient information to enable the area affected by the act to be identified; and

                     (d)  information about the way in which further details about the act may be obtained.

#### Subdivision C—Acts attributable to a State or Territory

##### <a id="22F"></a>22F  State/Territory acts may be validated

                   If a law of a State or Territory contains provisions to the same effect as sections 22B and 22C, the law of the State or Territory may provide that intermediate period acts attributable to the State or Territory are valid, and are taken always to have been valid.

##### <a id="22G"></a>22G  Entitlement to compensation

Compensation where validation

             (1)  If a law of a State or Territory validates an intermediate period act attributable to the State or Territory in accordance with section 22F, the native title holders are entitled to compensation.

Recovery of compensation 

             (2)  The native title holders may recover the compensation from the State or Territory.

States or Territories may create compensation entitlement

             (3)  This section does not prevent a law of a State or Territory from creating an entitlement to compensation for an intermediate period act or for the validation of an intermediate period act.

Note:          Paragraph 49(b) deals with the situation where there are multiple rights to compensation under Commonwealth, State and Territory laws.

##### <a id="22H"></a>22H  Requirement to notify: mining rights

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  an act that is attributable to a State or Territory consists of:

                              (i)  the creation of a right to mine; or 

                             (ii)  the variation of such a right to extend the area to which it relates; or

                            (iii)  the extension of the period for which such a right has effect, other than under an option or right of extension or renewal created by the lease, contract or other thing whose grant or making created the right to mine; and

                     (b)  the act took place at any time during the period from the beginning of 1 January 1994 until the end of 23 December 1996; and

                     (c)  at any time before the act was done, either:

                              (i)  a grant of a freehold estate or a lease was made covering any of the land or waters affected by the act; or

                             (ii)  a public work was constructed or established on any of the land or waters affected by the act;

the State or Territory must, before the end of 6 months after the commencement of the law of the State or Territory that validates intermediate period acts attributable to the State or Territory in accordance with section 22F:

                     (d)  give notice containing the details set out in subsection (2) to any registered native title body corporate, any registered native title claimant and any representative Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander body, in relation to any of the land or waters affected by the act; and

                     (e)  notify the public in the determined way of the details set out in subsection (2).

Details

             (2)  The details are:

                     (a)  the date on which the act was done; and

                     (b)  the kind of mining involved; and

                     (c)  sufficient information to enable the area affected by the act to be identified; and

                     (d)  information about the way in which further details about the act may be obtained.

<h8 class="ActHead8">Division 2AA—Validation of transfers under New   South Wales land rights legislation</h8>

##### <a id="22I"></a>22I  Overview of Division

                   In summary, this Division allows New   South Wales to validate certain transfers under the _Aboriginal__Land__Rights Act 1983_ of that State.

##### <a id="22J"></a>22J  Validation of transfers

                   If:

                     (a)  future acts consist of the transfer of lands under section 36 of the _Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983_ of New South Wales; and

                     (b)  the claims for the lands were made before 28 November 1994; and

                     (c)  the acts took place before or take place after the commencement of this section; and

                     (d)  the acts are not intermediate period acts; and

                     (e)  the acts are invalid to any extent because of Division 3 of Part 2 or for any other reason, but would be valid to that extent if native title did not exist in relation to the lands;

a law of New South Wales may provide that the acts are valid, and are taken always to have been valid.

##### <a id="22K"></a>22K  Effect of validation on native title

                   The non-extinguishment principle applies to the acts.

##### <a id="22L"></a>22L  Entitlement to compensation

Compensation where validation

             (1)  If a law of New South Wales validates the acts, the native title holders concerned are entitled to compensation.

Recovery of compensation

             (2)  The native title holders may recover the compensation from New South Wales.

Compensation to take into account rights etc. conferred by transferee

             (3)  The compensation is to take into account all rights, interests and other benefits conferred, in relation to the lands, on the native title holders by, or by virtue of membership of, the Aboriginal Land Council (within the meaning of the _Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983_ of New South Wales) to which the lands are transferred or by which the lands are held.

NSW may create compensation entitlement

             (4)  This section does not prevent a law of New   South Wales from creating an entitlement to compensation for the acts or for their validation.

Note:          Paragraph 49(b) deals with the situation where there are multiple rights to compensation under Commonwealth and State legislation.

### Division 2B—Confirmation of past extinguishment of native title by certain valid or validated acts

##### <a id="23A"></a>23A  Overview of Division

             (1)  In summary, this Division provides that certain acts attributable to the Commonwealth that were done on or before 23 December 1996 will have completely or partially extinguished native title.

             (2)  If the acts were **_previous exclusive possession acts_** (involving the grant or vesting of things such as freehold estates or leases that conferred exclusive possession, or the construction or establishment of public works), the acts will have completely extinguished native title.

             (3)  If the acts were **_previous non-exclusive possession acts_**(involving grants of non-exclusive agricultural leases or non-exclusive pastoral leases), they will have extinguished native title to the extent of any inconsistency.

             (4)  This Division also allows States and Territories to legislate, in respect of certain acts attributable to them, to extinguish native title in the same way as is done under this Division for Commonwealth acts.

##### <a id="23B"></a>23B  Previous exclusive possession act

             (1)  This section defines **_previous exclusive possession act_**.

Grant of freehold estates or certain leases etc. on or before 23.12.1996

             (2)  An act is a **_previous exclusive possession act_** if:

                     (a)  it is valid (including because of Division 2 or 2A of Part 2); and

Note:       As at the commencement of this section, acts such as grants before 1 January 1994 that were invalid because of native title have been validated by or under Division 2.

                     (b)  it took place on or before 23 December 1996; and

                     (c)  it consists of the grant or vesting of any of the following:

                              (i)  a Scheduled interest (see section 249C);

                             (ii)  a freehold estate;

                            (iii)  a commercial lease that is neither an agricultural lease nor a pastoral lease;

                            (iv)  an exclusive agricultural lease (see section 247A) or an exclusive pastoral lease (see section 248A);

                             (v)  a residential lease;

                            (vi)  a community purposes lease (see section 249A);

                           (vii)  what is taken by subsection 245(3) (which deals with the dissection of mining leases into certain other leases) to be a separate lease in respect of land or waters mentioned in paragraph (a) of that subsection, assuming that the reference in subsection 245(2) to “1 January 1994” were instead a reference to “24 December 1996”;

                           (viii)  any lease (other than a mining lease) that confers a right of exclusive possession over particular land or waters.

Vesting of certain land or waters to be covered by paragraph (2)(c)

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  by or under legislation of a State or a Territory, particular land or waters are vested in any person; and

                     (b)  a right of exclusive possession of the land or waters is expressly or impliedly conferred on the person by or under the legislation;

the vesting is taken for the purposes of paragraph (2)(c) to be the vesting of a freehold estate over the land or waters.

Construction of public works commencing on or before 23.12.1996

          (9B)  An act is not a **_previous exclusive possession act_** if it is done by or under legislation that expressly provides that the act does not extinguish native title.

Exclusion of Crown to Crown grants etc.

          (9C)  If an act is the grant or vesting of an interest in relation to land or waters to or in the Crown in any capacity or a statutory authority, the act is not a **_previous exclusive possession act_**:

                     (a)  unless, apart from this Act, the grant or vesting extinguishes native title in relation to the land or waters; or

                     (b)  if the grant or vesting does not, apart from this Act, extinguish native title in relation to the land or waters—unless and until the land or waters are (whether before or after 23 December 1996) used to any extent in a way that, apart from this Act, extinguishes native title in relation to the land or waters.

Exclusion by regulation

           (10)  The regulations may provide that an act is not a **_previous exclusive possession act_**.

Effect of exclusions

           (11)  To avoid doubt, the fact that an act is, because of any of the previous subsections, not a previous exclusive possession act does not imply that the act is not valid.

### Division 3—Future acts etc. and native title

#### Subdivision A—Preliminary

##### <a id="24AA"></a>24AA  Overview

Future acts

             (1)  This Division deals mainly with future acts, which are defined in section 233\. Acts that do not affect native title are not **_future acts_**; therefore this Division does not deal with them (see section 227 for the meaning of acts that **_affect_** native title).

Validity of future acts

             (2)  Basically, this Division provides that, to the extent that a future act affects native title, it will be valid if covered by certain provisions of the Division, and invalid if not.

Validity under indigenous land use agreements

             (3)  A future act will be valid if the parties to certain agreements (called indigenous land use agreements—see Subdivisions B, C and D) consent to the act being done. A future act (other than an intermediate period act) that has already been done invalidly may also be validated as a result of such agreements.

Other bases for validity

             (4)  A future act will also be valid to the extent covered by any of the following:

                     (a)  section 24FA (future acts where procedures indicate absence of native title);

                     (b)  section 24GB (acts permitting primary production on non-exclusive agricultural or pastoral leases);

                     (c)  section 24GD (acts permitting off-farm activities directly connected to primary production activities);

                     (d)  section 24GE (granting rights to third parties etc. on non-exclusive agricultural or pastoral leases);

                     (e)  section 24HA (management of water and airspace);

                      (f)  section 24IA (acts involving renewals and extensions etc. of acts);

                     (g)  section 24JA (acts involving reservations, leases etc.);

                     (h)  section 24KA (acts involving facilities for services to the public);

                      (i)  section 24LA (low impact future acts);

                      (j)  section 24MD (acts that pass the freehold test—but see subsection (5));

                     (k)  section 24NA (acts affecting offshore places).

Right to negotiate

             (5)  In the case of certain acts covered by section 24IC (permissible lease etc. renewals) or section 24MD (acts that pass the freehold test), for the acts to be valid it is also necessary to satisfy the requirements of Subdivision P (which provides a “right to negotiate”).

Extinguishment/non-extinguishment; procedural rights and compensation

             (6)  This Division provides that, in general, valid future acts are subject to the non-extinguishment principle. The Division also deals with procedural rights and compensation for the acts.

Activities etc. prevail over native title

             (7)  To avoid doubt, section 44H provides that a valid lease, licence, permit or authority, and any activity done under it, prevail over any native title rights and interests and their exercise.

Statutory access rights

             (8)  This Division confers access rights in respect of non-exclusive agricultural and non-exclusive pastoral leases on certain persons covered by registered native title claims (see Subdivision Q).

##### <a id="24AB"></a>24AB  Order of application of provisions

Indigenous land use agreement provisions

             (1)  To the extent that a future act is covered by section 24EB (which deals with the effect of indigenous land use agreements on future acts), it is not covered by any of the sections listed in paragraphs 24AA(4)(a) to (k).

Other provisions

             (2)  To the extent that a future act is covered by a particular section in the list in paragraphs 24AA(4)(a) to (k), it is not covered by a section that is lower in the list.

Note:          It is important to know under which particular provision a future act is valid because the consequences in terms of compensation and procedural rights may be different.

##### <a id="24AC"></a>24AC  Regulations about notification

Note 2:       If a future act covered by such a statement would otherwise be subject to the “right to negotiate” provisions in Subdivision P, the agreement must also include a statement that those provisions are not intended to apply: see paragraph 24EB(1)(c).

Note 3:       If the agreement involves the extinguishment of native title by surrender, it must include a statement to that effect: see paragraph 24EB(1)(d).

                     (b)  all persons holding native title in relation to any of the land or waters in the area covered by the agreement, who are not already parties to the agreement, were bound by the agreement in the same way as the registered native title bodies corporate, or the native title group, as the case may be.

Note:       The fact that, under the “right to negotiate” provisions in Subdivision P, agreements can be made after notice of an act is given as mentioned in section 29 does not prevent an indigenous land use agreement being made that consents to the doing of the act.

                     (d)  if the act is the surrender of native title under an agreement covered by Subdivision B or C—the agreement also includes a statement to the effect that the surrender is intended to extinguish the native title rights and interests.

##### <a id="24EBA"></a>24EBA  Effect of registration on previous acts covered by indigenous land use agreements

Coverage of section

             (1)  The consequences set out in this section apply if:

                     (a)  details are on the Register of Indigenous Land Use Agreements of an agreement that includes a statement to the effect that the parties agree to:

                              (i)  the validating of a particular future act (other than an intermediate period act), or future acts (other than intermediate period acts) included in classes, that have already been done invalidly; or

Note:       Intermediate period acts are or can be validated only under Division 2A.

                             (ii)  the validating, subject to conditions, of a particular future act (other than an intermediate period act), or of future acts (other than intermediate period acts) included in classes, that have already been done invalidly; or

                            (iii)  changing the effects, that are provided for by section 22B (which relates to native title rights and interests) or by a law of a State or Territory that contains provisions to the same effect, of an intermediate period act or of intermediate period acts included in classes; and

                     (b)  whichever of the Commonwealth, the State or the Territory to which the act or class of acts is attributable is a party to the agreement; and

                     (c)  where, whether under the agreement or otherwise, a person other than the Crown in right of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory is or may become liable to pay compensation in relation to the act or class of acts—that person is a party to the agreement.

Commonwealth future acts valid

             (2)  If subparagraph (1)(a)(i) or (ii) applies and the future act or class of future acts is attributable to the Commonwealth, the act or class of acts is valid, and is taken always to have been valid.

State or Territory laws may validate their future acts

             (3)  If subparagraph (1)(a)(i) or (ii) applies and the future act or class of future acts is attributable to a State or Territory, a law of the State or the Territory may provide that the act or class of acts is valid, and is taken always to have been valid. The law may do so by applying to all acts, to classes of acts, or to particular acts, to which subparagraph (1)(a)(i) or (ii) applies in respect of which the requirements of subsection (1) are or become satisfied.

Non-extinguishment principle applies to future acts

             (4)  If subsection (2) applies or a law makes provision in accordance with subsection (3), the non-extinguishment principle applies to the act or class of acts unless:

                     (a)  the act or class of acts is the surrender of native title; and

                     (b)  the agreement includes a statement to the effect that the surrender is intended to have extinguished the native title rights and interests.

Compensation consequences of future acts

             (5)  If subsection (2) applies or a law makes provision in accordance with subsection (3), the consequences set out in subsection 24EB(4), (5) or (6), and the consequences set out in subsection 24EB(7), apply to the act or to each of the acts in the class.

Changing the effects of validated acts

             (6)  If subparagraph (1)(a)(iii) applies, the effects mentioned in that subparagraph are changed in accordance with the agreement.

##### <a id="24EC"></a>24EC  Agreements unrelated to future acts

                   The fact that this Subdivision deals with agreements with native title holders that relate to their native title rights and interests does not imply that the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory cannot:

                     (a)  make other agreements; or

                     (b)  legislate in relation to the making of other agreements;

with native title holders that relate to their native title rights and interests (other than agreements consenting to the doing of future acts).

#### Subdivision F—Future acts: if procedures indicate absence of native title

                     (a)  any future act by any person in relation to the area that is done at that time is valid; and

                     (b)  if such an act extinguishes native title to any extent—the native title holders are entitled to compensation, in accordance with Division 5, for the act in so far as it has that effect; and

                     (c)  if the act mentioned in paragraph (a) does not so extinguish native title and the native title holders would be entitled to compensation under subsection 17(2) for the act on the assumption that it was a past act referred to in that subsection—they are entitled, in accordance with Division 5, to compensation for the act.

Who pays compensation

             (2)  The native title holders may recover the compensation from:

                     (a)  if the act is attributable to the Commonwealth—the Crown in right of the Commonwealth; or

Note:          For the renewal, re-grant, re-making or extension of certain acts covered by this section, see Subdivision I.

Farm tourism included

             (2)  This section applies to a future act that:

                     (a)  where the lease covered by paragraph (1)(a) is a non-exclusive pastoral lease covering an area greater than 5,000 hectares—the act has the effect that the majority of the area covered by the lease is required or permitted to be used for purposes other than pastoral purposes; or

                     (b)  in any case—the act converts a lease covered by paragraph (1)(a) into a lease conferring a right of exclusive possession, or into a freehold estate, over any of the land or waters covered by the lease.

Note:       If such an act is done in exercise of a legally conferred right, it could be covered by section 24ID. A lease conferring such rights or a freehold estate could be granted after a compulsory acquisition of native title under section 24MD or under certain indigenous land use agreements.

                     (b)  the lease mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) is a non-exclusive pastoral lease and the primary production activity mentioned in subparagraph (1)(d)(i) or (ii) is an agricultural activity;

before the future act is done, the person proposing to do the act must:

                     (c)  notify, in the way determined in writing by the Commonwealth Minister, any representative Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander bodies, registered native title bodies corporate and registered native title claimants in relation to the land or waters covered by the non-exclusive agricultural lease or non-exclusive pastoral lease that the act, or acts of that class, are to be done in relation to the particular land or waters; and

                     (d)  give them an opportunity to comment on the act or class of acts.

##### <a id="24GC"></a>24GC  Primary production etc. activities on non-exclusive agricultural or pastoral leases

                             (ii)  another activity, on the area covered by the lease, that is associated with or incidental to a primary production activity covered by subparagraph (i), provided that, when the other activity is being carried on, the majority of the area covered by the lease is used for primary production activities; and

                     (d)  at some time before 31 March 1998, the activity could have been done under any legislation then in force, or under any lease, licence, permit or authority that could have then been issued, in relation to the area covered by the lease, if any native title in relation to the area covered by the lease had not then existed.

Activities prevail over native title etc.

             (2)  To avoid doubt:

                     (a)  the doing of any activity mentioned in paragraph (1)(c) prevails over any native title rights and interests and any exercise of those rights and interests, but does not extinguish them; and

                     (b)  the existence and exercise of native title rights and interests do not prevent the carrying on of any such activity.

Note:          This subsection is not intended to imply that the person carrying on the activity is not subject to the laws of a State or Territory.

                     (a)  a freehold estate, an agricultural lease (see section 247) or a pastoral lease (see section 248) was granted on or before 23 December 1996; and

                     (b)  the grant was valid (including because of Division 2 or 2A); and

Note:       As at the commencement of this section, grants before 1 January 1994 that were invalid because of native title have been validated by or under Division 2.

                     (c)  the future act takes place after 23 December 1996; and

                     (d)  the future act is not:

                              (i)  the grant of a lease; or

                             (ii)  any act that confers a right of exclusive possession over land; and

                     (e)  the future act permits or requires the carrying on of grazing, or an activity consisting of or relating to gaining access to or taking water, that:

                              (i)  takes place while the freehold estate exists or the agricultural lease or pastoral lease (including as renewed on one or more occasions) is in force; and

                             (ii)  is directly connected to the carrying on of any primary production activity on the area covered by the freehold estate or the agricultural lease or pastoral lease; and

                            (iii)  takes place in an area adjoining or near the area covered by the freehold estate or the agricultural lease or pastoral lease; and

                            (iv)  does not prevent native title holders in relation to land or waters in the area in which the activity will be carried on from having reasonable access to the area; and

                      (f)  if:

                              (i)  before the future act is done, an approved determination of native title is made in relation to the land or waters on which any activity permitted or required by the future act takes place; and

                             (ii)  the determination is that native title exists in relation to the land or waters and that the native title rights and interests confer exclusive possession of the land or waters on the native title holders;

                            the doing of the activity is not inconsistent with the exercise of the native title rights and interests.

Example 1: An example of an act covered by this section is the conferral of rights to graze cattle in an area adjoining that covered by an agricultural lease or pastoral lease, if the cattle are also grazed in the area covered by the lease.

Example 2: Another example is the conferral of rights to take water from an area near that covered by an agricultural lease or pastoral lease, if the water is for use in carrying on primary production activities in the area covered by the lease.

##### <a id="24IA"></a>24IA  Future acts to which this section applies

                   This Subdivision applies to a future act if the act is:

                     (a)  a pre-existing right-based act (see section 24IB); or

                     (b)  a permissible lease etc. renewal (see section 24IC).

##### <a id="24IB"></a>24IB  Pre-existing right-based acts

                   A future act is a **_pre-existing right-based act_** if it takes place:

                     (a)  in exercise of a legally enforceable right created by any act done on or before 23 December 1996 that is valid (including because of Division 2 or 2A); or

                     (b)  in good faith in giving effect to, or otherwise because of, an offer, commitment, arrangement or undertaking made or given in good faith on or before 23 December 1996, and of which there is written evidence created at or about the time the offer, commitment, arrangement or undertaking was made.

##### <a id="24IC"></a>24IC  Future acts that are permissible lease etc. renewals

             (1)  A future act is a **_permissible lease etc. renewal_** if:

                     (a)  it is:

                              (i)  the renewal; or

                             (ii)  the re-grant or re-making; or

                            (iii)  the extension of the term;

                            of a lease, licence, permit or authority (the **_original lease etc._**) that is valid (including because of Division 2 or 2A); and

                     (b)  any of the following subparagraphs applies:

                              (i)  the original lease etc. was granted on or before 23 December 1996;

                             (ii)  the grant of the original lease etc. was a permissible lease etc. renewal or a pre-existing right-based act;

                            (iii)  the original lease etc. was created by an act covered by section 24GB, 24GD, 24GE or 24HA (which deal with certain acts in relation to primary production activities or involving management or regulation of water and airspace); and

                     (c)  the future act does not:

                              (i)  confer a right of exclusive possession over any of the land or waters covered by the original lease etc.; or

                             (ii)  otherwise create a larger proprietary interest in the land or waters than was created by the original lease etc.; or

                            (iii)  create a proprietary interest over any of the land or waters covered by the original lease etc., where the original lease etc. created only a non-proprietary interest; or

                            (iv)  if the original lease etc. was a non-exclusive pastoral lease covering an area greater than 5,000 hectares and the majority of the area covered was not required or permitted to be used for purposes other than pastoral purposes—have the effect that the majority of the area covered by the renewed, re-granted, re-made or extended lease is required or permitted to be used for purposes other than pastoral purposes; and

                     (d)  if the original lease etc. contains, or is subject to, a reservation or condition for the benefit of Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders—the renewed, re-granted, re-made or extended lease, licence, permit or authority contains, or is subject to, the same reservation or condition; and

                     (e)  if the original lease etc. did not permit mining—the renewed, re-granted, re-made or extended lease, licence, permit or authority does not permit mining.

Replacement by 2 or more leases etc.

             (2)  If 2 or more leases, licences, permits or authorities are granted in place of, respectively, a single lease, licence, permit or authority, then, for the purposes of subsection (1), each of the 2 or more grants is taken to be a **_renewal_** of the single lease, licence, permit or authority.

Features that do not prevent a lease etc. from being a renewal

             (3)  The features listed in subsection (4) do not prevent:

                     (a)  an act from being the renewal, re-grant, re-making, or extension of the term, of a lease, licence, permit or authority (the **_old authority_**) for the purposes of subsection (1) (the renewed, re-granted, re-made or extended lease, licence, permit or authority being the **_new authority_**); or

                     (b)  2 or more leases, licences, permits or authorities (each of which is a **_new authority_**) from being granted **_in place of_** a single lease, licence, permit or authority (the **_old authority_**) for the purposes of subsection (2).

Features

             (4)  The features are as follows:

                     (a)  the new authority, or the new authorities together, cover a smaller area than the old authority;

                     (b)  the term of the new authority, or of any of the new authorities, is longer than the term of the old authority;

                     (c)  the new authority or any of the new authorities is a perpetual lease (other than a mining lease);

                     (d)  if the new authority or any of the new authorities is a non-exclusive agricultural lease or a non-exclusive pastoral lease—the new authority permits or requires the carrying on of an activity that the old authority did not permit or require and that consists of:

                              (i)  a primary production activity (see section 24GA); or

                             (ii)  another activity, on the area covered by the new authority or of any of the new authorities, that is associated with or incidental to a primary production activity, provided that, when the other activity is being carried on, the use of the majority of the area covered by the new authority, or the new authorities together, will be for primary production activities.

##### <a id="24ID"></a>24ID  Effect of Subdivision applying to an act

             (1)  If this Subdivision applies to a future act:

                     (a)  subject to Subdivision P (which deals with the right to negotiate), the act is valid; and

Note:          Subdivision P applies only to certain renewals of mining leases etc.: see subsections 26(1A) and 26D(1).

                     (b)  if the act consists of the grant of a freehold estate, or the conferral of a right of exclusive possession, over particular land or waters—the act extinguishes any native title in relation to the land or waters; and

Note:       The only acts to which this paragraph applies are certain acts covered by section 24IB.

                     (c)  in any other case—the non-extinguishment principle applies to the act; and

                     (d)  in any case—the native title holders are entitled to compensation for the act in accordance with Division 5.

Who pays compensation

             (2)  The compensation is payable by:

                     (a)  if the act is attributable to the Commonwealth—the Crown in right of the Commonwealth; or

                     (b)  if the act is attributable to a State or Territory—the Crown in right of the State or Territory.

Notification

             (3)  If paragraph (1)(b) applied in relation to the future act, then, before the act is done, the person proposing to do the act must:

                     (a)  notify, in the way determined in writing by the Commonwealth Minister, any representative Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander bodies, registered native title bodies corporate and registered native title claimants in relation to the land or waters that will be affected by the act that the act, or acts of that class, are to be done in relation to the land or waters concerned; and

                     (b)  give them an opportunity to comment on the act or class of acts.

Other procedural rights

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  the act is a permissible lease etc. renewal of a non-exclusive agricultural lease (see section 247B) or a non-exclusive pastoral lease (see section 248B); and

                     (b)  the act is covered by paragraph 24IC(4)(b) or (c);

subsection 24MD(6B) applies to the act as if the act were a compulsory acquisition, of the kind mentioned in that subsection, of native title rights and interests in relation to the land or waters that will be affected by the act, done by:

                     (c)  if the act is attributable to the Commonwealth—the Commonwealth; or

                     (d)  if the act is attributable to a State or Territory—that State or Territory.

#### Subdivision J—Reservations, leases etc.

##### <a id="24JA"></a>24JA  Acts covered by this Subdivision

Reservations etc.

             (1)  This Subdivision applies to a future act (the **_later act_**) if:

                     (a)  an act (the **_earlier act_**) took place before the later act and on or before 23 December 1996; and

                     (b)  the earlier act was valid (including because of Division 2 or 2A); and

                     (c)  the earlier act:

                              (i)  was done by the Crown in right of the Commonwealth, a State or Territory; or

                             (ii)  consisted of the making, amendment or repeal of legislation by the Commonwealth, a State or Territory: and

                     (d)  the earlier act contained, made or conferred a reservation, proclamation, dedication, condition, permission or authority (the **_reservation_**) under which the whole or part of any land or waters was to be used for a particular purpose; and

                     (e)  the later act is done in good faith:

                              (i)  under or in accordance with the reservation; or

                             (ii)  in the area covered by the reservation, so long as the act’s impact on native title is no greater than the impact that any act that could have been done under or in accordance with the reservation would have had.

Example 1: A future act consisting of the creation of a national park management plan might be covered by subparagraph (e)(i), if the land concerned was reserved for the establishment of the national park before 23 December 1996.

Example 2: A future act consisting of the grant of a forestry licence might be covered by that subparagraph, if the grant is done under or in accordance with a dedication for forestry purposes made before 23 December 1996.

Example 3: Subparagraph (e)(ii) might apply if particular land was reserved as a hospital site before 23 December 1996, and instead a school is later built on the land.

Leases

             (2)  This Subdivision also applies to a future act (the **_later act_**) if:

                     (b)  the earlier act was valid (including because of Division 2 or 2A); and

                     (c)  the earlier act was done by the Crown in right of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; and

                     (d)  the earlier act consisted of the grant of a lease to a statutory authority of the Commonwealth, the State or the Territory, where:

                              (i)  under the lease, the whole or part of any land or waters covered by the lease was to be used for a particular purpose; or

                             (ii)  there is written evidence, created at any time on or before 23 December 1996 by the Commonwealth, the State or the Territory, that the whole or part of any land or waters covered by the lease was to be used for a particular purpose; and

                     (e)  the later act is done in good faith and consists of the use, by the statutory authority or any person, of the land or waters for the particular purpose.

                     (b)  if the act is attributable to a State or Territory—the Crown in right of the State or Territory.

Notification of public works

             (6)  If the act consists of the construction or establishment of a public work, then, before the act is done, the person proposing to do the act must:

                     (a)  notify, in the way determined in writing by the Commonwealth Minister, any representative Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander bodies, registered native title bodies corporate and registered native title claimants in relation to the land or waters covered by the reservation or lease that the act, or acts of that class, are to be done in relation to the land or waters; and

                     (b)  give them an opportunity to comment on the act or class of acts.

Notification of national, State and Territory park management plans

             (7)  If the act consists of the creation of a plan for the management of a national, State or Territory park intended to preserve the natural environment of an area, then, before the act is done, the person proposing to do the act must:

#### Subdivision K—Facilities for services to the public

##### <a id="24KA"></a>24KA  Facilities for services to the public

Coverage of Subdivision

             (1)  This Subdivision applies to a future act if:

                     (a)  it relates, to any extent, to an onshore place; and

                     (b)  it either:

                              (i)  permits or requires the construction, operation, use, maintenance or repair, by or on behalf of any person, of any of the things listed in subsection (2) that is to be operated, or is operated, for the general public; or

                             (ii)  consists of the construction, operation, use, maintenance or repair, by or on behalf of the Crown, or a local government body or other statutory authority of the Crown, in any of its capacities, of any of the things listed in subsection (2) that is to be operated, or is operated, for the general public; and

                     (c)  it does not prevent native title holders in relation to land or waters on which the thing is located or to be located from having reasonable access to such land or waters in the vicinity of the thing, except:

                              (i)  while the thing is being constructed; or

                             (ii)  for reasons of health and safety; and

                     (d)  a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory makes provision in relation to the preservation or protection of areas, or sites, that may be:

                              (i)  in the area in which the act is done; and

                             (ii)  of particular significance to Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders in accordance with their traditions.

Compulsory acquisitions not covered

          (1A)  To avoid doubt, this Subdivision does not apply to a future act that is the compulsory acquisition of the whole or part of any native title rights and interests.

Facilities etc.

             (2)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), the things are as follows:

                     (a)  a road, railway, bridge or other transport facility (other than an airport or port);

                     (b)  a jetty or wharf; 

                     (c)  a navigation marker or other navigational facility;

                     (d)  an electricity transmission or distribution facility;

                     (e)  lighting of streets or other public places;

                      (f)  a gas transmission or distribution facility;

                     (g)  a well, or a bore, for obtaining water;

                      (i)  a drainage facility, or a levee or other device for management of water flows;

                      (j)  an irrigation channel or other irrigation facility;

                     (k)  a sewerage facility, other than a treatment facility;

                      (l)  a cable, antenna, tower or other communication facility;

                    (m)  any other thing that is similar to any one or more of the things mentioned in the paragraphs above.

Validation of act

             (3)  If this Subdivision applies to a future act, the act is valid.

Non-extinguishment principle

             (4)  The non-extinguishment principle applies to the act.

Compensation

             (5)  If any native title holders would be entitled to compensation under subsection 17(2) for the act on the assumption that it was a past act referred to in that section, the native title holders are entitled to compensation for the act in accordance with Division 5.

Who pays compensation

             (6)  The native title holders may recover the compensation from:

                     (a)  if the act is attributable to the Commonwealth:

                              (i)  if a law of the Commonwealth provides that a person other than the Crown in right of the Commonwealth is liable to pay the compensation—that person; or

                             (ii)  if not—the Crown in right of the Commonwealth; or

                     (b)  if the act is attributable to a State or Territory:

                              (i)  if a law of the State or Territory provides that a person other than the Crown in any capacity is liable to pay the compensation—that person; or

                             (ii)  if not—the Crown in right of the State or Territory.

Procedural rights

             (7)  The native title holders, and any registered native title claimants in relation to land or waters in the area concerned, have the same procedural rights as they would have in relation to the act on the assumption that they instead held:

                     (a)  to the extent (if any) that the land concerned is covered by a non-exclusive agricultural lease (see section 247B) or a non-exclusive pastoral lease (see section 248B)—a lease of that kind; or

                     (b)  to the extent (if any) that paragraph (a) does not apply—ordinary title;

covering any land concerned or covering the land adjoining, or surrounding, any waters concerned.

Native title rights and interests to be considered

          (7A)  If, in the exercise of those procedural rights, the native title holders are entitled to have matters considered, those matters include their native title rights and interests.

Satisfying the right to be notified

             (8)  If:

                     (a)  because of subsection (7) or any law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, the native title holders have a procedural right that requires another person to notify them of the act; and

                     (b)  there has been no approved determination of the native title;

then one way in which the person may give the required notification is by notifying, in the way determined in writing by the Commonwealth Minister for the purposes of this subsection the following that the act is to take place:

                     (c)  any representative Aboriginal/Torres Islander bodies for the area concerned;

                     (d)  any registered native title claimants in relation to land or waters in the area concerned.

Satisfying other procedural rights

             (9)  If:

                     (a)  because of subsection (7) or any law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, the native title holders have a procedural right that requires another person to do any thing in relation to the native title holders; and

                     (b)  there has been no approved determination of the native title;

then one way in which the person may give effect to the requirement is:

                     (c)  by doing the thing in relation to any registered native title claimant in relation to land or waters in the area concerned; or

                     (d)  if there are no such registered native title claimants—by ensuring that any representative Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander bodies for the area concerned have an opportunity to comment on the doing of the act.

#### Subdivision L—Low impact future acts

##### <a id="24LA"></a>24LA  Low impact future acts

             (1)  This Subdivision applies to a future act in relation to particular land or waters if:

                     (a)  the act takes place before, and does not continue after, an approved determination of native title is made in relation to the land or waters, if the determination is that native title exists; and

                     (b)  the act does not consist of, authorise or otherwise involve:

                              (i)  the grant of a freehold estate in any of the land or waters; or

                             (ii)  the grant of a lease over any of the land or waters; or

                            (iii)  the conferral of a right of exclusive possession over any of the land or waters; or

                            (iv)  the excavation or clearing of any of the land or waters; or

                             (v)  mining (other than fossicking by using hand-held implements); or

                            (vi)  the construction or placing on the land, or in the waters, of any building, structure, or other thing (other than fencing or a gate), that is a fixture; or

                           (vii)  the disposal or storing, on the land or in the waters, of any garbage or any poisonous, toxic or hazardous substance.

Exclusion for public health or safety etc.

             (2)  Subparagraph (1)(b)(iv) does not apply to:

                     (a)  excavation or clearing that is reasonably necessary for the protection of public health or public safety; or

                     (b)  tree lopping, clearing of noxious or introduced animal or plant species, foreshore reclamation, regeneration or environmental assessment or protection activities.

Validation of act

             (3)  If this Subdivision applies to a future act, the act is valid.

Non-extinguishment

             (4)  The non-extinguishment principle applies to the act.

#### Subdivision M—Acts passing the freehold test

##### <a id="24MA"></a>24MA  Legislative acts

                   This Subdivision applies to a future act if it is the making, amendment or repeal of legislation and:

                     (a)  the act applies in the same way to the native title holders concerned as it would if they instead held ordinary title to the land (or to the land adjoining, or surrounding, the waters) affected; or

                     (b)  the effect of the act on the native title in relation to the land or the waters is not such as to cause the native title holders to be in a more disadvantageous position at law than they would be if they instead held ordinary title to the land (or to the land adjoining, or surrounding, the waters).

Example 1: An example of a future act covered by paragraph (a) is the making of legislation that permits mining on land in respect of which there is either native title or ordinary title.

Example 2: An example of a future act covered by paragraph (b) is the amendment of legislation that permits mining on land that is subject to ordinary title so that it will also permit mining, on the same terms, on land in relation to which native title exists.

##### <a id="24MB"></a>24MB  Non-legislative acts

Freehold test

             (1)  This Subdivision applies to a future act if:

                     (a)  it is an act other than the making, amendment or repeal of legislation; and

                     (b)  either:

                              (i)  the act could be done in relation to the land concerned if the native title holders concerned instead held ordinary title to it; or

                             (ii)  the act could be done in relation to the waters concerned if the native title holders concerned held ordinary title to the land adjoining, or surrounding, the waters; and

                     (c)  a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory makes provision in relation to the preservation or protection of areas, or sites, that may be:

                              (i)  in the area to which the act relates; and

                             (ii)  of particular significance to Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders in accordance with their traditions.

Example:    An example of a future act covered by this subsection is the grant of a mining lease over land in relation to which there is native title when a mining lease would also be able to be granted over the land if the native title holders instead held ordinary title to it.

Opal or gem mining

             (2)  This Subdivision also applies to a future act if:

                     (a)  it is an act other than the making, amendment or repeal of legislation; and

                     (b)  it is not covered by subsection (1); and

                     (c)  it consists of the creation or variation of a right to mine for opals or gems; and

                     (d)  a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory makes provision in relation to the preservation or protection of areas, or sites, that may be:

                              (i)  in the area to which the act relates; and

                             (ii)  of particular significance to Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders in accordance with their traditions.

##### <a id="24MC"></a>24MC  Only onshore places covered

                   However, this Subdivision only applies to a future act to the extent that it relates to an onshore place. A reference to an act to which this Subdivision applies is to be read as referring to the act to that extent only.

##### <a id="24MD"></a>24MD  Treatment of acts that pass the freehold test

Validation of act

             (1)  If this Subdivision applies to a future act, then, subject to Subdivision P (which deals with the right to negotiate), the act is valid.

Extinguishment of native title by compulsory acquisition

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  the act is the compulsory acquisition of the whole or part of any native title rights and interests under a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory that permits both:

                              (i)  the compulsory acquisition by the Commonwealth, the State or the Territory of native title rights and interests; and

                             (ii)  the compulsory acquisition by the Commonwealth, the State or the Territory of non-native title rights and interests in relation to land or waters; and

                     (b)  the whole, or the equivalent part, of all non-native title rights and interests, in relation to the land or waters to which the native title rights and interests that are compulsorily acquired relate, is also acquired (whether compulsorily or by surrender, cancellation or resumption or otherwise) in connection with the compulsory acquisition of the native title rights and interests; and

                    (ba)  the practices and procedures adopted in acquiring the native title rights and interests are not such as to cause the native title holders any greater disadvantage than is caused to the holders of non-native title rights and interests when their rights and interests are acquired;

then:

                     (c)  the compulsory acquisition extinguishes the whole or the part of the native title rights and interests; and

                     (d)  if compensation on just terms is provided under a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory to the native title holders for the compulsory acquisition, and they request that the whole or part of any such compensation should be in a form other than money, the person providing the compensation must:

                              (i)  consider the request; and

                             (ii)  negotiate in good faith in relation to the request; and

                     (e)  if compensation on just terms is not provided under a law of the Commonwealth, a State or Territory to the native title holders for the compulsory acquisition, they are entitled to compensation for the acquisition in accordance with Division 5.

Note 1:       Subdivision P (which deals with the right to negotiate) applies to some acquisitions.

Note 2:       This subsection only deals with the case where native title rights and interests are compulsorily acquired. It is also possible for native title rights and interests to be acquired voluntarily by means of an indigenous land use agreement or an agreement covered by subsection (2A). In such cases, non-native title rights and interests could be acquired either compulsorily or by some other means (e.g. voluntarily).

Extinguishment of native title by surrender in course of right to negotiate process

          (2A)  If:

                     (a)  notice of a proposed compulsory acquisition of native title rights and interests is given in accordance with section 29 or with an equivalent alternative provision applicable under section 43 or 43A; and

                     (b)  an agreement arose out of negotiations in relation to the proposed compulsory acquisition of the native title rights and interests; and

                     (c)  the agreement includes a statement to the effect that an act consisting of the surrender of the whole or part of the native title rights and interests is intended to extinguish the whole or the part of the native title rights and interests;

then:

                     (d)  the surrender extinguishes the whole or the part of the native title rights and interests; and

                     (e)  no native title holder who is entitled to any benefit provided under the agreement is entitled to any compensation for the act under this Act, other than compensation provided for in the agreement; and

                      (f)  any other native title holder is entitled to compensation for the act in accordance with Division 5.

Non-extinguishment and compensation

             (3)  In the case of any future act to which this Subdivision applies that is not covered by subsection (2) or (2A):

                     (a)  the non-extinguishment principle applies to the act; and

                     (b)  if the following conditions are satisfied:

                              (i)  the similar compensable interest test is satisfied in relation to the act; and

                             (ii)  the law mentioned in section 240 (which defines **_similar compensable interest test_**) does not provide for compensation to the native title holders for the act;

                            the native title holders are entitled to compensation for the act in accordance with Division 5.

Who pays compensation

             (4)  The native title holders may recover the compensation from:

                     (a)  if the act is attributable to the Commonwealth:

                              (i)  if a law of the Commonwealth provides that a person other than the Crown in right of the Commonwealth is liable to pay the compensation—that person; or

                             (ii)  if not—the Crown in right of the Commonwealth; or

                     (b)  if the act is attributable to a State or Territory:

                              (i)  if a law of the State or Territory provides that a person other than the Crown in any capacity is liable to pay the compensation—that person; or

                             (ii)  if not—the Crown in right of the State or Territory.

Exception for certain lessees

             (5)  If:

                     (a)  the act is the compulsory acquisition of the whole or part of any native title rights and interests; and

                     (b)  the land or waters concerned are to any extent the subject of a non-exclusive agricultural lease or a non-exclusive pastoral lease;

then, despite subsection (4):

                     (c)  the native title holders are not entitled to recover the compensation from the lessee; and

                     (d)  if the act is attributable to the Commonwealth—the native title holders may recover the compensation from the Crown in right of the Commonwealth; and

                     (e)  if the act is attributable to a State or Territory—the native title holders may recover the compensation from the Crown in right of the State or Territory.

Consequences of certain acts

             (6)  In the case of any future act to which this Subdivision applies, other than:

                     (a)  an act to which Subdivision P (which deals with the right to negotiate) applies; or

                     (b)  an act determined under section 26A to be an approved exploration etc. act; or

                     (c)  an act determined under section 26B to be an approved gold or tin mining act; or

                     (d)  an act covered by section 26C (which deals with opal or gem mining);

the consequences in subsections (6A) and (6B) apply.

Procedural rights 

          (6A)  The native title holders, and any registered native title claimants in relation to the land or waters concerned, have the same procedural rights as they would have in relation to the act on the assumption that they instead held ordinary title to any land concerned and to the land adjoining, or surrounding, any waters concerned.

Other consequences

          (6B)  If the act is:

                     (a)  the compulsory acquisition of native title rights and interests for the purpose of conferring rights or interests in relation to the land or waters concerned on persons other than the Commonwealth, the State or the Territory to which the act is attributable; or

                     (b)  the creation or variation of a right to mine for the sole purpose of the construction of an infrastructure facility (see section 253) associated with mining;

Note:          The acts covered by paragraphs (a) and (b) are not covered by Subdivision P: see subsection (6) and paragraph 26(1)(c).

the following consequences also apply:

                     (c)  the Commonwealth, the State or the Territory to which the act is attributable must notify each of the following:

                              (i)  any registered native title claimant (a **_claimant_**) in relation to the land or waters; and

                             (ii)  any native title body corporate (a **_body corporate_**), in relation to the land or waters; and

                            (iii)  any representative Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander body in relation to the land or waters;

                            that the act is to be done; and

                     (d)  any claimant or body corporate may object, within 2 months after the notification, to the doing of the act so far as it affects their registered native title rights and interests; and

                     (e)  either:

                              (i)  in a paragraph (a) case—the Commonwealth, the State or the Territory; or

                             (ii)  in a paragraph (b) case—the person who requested or applied for the doing of the act;

                            must consult any claimants, and bodies corporate, who object, about ways of minimising the act’s impact on registered native title rights and interests in relation to the land or waters, and, if relevant, any access to the land or waters or the way in which any thing authorised by the act might be done; and

                      (f)  if any claimant or body corporate objects, as mentioned in paragraph (d), to the doing of the act and so requests, the Commonwealth, the State or the Territory must ensure that the objection is heard by an independent person or body; and

                     (g)  if the independent person or body hearing any objection as mentioned in paragraph (f) makes a determination upholding the objection, or that contains conditions about the doing of the act that relate to registered native title rights and interests, the determination must be complied with unless:

                              (i)  the Minister of the Commonwealth, the State or the Territory responsible for indigenous affairs is consulted; and

                             (ii)  the consultation is taken into account; and

                            (iii)  it is in the interests of the Commonwealth, the State or the Territory not to comply with the determination.

Meaning of **determination**

          (6C)  In paragraph (6B)(g):

                    <a name="determin"></a>**_determination_** includes recommendation.

                    <a name="interest"></a>**_in the interests of_** the Commonwealth, the State or the Territory includes:

                     (a)  for the social or economic benefit of the Commonwealth, the State or the Territory (including of Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders); and

                     (b)  in the interests of the relevant region or locality in the Commonwealth, the State or the Territory.

Satisfying the right to be notified

             (7)  If:

                     (a)  because of subsection (6A) or any law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, the native title holders have a procedural right that requires another person to notify them of the act; and

                     (b)  there has been no approved determination of the native title;

then one way in which the person may give the required notification is by notifying, in the way determined in writing by the Commonwealth Minister for the purposes of this subsection, the following that the act is to take place:

                     (c)  any representative Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander bodies for the area concerned;

                     (d)  any registered native title claimants in relation to land or waters in the area concerned.

Satisfying other procedural rights

             (8)  If:

                     (a)  because of subsection (6A) or any law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, the native title holders have a procedural right that requires another person to do any thing in relation to the native title holders; and

                     (b)  there has been no approved determination of the native title;

then one way in which the person may give effect to the requirement is:

                     (c)  by doing the thing in relation to any registered native title claimant in relation to land or waters in the area concerned; or

                     (d)  if there are no such registered native title claimants—by ensuring that any representative Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander bodies for the area concerned have an opportunity to comment on the doing of the act.

#### Subdivision N—Acts affecting offshore places

##### <a id="24NA"></a>24NA  Acts affecting offshore places

Coverage of Subdivision

             (1)  This Subdivision applies to a future act to the extent that it relates to an offshore place. A reference to a future act to which this Subdivision applies is to be read as referring to the act to that extent only.

Validation of act

             (2)  If this Subdivision applies to a future act, the act is valid.

Extinguishment of native title by compulsory acquisition

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  the act is the compulsory acquisition of the whole or part of any native title rights and interests under a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory that permits both:

                              (i)  the compulsory acquisition by the Commonwealth, the State or the Territory of native title rights and interests; and

                             (ii)  the compulsory acquisition by the Commonwealth, the State or the Territory of non-native title rights and interests in relation to land or waters; and

                     (b)  the whole, or the equivalent part, of all non-native title rights and interests, in relation to the land or waters to which the native title rights and interests that are compulsorily acquired relate, is also acquired (whether compulsorily or by surrender, cancellation or resumption or otherwise) in connection with the compulsory acquisition of the native title rights and interests; and

                     (c)  the practices and procedures adopted in acquiring the native title rights and interests are not such as to cause the native title holders any greater disadvantage than is caused to the holders of non-native title rights and interests when their rights and interests are acquired;

then the compulsory acquisition extinguishes the whole or the part of the native title rights and interests.

Non-extinguishment principle

             (4)  In the case of any other future act to which this Subdivision applies, the non-extinguishment principle applies to the act.

Compensation where compulsory acquisition

             (5)  If this Subdivision applies to a future act consisting of the compulsory acquisition of the whole or part of any native title rights and interests:

                     (a)  if compensation on just terms is provided under a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory to the native title holders for the acquisition, and they request that the whole or part of any such compensation should be in a form other than money, the person providing the compensation must:

                              (i)  consider the request; and

                             (ii)  negotiate in good faith in relation to the request; and

                     (b)  if compensation on just terms is not provided under a law of the Commonwealth, a State or Territory to the native title holders for the acquisition, they are entitled to compensation for the acquisition in accordance with Division 5.

Compensation for other acts

             (6)  In the case of any other future act to which this Subdivision applies, the native title holders are entitled to compensation for the act in accordance with Division 5.

Who pays compensation

             (7)  The native title holders may recover the compensation from:

                     (a)  if the act is attributable to the Commonwealth:

                              (i)  if a law of the Commonwealth provides that a person other than the Crown in right of the Commonwealth is liable to pay the compensation—that person; or

                             (ii)  if not—the Crown in right of the Commonwealth; or

                     (b)  if the act is attributable to a State or Territory:

                              (i)  if a law of the State or Territory provides that a person other than the Crown in any capacity is liable to pay the compensation—that person; or

                             (ii)  if not—the Crown in right of the State or Territory.

Procedural rights

             (8)  In the case of any future act to which this Subdivision applies, the native title holders, and any registered native title claimants in relation to land or waters in the area concerned, have the same procedural rights as they would have in relation to the act on the assumption that they instead held any corresponding rights and interests in relation to the offshore place that are not native title rights and interests.

Satisfying the right to be notified

             (9)  If:

                     (a)  because of subsection (8) or any law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, the native title holders have a procedural right that requires another person to notify them of the act; and

                     (b)  there has been no approved determination of the native title;

then one way in which the person may give the required notification is by notifying, in the way determined in writing by the Commonwealth Minister for the purposes of this subsection, the following that the act is to take place:

                     (c)  any representative Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander bodies for the area concerned;

                     (d)  any registered native title claimants in relation to land or waters in the area concerned.

Satisfying other procedural rights

           (10)  If:

                     (a)  because of subsection (8) or any law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, the native title holders have a procedural right that requires another person to do any thing in relation to the native title holders; and

                     (b)  there has been no approved determination of the native title;

then one way in which the person may give effect to the requirement is:

                     (c)  by doing the thing in relation to any registered native title claimant in relation to land or waters in the area concerned; or

                     (d)  if there are no such registered native title claimants—by ensuring that any representative Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander bodies for the area concerned have an opportunity to comment on the doing of the act.

#### Subdivision O—Future acts invalid unless otherwise provided

##### <a id="24OA"></a>24OA  Future acts invalid unless otherwise provided

                   Unless a provision of this Act provides otherwise, a future act is invalid to the extent that it affects native title.

#### Subdivision P—Right to negotiate

##### <a id="25"></a>25  Overview of Subdivision

             (1)  In summary, this Subdivision applies to certain future acts done by the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory that are of any of the following kinds:

                    (aa)  certain acts covered by section 24IC (which deals with permissible lease etc. renewals);

                     (a)  certain conferrals of mining rights;

                     (b)  certain compulsory acquisitions of native title rights and interests;

                     (c)  other acts approved by the Commonwealth Minister.

             (2)  Before the future act is done, the parties must negotiate with a view to reaching an agreement about the act.

             (3)  If they do not reach agreement, an arbitral body, or a Minister, will make a determination about the act instead.

             (4)  If the procedures in this Subdivision are not complied with, the act will be invalid to the extent that it affects native title.

             (5)  States and Territories may make their own laws as alternatives to this Subdivision. The Commonwealth Minister must be satisfied as to certain matters before such laws can take effect.

Note:          The fact that action is being taken to comply with this Subdivision does not imply that action under another law, such as processing requests or applications in respect of the act, cannot be taken at the same time.

##### <a id="26"></a>26  When Subdivision applies

Subdivision applies to certain permissible lease etc. renewals

          (1A)  This Subdivision applies to a future act if:

                     (a)  section 24IC (which deals with permissible lease etc. renewals) applies to the act; and

                     (b)  the act is done by the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory (the **_Government party_**); and

                     (c)  the renewal, re-grant, re-making or extension of the term of the lease, licence, permit or authority concerned creates a right to mine.

Subdivision also applies to certain future acts

             (1)  This Subdivision also applies to a future act if:

                     (a)  Subdivision M (which deals with acts that pass the freehold test) applies to the act; and

Note:       That Subdivision only applies to an act to the extent that the act relates to an onshore place: see section 24MC.

                     (b)  the act is done by the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory (the **_Government party_**); and

                     (c)  subject to this section, the act is:

                              (i)  the creation of a right to mine, whether by the grant of a mining lease or otherwise, except one created for the sole purpose of the construction of an infrastructure facility (see section 253) associated with mining; or

Note:       Rights to mine created for the sole purpose of the construction of an infrastructure facility associated with mining are dealt with in subsection 24MD(6B).

                             (ii)  the variation of such a right, to extend the area to which it relates; or

                            (iii)  the compulsory acquisition of native title rights and interests, unless:

                                        (A)  the purpose of the acquisition is to confer rights or interests in relation to the land or waters concerned on the Government party and the Government party makes a statement in writing to that effect before the acquisition takes place; or

                                        (B)  the purpose of the acquisition is to provide an infrastructure facility; or

Note:       Certain compulsory acquisitions covered by sub-subparagraphs (iii)(A) and (B) are dealt with in subsection 24MD(6B).

                            (iv)  any other act approved by the Commonwealth Minister, in writing, for the purposes of this paragraph, where, if the act is attributable to a State or Territory, the Commonwealth Minister consulted the State Minister or the Territory Minister about the approval before giving it.

Exclusions

             (2)  This Subdivision does not apply to the extent that the act is:

                     (a)  an act covered by section 24EB (which deals with the effects of indigenous land use agreements) or by any of the sections listed in paragraphs 24AA(4)(a) to (i); or

                     (b)  an act determined in writing by the Commonwealth Minister to be an approved exploration etc. act (see section 26A); or

                     (c)  an act determined in writing by the Commonwealth Minister to be an approved gold or tin mining act (see section 26B); or

                     (d)  an act excluded by section 26C (which deals with opal or gem mining) from the coverage of this Subdivision; or

                     (e)  an act excluded by section 26D (which deals with renewals of valid mining leases etc.) from the coverage of this Subdivision; or

                      (f)  an act that is the compulsory acquisition of native title rights and interests and that relates solely to land or waters wholly within a town or city (see section 251C).

Note:          Under sections 43 and 43A, a State or Territory may, in certain circumstances, make alternative provisions to the regime provided for by this Subdivision.

Sea and intertidal zone excluded

             (3)  This Subdivision only applies to the act to the extent that the act relates to a place that is on the landward side of the mean high-water mark of the sea. A reference to an act to which this Subdivision applies is to be read as referring to the act to that extent only.

##### <a id="26A"></a>26A  Approved exploration etc. acts

             (1)  If the conditions in this section are satisfied, the Commonwealth Minister may determine in writing that an act, or that each act included in a class of acts, is an **_approved exploration etc. act_**.

First condition

             (2)  The first condition is that the act, or acts included in the class, consist of the creation or variation of a right to mine, where the right as so created or varied is a right to explore, a right to prospect or a right to fossick.

Second condition

             (3)  The second condition is that the Minister is satisfied that the act or acts are unlikely to have a significant impact on the particular land or waters concerned.

Drilling and second condition

             (4)  If the act or acts authorise drilling, this does not mean that the second condition cannot be satisfied.

Third condition

             (5)  The third condition is that the Minister has:

                              (i)  registered native title bodies corporate; and

                             (ii)  registered native title claimants; and

                            (iii)  representative Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander bodies;

                            in relation to any of the land or waters that will be affected by the act or acts will have a right to be notified that the act or each act included in the class is to be done; and

                     (b)  any such persons or bodies will have a right to be heard by an independent person or body about:

                     (c)  either:

                              (i)  the person, or one of the persons, who will do any thing authorised by the act will have a legal obligation to consult appropriately any person or body covered by subparagraph (a)(i) or (ii), unless the person or body indicates that the person or body does not wish to be so consulted; or

                             (ii)  procedures will be in place under which such consultation will be required;

                            for the purpose of minimising the impact of the act on the exercise of native title rights and interests in relation to land or waters that will be affected by the act, and in particular about the matters set out in subsection (7).

Matters relevant to fourth condition

             (7)  The matters are:

                             (ii)  affects the native title rights and interests;

                            is to be done.

Revocation of determination

             (8)  If, at any time after making the determination, the Commonwealth Minister considers that circumstances have changed to the extent that the conditions in this section would not be satisfied if he or she were making the determination at that time, the Commonwealth Minister must:

                     (a)  if the act or acts are done by a State or Territory:

                              (i)  advise the State Minister or the Territory Minister concerned in writing of the fact; and

                             (ii)  if at the end of 90 days, or such longer period as the Commonwealth Minister allows, after doing so, the conditions in this section would still not be satisfied—in writing, revoke the determination; or

                     (b)  if the act or acts are done by the Commonwealth—in writing, revoke the determination.

##### <a id="26B"></a>26B  Approved gold or tin mining acts

             (1)  If the conditions in this section are satisfied, the Commonwealth Minister may determine in writing that each act included in a class of acts done by a State or Territory is an **_approved gold or tin mining act_**.

First condition

             (2)  The first condition is that the relevant State Minister or Territory Minister has requested the Commonwealth Minister in writing to make such a determination in relation to acts in the class.

Second condition

                     (c)  the practical effect of the exercise of those existing rights and interests, and that existing use, on the exercise of any native title rights and interests in relation to the land or waters concerned.

##### <a id="34"></a>34  No agreement if determination

                   An agreement of the kind mentioned in paragraph 31(1)(b) has no effect in relation to the act for the purposes of this Subdivision if it is made after the making of a determination under section 36A or 38.

##### <a id="35"></a>35  Application for arbitral body determination

             (1)  Any negotiation party may apply to the arbitral body for a determination under section 38 in relation to the act if:

Withdrawal of application

             (2)  At any time before a determination in relation to the act is made under section 36A or 38, the negotiation party may withdraw the application by giving notice to the arbitral body.

Negotiations for an agreement

             (3)  Even though the application has been made, the negotiation parties may continue to negotiate with a view to obtaining an agreement of the kind mentioned in paragraph 31(1)(b) before a determination in relation to the act is made under section 36A or 38\. If they make such an agreement before such a determination is made, the application is taken to have been withdrawn.

##### <a id="36"></a>36  Arbitral body determination to be made as soon as practicable

             (1)  Subject to section 37, the arbitral body must take all reasonable steps to make a determination in relation to the act as soon as practicable.

Determination not to be made where failure to negotiate in good faith

             (2)  If any negotiation party satisfies the arbitral body that any other negotiation party (other than a native title party) did not negotiate in good faith as mentioned in paragraph 31(1)(b), the arbitral body must not make the determination on the application.

Note:          It would be possible for a further application to be made under section 35.

Report to Commonwealth Minister

             (3)  If the arbitral body is the NNTT and it does not make the determination within the period of 6 months starting when the application is made, it must, as soon as is reasonably practicable after the end of the period, advise the Commonwealth Minister in writing of the reason for it not doing so and include in that advice an estimate of when a determination is likely to be made.

Relevant Minister may give arbitral body notice as to urgency

             (4)  At any time later than 4 months after a negotiation party has made an application under section 35 that has not been withdrawn, and before either:

                     (a)  the negotiation parties have made an agreement of the kind mentioned in paragraph 31(1)(b); or

                     (b)  the arbitral body has made a determination under section 38;

the relevant Minister may give a written notice to the arbitral body requesting the arbitral body to make such a determination within the period specified in the notice. The period must end at a time later than 6 months after the application under section 35 was made.

##### <a id="36A"></a>36A  Ministerial determination if arbitral body determination delayed

Relevant Minister may make determination

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  the arbitral body has not made a determination in relation to the act within the period specified in a notice under subsection 36(4); and

                     (b)  no agreement of the kind mentioned in paragraph 31(1)(b) has been made in relation to the act; and

                     (d)  the requirements of section 36B are met;

the relevant Minister may, subject to this section, make a determination in relation to the act.

Requirement for State/Territory Minister to consult before making determination

                     (a)  the relevant Minister is a State Minister or a Territory Minister; and

                     (b)  the determination is that the act may be done or may be done subject to conditions to be complied with by any of the parties;

the relevant Minister may only make the determination after he or she has consulted the Commonwealth Minister about the determination.

Criteria for making determination

             (2)  The relevant Minister may only make the determination if the relevant Minister considers that:

                     (a)  a determination under section 38 is unlikely to be made within a period that is reasonable having regard to all the circumstances; and

                     (b)  if the relevant Minister is a State Minister or a Territory Minister—it is in the interests of the State or Territory to make the determination at the time; and

                     (c)  if the relevant Minister is the Commonwealth Minister—it is in:

                              (i)  in any case—the national interest; and

                             (ii)  if the act concerned is an act attributable to a State or Territory—the interests of the State or Territory;

                            to make the determination at the time.

Relevant Minister may consider other matters

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not prevent the relevant Minister from having regard to other matters in deciding whether to make a determination under this section.

##### <a id="36B"></a>36B  Consultation prior to section 36A determination

             (1)  Before making a determination under section 36A, the relevant Minister must give notice in accordance with subsection (2), and with subsection (3), of this section.

Notice to arbitral body

             (2)  The relevant Minister must give written notice to the arbitral body requiring it, by the end of the day specified in the notice, to give the Minister and each negotiation party a summary of material that has been presented to the arbitral body in the course of the arbitral body considering whether to make a determination under section 38 in relation to the act.

Notice to negotiation parties

             (3)  The relevant Minister must give written notice to each negotiation party that the Minister is considering making the determination and that each negotiation party:

                     (a)  may, by the end of the day specified in the notice, give the Minister any submission or other material that the negotiation party wants the Minister to take into account in deciding whether to make the determination and, if so, its terms; and

                     (b)  if the negotiation party does so—must also give each of the other negotiation parties a copy of the submission or other material; and

                     (c)  may, within 7 days after the specified day, in response to any submission or other material given by any other negotiation party or the arbitral body, give the Minister any further submission or other material that the negotiation party wants the Minister to take into account as mentioned in paragraph (a).

Specified day

             (4)  The day specified under subsection (2) or (3) must be the same in all of the notices given under the subsections. It must be a day by which, in the relevant Minister’s opinion, it is reasonable to assume that all of the notices so given will have been received by, or will otherwise have come to the attention of, the persons who must be so notified.

Natural justice

             (5)  If the relevant Minister complies with subsection (1), there is no requirement for any person to be given any further hearing before the relevant Minister makes the determination.

Material etc. taken into account

             (6)  In making the determination, the relevant Minister:

                     (a)  must take into account:

                              (i)  any submission or material provided by any of the negotiation parties in accordance with subsection (3), but only if the negotiation party has complied with the requirements of paragraph (3)(b); and

                             (ii)  any report provided by the arbitral body; and

                            (iii)  any consultations with the Commonwealth Minister as mentioned in subsection 36A(1A); and

                     (b)  may, but need not, take into account any other matter or thing.

Minister’s power not limited

             (7)  The fact that no submission or other material of the kind mentioned in subsection (3) has been given to the Minister before the end of the day specified in the notice does not prevent the Minister from making the determination.

Coverage of section

                     (a)  sets out the kind of determination that may be made under section 36A; and

                     (b)  the giving of any submission or other material to the Minister; and

                     (c)  any request by a negotiation party for the Minister to make the determination; and

                     (d)  any other circumstance.

Who makes determination

             (3)  A determination must be made by the relevant Minister personally.

                     (b)  the amount, when paid, must be held in trust in accordance with the regulations until it is dealt with in accordance with section 52.

Note:          The NNTT cannot determine compensation (see Division 5 and Division 1 of Part 3). However, if the arbitral body is not the NNTT, it may be able to do so.

Conditions to have contractual effect

             (6)  If the act is done, any conditions in a determination by the relevant Minister under this section have effect, in addition to any effect that they may have apart from this subsection, as if they were terms of a contract among the negotiation parties. If a native title party is a registered native title claimant, any other person included in the native title claim group (see section 253) concerned is a negotiation party for this purpose only.

Copy of determination to be tabled

             (7)  The relevant Minister must, as soon as practicable after making a determination, and in any case within 15 sitting days, cause a copy of the determination, together with reasons for the determination, to be laid:

                     (a)  is not reasonably capable of being determined when the determination is made; and

                     (b)  is not directly relevant to the doing of the act;

is to be the subject of further negotiations or to be determined in a specified manner.

Example:    The arbitral body could determine that a mining lease may be granted subject to site clearance procedures to be determined by a third person.

Matters to be determined by arbitration

          (1B)  If:

                     (a)  the manner specified is arbitration (other than by the arbitral body); and

the arbitral body must determine the matter at an appropriate time.

Profit-sharing conditions not to be determined

             (2)  The arbitral body must not determine a condition under paragraph (1)(c) that has the effect that native title parties are to be entitled to payments worked out by reference to:

                     (b)  any income derived; or

                     (c)  any things produced; 

by any grantee party as a result of doing anything in relation to the land or waters concerned after the act is done.

##### <a id="39"></a>39  Criteria for making arbitral body determinations

             (1)  In making its determination, the arbitral body must take into account the following:

                     (a)  the effect of the act on:

                              (i)  the enjoyment by the native title parties of their registered native title rights and interests; and

                             (v)  any area or site, on the land or waters concerned, of particular significance to the native title parties in accordance with their traditions;

                     (b)  the interests, proposals, opinions or wishes of the native title parties in relation to the management, use or control of land or waters in relation to which there are registered native title rights and interests, of the native title parties, that will be affected by the act;

                      (f)  any other matter that the arbitral body considers relevant.

Existing non-native title interests etc.

             (2)  In determining the effect of the act as mentioned in paragraph (1)(a), the arbitral body must take into account the nature and extent of:

                     (a)  existing non-native title rights and interests in relation to the land or waters concerned; and

                     (b)  existing use of the land or waters concerned by persons other than the native title parties.

Laws protecting sites of significance etc. not affected

             (3)  Taking into account the effect of the act on areas or sites mentioned in subparagraph (1)(a)(v) does not affect the operation of any law of the Commonwealth, a State or Territory for the preservation or protection of those areas or sites.

Agreements to be given effect

             (4)  Before making its determination, the arbitral body must ascertain whether there are any issues relevant to its determination on which the negotiation parties agree. If there are, and all of the negotiation parties consent, then, in making its determination, the arbitral body:

                     (c)  an issue was decided in the agreement or during the inquiry;

the negotiation parties must not, without leave of the arbitral body that is making the determination, seek to vary the decision on the issue.

##### <a id="41"></a>41  Effect of determination or agreement

             (1)  Subject to this section:

                     (a)  a determination by the arbitral body; or

                     (b)  an agreement of the kind mentioned in paragraph 31(1)(b);

that the act may be done subject to conditions being complied with by the parties has effect, if the act is done, as if the conditions were terms of a contract among the negotiation parties. The effect is in addition to any other effect that the agreement or determination may have apart from this subsection.

Other negotiation parties

             (2)  If a native title party is a registered native title claimant, any other person included in the native title claim group concerned is taken to be a negotiation party for the purposes only of subsection (1).

Trust condition

             (3)  If, in the case of a determination by the arbitral body, a condition to be complied with is that an amount is to be paid and held in trust until it is dealt with in accordance with section 52:

##### <a id="42"></a>42  Overruling of determinations

             (1)  If a State Minister or a Territory Minister considers it to be in the interests of the State or Territory to overrule the determination of a recognised State/Territory body for the State or Territory, the State Minister or Territory Minister may, by writing given to the recognised State/Territory body, make a declaration in accordance with subsection (3).

Right of Commonwealth to overrule

             (2)  If the Commonwealth Minister considers it to be in:

                     (a)  in any case—the national interest; or

                     (b)  if the act concerned is an act attributable to a State or Territory—the interests of the State or Territory;

to overrule a determination of the NNTT (other than a determination under subsection 32(4), which deals with the expedited procedure), the Commonwealth Minister may, by writing given to the NNTT, make a declaration in accordance with subsection (3).

Kinds of declaration

Note:          The NNTT cannot determine compensation (see Division 5 of this Part and Division 1 of Part 3). However, if the arbitral body is not the NNTT, it may be able to do so.

Conditions have contractual effect

             (6)  If the act is done, any conditions in a declaration by a Minister under this section have effect, in addition to any effect that they may have apart from this subsection, as if they were terms of a contract among the negotiation parties. If a native title party is a registered native title claimant, any other person included in the native title claim group concerned is a negotiation party for this purpose only.

Copy of declaration to be given to parties

##### <a id="43"></a>43  Modification of Subdivision if satisfactory alternative State or Territory provisions

Determination about alternative provisions

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a law of a State or Territory provides for alternative provisions to those contained in this Subdivision in relation to some or all acts to which this Subdivision applies that are attributable to the State or Territory; and

                     (b)  the Commonwealth Minister determines in writing that the alternative provisions comply with subsection (2);

then, while the determination is in force, the alternative provisions have effect instead of this Subdivision.

Requirement to be satisfied

                      (i)  provide that any decision of the body determining the objection may only be overruled on grounds of State or Territory interest or of national interest; and

                      (j)  make appropriate provision for compensation for the act, including provision for trusts on similar terms to those in subsections 36C(5), 41(3) and 42(5); and

Revocation of determination

             (3)  If at any time the alternative provisions are amended so that they no longer comply with subsection (2), the Commonwealth Minister must:

                     (a)  advise the State Minister or the Territory Minister concerned in writing of the fact; and

                     (b)  if, at the end of 180 days after doing so, the alternative provisions do not comply and subparagraphs (c)(i) and (ii) do not apply—in writing, revoke the determination made under paragraph (1)(b); and

                     (c)  if:

                              (i)  at the end of 180 days after advising the State Minister or Territory Minister, the alternative provisions do not comply and the Commonwealth Minister is satisfied that the State Minister or the Territory Minister is using his or her best endeavours to ensure that the alternative provisions will comply; and

                             (ii)  before the end of the 180 days, the Commonwealth Minister determined in writing that a further period should apply for the purposes of this paragraph; and

                            (iii)  at the end of the further period, the alternative provisions still do not comply;

                            in writing, revoke the determination made under paragraph (1)(b).

Note:       A determination mentioned in subparagraph (c)(ii) is a disallowable instrument: see section 214.

Regulations to make transitional provisions

             (4)  The regulations may prescribe any modifications of this Act that are necessary to deal with transitional matters arising from the making, amendment or revocation of determinations under this section.

##### <a id="43A"></a>43A  Exception to right to negotiate: satisfactory State/Territory provisions

Determination about alternative provisions

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a law or laws of a State or Territory provide for alternative provisions to those contained in this Subdivision in relation to some or all acts to which this Subdivision applies that:

                     (b)  the Commonwealth Minister determines in writing that the provisions comply with subsections (4) and (6) and that the requirements of subsection (7) are complied with;

                     (a)  an area:

                              (i)  that is, or was (whether before or after this Act commenced), covered by a freehold estate in fee simple or by a lease (other than a mining lease); and

                             (ii)  over which all native title rights and interests have not been extinguished; or

Example 1: An example of such an area is an area covered by a non-exclusive agricultural lease or a non-exclusive pastoral lease (including one subject to section 47).

Example 2: An example of a freehold estate in fee simple over which all native title rights and interests may not have been extinguished is one whose grant or vesting is covered by subsection 23B(9), (9A), (9B) or (9C).

                     (b)  an area that is, or was (whether before or after this Act commenced):

                              (i)  covered by a reservation, proclamation, dedication, condition, permission or authority, made or conferred by the Crown in right of the State or Territory or by the making, amendment or repeal of legislation of the State or Territory, under which the whole or a part of the land or waters in the area was to be used for public purposes generally or for a particular purpose; and

                             (ii)  in use for public purposes, for the particular purpose or for a similar purpose; or

Example:    An example of an area covered by paragraph (b) is an area containing a national park.

                     (c)  an area that, when the act is done, is wholly within a town or city (see section 251C).

Notification of proposed determination

             (3)  Before making the determination, the Commonwealth Minister must:

                     (a)  notify all representative Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander bodies for the land or waters concerned of the proposed determination; and

                     (b)  invite submissions from them about the proposed determination; and

                     (c)  consider any submissions made in response to the invitation.

Requirement to be satisfied: procedures etc.

             (4)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), the alternative provisions comply with this subsection if, in the opinion of the Commonwealth Minister, they:

                     (a)  contain appropriate procedures for notifying each of the following that an act to which the provisions apply is to be done:

                              (i)  any registered native title claimant (a **_claimant_**) in relation to any of the land or waters to which the act relates;

                             (ii)  any registered native title body corporate (a **_body corporate_**) in relation to any of that land or waters;

                            (iii)  any representative Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander body in relation to any of that land or waters; and

                     (b)  give any claimant or body corporate the right to object, within a specified period after the notification, to the doing of the act so far as it affects their registered native title rights and interests; and

                     (c)  if the act is of the kind mentioned in subparagraph 26(1)(c)(iii) (which deals with certain compulsory acquisitions)—provide for consultation (including provide in relation to mediation) between:

                              (i)  any claimants, and bodies corporate, who object; and

                             (ii)  the State or Territory;

                            about ways of minimising the act’s impact on registered native title rights and interests in relation to the land or waters concerned; and

                     (d)  in any other case—provide for consultation (including provide in relation to mediation) between:

                              (i)  any claimants, and bodies corporate, who object; and

                             (ii)  the person who requested or applied for the doing of the act;

                            about ways of minimising the act’s impact on registered native title rights and interests in relation to the land or waters concerned, including about any access to the land or waters or the way in which any thing authorised by the act might be done; and

                     (e)  if any person objects as mentioned in paragraph (b), provide for the objection to be heard by an independent person or body; and

Example: The independent person or body could be a State or Territory tribunal which deals with acts of the kind concerned, for example, a mining warden where the act is the grant of a mining lease.

                      (f)  provide for judicial review of the decision to do the act; and

Example: The judicial review could be by the Supreme Court of the State or Territory.

                     (g)  provide that, if the independent person or body hearing any objection as mentioned in paragraph (e) makes a determination upholding the objection, or that contains conditions about the doing of the act that relate to registered native title rights and interests, the determination must be complied with unless:

                              (i)  the Minister of the State or the Territory responsible for indigenous affairs is consulted; and

                             (ii)  the consultation is taken into account; and

                            (iii)  it is in the interests of the State or the Territory not to comply with the determination; and

                     (h)  if the act is of the kind mentioned in subparagraph 26(1)(c)(iii) (which deals with certain compulsory acquisitions)—confer on each claimant and body corporate procedural rights that are not less favourable than those they would have on the assumption that they instead held ordinary title to any land concerned and to the land adjoining, or surrounding, any waters concerned.

Meaning of **determination**

             (5)  In paragraph (4)(g):

                    <a name="determin"></a>**_determination_** includes recommendation.

                    <a name="interest"></a>**_in the interests of_** the State or the Territory includes:

                     (a)  for the social or economic benefit of the State or the Territory (including of Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders); and

                     (b)  in the interests of the relevant region or locality in the State or the Territory.

Requirement to be satisfied: compensation

             (6)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), the alternative provisions comply with this subsection if, in the opinion of the Commonwealth Minister, they provide for compensation for the effect of the act on native title to be payable and for any dispute about the compensation to be determined by an independent person or body.

Requirement to be satisfied: preservation of areas of significance

             (7)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), the requirements of this subsection are complied with if, in the opinion of the Commonwealth Minister, a law of the Commonwealth, the State or the Territory provides, for the whole of the land or waters to which the alternative provisions relate, in relation to the preservation or protection of areas, or sites, that may be of particular significance to Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders in accordance with their traditions.

Different provisions for different kinds of land or waters

             (8)  Laws of a State or Territory may make different provision under subsection (1) in relation to different kinds of land or waters.

Note:          In such a case, the Commonwealth Minister would need to make separate determinations under that subsection.

Revocation of determination

             (9)  If at any time the alternative provisions are amended so that they no longer comply as mentioned in paragraph (1)(b), the Commonwealth Minister must:

                     (a)  advise the State Minister or the Territory Minister concerned in writing of the fact; and

                     (b)  if, at the end of 90 days after doing so, the alternative provisions do not comply and subparagraphs (c)(i) and (ii) do not apply—in writing, revoke the determination made under paragraph (1)(b); and

                     (c)  if:

                              (i)  at the end of 90 days after advising the State Minister or Territory Minister, the alternative provisions do not comply and the Commonwealth Minister is satisfied that the State Minister or the Territory Minister is using his or her best endeavours to ensure that the alternative provisions will comply; and

                             (ii)  before the end of the 90 days, the Commonwealth Minister determined in writing that a further period should apply for the purposes of this paragraph; and

                            (iii)  at the end of the further period, the alternative provisions still do not comply;

                            in writing, revoke the determination made under paragraph (1)(b).

Note:       A determination mentioned in subparagraph (c)(ii) is a disallowable instrument: see section 214.

Exclusion of certain compulsory acquisitions

           (10)  The alternative provisions do not apply to an act of the kind mentioned in subparagraph 26(1)(c)(iii) (which deals with certain compulsory acquisitions) if the act involves the acquisition of native title rights and interests in relation to land or waters in both an alternative provision area and an area that is not an alternative provision area.

Regulations to make transitional provisions

           (11)  The regulations may prescribe any modifications of this Act that are necessary to deal with transitional matters arising from the making, amendment or revocation of determinations under this section.

##### <a id="43B"></a>43B  Mining rights covering both alternative provision area and other area

                   If:

                     (a)  a particular future act is the creation or variation of a right to mine in both an alternative provision area (as defined in subsection 43A(2)) and an area (the **_other area_**) that is not an alternative provision area; and

                     (b)  because of section 43A, provisions of a State or Territory law would, apart from this section, have effect in relation to the act;

then, for the purposes of this Subdivision:

                     (c)  the act is taken to consist of 2 separate acts, as follows:

                              (i)  one act consisting of the creation or variation of that right to mine, but only in the alternative provision area; and

                             (ii)  the other act consisting of the creation or variation of that right to mine, but only in the other area; and

                     (d)  the act mentioned in subparagraph (c)(ii) is taken to be done only when the right concerned is first exercised in the other area.

Note:          In effect, this section splits the act in 2 (for “right to negotiate” purposes only). Only the “act” mentioned in subparagraph (c)(i)—not the “act” mentioned in subparagraph (c)(ii)—attracts the alternative provisions under section 43A.

##### <a id="44"></a>44  Additional operation of Subdivision

                   Without affecting its operation apart from this section, this Subdivision also has the effect that it would have if each reference to a grantee party were, by express provision, confined to a grantee party that is a foreign corporation, or a trading or financial corporation formed within the limits of the Commonwealth.

#### Subdivision Q—Conferral of access rights on native title claimants in respect of non-exclusive agricultural and pastoral leases

##### <a id="44A"></a>44A  Conditions for Subdivision to apply

             (1)  This Subdivision applies if the conditions in this section are met.

Person in claim group in respect of registered claim over non-exclusive agricultural or pastoral lease

             (2)  A person must be included in the native title claim group (see section 253) in relation to a claim:

                     (a)  for which there is an entry on the Register of Native Title Claims; and

Note:       Under paragraph 190(4)(d), entries on the Register must be removed when the application in question is withdrawn, dismissed or otherwise finalised.

                     (b)  that relates to any extent to an area that is covered by a non-exclusive agricultural lease or a non-exclusive pastoral lease.

Access for traditional activities

             (3)  Either:

                     (a)  as at the end of 23 December 1996, the person included in the native title claim group must have regularly had physical access to the whole or part (the **_traditional access area_**) of the area that is covered by both the claim and the lease for the purpose of carrying on one or more traditional activities (see subsection (4)) of the person; or

                     (b)  the person included in the native title claim group must be a descendant of a person who, as at 23 December 1996, regularly had such physical access.

Traditional activity

             (4)  A **_traditional activity_** is an activity of any of the following kinds, but only if it is carried on for traditional purposes of Aboriginal people or Torres Strait Islanders:

                     (a)  hunting, fishing, gathering or camping;

                     (b)  performing rites or other ceremonies;

                     (c)  visiting sites of significance.

##### <a id="44B"></a>44B  Rights of access for traditional activities

Conferral of rights

             (1)  At all times while this Subdivision applies, the person included in the native title claim group has a right:

                     (a)  to have access, in the same way and to the same extent as the access mentioned in subsection 44A(3), to the traditional access area for the purpose of carrying on the one or more traditional activities in that area in the same way and to the same extent as they were carried on pursuant to the access mentioned in that subsection; and

                     (b)  to carry on those activities in that area in that way and to that extent.

Lessee etc. rights prevail

             (2)  The rights of:

                     (a)  the lessee under the lease; or

                     (b)  any person with non-native title rights or interests in relation to the traditional access area;

prevail over the rights conferred by subsection (1). To avoid doubt, the existence and exercise of the rights conferred by subsection (1) do not prevent the doing of any thing in exercise of the rights of the lessee or person with the non-native title rights or interests.

Agreements about rights

             (3)  The lessee or any person with non-native title rights or interests in relation to the traditional access area may make an agreement with the person included in the native title claim group about:

                     (a)  the manner of exercise of any of the rights conferred by subsection (1); or

                     (b)  the variation of any of those rights.

Note:          For example, an agreement might be made requiring notification of intended exercise of the rights.

Assistance in making agreements

             (4)  Any persons wishing to make such an agreement may request assistance from the NNTT or a recognised State/Territory body in negotiating the agreement.

Statutory access rights do not amount to native title

             (5)  To avoid doubt, the fact that the person satisfies the conditions in section 44A does not mean that the person has native title rights and interests in relation to the traditional access area.

##### <a id="44C"></a>44C  Suspension of native title rights

             (1)  For so long as the person included in the native title claim group has rights conferred by subsection 44B(1), no person can enforce any native title rights or interests in relation to the whole or part of the land or waters covered by the lease, except in proceedings before the Federal Court or a recognised State/Territory body that are related to the making of an approved determination of native title.

Other provisions not affected

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not affect the operation of any other provision of this Act.

Note:          The “right to negotiate” provisions in Subdivision P are an example of provisions that are not intended to be affected.

##### <a id="44D"></a>44D  Certain other laws not affected

Laws etc. of benefit to Aboriginal peoples or Torres  Strait Islanders

             (1)  This Subdivision does not affect:

                     (a)  any reservation or condition for the benefit of Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders contained:

                              (i)  in any law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; or

                             (ii)  elsewhere; or

                     (b)  the operation of any law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory that allows for the granting of access rights to Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders; or

                     (c)  the operation of any law of the Commonwealth, a State or Territory that relates to the preservation or protection of any area or site of particular significance to Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders in accordance with their traditions.

Laws of general application

             (2)  This Subdivision is not intended to imply that, in exercising rights conferred by subsection 44B(1), a person is not subject to laws of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory that are of general application.

##### <a id="44E"></a>44E  Federal Court jurisdiction

                   The Federal Court may, in its discretion, refuse to exercise the jurisdiction conferred on it under subsection 213(2) in relation to a matter involving a right conferred by subsection 44B(1) for the reason that an adequate alternative means of resolving the matter is available.

##### <a id="44F"></a>44F  Request for mediation

                   If all of the persons involved in any dispute about a right conferred by subsection 44B(1) agree, they may request the NNTT or a recognised State/Territory body to mediate in the dispute.

Note:          Persons wishing to make an indigenous land use agreement about access in general may request assistance from the NNTT or a recognised State/Territory body in negotiating the agreement: see sections 24BF, 24CF and 24DG.

##### <a id="44G"></a>44G  Other mediation, arbitration and agreements not excluded by Subdivision

                   Nothing in this Subdivision prevents:

                     (a)  mediation or arbitration by any person or body of any matter arising in relation to a right conferred by subsection 44B(1); or

                     (b)  the making or enforcing of agreements about access to the area covered by the non-exclusive agricultural lease or the non-exclusive pastoral lease other than under rights conferred by subsection 44B(1).

## 10  Before section 45

Insert:

##### <a id="44H"></a>44H  Rights conferred by valid leases etc.

                   To avoid doubt, if:

                     (a)  the grant, issue or creation of a lease, licence, permit or authority is valid (including because of any provision of this Act); and

                     (b)  the lease, licence, permit or authority requires or permits the doing of any activity (whether or not subject to any conditions); and

                    (ba)  an activity is done in accordance with the lease, licence, permit or authority and any such conditions;

then:

                     (c)  the requirement or permission, and the doing of the activity, prevail over any native title rights and interests and any exercise of those rights and interests, but do not extinguish them; and

                     (d)  the existence and exercise of the native title rights and interests do not prevent the doing of the activity; and

                     (e)  native title holders are not entitled to compensation under this Act for the doing of the activity.

Note 1:       Any compensation to which the native title holders may be entitled under this Act for the grant of the lease, licence, permit or authority may take into account the doing of the activity.

Note 2:       This section is not intended to imply that the person carrying on the activity is not subject to the laws of a State or Territory.

## 11  Paragraph 47(3)(c)

Omit “proposed”.

## 12  Paragraph 47(3)(c)

Omit “Subdivision B”, substitute “Subdivision P”.

##### <a id="47A"></a>47A  Reserves etc. covered by claimant applications

When section applies

                     (b)  when the application is made:

                              (i)  a freehold estate exists, or a lease is in force, over the area or the area is vested in any person, if the grant of the freehold estate or lease or the vesting took place under legislation that makes provision for the grant or vesting of such things only to, in or for the benefit of, Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders; or

                             (ii)  the area is held expressly for the benefit of, or is held on trust, or reserved, expressly for the benefit of, Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders; and

                     (c)  when the application is made, one or more members of the native title claim group occupy the area.

Prior extinguishment to be disregarded

             (2)  For all purposes under this Act in relation to the application, any extinguishment, of the native title rights and interests in relation to the area that are claimed in the application, by any of the following acts must be disregarded:

                     (a)  the grant or vesting mentioned in subparagraph (1)(b)(i) or the doing of the thing that resulted in the holding or reservation mentioned in subparagraph (1)(b)(ii);

                     (b)  the creation of any other prior interest in relation to the area, other than, in the case of an area held as mentioned in subparagraph (1)(b)(ii), the grant of a freehold estate for the provision of services (such as health and welfare services).

Note:          The applicant will still need to show the existence of any connection with the land or waters concerned that may be required by the common law concept of native title.

Effect of determination

             (3)  If the determination on the application is that the native title claim group hold the native title rights and interests claimed:

                     (a)  the determination does not affect:

                              (i)  the validity of the grant or vesting or of the creation of the trust or reservation; or

                             (ii)  the validity of the creation of any other prior interest in relation to the area; or

                     (b)  the non-extinguishment principle applies to the grant or vesting or the creation of the trust or reservation or any other prior interest.

Exclusion of Crown ownership of natural resources

             (4)  For the purposes of this section, a reference to the creation of an interest in relation to an area does not include a reference to the creation of an interest that confirms ownership of natural resources by, or confers ownership of natural resources on, the Crown in any capacity.

Effect of determination

             (3)  If the determination on the application is that the native title claim group hold the native title rights and interests claimed:

Defined expressions

             (5)  For the purposes of this section:

Claims made to Federal Court

and may have regard to such other information as he or she considers appropriate.

Information about other rights and interests

             (4)  Without limiting subsection (3), information mentioned in that subsection may include information about current or previous non-native title rights and interests in, or in relation to, the land or waters in the area covered by the application.

Effect of paragraph (3)(b)

             (5)  The fact that no information of the kind referred to in paragraph (3)(b) has been supplied at a particular time does not prevent the Registrar accepting a claim for registration under this section.

In any other case, the Registrar must not accept the claim for registration.

Note:          The fact that the Registrar is considering the claim under this section does not mean that the application cannot be amended: see subsection 64(3).

                     (a)  before the Registrar has decided whether or not to accept the claim for registration; or

the Registrar is notified under section 189 or 189A of a decision or determination to the effect that the application has been dismissed or otherwise finalised, or is notified that the application has been withdrawn, the Registrar must not:

                     (c)  decide whether or not to accept the claim for registration; or

                     (d)  enter the details in the Register;

as the case requires.

                     (a)  the persons in the native title claim group are named in the application; or

                     (b)  the persons in that group are described sufficiently clearly so that it can be ascertained whether any particular person is in that group.

Identification of claimed native title

             (4)  The Registrar must be satisfied that the description contained in the application as required by paragraph 62(2)(d) is sufficient to allow the native title rights and interests claimed to be readily identified.

Factual basis for claimed native title

             (5)  The Registrar must be satisfied that the factual basis on which it is asserted that the native title rights and interests claimed exist is sufficient to support the assertion. In particular, the factual basis must support the following assertions:

                     (a)  that the native title claim group have, and the predecessors of those persons had, an association with the area; and

                     (b)  that there exist traditional laws acknowledged by, and traditional customs observed by, the native title claim group that give rise to the claim to native title rights and interests; and

Prima facie case

             (6)  The Registrar must consider that, prima facie, at least some of the native title rights and interests claimed in the application can be established.

Note:          If the claim is accepted for registration, the Registrar must, under paragraph 186(1)(g), enter on the Register of Native Title Claims details of only those claimed native title rights and interests that can, prima facie, be established. Only those rights and interests are taken into account for the purposes of subsection 31(2) (which deals with negotiation in good faith in a “right to negotiate” process) and subsection 39(1) (which deals with criteria for making arbitral body determinations in a “right to negotiate” process).

                              (i)  the Crown in any capacity; or

                             (ii)  a statutory authority of the Crown in any capacity; or

                            (iii)  any holder of a lease over any of the land or waters, or any person acting on behalf of such a holder of a lease.

No failure to comply with section 61A

             (8)  The application and accompanying documents must not disclose, and the Registrar must not otherwise be aware, that, because of section 61A (which forbids the making of applications where there have been previous native title determinations or exclusive or non-exclusive possession acts), the application should not have been made.

No extinguishment etc. of claimed native title

             (9)  The application and accompanying documents must not disclose, and the Registrar must not otherwise be aware, that:

                     (a)  to the extent that the native title rights and interests claimed consist of or include ownership of minerals, petroleum or gas—the Crown in right of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory wholly owns the minerals, petroleum or gas; or

                     (b)  to the extent that the native title rights and interests claimed relate to waters in an offshore place—those rights and interests purport to exclude all other rights and interests in relation to the whole or part of the offshore place; or

                     (c)  in any case—the native title rights and interests claimed have otherwise been extinguished (except to the extent that the extinguishment is required to be disregarded under subsection 47(2), 47A(2) or 47B(2)).

No previous overlapping claim groups

             (3)  The Registrar must be satisfied that no person included in the native title claim group for the application (the **_current application_**) was a member of the native title claim group for any previous application, if:

                     (a)  the previous application covered the whole or part of the area covered by the current application; and

                     (b)  an entry relating to the claim in the previous application was on the Register of Native Title Claims when the current application was made; and

                     (c)  the entry was made, or not removed, as a result of consideration of the previous application under section 190A.

Identity of claimed native title holders

             (4)  The Registrar must be satisfied that either of the following is the case:

                     (a)  the application has been certified under paragraph 202(4)(d) by each representative Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander body that could certify the application in performing its functions under that Part; or

                     (b)  the applicant is a member of the native title claim group and is authorised to make the application, and deal with matters arising in relation to it, by all the other persons in the native title claim group.

             (5)  If the application has not been certified as mentioned in paragraph (4)(a), the Registrar cannot be satisfied that the condition in subsection (4) has been satisfied unless the application:

                     (a)  includes a statement to the effect that the requirement set out in paragraph (4)(b) has been met; and

                     (b)  briefly sets out the grounds on which the Registrar should consider that it has been met.

Overlapping representative body areas

             (6)  Paragraph (4)(a) does not require certification by a particular representative Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander body that could certify the application in performing its functions if:

                     (a)  the application has been certified under paragraph 202(4)(d) by another representative Aboriginal Torres/Strait Islander body whose area includes all of the area of land or waters, to which the application relates, that is within the first-mentioned body’s area; or

                     (b)  the application has been certified under paragraph 202(4)(d) by 2 or more other representative Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander bodies whose areas, when combined, include all of the area of land or waters, to which the application relates, that is within the first-mentioned body’s area.

Definition of **area**

             (7)  In subsection (6):

                    <a name="area"></a>**_area_**, in relation to a representative Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander body, means the area in relation to which the body has been determined under section 202 to be a representative Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander body.

##### <a id="190D"></a>190D  If the claim cannot be registered

             (1)  If the Registrar does not accept the claim for registration, the Registrar must, as soon as practicable, give the applicant and the Federal Court written notice of his or her decision not to accept the claim, including a statement of the reasons for the decision.

Content of notice where failure to satisfy physical connection test

          (1A)  If the only reason why the Registrar cannot accept the claim for registration is that the condition in subsection 190B(7) (which is about a physical connection with the claim area) is not satisfied, the notice must advise the applicant of the applicant’s right to make an application to the Federal Court under subsection (2) and of the power of the Court to make an order in accordance with subsection (4) in respect of the application.

Applicant may apply to Federal Court for review

             (2)  If the Registrar gives the applicant a notice under subsection (1), the applicant may apply to the Federal Court for a review of the Registrar’s decision not to accept the claim.

Federal Court has jurisdiction

             (3)  The Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine an application made to it under subsection (2).

Court order where physical connection test failed

             (4)  If, on an application under subsection (2) in a case to which subsection (1A) applies, the Court is satisfied that:

                     (a)  prima facie, at least some of the native title rights and interests claimed in the application can be established; and

                     (b)  at some time in his or her lifetime, at least one parent of one member of the native title claim group had a traditional physical connection with any part of the land or waters and would reasonably have been expected to have maintained that connection but for things done (other than the creation of an interest in relation to land or waters) by:

                              (i)  the Crown in any capacity; or

                             (ii)  a statutory authority of the Crown in any capacity; or

                            (iii)  any holder of a lease over any of the land or waters, or any person acting on behalf of such a holder of a lease;

the Court may order the Registrar to accept the claim for registration.

Opportunity to be heard

             (5)  Before making an order under subsection (4), the Court must give to any person who is a party to the proceedings in the Court under Part 4 in relation to the application an opportunity to be heard in relation to the making of the order.

##### <a id="207B"></a>207B  Equivalent State/Territory bodies

Equivalent bodies

             (1)  This section applies if the State Minister for a State, or the Territory Minister for a Territory, nominates to the Commonwealth Minister one or more offices, tribunals or bodies (each of which is an **_equivalent body_**), established by or under a law of the State or Territory, for the purpose of each performing specified functions or exercising specified powers of the NNTT or the Native Title Registrar, in specified circumstances, under specified equivalent body provisions (see subsection (9)).

Different functions/powers etc.

             (2)  To avoid doubt, the nomination may specify:

                     (a)  different functions or powers in relation to different equivalent bodies; or

                     (b)  different functions or powers in different circumstances.

Determination

             (3)  The Commonwealth Minister may, in writing, determine that the one or more equivalent bodies are to perform the specified functions or exercise the specified powers in the specified circumstances, under the specified equivalent body provisions.

Criteria to be satisfied

             (4)  In order to ensure that there is a nationally consistent approach to the recognition and protection of native title, the Commonwealth Minister must not make the determination unless the Commonwealth Minister is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the one or more equivalent bodies will have available to them, through the bodies’ membership, appropriate expertise (including expertise in matters relating to Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders) for performing their functions or exercising their powers under the determination; and

                     (b)  under the law of the State or Territory, the procedures of the one or more equivalent bodies in performing those functions or exercising those powers will be fair, just, informal, accessible and expeditious; and

                     (c)  the one or more equivalent bodies will have adequate resources to enable them to perform those functions or exercise those powers; and

                    (ca)  members of the one or more equivalent bodies will enjoy security of tenure no less favourable than that enjoyed by members of the NNTT or the Native Title Registrar, as the case requires; and

                     (d)  the law of the State or Territory will enable and require the one or more equivalent bodies to perform those functions or exercise those powers if the Commonwealth Minister makes the determination; and

                     (e)  if any of the functions or powers that the one or more equivalent bodies will perform or exercise under the determination involves the maintenance of any register under this Act—the law of the State or Territory will require the functions to be performed or the powers to be exercised in a way that ensures that the register will be maintained in a nationally integrated and accessible manner; and

                      (f)  if any of the functions or powers that will be performed or exercised under the determination are those of the NNTT—the law of the State or Territory will require the member or at least one of the members of the equivalent body to be a member of the NNTT; and

                     (g)  any other requirement that the Commonwealth Minister considers relevant will be satisfied.

Modified application of Act etc.

             (5)  While the determination is in force, this Act, and Schedule 5 to the _Native Title Amendment Act 1998_, have effect, in relation to a function or power of the NNTT or Native Title Registrar specified in the determination, as if, in the specified circumstances:

                     (a)  the one or more equivalent bodies had the functions or powers, instead of the NNTT or the Registrar; and

                     (b)  if one of the powers specified in the determination is the power to make determinations under Subdivision P of Division 3 of Part 2 of this Act—for the purposes of sections 36A, 36B, 36C and 42 of this Act, the State Minister or the Territory Minister of the relevant State or Territory had the powers of the Commonwealth Minister under that section, instead of the Commonwealth Minister.

Note:          The _Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977_ will apply to decisions that an equivalent body or a State or Territory Minister may, because of this section, make under this Act to the same extent to which it applies to corresponding decisions of the NNTT, the Native Title Registrar or the Commonwealth Minister under this Act.

Vesting of functions and powers in equivalent bodies

             (6)  While the determination is in force, the functions and powers specified in the determination are vested in the one or more equivalent bodies, in the circumstances set out in the determination.

Revocation of determination

             (7)  If, at any time:

                     (a)  the law of the State or Territory is amended; and

                     (b)  as a result, the Commonwealth Minister ceases to be satisfied as mentioned in subsection (4) in relation to any or all of the equivalent bodies;

he or she must:

                     (c)  advise the State Minister or the Territory Minister concerned in writing of the fact; and

                     (d)  if at the end of 90 days, or such longer period as the Commonwealth Minister allows, after doing so, the Commonwealth Minister is still not satisfied as mentioned in subsection (4)—in writing, revoke the determination.

Regulations to make transitional provisions

             (8)  The regulations may prescribe any modifications of this Act that are necessary or convenient to deal with transitional matters arising from the making or revocation of determinations under this section.

Equivalent body provisions

             (9)  The **_equivalent body provisions_** are:

                     (a)  all of the provisions of this Act, except the following:

                              (i)  this section;

                             (ii)  Part 5;

                            (iii)  the provisions of Part 6, other than subsection 136D(1) and sections 139, 145, 169, 178 and 179; and

                     (b)  Schedule 5 to the _Native Title Amendment Act 1998_.

## 76  After paragraph 215(2)(a)

Insert:

                    (aa)  the regulations may make provision:

                              (i)  prescribing fees to be paid to obtain access to, or information from, records or information kept by the Native Title Registrar as mentioned in section 98A; and

                             (ii)  for or in relation to the waiver or refund, in whole or part, of such fees; and

## 77  Subparagraph 215(2)(b)(i)

Before “Registrar”, insert “Native Title”.

## 78  After subparagraph 215(2)(b)(i)

Insert:

                            (ia)  the waiver, in whole or in part, of those fees; and

## 79  Section 222 (table)

                   A **_determination of native title_** is a determination whether or not native title exists in relation to a particular area (the **_determination area_**) of land or waters and, if it does exist, a determination of:

                     (a)  who the persons, or each group of persons, holding the common or group rights comprising the native title are; and

                     (e)  to the extent that the land or waters in the determination area are not covered by a non-exclusive agricultural lease or a non-exclusive pastoral lease—whether the native title rights and interests confer possession, occupation, use and enjoyment of that land or waters on the native title holders to the exclusion of all others.

## 6  At the end of section 202

Add:

Certification of applications for determinations of native title

             (5)  A representative body must not certify under paragraph (4)(d) an application for a determination of native title unless it is of the opinion that:

                     (a)  the applicant has authority to make the application, and deal with matters arising in relation to it, on behalf of all the other persons in the native title claim group; and

                     (b)  all reasonable efforts have been made to ensure that the application describes or otherwise identifies all the other persons in the native title claim group.

Note:          Section 251B deals with **_authority_** to make the application.

Overlapping applications for determinations of native title

             (6)  If the land or waters covered by the application are wholly or partly covered by one or more applications (including proposed applications) of which the representative body is aware, the representative body must make all reasonable efforts:

                     (a)  to achieve agreement, relating to native title over the land or waters, between the persons in respect of whom the applications are, or would be, made; and

                     (b)  to minimise the number of applications covering the land or waters.

However, a failure by the representative body to comply with this subsection does not invalidate any certification of the application by the representative body.

Statement to be included in certifications of applications for determinations of native title

             (7)  A certification of an application for a determination of native title by a representative body must:

                     (a)  include a statement to the effect that the representative body is of the opinion that the requirements of paragraphs (5)(a) and (b) have been met; and

                     (b)  briefly set out the body’s reasons for being of that opinion; and

                     (c)  where applicable, briefly set out what the representative body has done to meet the requirements of subsection (6).

Certification of applications for registration of indigenous land use agreements

             (8)  A representative body must not certify under paragraph (4)(e) an application for registration of an indigenous land use agreement unless it is of the opinion that:

                     (a)  all reasonable efforts have been made to ensure that all persons who hold or may hold native title in relation to land or waters in the area covered by the agreement have been identified; and

                     (b)  all of the persons so identified have authorised the making of the agreement.

Note:          Section 251A deals with **_authority_** to make the agreement.

Statement to be included in certifications of applications for registration of indigenous land use agreements

             (9)  A certification of an application for registration of an indigenous land use agreement by a representative body must:

                     (a)  include a statement to the effect that the representative body is of the opinion that the requirements of paragraphs (8)(a) and (b) have been met; and

                     (b)  briefly set out the body’s reasons for being of that opinion.

### Division 2—Recognition of representative Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander bodies

##### <a id="203A"></a>203A  Inviting applications for recognition

Commonwealth Minister may invite applications

             (1)  Subject to section 203AA, the Commonwealth Minister may, in the way determined in writing by the Commonwealth Minister, invite applications from eligible bodies for recognition as the representative body for an area.

Invitations may cover more than one area

             (2)  The invitation may specify more than one area for which applications are invited.

Invitations to specify application period

             (3)  The invitation must specify the period (of at least 28 days) within which applications are to be given to the Commonwealth Minister.

Invitations may be general

             (4)  For the avoidance of doubt, the way determined under subsection (1) for inviting applications may provide for the publication of general invitations to eligible bodies, and need not require that a separate invitation be made to each eligible body.

##### <a id="203AA"></a>203AA  Inviting applications from representative bodies during the transition period

Commonwealth Minister to invite applications

             (1)  As soon as practicable after the start of the transition period, the Commonwealth Minister must make invitations under section 203A relating to areas that, taken together, cover all the land and waters to which this Act extends. The invitations need not all be made at the same time.

Matters to which Commonwealth Minister must have regard

             (2)  Without limiting the matters to which the Commonwealth Minister may have regard in deciding the areas in relation to which the invitations will be made, he or she must have regard to the following:

                     (a)  the areas for the representative bodies that are already in existence;

                     (b)  the need to minimise any disruption to the performance of the functions of those representative bodies;

                     (c)  the requirements of subsection 203AD(4) in relation to the recognition of representative bodies.

Invitation to representative bodies

             (3)  If an invitation under section 203A relates to an area (the **_original invitation area_**) that wholly or partly covers an area for which a body was, on the day on which this section commenced, a representative body:

                     (a)  the invitation must initially be made only to each of the bodies that was, on that day, a representative body for an area wholly or partly covered by the original invitation area; and

                     (b)  other than as provided in subsection (4), no other invitations may be made under section 203A, for areas that wholly or partly cover the original invitation area, until the end of the transition period.

Situations where general invitations can still be made

             (4)  If the Commonwealth Minister has, as mentioned in paragraph (3)(a), made an invitation in respect of the original invitation area to a representative body or bodies, the Commonwealth Minister may make another invitation within the transition period in respect of the original invitation area, or an area wholly or partly within the original invitation area, if:

                     (a)  none of the bodies invited as mentioned in paragraph (3)(a) applied for recognition as the representative body for the original invitation area within the relevant application period under subsection 203A(3); or

                     (b)  the Commonwealth Minister has rejected the application of each of the bodies so invited that did apply.

Diagram of the rules for making invitations

             (5)  This diagram shows when, under section 203A and this section, invitations can be made, during the transition period, for applications for recognition as the representative body for a particular area.

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2007C00533/Html/NativeTitleAmend1998_image002.gif)

Note:          These rules will not apply once the transition period has ended.

##### <a id="203AB"></a>203AB  Application for recognition

Eligible bodies may apply

             (1)  Subject to subsection (3), an eligible body may apply to the Commonwealth Minister, in the form approved by the Commonwealth Minister, for recognition as the representative body for the area, or for one or more of the areas, in respect of which applications have been invited under section 203A.

Application period

             (2)  The application must be given to the Commonwealth Minister within the period specified under subsection 203A(3), or within such further period as the Commonwealth Minister allows (whether or not the initial period has expired).

Invitation to existing representative bodies

             (3)  If the invitation in question was one to which subsection 203AA(3) applied, an application can only be made by an eligible body that has been invited to apply in accordance with subsection 203AA(3) or (4), as the case requires.

##### <a id="203AC"></a>203AC  Dealing with applications

          (1A)  The Commonwealth Minister must determine applications under section 203AB:

                     (a)  as soon as practicable after:

                              (i)  the period specified under subsection 203A(3); or

                             (ii)  if a further period applies under subsection 203AB(2) in relation to one or more of those applications—the last such further period to end; or

                            (iii)  if the Commonwealth Minister has, in relation to one or more of those applications, given to a body a notice under subsection (1) requiring the body to give further information within a specified period—the last such period to end;

                            whichever occurs last; and

                     (b)  if the applications are in respect of an invitation to which subsection 203AA(3) applied—in any event before the end of the transition period.

             (1)  The Commonwealth Minister may give to a body that has made an application under section 203AB a notice requiring the body to give further information relating to the application within a period specified in the notice.

             (2)  The period specified:

                     (a)  must not begin before the day on which the notice was given; and

                     (b)  must be a period of at least 21 days.

             (3)  The fact that no further information has been given to the Commonwealth Minister as at the end of the period specified in the notice does not prevent the Commonwealth Minister from determining the application.

             (4)  The notice must contain a statement setting out the effect of subsection (3).

##### <a id="203AD"></a>203AD  Recognition of representative bodies

Commonwealth Minister may recognise representative bodies

             (1)  The Commonwealth Minister may, by written instrument, recognise, as the representative body for an area, an eligible body that has applied under section 203AB to be the representative body for the area if the Commonwealth Minister is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the body will satisfactorily represent persons who hold or may hold native title in the area; and

                     (b)  the body will be able to consult effectively with Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders living in the area; and

                     (c)  if the body is already a representative body—the body satisfactorily performs its existing functions; and

                     (d)  the body would be able to perform satisfactorily the functions of a representative body.

When recognition takes effect

             (2)  The recognition of the body as a representative body takes effect on the day specified in the instrument of recognition. However, that day must not precede the day on which Division 3 commences.

Exempt State bodies

             (3)  The Commonwealth Minister must not recognise an exempt State body unless satisfied that the obligations it would have under this Act, together with its other obligations under the laws of a State, provide an appropriate level of accountability.

Commonwealth Minister not to recognise more than one body for an area

             (4)  The Commonwealth Minister must not, under this section, recognise a body as the representative body for an area at a particular time if, at that time, there is already a representative body recognised under this section (whether or not the recognition has taken effect) for all or part of that area.

Note:          The fact that a representative body has previously been determined under section 202 will not prevent recognition of a body under this section.

Notifying unsuccessful applicants

             (5)  If the Commonwealth Minister decides not to recognise as the representative body for an area a body that applied for that recognition, the Commonwealth Minister must notify the body, in writing, of the decision and the reasons for the decision.

##### <a id="203AI"></a>203AI  Matters to which Commonwealth Minister must have regard

Fairness of organisational structures and administrative processes

             (1)  In considering, for the purposes of making a decision under this Division in relation to a particular area, whether a body:

                     (a)  will satisfactorily represent persons who hold or may hold native title in the area; or

                     (b)  will be able to consult effectively with Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders living in the area;

the Commonwealth Minister must take into account whether, in the Commonwealth Minister’s opinion, the body’s organisational structures and administrative processes will operate in a fair manner.

Criteria for assessing fairness

             (2)  Without limiting the matters to which the Commonwealth Minister may have regard in assessing the fairness of the body’s organisational structures and administrative processes, the Commonwealth Minister must have particular regard to:

                     (a)  the opportunities for the Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders for whom it might act to participate in its processes; and

                     (b)  the level of consultation with them involved in its processes; and

                     (c)  its procedures for making decisions and for reviewing its decisions; and

                     (d)  its rules or requirements relating to the conduct of its executive officers; and

                     (e)  the nature of its management structures and management processes; and

                      (f)  its procedures for reporting back to persons who hold or may hold native title in the area, and to the Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders living in the area.

Commonwealth Minister’s consideration of other matters unaffected

             (3)  This section does not limit any other matters that the Commonwealth Minister may take into account in making a decision under this Division.

Note:          Divisions 3 to 6 of this Part are to be inserted, and will enter into force, at the end of the transition period (see Part 2 of Schedule 3 to the _Native Title Amendment Act 1998_).

Consultation prior to applications

                     (b)  by the time the new “right to negotiate” provisions commenced, no determination had been made under section 32(4) of the old Act in relation to the objection; and

                     (c)  apart from this subitem, the new “right to negotiate” provisions would apply in relation to the future act after the commencement of this Act;

then, after the commencement of this Act:

                     (d)  the old “right to negotiate” provisions continue to apply, despite the amendments made by this Act, for the purpose of making the determination; and

                     (e)  if the determination is that the act is not an act attracting the expedited procedure, the new “right to negotiate” provisions apply in relation to the future act as if:

                              (i)  the only persons who were native title parties were those who were native title parties under the old Act; and

                             (ii)  the requirements of section 29 of the new Act had been complied with.

Saving of old Act agreements and arbitral determinations

(4)        The amendments made by this Act do not affect any conditions in:

then the doing of the thing, or failure to do the thing, is not ineffective, and is taken never to have been ineffective, for the purposes of the _Native Title Act 1993_ merely because the original determination was not laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after its meeting.

_Note:       Under section 214 of the Native Title Act 1993, as in force at the time the original determination was made, the original determination was a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, as in force at that time, which meant that it was required under that Act, as then in force, to be tabled._
