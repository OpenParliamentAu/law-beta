###  NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (IMPUTATION) ACT 2002Schedule&#160;1&#151;The simplified imputation system 
**
Income Tax Assessment Act 1997










<dl compact="">

		The <sup>*</sup>imputation system partially integrates the income tax

liabilities of an Australian corporate tax entity and its members by:

 </dl>
<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>allowing the entity, when distributing profits to its members, to pass to

those members credit for income tax paid by the entity on those profits; and</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>allowing the entity's Australian members to claim a tax offset for that

credit; and</dd>

<dt>(c)</dt><dd>allowing the entity's Australian members to claim a refund if they are

unable to fully utilise the tax offset in reducing their income tax.

</dd>

</dl></dl>

<dl compact="">

		When an Australian corporate tax entity distributes profits to its members,

the entity has the option of passing to those members credit for income tax

paid by the entity on the profits. This is done by franking the distribution.

 </dl>
<dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>A franking account is used to keep track of income tax paid by the entity,

so that the entity can pass to its members the benefit of having paid that tax

when a distribution is made.</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>Each corporate tax entity has a franking account.</dd> <dt>(3)</dt><dd>Typically, a corporate tax entity receives a credit in the account if the entity pays income tax or receives a franked distribution. A credit in the franking account is called a franking credit.</dd> <dt>(4)</dt><dd>Typically, a corporate tax entity receives a debit in the account if the entity receives a refund of tax or franks a distribution to its members. A debit in the franking account is called a franking debit. </dd> </dl>
<dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>A corporate tax entity franks a distribution by allocating a franking

credit to it.</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>The amount of the franking credit on the distribution is the amount specified in a statement that accompanies the distribution.</dd> <dt>(3)</dt><dd>Only some kinds of distribution can be franked. These are called frankable distributions. </dd> </dl>
<dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>A corporate tax entity must not frank a distribution from profits with a

franking credit that exceeds the maximum amount of income tax that could have

been paid by the entity on the profits distributed.</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>If a distribution is franked in excess of this limit, the entity will be taken to have franked the distribution with the maximum franking credit for the distribution. </dd> </dl>
<dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>All frankable distributions made within a particular period must be

franked to the same extent. This is the benchmark rule.</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>It is designed to ensure that one member of a corporate tax entity is not preferred over another by the manner in which distributions are franked. </dd> </dl>
<dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>Under Division&#160;207, if an Australian member of a corporate tax entity

receives a franked distribution, the member can usually offset, against the

member's own income tax liability, income tax paid by the entity on the profits

underlying the distribution.</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>The tax offset to which the member is entitled is equal to the franking credit on the distribution. </dd> </dl>
<dl compact="">

Note 1:	A member may be entitled to a refund under

Division&#160;67 if the sum of the tax offset and certain other tax offsets

exceeds the amount of income tax that the member would have to pay if the

member had not got those tax offsets. Note 2:	If the member is not a resident, the tax effects of receiving a distribution will be dealt with under Division&#160;11A of Part&#160;III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, and Subdivision&#160;207-D of this Part.  </dl>
<dl compact="">

		If an Australian corporate tax entity receives a franked distribution, it can

pass the benefit of having received a franking credit on the distribution to

its own members by franking distributions to those members.

 </dl>
<dl compact="">

		There are special rules to deal with:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>venture capital franking by a pooled development fund; and</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>franking by life insurance companies; and</dd>

<dt>(c)</dt><dd>franking by exempting companies and former exempting companies.

</dd>

</dl></dl>

<dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>The main object of this Part is to allow certain <sup>*</sup>corporate tax

entities to pass to their <sup>*</sup>members the benefit of having paid income

tax on the profits underlying certain <sup>*</sup>distributions.</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>The other objects of this Part are to ensure that: </dd> </dl>
<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>the imputation system is not used to give the benefit of income tax paid

by a <sup>*</sup>corporate tax entity to <sup>*</sup>members who do not have a

sufficient economic interest in the entity; and</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>the imputation system is not used to prefer some members over others when

passing on the benefits of having paid income tax; and</dd>

<dt>(c)</dt><dd>the <sup>*</sup>membership of a corporate tax entity is not manipulated to

create either of the outcomes mentioned in paragraphs&#160;(a) and (b).

</dd>

</dl></dl>
<dl compact="">

		Subject to the rules on the application of this Part set out in the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_, this Part applies to events that

occur on or after 1&#160;July 2002.

		An entity _franks_ a <sup>*</sup>distribution if:

 </dl>
<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>the entity is a <sup>*</sup>franking entity that satisfies the

<sup>*</sup>residency requirement when the distribution is made; and</dd>

<dt>(c)</dt><dd>the entity allocates a <sup>*</sup>franking credit to the distribution.

</dd>

</dl></dl>
<dl compact="">

Note 1:	Division&#160;205 deals with a corporate tax entity's

franking account and sets out when credits, known as franking credits, and

debits, known as franking debits, arise in that account. Note 2:	The mechanism by which an entity allocates a franking credit to a distribution (for example, whether it is done by resolution or some other means) is determined by the entity.  </dl>

Division&#160;205&#151;Franking accounts

Guide to Division&#160;205
 205-1  What this Division is about

This Division:

*	creates a franking account for each entity that is, or has been, a corporate tax entity; and

*	identifies when franking credits and debits arise in those accounts and the amount of those credits and debits; and

*	identifies when there is a franking surplus or deficit in the account; and

*	creates a liability to pay franking deficit tax if the account is in 
<center>Back to Top</center>
 deficit at certain times.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>Each entity that is, or has ever been, a corporate tax entity has a

franking account.</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>The payment of a PAYG instalment or income tax will generate a franking credit in that account. The amount of the credit is equal to the amount of tax paid. The receipt of a franked distribution by an entity from another corporate tax entity will also generate a franking credit. There are other circumstances in which a franking credit arises.</dd> <dt>(3)</dt><dd>The receipt of a refund of income tax or the payment of a franked distribution by a corporate tax entity will generate a franking debit. There are, however, other cases where a franking debit arises. For example, a franking debit might arise under a determination by the Commissioner because  distributions have been streamed.</dd> <dt>(4)</dt><dd>An entity must be a franking entity at certain times and satisfy certain residency requirements before a franking credit or debit arises in its account.</dd> <dt>(5)</dt><dd>Franking deficit tax is payable if the franking account of an entity is in deficit at the end of the entity's income year, or when the entity ceases to be a franking entity. </dd> </dl></dl>

 Guide to Subdivision&#160;207-B
 207-25  What this Subdivision is about

A franked distribution to certain partnerships and trusts is treated as flowing indirectly to members of the partnership or trust.
 Each member's share of the franking credit on the distribution is included in 
<center>Back to Top</center>
 that member's assessable income.
 Each member is then given a tax offset equal to that share of the franking credit, provided the member is not itself a partnership or trust through which the distribution flows indirectly.
 Where the trustee, rather than a member, is the taxpayer on a share of the distribution, it is the trustee in that capacity who is given the tax offset under this Subdivision.

Subdivision&#160;207-E&#151;No gross-up or tax offset where distribution is not taxed in any case
 Guide to Subdivision&#160;207-E
 207-105  What this Subdivision is about

If an entity would not in any case pay income tax on a franked distribution:

*	no amount is included in the entity's assessable income as a result of the franking credit on the distribution; and

*	the entity is not entitled to a tax offset as a result of the distribution.
