                     (b)  the consideration received by the members for the disposal were equal to the * market value of the membership interest at that time;

the * reduced cost base of the membership interest would have been reduced as a result of the operation of section 165-115ZD of this Act or the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_, then the reduced cost base of the membership interest that is to be used in subsection (1) of this section is reduced by the amount of that reduction.

Where liability valued differently for joined group

             (4)  Subsection 705-65(4) applies in relation to assets mentioned in subsection (2) of this section in a corresponding way to that in which it applies in relation to members’ * membership interests.

Reduction in reduced cost base under subsection 165-115ZA(3) to be added back

             (5)  If:

                     (a)  in working out the * reduced cost base of a * member’s asset for the purposes of subsection (2), a reduction has taken place under subsection 165-115ZA(3) (about alterations in ownership or control of loss companies); and

                     (b)  the reduction is to some extent attributable to so much of an amount that was taken into account both in working out the amount of the reduction and in working out:

                              (i)  the step 5 amount under section 705-100; or

                             (ii)  the step 6 amount under section 705-110;

the reduced cost base is, to the extent mentioned in paragraph (b), increased by:

                     (c)  if subparagraph (b)(i) applies—the amount of that reduction; or

                     (d)  if subparagraph (b)(ii) applies—the amount of that reduction multiplied by the * general company tax rate.

## 28  Section 705-90

Repeal the section, substitute:

##### <a id="705-90"></a>705-90  Undistributed, frankable profits accruing to joined group before joining time—step 3 in working out allocable cost amount

             (1)  For the purposes of step 3 in the table in section 705-60, the step 3 amount is worked out in accordance with this section.

Undistributed profits

             (2)  First work out the undistributed profits of the joining entity at the joining time. These are the amounts that, in accordance with * accounting standards, or statements of accounting concepts made by the Australian Accounting Standards Board, are retained profits of the joining entity that could be recognised in the joining entity’s statement of financial position if that statement were prepared as at the joining time.

Extent to which dividends paid out of undistributed profits would be frankable

             (3)  Then work out the extent to which the undistributed profits, if they had been distributed as dividends at the joining time, could have been franked in accordance with section 160AQF of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ on the assumptions in subsection (4) of this section.

Assumptions for purposes of subsection (3)

             (4)  The assumptions are that the joining entity’s franking account balance at the end of the income year that ends, or, if section 701-30 applies, of the income year that is taken by subsection (3) of that section to end, at the joining time had been adjusted to take account of franking credits or franking debits that would arise if the following were paid just before the joining time:

                     (a)  the income tax, or * refund of income tax, on the joining entity’s taxable income for that income year; and

                     (b)  any income tax, or refund of income tax, that has not yet been paid (regardless of whether it has become payable or due for payment) on the joining entity’s taxable income for any earlier income year, other than one excluded by subsection (5).

Exclusion of certain income years where previous membership of a consolidated group

             (5)  If the joining entity was previously a * subsidiary member of a * consolidated group, any income year earlier than the one that started, or, if section 701-30 applies, the one that is taken by subsection (3) of that section to have started, when the joining entity ceased to be a subsidiary member of that group is excluded for the purposes of paragraph (4)(b) of this section.

Undistributed profits must have accrued to joined group and not recouped losses

             (6)  Next:

                     (a)  work out the extent to which the undistributed profits that, if they had been distributed as dividends at the joining time, could have been so franked accrued to the joined group before the joining time (subsection (7) states what it means for a profit to accrue to the joined group before the joining time); and

                     (b)  then exclude those that recouped losses of any * sort that accrued to the joined group before the joining time (subsection (8) states what it means for a loss to accrue to the joined group before the joining time).

The result is the step 3 amount.

Profit accruing to the joined group before the joining time

             (7)  A profit accrued to the joined group before the joining time if, on the following assumptions:

                     (a)  that it was distributed to holders of * membership interests as it accrued; and

                     (b)  that entities interposed between the * head company and the joining entity successively distributed any of it immediately after receiving it;

it would have been received by the entity that is the head company at the joining time, in respect of membership interests that it held continuously until that time either directly or indirectly through interposed entities.

Loss accruing to the joined group before the joining time

             (8)  A loss accrued to the joined group before the joining time if and to the extent that, assuming that as it arose it were instead a profit that was accruing, a distribution of that profit would have been a distribution made to the joined group out of profits that accrued to the joined group before the joining time.

Use of reliable estimates

             (9)  In working out:

                     (a)  for the purposes of subsection (4), the amount of income tax, or * refund of income tax, on the joining entity’s taxable income for a particular income year and the extent to which it has not yet been paid; or

                     (b)  for the purposes of subsection (7), the amount of a profit that accrued to the joined group during a particular period; or

                     (c)  for the purposes of subsection (8), the amount of a loss that accrued to the joined group during a particular period;

use the most reliable basis for estimation that is available.

Repeal the heading.

## 38  Section 705-120

#### Application and object

##### <a id="705-135"></a>705-135  Application and object of this Subdivision

Application

             (1)  This Subdivision has effect for the head company core purposes set out in subsection 701-1(2) if one or more entities become * subsidiary members of a * consolidated group at the time (the **_formation time_**) it comes into existence as a consolidated group.

Note:          This is the first exception to Subdivision 705-A: see paragraph 705-15(a).

Object

             (2)  The object of this Subdivision is to modify the rules in Subdivision 705-A (which basically determine the tax cost setting amount for assets of an entity joining an existing * consolidated group) so that they have effect, and take account of different circumstances that apply, when a consolidated group comes into existence.

Note:          The main circumstance is where one of the entities has membership interests in another. In such a case, the order in which the rules in Subdivision 705-A are applied will affect the tax cost setting amounts for the assets of the entities.

#### Modified application of Subdivision 705-A

##### <a id="705-140"></a>705-140  Subdivision 705-A has effect with modifications

             (1)  Subdivision 705-A has effect in relation to each entity becoming a * subsidiary member of the * consolidated group at the formation time in the same way as that Subdivision has effect in relation to an entity becoming a subsidiary member of a consolidated group in circumstances covered by that Subdivision.

             (2)  However, that effect of Subdivision 705-A is subject to modifications set out in this Subdivision.

##### <a id="705-145"></a>705-145  Order in which tax cost setting amounts are to be worked out where subsidiary members have membership interests in other subsidiary members

Object

             (1)  The object of this section is to ensure that where, on becoming * subsidiary members, entities hold assets consisting of * membership interests in other subsidiary members, the * head company’s cost of becoming the holder of the assets of all of the entities that become subsidiary members correctly reflects the group’s cost of acquiring the entities.

Tax cost setting amounts to be worked out from top down

             (2)  If, on becoming * subsidiary members, entities hold * membership interests in any other entities that become subsidiary members, the * tax cost setting amounts for the assets of entities holding membership interests must be worked out before the tax cost setting amounts for the assets of the entities in which the membership interests are held.

Note:          The tax cost setting amount in respect of assets of any subsidiary member in which the head company, but no other subsidiary member, holds membership interests can be worked out in any order in relation to the calculations for other subsidiary members.

Tax cost setting amount for higher entity’s membership interests to be used in working out lower entity’s tax cost setting amount

             (3)  The tax cost setting amount worked out for assets of an entity mentioned in subsection (2) consisting of * membership interests in another such entity is to be used as the amount for those interests under subsection 705-65(1) (step 1 of allocable cost amount) in working out the tax cost setting amount for assets of that other entity.

Note 1:       Subsection 705-65(1) adds together amounts worked out in accordance with section 705-65 representing the cost of the membership interests that each member of the group holds in the entity. If any of those membership interests is held by another subsidiary member, subsection (3) above will replace the amount otherwise applicable with the tax cost setting amount that will have been worked out for the interests in accordance with subsection (2) above.

Note 2:       The tax cost setting amount worked out for the membership interests has no relevance other than for the purpose mentioned in subsection (3). This is because, under the single entity principle, intra group membership interests are ignored while entities are members of the group. If an entity ceases to be a member, section 701-15 and Division 711 set the tax cost of membership interests in the entity at that time.

Value shifting etc. provisions not to apply to later CGT events involving membership interests

             (4)  However, despite subsection (3), subsection 705-65(4) (which prevents the later operation of value shifting etc. provisions) still applies to the * membership interests.

Rights and options to acquire membership interests

             (5)  For the purposes of this section, if, on becoming a * subsidiary member, an entity holds a right or option (including a contingent right or option), created or issued by another entity that becomes a subsidiary member at the same time, to acquire a * membership interest in that other entity, that right or option is treated as if it were a membership interest in that other entity.

##### <a id="705-150"></a>705-150  Adjustment to result of step 3 in working out allocable cost amount where pre-formation time roll-over from head company to member of wholly-owned group

Object

             (1)  The object of this section is to ensure that, in working out the group’s * allocable cost amount for certain entities that become * subsidiary members of the group at the formation time, an adjustment is made to take account of roll-overs under Subdivision 126-B or section 160ZZO of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ before the formation time.

When section applies

             (2)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  before the formation time, there was a roll-over under Subdivision 126-B or section 160ZZO of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ in relation to a * CGT event (the **_head company roll-over event_**) that happened in relation to an asset (the **_head company_** **_roll-over asset_**), where:

                              (i)  an entity (the **_head company roll-over recipient_**) that becomes a * subsidiary member of the group was the recipient company in relation to the roll-over; and

                             (ii)  the originating company in relation to that roll-over was the entity that becomes the * head company of the group; and

                     (b)  between the roll-over and the formation time, no other CGT event happened in relation to the head company roll-over asset:

                              (i)  for which there was another roll-over satisfying the requirements of paragraph (a); or

                             (ii)  for which there was not a roll-over under Subdivision 126-B or section 160ZZO of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; and

                     (c)  the head company roll-over asset is not a * pre-CGT asset at the formation time; and

                     (d)  the sum of the * cost bases of all of the * head company’s * CGT assets just before the head company roll-over event exceeded or was less than the sum of the cost bases of all of the head company’s CGT assets just after the head company roll-over event (the excess or shortfall being the **_head company roll-over adjustment amount_**).

Adjustment to result of step 3 in allocable cost amount for head company roll-over recipient

             (3)  For the purpose of working out the group’s * allocable cost amount for the head company roll-over recipient, the result of step 3 in the table in section 705-60 is reduced (if the head company roll-over adjustment amount is an excess), or increased (if the head company roll-over adjustment amount is a shortfall), by the amount worked out as follows:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00500/Html/NBTSConsolValueShiftDemergOtherMeasures2002_image002.gif)

where:

                    <a name="market-valu-membership-interest-head-compani-roll-recipi"></a>**_market value of all membership interests in head company roll-over recipient_** means the * market value, at the formation time, of all * membership interests in the head company roll-over recipient that are held by entities that become * members of the group at that time.

Adjustment to result of step 3 in allocable cost amount for interposed entity

             (4)  Also, if this section applies, for the purpose of working out the group’s * allocable cost amount for any entity (the **_target entit_ y**) that:

                     (a)  becomes a * subsidiary member of the group at the formation time; and

                     (b)  is interposed at that time between the * head company and the head company roll-over recipient; and

                     (c)  is the first or only such interposed entity;

the result of step 3 in the table in section 705-60 is reduced (if the head company roll-over adjustment amount is an excess), or increased (if the head company roll-over adjustment amount is a shortfall), by the amount worked out as follows:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00500/Html/NBTSConsolValueShiftDemergOtherMeasures2002_image003.gif)

where:

                    <a name="market-valu-membership-interest-head-compani-roll-recipi"></a>**_market value of all membership interests in head company roll-over recipient_** has the same meaning as in subsection (3).

                    <a name="market-valu-head-compani-indirect-membership-interest-head-compani-roll-recipi"></a>**_market value of head company’s indirect membership interests in head company roll-over recipient_** means so much of the * market value, at the formation time, of the * head company’s * membership interests in the target entity as is attributable to membership interests that the entity holds directly, or indirectly through other interposed entities that become * subsidiary members of the group at the formation time, in the head company roll-over recipient.

Note:          If under subsection (3) or (4) the amount by which the result of step 3 is to be reduced exceeds that result, the excess is treated as a capital gain of the head company.

##### <a id="705-155"></a>705-155  Adjustment in working out step 4 of allocable cost amount for successive distributions through interposed entities

Object

             (1)  The object of this section is to ensure that, in working out the group’s * allocable cost amount for entities that become * subsidiary members of the group at the formation time, there is only one reduction under step 4 in the table in section 705-60 (about pre-formation time distributions out of certain profits) for distributions of the same profits.

When section applies

             (2)  This section applies if, apart from this section:

                     (a)  in working out the group’s * allocable cost amount for an entity that becomes a * subsidiary member of the group at the formation time, there would be a reduction under step 4 in the table in section 705-60 for a distribution (the **_first distribution_**) made by the entity; and

                     (b)  in working out the group’s * allocable cost amount for a second entity that becomes a * subsidiary member of the group at that time, there would also be a reduction under that step for any of the first distribution that the second entity successively distributed as mentioned in paragraph 705-95(a).

No step 4 reduction in respect of successive distribution of amount for which there has already been a step 4 reduction

             (3)  If this section applies, there is no reduction as mentioned in paragraph (2)(b).

##### <a id="705-160"></a>705-160  Adjustment to allocation of allocable cost amount to take account of owned losses of certain entities that become subsidiary members

Object

             (1)  The object of this section is to prevent a distortion under section 705-35 in the allocation of * allocable cost amount to an entity that becomes a * subsidiary member of the group where that entity has * membership interests in another entity that has certain tax losses when it becomes a subsidiary member.

Adjustment to allocation of allocable cost amount

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  an entity becomes a * subsidiary member of the group at the formation time; and

                     (b)  the entity has * membership interests in a second entity that becomes a subsidiary member of the group at that time; and

                     (c)  in working out the group’s * allocable cost amount for the second entity an amount is required to be subtracted (the **_loss subtraction amount_**) under step 5 in the table in section 705-60 (about losses accruing before becoming a subsidiary member of the group);

then, for the purposes of working out under section 705-35 the * tax cost setting amount for the assets of the first entity, the * market value of the first entity’s membership interests in the second entity is increased by the first entity’s interest in the loss subtraction amount (see subsection (3)).

First entity’s interest in loss subtraction amount

             (3)  The first entity’s interest in the loss subtraction amount is worked out using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00500/Html/NBTSConsolValueShiftDemergOtherMeasures2002_image004.gif)

##### <a id="705-165"></a>705-165  Working out pre-CGT factors where subsidiary members have membership interests in other subsidiary members

Object

             (1)  The object of this section is to ensure that where, on becoming * subsidiary members, entities hold * membership interests in other subsidiary members, the pre-CGT status of membership interests held by the * head company, and not the pre-CGT status of membership interests held by other entities, is used to work out the * pre-CGT factor under section 705-125 for assets of the other subsidiary members.

Pre-CGT factor to be worked out from top down

             (2)  If, on becoming * subsidiary members, entities hold * membership interests in any other entities that become subsidiary members, the * pre-CGT factor for the assets of entities holding membership interests must be worked out before the pre-CGT factor for the assets of the entities in which the membership interests are held.

Repeal the section, substitute:

##### <a id="705-40"></a>705-40  Tax cost setting amount for reset cost base assets held on revenue account

             (1)  The * tax cost setting amount for a reset cost base asset that is * trading stock, a * depreciating asset or a * revenue asset must not exceed the greater of:

                     (a)  the asset’s * market value; and

                     (b)  the joining entity’s * terminating value for the asset.

             (2)  If subsection (1) _reduces_ the asset’s * tax cost setting amount, the amount of the reduction is allocated among the other reset cost base assets (including other * trading stock, * depreciating assets and * revenue assets) other than excluded assets, so as to _increase_ their tax cost setting amounts, in accordance with the principles set out in subsection (3).

Note:          If any of the amount of the reduction cannot be allocated, it is instead treated as a capital loss of the head company.

             (3)  These are the principles:

                     (a)  the allocation is to be in proportion to the * market values of the assets;

                     (b)  the amount allocated to an item of * trading stock, to a * depreciating asset or to a * revenue asset must not cause its * tax cost setting amount to contravene subsection (1);

                     (c)  any of the amount that cannot be allocated is to be reallocated, to the maximum extent possible, among the remaining reset cost base assets (other than excluded assets) by applying this subsection a further one or more times.

\[This is the end of the Guide.]

#### Objects

##### <a id="717-5"></a>717-5  Objects of this Subdivision

             (1)  The main objects of this Subdivision are set out in subsections (2), (3) and (4).

             (2)  The first of those objects is to allow the * head company of a * consolidated group to get the benefit of foreign tax paid in respect of foreign income (within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) included in the head company’s assessable income because another entity is or was a * subsidiary member of the group.

             (3)  The second of those objects is to allow the * head company of a * consolidated group to apply, in relation to an income year, * excess foreign tax credits of an entity (the **_joining entity_**) that becomes a * subsidiary member of the group at a time (the **_joining time_**) if:

                     (a)  the income year starts after the joining time; and

                     (b)  those excess foreign tax credits are from an income year ending before the joining time.

             (4)  The third of those objects is to prevent an entity (other than the * head company of the group) from applying * excess foreign tax credits mentioned in paragraph (3)(b) to increase its own credits in respect of foreign tax.

#### Foreign tax on amounts in head company’s assessable income

##### <a id="717-10"></a>717-10  Head company taken to be liable for subsidiary member’s foreign tax

             (1)  This section operates if:

                     (a)  an entity was a * subsidiary member of a * consolidated group for all or part of an income year; and

                     (b)  the assessable income of the * head company of the group for that income year included foreign income (within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_); and

                     (c)  the entity paid, and was personally liable for, foreign tax (within the meaning of that Act) in respect of that foreign income (whether or not the entity was a subsidiary member of the group at the time of payment).

             (2)  Section 160AF of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ operates as if:

                     (a)  the * head company had paid and been personally liable for the foreign tax; and

                     (b)  the entity had not paid and had not been personally liable for the foreign tax.

Note:          Section 160AF of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ provides a foreign tax credit (which is a tax offset) of an amount that depends on:

(a)           foreign tax that an entity paid, and was personally liable for, in respect of foreign income included in the entity’s assessable income; and

(b)           the amount of Australian tax payable (worked out as described in that section) in respect of the foreign income.

             (3)  This section does not limit the operation of section 160AF of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

#### Foreign tax on amounts not in head company’s assessable income

##### <a id="717-15"></a>717-15  Transferring subsidiary member’s excess foreign tax credits from earlier years to head company

             (1)  This section operates for the purposes of section 160AFE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ in relation to an income year if:

                     (a)  an entity (the **_joining entity_**) becomes a * subsidiary member of a * consolidated group at a time (the **_joining time_**); and

                     (b)  the joining time is:

                              (i)  before the start of that income year; and

                             (ii)  after the start of an earlier income year (the **_earlier year_**); and

                     (c)  the joining entity has * excess foreign tax credits (the **_transfer credits_**) from the earlier year.

             (2)  For those purposes:

                     (a)  the * head company of the group is taken to have the transfer credits; and

                     (b)  the joining entity is taken _not_ to have the transfer credits; and

                     (c)  if, apart from paragraph (a), the head company has * excess foreign tax credits from the earlier year—the transfer credits are taken to be included in those excess foreign tax credits.

             (3)  Subsection (2) also has effect for the purposes of a subsequent operation of this section.

Example:    An entity becomes a subsidiary member of a consolidated group in an income year. This section operates in relation to a later income year so that the entity no longer has the transfer credits mentioned in paragraph (1)(c) (see paragraph (2)(b)). The entity later leaves the group and becomes a subsidiary member of a second consolidated group. In a subsequent operation of this section in relation to the head company of the second group, the entity will not have those transfer credits, because of the previous operation of paragraph (2)(b).

             (4)  This section operates separately in relation to each class of foreign income (within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) identified in subsection 160AF(7) of that Act, as if:

                     (a)  the * head company’s foreign income of that class for an income year were the whole of the head company’s foreign income for that year; and

                     (b)  the joining entity’s foreign income of that class for an income year were the whole of the joining entity’s foreign income for that year.

##### <a id="717-20"></a>717-20  Where entity not subsidiary member for whole of income year

             (1)  This section  operates if:

                     (a)  an entity (the **_joining entity_**) is a * subsidiary member of a * consolidated group for some but not all of an income year (the **_joining year_**); and

                     (b)  there are one or more periods in the joining year (each of which is a **_non-membership period_**) during which the entity is not a subsidiary member of any * consolidated group.

Note:          Section 701-30 treats each non-membership period as a separate income year for some purposes.

             (2)  Subsection (3) has effect for the purposes of section 701-30 in relation to the joining entity.

             (3)  In working out amounts for the joining entity under subsection 701-30(3) in relation to each non-membership period, make these assumptions:

                     (a)  if the joining year starts at the same time as the earliest of those non-membership periods:

                              (i)  subsection 160AFE(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ operates in relation to the joining entity for that non-membership period; and

                             (ii)  subsection 160AFE(2) of that Act does _not_ operate in relation to the joining entity for the later non-membership periods (if any);

                     (b)  otherwise—subsection 160AFE(2) of that Act does _not_ operate in relation to the joining entity for any of the non-membership periods.

             (4)  Subsection (5) has effect for the purposes of section 717-15 in relation to the * head company of the * consolidated group for a later income year.

             (5)  In working out the amount (if any) of the joining entity’s transfer credits (within the meaning of paragraph 717-15(1)(c)) from the joining year, do not include the amount of the joining entity’s * excess foreign tax credits from a non-membership period (if any) that ends at the same time the joining year ends.

##### <a id="717-230"></a>717-230  Calculating FIF income where a company joins the group

             (1)  This section modifies the operation of Part XI of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ if:

                     (a)  a company (the **_joining company_**) becomes a * subsidiary member of a * consolidated group at a time (the **_joining time_**); and

                     (b)  for the purposes of that Part, the FIF attribution account percentage of the joining company in relation to a FIF attribution account entity that is a * FIF is more than nil at the time (the **_surplus time_**) just before the joining time.

             (2)  That Part operates in relation to the joining company as if a notional accounting period of the * FIF in relation to the joining company ended at the time (the **_credit/debit time_**) just before the surplus time.

             (3)  That Part operates in relation to the joining company as if subsection 485(3) of that Act provided that the operative provision applied to the joining company in relation to the * FIF in respect of the notional accounting period of that FIF that ended in the year of income that included the credit/debit time.

             (4)  Paragraph 538(2)(d) of that Act operates in relation to the * head company of the * consolidated group in relation to the * FIF in respect of the notional accounting period of that FIF that included the joining time as if:

                     (a)  the head company had acquired the interest or interests mentioned in that paragraph during that period (so far as those interests are held by the head company because the joining company became a * subsidiary member of the group); and

                     (b)  the amount or value of the consideration paid or given by the head company in respect of the acquisition was equal to the amount worked out under paragraph 538(2)(a) of that Act in relation to the joining company in relation to the FIF in respect of the notional accounting period mentioned in subsection (2) of this section.

Note:          The modifications made by this section:

(a)           apply if a company joins a consolidated group during a notional accounting period of a FIF in which the company has an interest; and

(b)           allow the appropriate calculation of amounts attributed under FIF rules to the head company and joining company before and after the joining time; and

(c)           mean that foreign investment fund income that accrued to the joining company from the FIF will be included in the joining company’s assessable income and will give rise to a FIF attribution credit, and may also give rise to a FIF attribution debit, in relation to the joining company; and

(d)           mean that the FIF attribution surplus and the FIF attributed tax account surplus for the FIF attribution account entity in relation to the joining company at the surplus time will take account of credits and debits arising at the credit/debit time and earlier.

##### <a id="717-265"></a>717-265  Calculating FIF income where a company leaves the group

             (1)  This section modifies the operation of Part XI of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ in relation to a company (the **_transferor company_**) if:

                     (a)  the transferor company is the * head company of a * consolidated group at a time (the **_surplus time_**); and

                     (b)  for the purposes of that Part, the FIF attribution account percentage of the transferor company in relation to a FIF attribution account entity that is a * FIF is more than nil at the surplus time; and

                     (c)  another company (the **_leaving company_**) ceases to be a * subsidiary member of the group at the time (the **_leaving time_**) just after the surplus time; and

                     (d)  for the purposes of that Part, the leaving company’s FIF attribution account percentage in relation to that FIF attribution account entity is more than nil at the leaving time.

             (2)  That Part operates in relation to the transferor company as if a notional accounting period of the * FIF in relation to the transferor company ended at the time (the **_credit/debit time_**) just before the surplus time.

             (3)  That Part operates in relation to the transferor company as if the next notional accounting period of the * FIF in relation to the transferor company started at the surplus time and continued until whichever of these times occurs first:

                     (a)  the time when a notional accounting period of the FIF in relation to the transferor company would have ended apart from this section;

                     (b)  the time when the period ends because of another application of this section.

             (4)  That Part operates in relation to the transferor company as if subsection 485(3) of that Act provided that the operative provision applied to the transferor company in relation to the * FIF in respect of the notional accounting period of that FIF that ended in the year of income that included the credit/debit time.

             (5)  Paragraph 538(2)(d) of that Act operates in relation to the leaving company in relation to the * FIF in respect of the notional accounting period of that FIF that included the leaving time as if:

                     (a)  the leaving company had acquired the interest or interests mentioned in that paragraph during that period (so far as those interests are held by the leaving company because it ceased to be a * subsidiary member of the group); and

                     (b)  the amount or value of the consideration paid or given by the leaving company in respect of the acquisition was equal to the amount worked out under paragraph 538(2)(a) of that Act in relation to the transferor company in relation to the FIF in respect of the notional accounting period mentioned in subsection (2) of this section.

Note:          The modifications made by this section:

(a)           apply if a company leaves a consolidated group during a notional accounting period of a FIF in which the company has an interest; and

(b)           allow the appropriate calculation of amounts attributed under FIF rules to the transferor company and leaving company before and after the leaving time; and

(c)           mean that foreign investment fund income that accrued to the transferor company from the FIF will be included in the transferor company’s assessable income and will give rise to a FIF attribution credit, and may also give rise to a FIF attribution debit, in relation to the transferor company; and

701-B    Modified application of provisions

#### Subdivision 701-A—Preliminary

**Table of sections**

701-1        Transitional group and transitional entity

701-5        Chosen transitional entity

701-10      Interpretation

##### <a id="701-1"></a>701-1  Transitional group and transitional entity

Group formed on 1 July 2002

             (1)  If a consolidated group came into existence on 1 July 2002:

                     (a)  the group is a **_transitional group_**; and

                     (b)  each entity that became a subsidiary member of the group on the day it came into existence is a **_transitional entity_**.

Group formed after 1 July 2002 but before 1 July 2003

             (2)  If a consolidated group came into existence after 1 July 2002 but before 1 July 2003:

                     (a)  the group is a **_transitional group_** if at least one entity that became a subsidiary member of the group on the day the group came into existence is a **_transitional entity_**; and

                     (b)  an entity is a transitional entity if:

                              (i)  at no time after 1 July 2002 and before the group came into existence was the entity a wholly-owned subsidiary of the entity (the **_future head company_**) that became the head company of the group; or

                             (ii)  at some time during that period, the entity was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the future head company and it remained such from the earliest time after 1 July 2002 when it was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the future head company until the group came into existence.

Group formed during financial year starting on 1 July 2003

             (3)  If a consolidated group came into existence during the financial year starting on 1 July 2003:

                     (a)  the group is a **_transitional group_** if at least one entity that became a subsidiary member of the group on the day the group came into existence is a transitional entity; and

                     (b)  an entity is a **_transitional entity_** if:

                              (i)  just before 1 July 2003, it was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the future head company; and

                             (ii)  it remained such from the earliest time after 1 July 2002 when it was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the future head company until the group came into existence.

##### <a id="701-5"></a>701-5  Chosen transitional entity

             (1)  If a group is a transitional group, its head company may choose that the group’s transitional entity is a **_chosen transitional entity_**, or one or more of the group’s transitional entities are **_chosen transitional entities_**.

Period for making choice

             (2)  The choice must be made by the end of the period described in subsection 703-50(3) for giving the Commissioner the choice under section 703-50 that the group is taken to be consolidated.

Choice is irrevocable

             (3)  The choice cannot be revoked.

##### <a id="701-10"></a>701-10  Interpretation

                   A reference in this Division to:

                     (a)  a provision of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; or

                     (b)  a consolidated group’s allocable cost amount for an entity;

is a reference to that provision as it applies to the group, or to the allocable cost amount as it is worked out for the entity, in accordance with Subdivision 705-B of that Act and with this Division.

#### Subdivision 701-B—Modified application of provisions

**Table of sections**

701-15      Tax cost and trading stock value not set for assets of chosen transitional entities

701-20      Working out allocable cost amount on formation for subsidiary members other than chosen transitional entities

701-25      No operation of value shifting and loss transfer provisions to membership interests in chosen transitional entities

701-30      Undistributed, unfrankable pre-formation profits of non-chosen transitional entities—adjustment to allocable cost amount and tax cost setting amount reduction for over-depreciated assets

701-35      CGT event for pre-formation roll-over after 16 May 2002 to be disregarded if cost base etc. would be different

701-40      When entity leaves transitional group, head company may choose, for purposes of transitional group’s allocable cost amount, to increase terminating values of over-depreciated assets

701-45      When entity leaves transitional group, head company may choose, for purposes of transitional group’s allocable cost amount, to use formation time market values, instead of terminating values, for certain pre-CGT assets

##### <a id="701-15"></a>701-15  Tax cost and trading stock value not set for assets of chosen transitional entities

                   Section 701-10 (cost to head company of assets that entity brings into group) and subsection 701-35(4) (setting value of trading stock at tax-neutral amount) do not apply to the assets of a chosen transitional entity.

Note:          The fact that the head company inherits the entity’s history under section 701-5 when the entity becomes a subsidiary member of the group means that the entity’s assets would be treated as having the same cost as they would for the entity at that time.

##### <a id="701-20"></a>701-20  Working out allocable cost amount on formation for subsidiary members other than chosen transitional entities

When section applies

             (1)  This section applies if any of the transitional entities in the transitional group is a chosen transitional entity.

Allocable cost amount to be worked out in special way

             (2)  If this section applies, the group’s allocable cost amount for each of the entities, other than a chosen transitional entity, that become subsidiary members when the group comes into existence (each of which is a **_non-chosen subsidiary_**) is worked out in a special way.

How to work out allocable cost amount

             (3)  The allocable cost amount for each non-chosen subsidiary is the sum of:

                     (a)  the head company adjusted allocable amount for the non-chosen subsidiary (see subsection (4)); and

                     (b)  for each sub-group (see subsection (6)) that exists in relation to the non-chosen subsidiary—the sub-group’s notional allocable cost amount (see subsection(5)) for the non-chosen subsidiary.

Head company adjusted allocable amount

             (4)  The **_head company adjusted allocable amount_** for the non-chosen subsidiary is the amount that would be the transitional group’s allocable cost amount for that entity if;

                     (a)  the holding of all sub-group membership interests were disregarded; and

                     (b)  only the following proportion of each of the step 2 to step 7 amounts in the table in section 705-60 was taken into account:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00500/Html/NBTSConsolValueShiftDemergOtherMeasures2002_image006.gif)

                            where:

**_market value of all membership interests in non-chosen subsidiary_** means the market value, at the time the group comes into existence, of all membership interests in the non-chosen subsidiary that are held by entities that become members of the group at that time.

**_market value of head company’s direct and indirect membership interests in non-chosen subsidiary_** means the market value, at the time the group comes into existence, of all membership interests in the non-chosen subsidiary that the head company holds directly or indirectly through interposed entities that become subsidiary members of the group at that time and are not included in any sub-group in relation to the non-chosen subsidiary.

Sub-group’s notional allocable cost amount

             (5)  For each sub-group that exists in relation to the non-chosen subsidiary, there is a **_sub-group’s notional allocable cost amount_**. That amount is the amount that would be a consolidated group’s allocable cost amount for the non-chosen subsidiary if:

                     (a)  the consolidated group came into existence at the same time as the transitional group and consisted only of the non-chosen subsidiary and the entities comprising the sub-group; and

                     (b)  the chosen transitional entity in the sub-group were the head company of the consolidated group; and

                     (c)  the only membership interests that any entity in the sub-group held in any other member of the consolidated group were the sub-group membership interests (see subsection (6)) in relation to the sub-group; and

                     (d)  only the following proportion of each of the step 2 to step 7 amounts in the table in section 705-60 was taken into account:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00500/Html/NBTSConsolValueShiftDemergOtherMeasures2002_image007.gif)

                            where:

**_market value of all membership interests in non-chosen subsidiary_** means the market value, at the time the group comes into existence, of all membership interests in the non-chosen subsidiary that are held by entities that become members of the group at that time.

**_market value of chosen transitional entity’s direct and indirect membership interests in non-chosen subsidiary_** means the market value, at the time the group comes into existence, of all membership interests in the non-chosen subsidiary that the chosen transitional entity holds directly or indirectly through interposed entities that are included in the sub-group.

Sub-group and sub-group membership interests

             (6)  If a chosen transitional entity holds membership interests in a non-chosen subsidiary, either directly or indirectly through one or more other entities, each of which is a non-chosen subsidiary:

                     (a)  the chosen transitional entity and each interposed non-chosen subsidiary comprise a **_sub-group_** in relation to the non-chosen subsidiary (unless the non-chosen subsidiary is included in a sub-group in relation to another non-chosen subsidiary); and

                     (b)  the following membership interests are the **_sub-group membership interests_** in relation to the sub-group:

                              (i)  the membership interests that the chosen transitional entity holds directly in the non-chosen subsidiary or in any of the interposed non-chosen subsidiaries;

                             (ii)  the membership interests that each interposed non-chosen subsidiary holds directly in the non-chosen subsidiary or in any of the other interposed non-chosen subsidiaries.

##### <a id="701-25"></a>701-25  No operation of value shifting and loss transfer provisions to membership interests in chosen transitional entities

                   If any provision of this Act would, because of events that happened before the time the transitional group came into existence, apply to a CGT event that happens after that time to change the cost base or reduced cost base of  the members’ membership interests in a chosen transitional entity, the provision does not so apply.

Note:          For example, such a provision could otherwise apply where a loss transfer or value shift involving the entity has occurred.

##### <a id="701-30"></a>701-30  Undistributed, unfrankable pre-formation profits of non-chosen transitional entities—adjustment to allocable cost amount and tax cost setting amount reduction for over-depreciated assets

Application of section to non-chosen transitional entities where transitional group formed before 1 July 2003

             (1)  This section applies if the transitional group comes into existence before 1 July 2003\. It applies to each transitional entity in the transitional group, other than a chosen transitional entity. This is so even if there are no chosen transitional entities at all.

Increase in step 3 of allocable cost amount on group formation

             (2)  The amount to be added under section 705-90 (step 3 of allocable cost amount) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ in working out the transitional group’s allocable cost amount for the transitional entity is increased by the additional undistributed profits (the **_step 3 unfrankable profits increase_**) that would form part of the step 3 amount under that section if:

                     (a)  subsections (3) and (4), and paragraph (6)(b), of that section were disregarded; and

                     (b)  it were a requirement of that section that, if any additional undistributed profits resulting from paragraph (a) of this subsection were distributed as dividends just before the group came into existence, the head company and each other transitional entity interposed between the head company and the transitional entity would be entitled to a rebate of income tax under section 46 or 46A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ on the dividends.

Increase in tax deferral amount in relation to over-depreciated assets

             (3)  The tax deferral amount for the purposes of applying section 705-50 (reduction in tax cost setting amount for over-depreciated assets) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ in relation to an asset of the transitional entity that becomes that of the head company under subsection 701-1(1) (the single entity rule) of that Act when the transitional group comes into existence is increased by the amount worked out under subsection (4) of this section.

Amount of increase in tax deferral amount

             (4)  The increase is equal to the amount that would have been the step 3 unfrankable profits increase if the undistributed profits constituting that increase were also required to satisfy the following requirements:

                     (a)  the profits were not subject to income tax because of deductions for the asset’s decline in value;

                     (b)  the decline in value represented the over-depreciation of the asset;

                     (c)  the deductions for the decline in value do not form part of a tax loss covered by the step 5 amount mentioned in step 5 in the table in section 705-60 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ in working out the transitional group’s allocable cost amount for the transitional entity.

##### <a id="701-35"></a>701-35  CGT event for pre-formation roll-over after 16 May 2002 to be disregarded if cost base etc. would be different

                   If:

                     (a)  after 16 May 2002 and before the transitional group came into existence, a CGT event happened in relation to an asset for which there was:

                              (i)  a roll-over under Subdivision 126-B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; or

                             (ii)  roll-over relief under section 40-340 of that Act in a case covered by item 4 of the table in subsection (1) of that section; and

                     (b)  the cost base or reduced cost base of that asset or any other asset that:

                              (i)  became an asset of the head company when the transitional group came into existence because subsection 701-1(1) (the single entity rule) of that Act applies; or

                             (ii)  was otherwise an asset of the head company at that time;

                            differs at that time from what it would have been if the roll-over had not occurred or there had been no such roll-over relief;

then Part 3-90 of the _Income Tax Assessment 1997_ applies as if the CGT event had not happened.

##### <a id="701-40"></a>701-40  When entity leaves transitional group, head company may choose, for purposes of transitional group’s allocable cost amount, to increase terminating values of over-depreciated assets

             (1)  This section applies if an entity ceases to be a subsidiary member of the transitional group and the requirements of subsections (2) to (5) are satisfied.

Asset held at leaving time

             (2)  Just before the entity ceases to be a subsidiary member, it must, disregarding subsection 701-1(1) (the single entity rule) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, hold an asset.

Reduction of asset’s tax cost setting amount for over-depreciation

             (3)  When the transitional group came into existence:

                     (a)  the asset must have become that of the head company of the transitional group because subsection 701-1(1) of that Act applied in relation to a transitional entity; and

                     (b)  section 705-50 of that Act must have reduced by an amount (the **_reduction amount_**) the tax cost setting amount for the asset.

Asset held continuously within group

             (4)  The asset must, disregarding subsection 701-1(1) of that Act, have been held at all times by the head company or a subsidiary member of the transitional group from when the transitional group came into existence until the entity ceases to be a subsidiary member of the transitional group.

Head company’s advice to leaving entity

             (5)  Before the entity ceases to be a subsidiary member of the transitional group, the head company must have advised the entity of the amount that the head company proposes to choose under subsection (6) of this section in relation to the asset.

Note:          This information would need to be known by the entity if it later becomes a subsidiary member of another consolidated group and still holds the asset. This is because subsection 705-50(5) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ requires a reduction in the tax cost setting amount for the asset on joining that other group and the amount chosen by the head company under this section is relevant to working out that reduction.

Head company’s choice

             (6)  If this section applies, the head company may, in relation to the entity’s ceasing to be a subsidiary member, choose that the terminating valuefor the asset, that is to be used in applying step 1 of the table in section 711-20 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, is increased by so much of the reduction amount as the head company chooses.

##### <a id="701-45"></a>701-45  When entity leaves transitional group, head company may choose, for purposes of transitional group’s allocable cost amount, to use formation time market values, instead of terminating values, for certain pre-CGT assets

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  an entity ceases to be a subsidiary member of the transitional group; and

                     (b)  just before the transitional group came into existence, the entity that became the head company held a pre-CGT asset; and

                     (c)  that holding of the asset did not occur as a result of a CGT event:

                              (i)  for which there was a roll-over under Subdivision 126-B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

                             (ii)  that occurred after 11.45 am by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory on 21 September 1999; and

                     (d)  just before the entity ceases to be a subsidiary member of the group, the asset is still a pre-CGT asset and is held by the head company only because the entity is taken by subsection 701-1(1) (the single entity rule) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ to be a part of the head company.

             (2)  If this section applies, the head company may, in relation to the entity’s ceasing to be a subsidiary member, choose that the terminating value for the asset, that is to be used in applying step 1 of the table in section 711-20 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, is equal to its market value just before the transitional group came into existence.

### Division 702—Modified application of this Act to assets that an entity brings into a consolidated group

**Table of sections**

702-1        Modified application of section 40-77 of this Act to assets that an entity brings into a consolidated group

702-5        Modified application of subsection 40-285(6) of this Act after entity brings assets into consolidated group

##### <a id="702-1"></a>702-1  Modified application of section 40-77 of this Act to assets that an entity brings into a consolidated group

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  an entity becomes a subsidiary member of a consolidated group; and

                     (b)  just before it does so, section 40-77 of this Act applies to an asset that it holds.

             (2)  For so long as the asset continues to be:

                     (a)  an asset of the head company because subsection 701-1(1) (the single entity rule) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies; or

                     (b)  an asset of another entity, where it became such an asset as a result of that subsection ceasing to apply on the entity ceasing to be a subsidiary member of the group;

then, despite certain provisions of that Act applying, in accordance with subsection 701-55(2) of that Act, as if the asset were acquired for a payment equal to its tax cost setting amount:

                     (c)  subsection 40-77(1) continues to apply to the asset; and

Note:       This means that Division 40 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ continues not to apply to an asset that is a mining, quarrying or prospecting right.

                     (d)  subsection 40-77(2) continues to apply to the asset, but applies as if the reference in that subsection to the cost of the asset were a reference to the cost worked out on the basis that the asset were acquired for a payment equal to its tax cost setting amount; and

                     (e)  subsection 40-77(3) continues to apply to the asset, but applies as if the reference in that subsection to the amount included in assessable income under subsection 40-285(1) of that Act were a reference to the amount so worked out on the basis that the asset were acquired for a payment equal to its tax cost setting amount.

##### <a id="702-5"></a>702-5  Modified application of subsection 40-285(6) of this Act after entity brings assets into consolidated group

                   If:

                     (a)  an entity becomes a subsidiary member of a consolidated group; and

                     (b)  because subsection 701-1(1) (the single entity rule) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies, an asset of the entity becomes an asset of the head company of the group; and

                     (c)  a balancing adjustment event happens in relation to the asset while it is an asset of the head company;

subsection 40-285(6) of this Act (about reducing the amount included in assessable income for a balancing adjustment event) applies as if the cost of the asset were equal to the tax cost setting amount applicable in relation to the asset for the purposes of having its tax cost set by section 701-10 (cost to head company of assets that entity brings into group) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

Note:          The tax cost setting amount applicable in relation to the asset for that purpose is worked out in accordance with Division 705 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997._

## 8  At the end of subsection 707-327(1)

Add:

Note:          This section has effect even if the amount added to the real loss-maker’s modified market value under section 707-325 is nil because the value donor’s modified market value is nil.

##### <a id="717-15"></a>717-15  Head company’s accelerated access to joining entity’s excess foreign tax credits from earlier years

             (1)  This section  operates in relation to an income year if:

                     (a)  a consolidated group came into existence during an income year (the **_current year_**); and

                     (b)  the current year ended before 1 July 2004; and

                     (c)  section 160AFE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ as amended by the _New Business Tax System (Consolidation, Value Shifting, Demergers and Other Measures) Act 2002_ applies in relation to the head company of the consolidated group for the current year; and

                     (d)  an entity (the **_joining entity_**) became a subsidiary member of a consolidated group at a time (the **_joining time_**) during the current year; and

                     (e)  the condition in subsection (2) is satisfied.

             (2)  The condition is that the joining entity and the head company of the group were members of the same wholly-owned group:

                     (a)  if the joining time was the start of the current year or the time the joining entity came into existence—at the joining time; or

                     (b)  otherwise—throughout the period:

                              (i)  beginning at the start of the current year, or the time the joining entity came into existence (whichever is later); and

                             (ii)  ending at the joining time.

             (3)  For the purposes of section 717-15 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ in relation to the current year, the reference in subparagraph 717-15(1)(b)(i) of that Act to the start of that income year is taken to be a reference to the end of that income year.

##### <a id="717-20"></a>717-20  Head company’s accelerated access to joining entity’s excess foreign tax credits from joining year

             (1)  This section operates if:

                     (a)  a consolidated group came into existence during an income year (the **_current year_**); and

                     (b)  the current year ended before 1 July 2004; and

                     (c)  section 160AFE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ as amended by the _New Business Tax System (Consolidation, Value Shifting, Demergers and Other Measures) Act 2002_ applies in relation to the head company of the consolidated group for the current year; and

                     (d)  an entity (the **_joining entity_**) became a subsidiary member of the consolidated group at a time (the **_joining time_**) during the current year; and

                     (e)  the condition in subsection (2) is satisfied; and

                      (f)  the joining entity had excess foreign tax credits from the earliest non-membership period (under section 701-30 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_) in the current year.

             (2)  The condition is that the joining entity and the head company of the consolidated group were members of the same wholly-owned group:

                     (a)  if the joining time was the start of the current year or the time the joining entity came into existence—at the joining time; or

                     (b)  otherwise—throughout the period:

                              (i)  beginning at the start of the current year, or the time the joining entity came into existence (whichever is later); and

                             (ii)  ending at the joining time.

             (3)  Section 160AFE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ operates in relation to the head company of the consolidated group for the current year as if:

                     (a)  subsection 160AFE(4) of that Act provided that the amount of the excess foreign tax credits mentioned in paragraph (1)(f) of this section was the amount of the head company’s excess foreign tax credits from an earlier year of income (the **_notional year_**); and

                     (b)  paragraphs 160AFE(3)(a) and (b) of that Act provided that the excess foreign tax credits from the notional year should be applied before the other credits mentioned in those paragraphs.

##### <a id="717-25"></a>717-25  No double counting of foreign tax

                   To avoid doubt, sections 717-15 and 717-20 do not operate so as to result in an amount of foreign tax (within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) being counted twice for the purposes of section 160AF of that Act.

\[The next Division is Division 820.]

###### Schedule 10—Consolidation: consequential provisions for international tax

<h9 class="ActHead9">Income Tax Assessment Act 1936</h9>

## 1  Section 160AFE

Repeal the section, substitute:

##### <a id="160AFE"></a>160AFE  Carrying forward excess foreign tax credits

             (1)  This section operates if the amount (the **_current foreign tax amount_**) worked out under paragraph 160AF(1)(c) for a taxpayer for a year of income (the **_current year_**) falls short of the amount worked out under paragraph 160AF(1)(d) for the taxpayer for the current year.

             (2)  The taxpayer’s excess foreign tax credits from earlier years of income (see subsection (4)) are applied in accordance with subsection (3) to increase the current foreign tax amount.

             (3)  Apply those credits according to the following rules:

                     (a)  only apply credits from the most recent 5 years of income ending before the current year;

                     (b)  apply credits from an earlier year of income before applying credits for a later year of income;

                     (c)  do not apply credits beyond the extent of the shortfall mentioned in subsection (1);

                     (d)  do not apply credits to the extent that the credits have already been applied under a previous operation of this section.

             (4)  The taxpayer has **_excess foreign tax credits_** from an earlier year of income (the **_earlier year_**) if the amount worked out under paragraph 160AF(1)(c) for the taxpayer for the earlier year exceeds the amount worked out under paragraph 160AF(1)(d) for the taxpayer for the earlier year. The amount of the credits equals the excess.

             (5)  This section operates separately in relation to each class of foreign income identified in subsection 160AF(7), as if the taxpayer’s foreign income of that class for a year of income were the whole of the taxpayer’s foreign income for that year.

## 2  Basic rule about application of section 160AFE

(1)        Section 160AFE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ as amended by this Schedule applies in relation to a taxpayer for each of its:

                     (a)  income years starting after 30 June 2003; and

                     (b)  non-membership periods (if any) under section 701-30 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ starting after 30 June 2003.

(2)        This item does not apply in relation to a taxpayer to which item 3  applies.

Note:          If you have a substituted accounting period, item 5 or 7 may apply instead of this item.

## 3  Different application for members of certain groups

(1)        This item applies to a taxpayer if:

                     (a)  the taxpayer becomes a member of a consolidated group or MEC group on the day (the **_consolidation day_**) the group comes into existence; and

                     (b)  the consolidation day either is before 1 July 2003 or is both:

                              (i)  the first day of the first income year starting after 30 June 2003 of the group’s head company (for a consolidated group) or provisional head company (for a MEC group) on the consolidation day; and

                             (ii)  before 1 July 2004; and

                     (c)  the taxpayer was not a member of a consolidated group or MEC group before the consolidation day.

(2)        Section 160AFE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ as amended by this Schedule applies in relation to the taxpayer for each of its:

                     (a)  income years starting on or after the consolidation day; and

                     (b)  non-membership periods (if any) under section 701-30 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ starting on or after the consolidation day.

Note:          If you become the head company of a consolidated group on or after 1 July 2002 and before 1 July 2003 on a day that is not the start of your income year, item 6 will apply instead of this item.

## 4  Transitional provision for section 160AFE

For the purposes of paragraph 160AFE(3)(d) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ as in force immediately after the commencement of this Schedule, take account of an amount utilised or applied under section 160AFE of that Act as in force either before or after that commencement for a year of income ending before or after that commencement.

5  Modification of basic rule

(1)        This item applies to a taxpayer instead of item 2 if the taxpayer:

                     (a)  has a substituted accounting period; and

                     (b)  is not a member of a consolidated group or a MEC group.

(2)        Section 160AFE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ as amended by this Schedule applies to the taxpayer from 1 July 2003\. That section applies from 1 July 2003 until the start of the taxpayer’s next income year as if that period were an income year.

(3)        Section 160AFE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ as in force just before the commencement of this Schedule (the **_old section 160AFE_**) applies to the taxpayer from the start of the taxpayer’s income year in which 1 July 2003 occurs until the end of 30 June 2003 as if that period were an income year.

6  Consolidation day on or after 1 July 2002 and before 1 July 2003

(1)        This item applies to a taxpayer instead of item 3 if:

                     (a)  the taxpayer becomes the head company of a consolidated group or MEC group on the day (also the **_consolidation day_**) the group comes into existence; and

                     (b)  the consolidation day is on or after 1 July 2002 and before 1 July 2003 and is not the start of an income year (whether or not the taxpayer has a substituted accounting period).

(2)        Section 160AFE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ as amended by this Schedule applies to the taxpayer from the consolidation day. That section applies from the consolidation day until the end of the taxpayer’s income year in which that day occurs as if that period were an income year.

(3)        If:

                     (a)  the consolidation day is after 1 July 2002; and

                     (b)  the taxpayer does not have a substituted accounting period;

the old section 160AFE applies to the taxpayer from 1 July 2002 until just before the consolidation day. If the taxpayer so chooses, it applies as if that period were an income year.

(4)        If the taxpayer has a substituted accounting period, the old section 160AFE applies to the taxpayer from the start of the taxpayer’s income year in which the consolidation day occurred until just before the consolidation day. If the taxpayer so chooses, it applies as if that period were an income year.

7  Consolidation day on or after 1 July 2003

(1)        This item applies to a taxpayer instead of item 2 if:

                     (a)  the taxpayer has a substituted accounting period; and

                     (b)  the taxpayer becomes the head company of a consolidated group or MEC group on the day (also the **_consolidation day_**) the group comes into existence; and

                     (c)  the consolidation day is on or after 1 July 2003 and is not the start of the taxpayer’s next income year.

(2)        Section 160AFE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ as amended by this Schedule applies to the taxpayer from 1 July 2003\. That section applies from 1 July 2003 until the start of the taxpayer’s next income year as if that period were an income year.

(3)        The old section 160AFE applies to the taxpayer from the start of the taxpayer’s income year in which 1 July 2003 occurs until the end of 30 June 2003\. If the taxpayer so chooses, it applies as if that period were an income year.

8  Applying old section 160AFE to part years

(1)        Subitem (2) has effect for the purposes of applying the old section 160AFE:

                     (a)  to a taxpayer as mentioned in item 5, 6 or 7; and

                     (b)  for a period that is shorter than an income year.

(2)        The requirement in paragraph (1D)(b) of that section that the income company be a group company in relation to the credit company in relation to the current year of income has effect as if it were a requirement that the income company be a group company in relation to the credit company:

                     (a)  continuously for a period of at least 12 months ending on the day before the day on which section 160AFE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ as amended by this Schedule starts to apply to the taxpayer; or

                     (b)  from the time when the income company and the credit company were both in existence, if that period is shorter.

9  Applying old section 160AFE to non-membership periods

(1)        Subitem (2) has effect for the purposes of applying the old section 160AFE to a taxpayer that:

                     (a)  becomes a subsidiary member of a consolidated group or MEC group; and

                     (b)  has a period referred to in section 701-30 as a non-membership period.

(2)        The requirement in paragraph (1D)(b) of the old section 160AFE that the income company be a group company in relation to the credit company in relation to the current year of income has effect as if it were a requirement that the income company be a group company in relation to the credit company:

                     (a)  continuously for a period of at least 12 months ending on the last day of the non-membership period; or

                     (b)  from the time when the income company and the credit company were both in existence, if that period is shorter.

10  Parts of income years not earlier income years

Any period that is shorter than an income year and that is treated as if it were an income year for the purposes of item 5, 6 or 7 of this Schedule is taken not to be an earlier income year for the purposes of section 160AFE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ as amended by this Schedule.

## 11  Transitional provision for section 160AF

(1)        This item applies if:

                     (a)  because of item 5, 6 or 7, old section 160AFE applies to a taxpayer as if a period were an income year (the **_notional income year_**); and

                     (b)  the taxpayer has an initial excess credit (within the meaning of old section 160AFE) in relation to the notional income year; and

                     (c)  the taxpayer transfers all or part (the extent of the transfer being the **_transfer amount_**) of that initial excess credit under old section 160AFE for utilisation by another company in the notional income year.

(2)        Section 160AF of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ applies to the taxpayer for the year of income in which the notional income year ends as if the amount of foreign tax paid by the taxpayer mentioned in paragraph 160AF(1)(b) of that Act were reduced by the transfer amount.

(3)        This item operates separately in relation to each class of foreign income identified in subsection 160AF(7) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, as if the taxpayer’s foreign income of that class for a year of income were the whole of the taxpayer’s foreign income for that year.

                            (a)   a * franking credit arises for the first member under item 5, 6 or 7 of the table in section 208-130 (distributions by * exempting entities to exempting entities);

                            (b)   a franking credit or * exempting credit arises for the first member because the distribution is * franked with an exempting credit;

                            (c)   the first member is entitled to a * tax offset because:

                                        (i)   the distribution is a * franked distribution made by an exempting entity; or

##### <a id="208-5"></a>208-5  What is an exempting entity?

                 (1)   An exempting entity is a corporate tax entity that is effectively owned by entities that, either because they are not Australian residents or because they receive distributions as exempt income, would not be able to fully utilise franking credits on distributions by the corporate tax entity.

                 (2)   In deciding whether a corporate tax entity is effectively owned by such entities, these rules:

                            (a)   look at the membership interests in the entity that involve the holder of the interest in bearing the risks and accruing the opportunities of ownership of the entity; and

                            (b)   ask whether at least 95% of those membership interests, and 95% of any interests in those membership interests, are held by Australian residents or entities that receive distributions as exempt income.

##### <a id="208-10"></a>208-10  Former exempting entities

                         When an entity ceases to be an exempting entity, it becomes a former exempting entity.

##### <a id="208-15"></a>208-15  Distributions by exempting entities and former exempting entities

                         To ensure that franking credits accumulated by an exempting entity are not the target of franking credit trading, these rules:

                            (a)   limit the circumstances in which a distribution franked with those credits can give rise to benefits under the imputation system; and

                            (b)   quarantine those credits by moving them into a separate account, called the exempting account, when the entity ceases to be an exempting entity; and

                            (c)   deny a recipient of a distribution franked with a credit from that account any benefit under the imputation system as a result of that distribution, unless the recipient was a member of the entity immediately before it became a former exempting entity.

##### <a id="208-20"></a>208-20  Exempting entities

                         A * corporate tax entity is an **_exempting entity_** at a particular time if, at that time, the entity is effectively owned by prescribed persons.

Note:          Prescribed persons are identified in sections 208-40 and 208-45.

##### <a id="208-25"></a>208-25  Effective ownership of entity by prescribed persons

                 (1)   An entity is **_effectively owned by prescribed persons_** at a particular time if:

                            (a)   at that time:

                                        (i)   not less than 95% of the * accountable membership interests in the entity; or

                                       (ii)   not less than 95% of the * accountable partial interests in the entity;

                                     are held by, or held indirectly for the benefit of, prescribed persons; or

                            (b)   paragraph (a) does not apply but it would nevertheless be reasonable to conclude that, at that time, the risks involved in, and the opportunities resulting from, holding accountable membership interests, or accountable partial interests, in the entity that are not held by, or directly or indirectly for the benefit of, prescribed persons are substantially borne by, or substantially accrue to, prescribed persons.

                 (2)   In deciding whether it would be reasonable to conclude as mentioned in paragraph (1)(b):

                            (a)   have regard to any * arrangement in respect of * membership interests (including unissued membership interests), or in respect of * partial interests, in the entity (including any derivatives held or issued in connection with those membership interests or partial interests) of which the entity is aware; but

                            (b)   do not have regard to risks involved in the ownership of membership interests, or partial interests, in the entity that are substantially borne by any person in the person’s capacity as a secured creditor.

                 (3)   An entity has a **_partial interest_** in a * corporate tax entity if it has an interest in a * membership interest in the corporate tax entity.

##### <a id="208-30"></a>208-30  Accountable membership interests

                 (1)   The purpose of this section is to identify which * membership interests in an entity are relevant in determining whether the entity is effectively owned by prescribed persons.

                 (2)   A * membership interest in an entity is an **_accountable membership interest_** if it is not an excluded membership interest.

                 (3)   A * membership interest in an entity is an **_excluded membership interest_** if, having regard to:

                            (a)   the purposes for which the membership interest was issued; and

                            (b)   any special or limited rights connected with, arising from, or attached to:

                                        (i)   the membership interest; or

                                       (ii)   other membership interests in the entity held by the holder of the membership interest; or

                                      (iii)   membership interests in the entity held by persons other than the holder of the membership interest; or

                                     (iv)   interests in any of the above;

                                     including rights that are conferred or exercisable only if the holder of the membership interest or interests concerned is, or is not, a prescribed person; and

                            (c)   the extent to which any such special or limited rights are similar to or differ from the rights that are normally attached to the ownership of * ordinary membership interests in * corporate tax entities; and

                            (d)   the relationship between the value of the membership interest and the value of the entity; and

                            (e)   any relationship or connection (whether of a personal or business nature) between holders of membership interests in the entity of which the entity is aware; and

                             (f)   any * arrangement in respect of membership interests (including unissued membership interests) in the entity, or interests in membership interests in the entity, of which the entity is aware;

it would be reasonable to conclude that the membership interest is not relevant in determining whether the entity is effectively owned by prescribed persons because holding the membership interest does not involve the holder bearing the risks, or result in the accrual to the holder of the opportunities, of ownership of the entity that ordinarily arise from, or are ordinarily attached to, the holding of ordinary membership interests in an entity.

                 (4)   In applying subsection (3), the fact that a person is a trustee is to be disregarded.

                 (5)   Without limiting subsection (3), a * membership interest in an entity held by a person who is not a prescribed person is an **_excluded membership interest_** if:

                            (a)   it is a finance membership interest; or

                            (b)   it is a distribution access membership interest; or

                            (c)   it does not carry the right to receive distributions; or

                            (d)   it was issued, transferred or acquired for a purpose (other than an incidental purpose) of ensuring that the entity is not effectively owned by prescribed persons.

                 (6)   A * membership interest is a **_finance membership interest_** if:

                            (a)   the membership interest is a * non-equity share in the entity; or

                            (b)   having regard to the rights attached to the membership interest and to any * arrangement with respect to the membership interest of which the entity is aware, the membership interest is equivalent to a debt owed by the entity to the holder of the membership interest.

                 (7)   A * membership interest to which subsection (6) does not apply is a **_finance membership interest_** if:

                            (a)   the manner in which the * distributions payable in respect of the membership interest are calculated, and the conditions applying to the payment of such distributions, indicate that the distributions paid are equivalent to the receipt by the person to whom they are paid of interest or an amount in the nature of or similar to interest; or

                            (b)   the capital invested by the holder of the membership interest will be redeemed or, because of an * arrangement between the holder and the entity or an * associate of the entity, it is reasonable for the holder to expect that the capital will be redeemed, for an amount that is not less than, or for property (including other membership interests in the entity) the value of which is not less than, the amount paid for the membership interest; or

                            (c)   the membership interest is redeemable by the entity by payment of a lump sum or by the transfer of property, or the membership interest has a preferred right to a repayment of capital on a winding up, where the amount of the lump sum or the value of the property, or the amount of the capital to be repaid, as the case may be, is to be calculated by reference to an implicit interest rate.

                 (8)   A * membership interest in an entity is a **_distribution access membership interest_** if, having regard to:

                            (a)   the terms of the issue of the membership interest, including any guarantee of payment of distributions; and

                            (b)   the amounts of the * distributions paid on the membership interest relative to the issue price of the membership interest; and

                            (c)   whether there is any guaranteed rate at which * franked distributions are to be paid on the membership interest; and

                            (d)   the duration of the period within which the membership interest was issued; and

                            (e)   the rights attached to other membership interests in the entity; and

                             (f)   any other relevant matters;

it could be concluded that the membership interest was issued only for the purpose of paying distributions to the holder of the membership interest.

##### <a id="208-35"></a>208-35  Accountable partial interests

                 (1)   The purpose of this section is to identify which * partial interests in an entity are relevant in determining whether the entity is effectively owned by prescribed persons.

                 (2)   A * partial interest in an entity is an **_accountable partial interest_** if it is not an excluded partial interest.

                 (3)   A * partial interest in an entity is an **_excluded partial interest_** if, having regard to:

                            (a)   the purposes for which the interest was granted; and

                            (b)   the nature of the interest; and

                            (c)   any special or limited rights connected with or arising from:

                                        (i)   the interest; or

                                       (ii)   other * membership interests, or partial interests, in the entity held by the holder of the interest; or

                                      (iii)   membership interests, or partial interests, in the entity held by persons other than the holder of the interest;

                                     including rights that are conferred or exercisable only if the holder of the membership interests or partial interests concerned is, or is not, a prescribed person; and

                            (d)   the extent to which the interest is similar to or differs from beneficial ownership; and

                            (e)   the relationship between the value of the interest and the value of the entity; and

                             (f)   any relationship or connection (whether of a personal or business nature) between holders of partial interests in the entity, and the holders of membership interests in the entity, of which the entity is aware; and

                            (g)   any * arrangement in respect of membership interests (including unissued membership interests) in the entity, or partial interests in the entity, of which the entity is aware;

it would be reasonable to conclude that the partial interest is not relevant in determining whether the entity is effectively owned by prescribed persons because holding the membership interest to which the partial interest relates does not involve the holder bearing the risks, or result in the accrual to the holder of the opportunities, of ownership of the entity that ordinarily arise from, or are ordinarily attached to, the holding of * ordinary membership interests in an entity.

                 (4)   In applying subsection (3), the fact that a person is a trustee is to be disregarded.

                 (5)   Without limiting subsection (3), a * partial interest in an entity is also an **_excluded partial interest_** if it was granted or otherwise created, or was transferred or acquired, for a purpose (other than an incidental purpose) of ensuring that the entity is not effectively owned by prescribed persons.

##### <a id="208-40"></a>208-40  Prescribed persons

                 (1)   A company is a **_prescribed person_** in relation to another * corporate tax entity if:

                            (a)   the company is not an * Australian resident; or

                            (b)   were the company to receive a * distribution made by the other corporate tax entity, the distribution would be * exempt income of the company.

                 (2)   A trustee is a **_prescribed person_** in relation to a * corporate tax entity if:

                            (a)   all the beneficiaries in the trust are prescribed persons under other provisions of this section; or

                            (b)   were the trustee to receive a * distribution made by the corporate tax entity, the distribution would be * exempt income of the trust estate.

                 (3)   A * partnership is a **_prescribed person_** in relation to a * corporate tax entity if:

                            (a)   all the partners are prescribed persons under other provisions of this section; or

                            (b)   were the partnership to receive a * distribution made by the corporate tax entity, the distribution would be * exempt income of the partnership.

                 (4)   An individual (other than a trustee) is a prescribed person in relation to a * corporate tax entity if:

                            (a)   he or she is not an * Australian resident; or

                            (b)   were he or she to receive a * distribution made by the corporate tax entity, the distribution would be * exempt income of the individual.

                 (5)   The Commonwealth, each of the States, the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and Norfolk Island are prescribed persons in relation to any * corporate tax entity.

##### <a id="208-45"></a>208-45  Persons who are taken to be prescribed persons

                 (1)   This section applies to a person that:

                            (a)   is a * company, a trustee, or a * partnership, that holds * membership interests (whether * accountable membership interests or excluded membership interests), or * partial interests (whether * accountable partial interests or excluded partial interests), in a * corporate tax entity (the **_relevant entity_**); and

                            (b)   is not a prescribed person under section 208-40.

                 (2)   A * company that holds * membership interests, or * partial interests, in the relevant entity is taken to be a **_prescribed person_** in relation to the relevant entity if the risks involved in, and the opportunities resulting from, holding the membership interests or partial interests are substantially borne by, or substantially accrue to, as the case may be, one or more prescribed persons.

                 (3)   A trustee of a trust who holds * membership interests, or * partial interests, in the relevant entity is taken to be a **_prescribed person_** in relation to the relevant entity if the risks involved in, and the opportunities resulting from, holding the membership interests or partial interests are substantially borne by, or substantially accrue to, as the case may be, one or more prescribed persons.

                 (4)   A trustee of a trust who holds * membership interests, or * partial interests, in the relevant entity is taken to be a **_prescribed person_** in relation to the relevant entity if:

                            (a)   unless subsection (7) applies, the trust is controlled by one or more persons who are prescribed persons; or

                            (b)   all the beneficiaries who are presently entitled to, or during the relevant year of income become presently entitled to, income from the trust are prescribed persons.

                 (5)   In determining whether subsection (3) or (4) applies in respect of a trust that is controlled by a person, have regard to the way in which the person, or any * associate of the person, exercises powers in relation to the trust.

                 (6)   A person **_controls a trust_** if:

                            (a)   the person has the power, either directly, or indirectly through one or more interposed entities, to control the application of the income, or the distribution of the property, of the trust; or

                            (b)   the person has the power, either directly, or indirectly through one or more entities, to appoint or remove the trustee of the trust; or

                            (c)   the person has the power, either directly, or indirectly through one or more entities, to appoint or remove beneficiaries of the trust; or

                            (d)   the trustee of the trust is accustomed or under an obligation, whether formal or informal, to act according to the directions, instructions or wishes of the person or of an * associate of the person.

                 (7)   Paragraph (4)(a) does not apply in relation to a trust if some of the beneficiaries receiving income from the trust are not prescribed persons and the Commissioner considers that it is reasonable to conclude that the risks involved in, and the opportunities resulting from, holding the * membership interests or * partial interests in the relevant entity are substantially borne by, or substantially accrue to, as the case may be, one or more persons who are not prescribed persons.

                 (8)   A * partnership that holds * membership interests, or * partial interests, in the relevant entity is taken to be a **_prescribed person_** in relation to the relevant entity if the risks involved in, and the opportunities resulting from, holding the membership interests or partial interests are substantially borne by, or substantially accrue to, as the case may be, one or more prescribed persons.

                 (9)   If any of the prescribed persons referred to in subsection (2), (3), (4) or (8) is a * corporate tax entity, that subsection applies even if the risks involved in, and the opportunities resulting from, holding any of the * membership interests, or * partial interests, in that entity are substantially borne by, or substantially accrue to, as the case may be, one or more persons who are not prescribed persons.

##### <a id="208-50"></a>208-50  Former exempting companies

                 (1)   Subject to subsection (2), a * corporate tax entity is a **_former exempting entity_** if it has, at any time, ceased to be an * exempting entity and is not again an exempting entity.

##### <a id="208-135"></a>208-135  Relationships that will give rise to a franking credit under item 5 of the table in section 208-130

                 (1)   A relationship between an entity making a * franked distribution and the recipient of the distribution is of a type that gives rise to a * franking credit under item 5 or 6 of the table in section 208-130 if either:

                            (a)   both entities are members of the same effectively wholly-owned group; or

                            (b)   the recipient holds more than 5% of the * membership interests in the entity making the distribution (other than finance membership interests or distribution access membership interests within the meaning of section 208-30 or membership interests that do not carry the right to receive distributions) and it would be reasonable to conclude that the risks involved in, and the opportunities resulting from, holding those membership interests are substantially borne by, or substantially accrue to, the recipient.

                 (2)   In deciding whether it would be reasonable to make the conclusion mentioned in paragraph (1)(b):

                            (a)   have regard to any * arrangement in respect of the * membership interests (including unissued membership interests) in the entity making the distribution (including derivatives held or issued in connection with those membership interests); and

                            (b)   do not have regard to risks involved in the ownership of membership interests in the entity making the distribution that are substantially borne by any person in the person’s capacity as a secured creditor.

##### <a id="208-140"></a>208-140  Membership of the same effectively wholly-owned group

                 (1)   Two * corporate tax entities are members of the **_same effectively wholly-owned group of entities_** on a particular day if:

                            (a)   throughout that day, not less than 95% of the * accountable membership interests in each of the entities, and not less than 95% of the * accountable partial interests in each of the entities, are held by, or are held indirectly for the benefit of, the same persons; or

                            (b)   paragraph (a) does not apply but it would nevertheless be reasonable to conclude, having regard to the matters mentioned in subsection (2), that, throughout that day, the risks involved in, and the opportunities resulting from, holding accountable membership interests, or accountable partial interests, in each of the entities are substantially borne by, or substantially accrue to, the same persons.

                 (2)   The matters to which regard is to be had as mentioned in paragraph (1)(b) are:

                            (a)   any special or limited rights attaching to * accountable membership interests, or * accountable partial interests, in each of the entities held by persons other than the persons mentioned in paragraph (1)(b) or their * associates; and

                            (b)   any special rights attaching only to accountable membership interests, or accountable partial interests, in each of the entities held by the persons mentioned in paragraph (1)(b) or their associates; and

                            (c)   the respective proportions:

                                        (i)   that accountable membership interests in each of the entities held by the persons mentioned in paragraph (1)(b) or their associates, and other accountable membership interests in the entity concerned, bear to all the accountable membership interests in that entity; and

                                       (ii)   that accountable partial interests in each of the entities held by the persons mentioned in paragraph (1)(b) or their associates, and other accountable partial interests in the entity concerned, bear to all the accountable partial interests in that entity; and

                            (d)   the respective proportions that:

                                        (i)   the total value of accountable membership interests in each of the entities held by the persons mentioned in paragraph (1)(b) or their associates, and the total value of other accountable membership interests in the entity concerned, bear to the total value of all the accountable membership interests in that entity; and

##### <a id="208-160"></a>208-160  Distributions that are affected by a manipulation of the imputation system

                         For the purposes of item 2 of the table in section 208-115 and items 2 and 5 of the table in section 208-130, a * distribution to an entity is affected by a manipulation of the imputation system if:

                            (a)   the Commissioner has made a determination under paragraph 204-30(3)(c) that no * imputation benefit is to arise for the entity in respect of the distribution; or

                            (b)   the Commissioner has made a determination under paragraph 177EA(5)(b) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ that no franking credit benefit (within the meaning of that section) is to arise in respect of the distribution to the entity; or

                         A * distribution * franked with an exempting credit is taken to **_flow indirectly_** to an entity if, had it been a * franked distribution, it would have been taken to have flowed indirectly to the entity under section 207-35.

##### <a id="208-180"></a>208-180  What is an entity’s share of the exempting credit on a distribution?

                         To work out an entity’s **_share_** of the * exempting credit on a * distribution * franked with that credit, use section 207-55 to work out what the entity’s share of the credit would be it if were a * franking credit on a * franked distribution. The entity’s share of the exempting credit is equal to that amount.

##### <a id="208-185"></a>208-185  Minister may convert exempting surplus to franking credit of former exempting entity previously owned by the Commonwealth

                            (a)   whether the making of the determination or determinations is necessary to enable the entity to make * distributions * franked at a * franking percentage of 100% after the sale; and

                            (b)   the extent to which the success of the sale or proposed sale depended or will depend upon the ability of the entity to make * franked distributions; and

                            (c)   the extent to which the reduction in receipts of income tax resulting from the making of the determination or determinations would be offset by the receipt of increased proceeds from the sale; and

                            (d)   any other matters that the Minister thinks relevant.

                 (3)   The following provisions of this section apply after the * exempting entity becomes a * former exempting entity.

                 (4)   If the * former exempting entity would, apart from this section, have an * exempting surplus at the end of an income year, the Minister may, in writing, determine that:

                            (a)   an * exempting debit of the entity (not exceeding the exempting surplus) specified in the determination is taken to have arisen immediately before the end of that income year; and

###### Schedule 14—Loss integrity rules: global method of valuing assets

<h7 class="ActHead7">Part 1—Income Tax Assessment Act 1997</h7>

## 1  Section 165-115

Repeal the section, substitute:

##### <a id="165-115"></a>165-115  What this Subdivision is about

* * *

If a change occurs in the ownership or control of a company that has an unrealised net loss, the company cannot, to the extent of the unrealised net loss, have capital losses taken into account, or deduct revenue losses, in respect of CGT events that happen to CGT assets that it owned at the time of the change, unless it satisfies the same business test.

* * *

##### <a id="165-115AA"></a>165-115AA  Special rules to save compliance costs

             (1)  A company is exempt from these rules if, at the time of the change in ownership or control, it (together with certain related entities) has a net asset value of not more than $5,000,000 under the test in section 152-15 (for small business CGT relief).

             (2)  In working out whether it has an unrealised net loss, a company can choose to work out the market value of each of its assets individually, or of all of its assets together.

             (3)  If a company works out the market value of each of its assets individually, it may choose to exclude every asset that it acquired for less than $10,000, in which case:

                     (a)  unrealised losses and gains on the excluded assets will not be taken into account in calculating the company’s unrealised net loss; and

                     (b)  losses on the excluded assets will be allowed without the company being subject to the same business test.

## 2  At the end of subsection 165-115A(1B)

Add:

                   However, the choice does not affect the application of the * global method of working out whether the company has an unrealised net loss (see subsection 165-115E(2)).

## 3  Section 165-115E

After “this way”, insert “(the **_individual asset method_**), unless the company chooses to work it out using the * global method (set out in subsection (2))”.

## 4  At the end of section 165-115E

Add:

             (2)  The **_global method_** of working out whether the company has an **_unrealised net loss_** at the relevant time is as follows:

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.    Work out the total market value of all * CGT assets that the company owned at the relevant time (including those it * acquired for less than $10,000), using a valuation method that would generally be regarded as appropriate in the circumstances.

Step 2.    Work out the total of the * cost bases of those * CGT assets at the relevant time.

                   Note:             If a CGT asset that the company owned at the relevant time was also trading stock or a revenue asset at that time, see subsection (3) of this section.

Step 3.    If the step 2 amount exceeds the step 1 amount, the excess is the company’s **_preliminary unrealised net loss_** at the relevant time.

Step 4.    Add up the company’s preliminary unrealised net loss and any * capital loss, deduction or share of a deduction disregarded under section 170-270 in relation to an asset referred to in paragraph 165-115A(1A)(b). The total is the company’s **_unrealised net loss_** at the relevant time.

* * *

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  a * CGT asset that the company owned at the relevant time was also * trading stock or a * revenue asset at that time; and

                     (b)  the asset’s * cost base at the relevant time is _less than_ the amount that would be compared under section 165-115F with the asset’s market value in working out a notional revenue gain or notional revenue loss that the company has at the relevant time in respect of the asset;

then, for the purposes of step 2 of the method statement in subsection (2) of this section, the amount that would be so compared is to be taken into account _instead of_ that cost base.

             (4)  A choice to use the * global method must be made on or before:

                     (a)  the day on which the company lodges its income tax return for the income year in which the relevant time occurred; or

                     (b)  such later day as the Commissioner allows.

## 5  Subsection 165-115F(7)

Repeal the subsection.

## 6  Section 165-115G

Repeal the section, substitute:

##### <a id="165-115GA"></a>165-115GA  What this Subdivision is about

* * *

This Subdivision prevents multiple recognition of a company’s losses when significant equity and debt interests that entities (not individuals) have in the company are realised.

* * *

##### <a id="165-115GB"></a>165-115GB  When adjustments must be made

             (1)  The operation of this Subdivision is triggered at an alteration time, which is when:

                     (a)  an alteration takes place in the ownership or control of the company; or

                     (b)  the liquidator of the company declares that shares in the company are worthless (CGT event G3).

             (2)  An alteration time is the trigger for making reductions and other adjustments to the reduced cost base of significant equity and debt interests in the company that are owned by an entity (not an individual) that, alone or with its associates, has a controlling stake in the company and either:

                     (a)  has a direct or indirect equity interest of at least 10% in the company; or

                     (b)  is owed a debt of at least $10,000 by the company or by another entity that has a significant equity or debt interest in the company.

Deductions that relate to such interests held as trading stock or otherwise on revenue account are also reduced.

             (3)  Adjustments may also be made when such an entity’s interests in the company are partly realised within 12 months before an alteration time or if, under an arrangement, such interests are realised partly within that period or at the alteration time and partly at an earlier time.

             (4)  However, entities in which there are no interests in respect of which the company’s losses have been, or can be, duplicated are not affected by this Subdivision.

##### <a id="165-115GC"></a>165-115GC  How adjustments are calculated

             (1)  Adjustments are based on the overall loss of the company. This comprises its realised losses and unrealised losses on CGT assets.

             (2)  Special rules, directed at saving compliance costs, apply to determine whether unrealised losses have to be counted at an alteration time and, if so, how to work them out.

             (3)  The company may not have to calculate its unrealised losses if the alteration time is not also a changeover time for the purposes of Subdivision 165-CC (about change of ownership or control of a company that has an unrealised net loss), and the company has no realised losses.

             (4)  The company does not have to count unrealised losses at an alteration time if (together with certain related entities) it has a net asset value of not more than $5,000,000 under the test in section 152-15 (for small business CGT relief).

             (5)  In working out its unrealised losses on CGT assets, the company can choose to work out the market value of each of its assets individually, or of all of its assets together.

             (6)  If the company works out the market value of each of its assets individually, unrealised losses on assets acquired for less than $10,000 do not have to be calculated at any time.

             (7)  Amounts (whether realised or unrealised) counted at a previous alteration time are not counted again at a later alteration time. (This does not apply to unrealised losses worked out by reference to the market value of all the company’s assets together.)

             (8)  However, if unrealised amounts are _not_ counted at a previous alteration time (for example, because of the $10,000 or small business entity exclusions) and are not required to be taken into account in adjustments made at that time, they may be counted at a later time as part of a realised loss.

             (9)  A formula is provided for making adjustments in straightforward cases if applying the formula gives a reasonable result having regard to the object of the Subdivision. Otherwise, reasonable adjustments must be made having regard to a number of stated factors.

           (10)  To help entities to make the adjustments, any entity that, in its own right, has a controlling stake in the company is required to provide a written notice to its associates setting out relevant information. In limited circumstances, the company itself may have to provide a written notice to entities that, to its knowledge, have a significant equity or debt interest in it.

## 7  After subsection 165-115R(6)

Insert:

          (6A)  Subsection (6) does not apply to paragraphs (3)(e) and (5)(e) if the company has chosen to use the * global method of working out whether it has an adjusted unrealised loss at the alteration time.

## 8  After subsection 165-115S(6)

Insert:

          (6A)  Subsection (6) does not apply to paragraphs (3)(c) and (5)(c) if the company has chosen to use the * global method of working out whether it has an adjusted unrealised loss at the current alteration time.

## 9  At the end of section 165-115T

Add:

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply to an adjusted unrealised loss that the company had at a previous alteration time if the company has chosen to use the * global method of working out whether it has an adjusted unrealised loss at that previous time.

## 10  Subsection 165-115U(1)

After “this way”, insert “(the **_individual asset method_**), unless the company chooses to work it out using the * global method (set out in subsection (1B))”.

## 11  After subsection 165-115U(1)

Insert:

          (1A)  Step 1 in the method statement in subsection (1) does not apply to an amount that was counted at an earlier alteration time if the company has chosen to use the * global method of working out whether it has an adjusted unrealised loss at that earlier time.

          (1B)  The **_global method_** of working out whether the company has an **_adjusted unrealised loss_** at the relevant alteration time is as follows:

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.    Work out the total market value of all * CGT assets that the company owned at the relevant alteration time (including those it * acquired for less than $10,000), using a valuation method that would generally be regarded as appropriate in the circumstances.

Step 2.    Work out the total of the * cost bases of those * CGT assets at the relevant time.

                   Note:             If a CGT asset that the company owned at the relevant time was also trading stock or a revenue asset at that time, see subsection (1C) of this section.

Step 3.    If the step 2 amount exceeds the step 1 amount, the excess is the company’s **_adjusted unrealised loss_** at the relevant time.

* * *

          (1C)  If:

                     (a)  a * CGT asset that the company owned at the relevant alteration time was also * trading stock or a * revenue asset at that time; and

                     (b)  the asset’s * cost base at the relevant alteration time is _less than_ the amount that, if the relevant alteration time were a changeover time, would be compared under section 165-115F with the asset’s market value in working out a notional revenue gain or notional revenue loss that the company would have at the changeover time in respect of the asset;

then, for the purposes of step 2 of the method statement in subsection (1B) of this section, the amount that would be so compared is to be taken into account _instead of_ that cost base.

          (1D)  A choice to use the * global method must be made on or before:

                     (a)  the day on which the company lodges its income tax return for the income year in which the relevant alteration time occurred; or

                     (b)  such later day as the Commissioner allows.

## 12  Subsection 165-115V(8)

Repeal the subsection.

## 13  After subsection 165-115W(1)

Insert:

          (1A)  Step 2 in the method statement in subsection (1) does not apply to an amount counted at an earlier alteration time if the company has chosen to use the * global method of working out whether it has an adjusted unrealised loss at that earlier time.

## 14  At the end of subsection 165-115ZA(1)

Add:

Note:          This section and section 165-115ZB can apply differently for a company that has used the global method of working out whether it has an adjusted unrealised loss at an alteration time. See section 165-115ZD.

## 15  At the end of Subdivision 165-CD

Add:

##### <a id="165-115ZD"></a>165-115ZD  Adjustment (or further adjustment) for interest realised at a loss after global method has been used

             (1)  This section affects how sections 165-115ZA and 165-115ZB apply to an interest (the **_equity_**) in, or a debt owed by, a company if, apart from this section, a loss:

                     (a)  would be * realised for income tax purposes by a * realisation event that happens to the equity or debt; or

                     (b)  would be so realised but for Subdivision 170-D (which defers realisation of capital losses and deductions);

and the company chose to use the * global method of working out whether it had an adjusted unrealised loss at the last alteration time:

                     (c)  that happened for the company before the realisation event; and

                     (d)  immediately before which the equity or debt was, or was part of:

                              (i)  if the company was a * loss company at that alteration time—a relevant equity interest, or a relevant debt interest, that an entity had in the company; or

                             (ii)  otherwise—what would have been such an interest if the company had been a loss company at that alteration time.

Note:          If that last alteration time is before the day on which the _New Business Tax System (Consolidation, Value Shifting, Demergers and Other Measures) Act 2002_ received the Royal Assent, the owner of the equity or debt may choose to apply section 165-115ZD of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_ instead of this section.

             (2)  In addition to any application to the equity or debt, in relation to that last alteration time, that sections 165-115ZA and 165-115ZB have apart from this section, those sections apply (and are taken always to have applied) to the equity or debt, in relation to that last alteration time, as if:

                     (a)  the company had an adjusted unrealised loss at that time worked out under this section; and

                     (b)  the company were therefore a * loss company at that time; and

                     (c)  that adjusted unrealised loss were the company’s overall loss at that time.

             (3)  For the purposes of how sections 165-115ZA and 165-115ZB apply because of this section, the adjustment amount under section 165-115ZB is to be worked out and applied in accordance with subsection 165-115ZB(6) (the non-formula method).

Adjusted unrealised loss worked out under this section

             (4)  The adjusted unrealised loss referred to in paragraph (2)(a) is worked out using this method statement:

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.    Add up the amount or value of each thing covered by subsection (5).

Step 2.    If the step 1 amount exceeds the loss referred to in paragraph (1)(a), reduce the step 1 amount by the excess.

Step 3.    Reduce the step 2 amount by so much of the loss referred to in paragraph (1)(a) as it is reasonable to conclude is attributable to _none_ of these:

               (a)     a notional capital loss, or a notional revenue loss, that the company has at that last alteration time in respect of a * CGT asset;

               (b)     a trading stock decrease in relation to that time for a CGT asset that was * trading stock of the company at that time.

* * *

             (5)  This subsection covers each thing covered by an item in the table, except to the extent that:

                     (a)  it is reasonable to conclude that the thing was _not_ attributable to value that is reflected in a notional capital gain or notional revenue gain that the company has at that last alteration time in respect of a * CGT asset; or

                     (b)  the thing has resulted in a reduction of the * reduced cost base of the equity or debt.

                   A choice under section 165-115U of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ to use the global method of working out whether a company has an adjusted unrealised loss at a particular time must be made within 6 months after the day on which the _New Business Tax System (Consolidation, Value Shifting, Demergers and Other Measures) Act 2002_ received the Royal Assent if:

                     (a)  that time is before that day; and

                     (b)  subsection 165-115U(1D) of that Act would otherwise require the choice to be made before the end of those 6 months.

##### <a id="165-115ZC"></a>165-115ZC  When certain notices to be given

             (1)  A notice under subsection 165-115ZC(4) or (5) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ must be given within 6 months after the day on which the _New Business Tax System (Consolidation, Value Shifting, Demergers and Other Measures) Act 2002_ received the Royal Assent if the alteration time is before that day.

             (2)  If, because of amendments made by Schedule 14 to the _New Business Tax System (Consolidation, Value Shifting, Demergers and Other Measures) Act 2002_, a notice already given under subsection 165-115ZC(4) or (5) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ before the day referred to in subsection (1) of this section no longer complies with section 165-115ZC of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, the entity required to give the notice may comply with that section 165-115ZC by giving a further notice.

             (3)  The further notice:

                     (a)  must vary the notice referred to in subsection (2) in such a way (which may include setting out additional information) that the notice as varied complies with section 165-115ZC of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ as affected by the amendments; and

                     (b)  must be given within the 6 months referred to in subsection (1) of this section, or within a further period allowed by the Commissioner; and

                     (c)  must otherwise be given in accordance with that section.

##### <a id="165-115ZD"></a>165-115ZD  Adjustment (or further adjustment) for interest realised at a loss after global method has been used

             (1)  This section affects how sections 165-115ZA and 165-115ZB of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ apply to an interest (the **_equity_**) in, or a debt owed by, a company if apart from this section, a loss:

                     (a)  would be realised for income tax purposes by a realisation event that happens to the equity or debt; or

                     (b)  would be so realised but for Subdivision 170-D of that Act (which defers realisation of capital losses and deductions);

and the company chose to use the global method of working out whether it had an adjusted unrealised loss at the last alteration time:

                     (c)  that happened for the company, before the realisation event; and

                     (d)  immediately before which the equity or debt was, or was part of:

                              (i)  if the company was a loss company at that alteration time—a relevant equity interest, or a relevant debt interest, that an entity had in the company; or

                             (ii)  otherwise—what would have been such an interest if the company had been a loss company at that alteration time;

and these conditions are satisfied:

                     (e)  that last alteration time is before the day on which the _New Business Tax System (Consolidation, Value Shifting, Demergers and Other Measures) Act 2002_ received the Royal Assent; and

                      (f)  the entity that owns the equity or debt immediately before the realisation event chooses to apply this section to the equity or debt, in relation to that last alteration time, instead of section 165-115ZD of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

                     (g)  the choice is made on or before the latest of these:

                              (i)  the last day of the period of 6 months after the day referred to in paragraph (c) of this subsection;

                             (ii)  the day on which the entity lodges its income tax return for the income year in which the realisation event occurred;

                            (iii)  such later day as the Commissioner allows.

If the entity makes that choice, this section applies accordingly instead of that section.

             (2)  In addition to any application to the equity or debt, in relation to that last alteration time, that sections 165-115ZA and 165-115ZB of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ have apart from this section, those sections apply (and are taken always to have applied) to the equity or debt, in relation to that last alteration time, as if:

                     (a)  the company had an adjusted unrealised loss at that time equal to the loss referred to in paragraph (1)(a) of this section, except so much of the loss as it is reasonable to conclude is attributable to _none_ of these:

                              (i)  a notional capital loss, or a notional revenue loss, that the company has at that last alteration time in respect of a CGT asset;

                             (ii)  a trading stock decrease in relation to that time for a CGT asset that was trading stock of the company at that time; and

                     (b)  the company were therefore a * loss company at that time; and

                     (c)  that adjusted unrealised loss were the company’s overall loss at that time.

             (3)  For the purposes of how sections 165-115ZA and 165-115ZB of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ apply because of this section, the adjustment amount under section 165-115ZB of that Act is to be worked out and applied in accordance with subsection 165-115ZB(6) (the non-formula method) of that Act.

             (4)  To avoid doubt:

                     (a)  a notice need not be given under section 165-115ZC of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ because of this section; and

                     (b)  this section does not affect the requirements that apply to a notice that otherwise must be given under that section.

723-1        Object

723-10      Reduction in loss from realising non-depreciating asset over which right has been created

723-15      Reduction in loss from realising non-depreciating asset at the same time as right is created over it

##### <a id="723-1"></a>723-1  Object

                   The purpose of this Division is to reduce a loss that would otherwise be * realised for income tax purposes by a * realisation event happening to an asset (except a * depreciating asset), to the extent that:

                     (a)  value has been shifted out of the asset by the owner creating in an associate a right over the asset; and

                     (b)  the value shifted was not brought to tax when the right was created and has not since been brought to tax on a realisation of the right.

##### <a id="723-10"></a>723-10  Reduction in loss from realising non-depreciating asset over which right has been created

             (1)  A loss that would, apart from this Division, be * realised for income tax purposes by a * realisation event is reduced by the amount worked out under subsections (3) and (4) if:

                     (a)  the event happens to a * CGT asset (the **_underlying asset_**) you own that, at the time of the event (the **_realisation time_**):

                              (i)  is _not_ a * depreciating asset; or

                             (ii)  is an item of your * trading stock; or

                            (iii)  is a * revenue asset of yours; and

                     (b)  before the realisation time:

                              (i)  you created in an * associate of yours; or

                             (ii)  an entity covered by subsection (2) (about previous owners of the underlying asset) created in an associate of the entity;

                            a right in respect of the underlying asset; and

                     (c)  immediately before the realisation time, the right is still in existence and is owned by an associate of yours; and

                     (d)  a decrease in the underlying asset’s market value is reasonably attributable to the creating of the right; and

                     (e)  creating the right involved a * CGT event:

                              (i)  whose * capital proceeds are _less_ than the market value of the right when created (the difference between those capital proceeds and that market value is called the **_shortfall on creating the right_**); and

                             (ii)  that is _not_ a CGT event that happens to some part of the underlying asset but not to the remainder of it; and

                      (f)  the shortfall on creating the right is more than $50,000; and

                     (g)  the market value of the underlying asset at the realisation time is less than it would have been if the right no longer existed at that time (the difference is called the **_deficit on realisation_**).

Note:          If subparagraph (1)(e)(ii) applies, the cost base and reduced cost base of the underlying asset is apportioned under section 112-30, so there is no need for this section to apply to the right.

             (2)  This subsection covers an entity if:

                     (a)  the entity * acquired the underlying asset before you did; and

                     (b)  there has been a roll-over for each * CGT event (if any) as a result of which an entity (including you) acquired the asset after the first entity acquired it, and before the realisation time; and

                     (c)  for each such CGT event (if any), the entity (including you) that acquired the underlying asset as a result of the event was, immediately after the event, an * associate of the entity that last acquired the asset before the event.

             (3)  The amount by which this section reduces the loss is the lesser of:

                     (a)  the shortfall on creating the right; and

                     (b)  the deficit on realisation.

However, that amount is reduced by each gain that:

                     (c)  is * realised for income tax purposes by a * realisation event that happens to the right:

                              (i)  before or at the realisation time for the underlying asset; and

                             (ii)  at a time when the right is owned by an entity that is your * associate immediately before the realisation time for the underlying asset; and

                     (d)  is not disregarded.

Note:          To work out a gain realised for income tax purposes by a realisation event that happens to the right, see sections 977-15, 977-35, 977-40 and 977-55\. If more than one of those sections applies to the right, see section 723-50.

             (4)  For each gain that:

                     (a)  is * realised for income tax purposes by a * realisation event that happens to the right:

                              (i)  within 4 years after the realisation time for the underlying asset; and

                             (ii)  at a time when the right is owned by an entity that is your * associate immediately before the realisation time for the underlying asset; and

                     (b)  is not disregarded;

the amount worked out under subsection (3) is taken to have been reduced by the amount of that gain.

Note:          This subsection may result in amendment of an assessment for the income year in which the realisation time happens.

##### <a id="723-15"></a>723-15  Reduction in loss from realising non-depreciating asset at the same time as right is created over it

             (1)  A loss that would, apart from this Division, be * realised for income tax purposes by a * realisation event is reduced by the amount worked out under subsections (2) and (3) if:

                     (a)  the event happens to a * CGT asset (the **_underlying asset_**) you own that, at the time of the event (the **_realisation time_**):

                              (i)  is _not_ a * depreciating asset; or

                             (ii)  is an item of your * trading stock;

                            (iii)  is a * revenue asset of yours; and

                     (b)  at the realisation time, you create in an * associate of yours a right in respect of the underlying asset; and

                     (c)  creating the right involves a * CGT event:

                              (i)  whose * capital proceeds are _less_ than the market value of the right when created (the difference between those capital proceeds and that market value is called the **_shortfall on creating the right_**); and

                             (ii)  that is _not_ a CGT event that happens to some part of the underlying asset but not to the remainder of it; and

                     (d)  the shortfall on creating the right is more than $50,000; and

                     (e)  the market value of the underlying asset at the realisation time is less than it would have been if the right had not been created (the difference is called the **_deficit on realisation_**).

Note:          If subparagraph (1)(c)(ii) applies, the cost base and reduced cost base of the underlying asset is apportioned under section 112-30, so there is no need for this section to apply to the right.

             (2)  The amount by which this section reduces the loss is the lesser of:

                     (a)  the shortfall on creating the right; and

                     (b)  the deficit on realisation.

             (3)  For each gain that:

                     (a)  is * realised for income tax purposes by a * realisation event that happens to the right:

                              (i)  within 4 years after the realisation time for the underlying asset; and

                             (ii)  at a time when the right is owned by an entity that is your * associate immediately before the realisation time for the underlying asset; and

                     (b)  is not disregarded;

the amount worked out under subsection (2) is taken to have been reduced by the amount of that gain.

Note 1:       To work out a gain realised for income tax purposes by a realisation event that happens to the right, see sections 977-15, 977-35, 977-40 and 977-55\. If more than one of those sections applies to the right, see section 723-50.

Note 2:       This subsection may require amendment of an assessment for the income year in which the realisation time happens.

##### <a id="723-20"></a>723-20  Exceptions

Conservation covenant over land

             (1)  Section 723-10 or 723-15 does not reduce a loss if:

                     (a)  the underlying asset is land; and

                     (b)  the right referred to in paragraph 723-10(1)(b) or 723-15(1)(b) is a * conservation covenant over the land.

Right created on death of owner

             (2)  Section 723-10 or 723-15 does not reduce a loss if the right referred to in paragraph 723-10(1)(b) or 723-15(1)(b) is created by:

                     (a)  a will or codicil; or

                     (b)  an order of a court varying or modifying a will or codicil; or

                     (c)  a total or partial intestacy; or

                     (d)  an order of a court varying or modifying the application of the law about distributing the estate of someone who dies intestate.

##### <a id="723-25"></a>723-25  Realisation event that is only a partial realisation

             (1)  Section 723-10 or 723-15 applies differently if:

                     (a)  a * realisation event happens to some part of a * CGT asset (the **_underlying asset_**) you own that, at the time of the event:

                              (i)  is _not_ a * depreciating asset; or

                             (ii)  is an item of your * trading stock; or

                            (iii)  is a * revenue asset of yours;

                            but not to the remainder of the underlying asset; or

                     (b)  a realisation event consists of creating an interest in a CGT asset (also the **_underlying asset_**) you own that, at the time of the event, is covered by subparagraph (a)(i), (ii) or (iii).

             (2)  The section applies on the basis that:

                     (a)  the * realisation event happens to the underlying asset; and

                     (b)  the shortfall on creating the right referred to in paragraph 723-10(1)(e) or 723-15(1)(c); and

                     (c)  the deficit on realisation referred to in paragraph 723-10(1)(g) or 723-15(1)(e);

are each reduced by multiplying its amount by this fraction:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00500/Html/NBTSConsolValueShiftDemergOtherMeasures2002_image011.gif)

             (3)  For the purposes of the formula in subsection (2):

                    <a name="market-valu-part"></a>**_market value of part_** means the market value, at the time of the * realisation event, of the part referred to in paragraph (1)(a) or the interest referred to in paragraph (1)(b), as appropriate.

                    <a name="market-valu-underlying-asset"></a>**_market value of underlying asset_** means the market value, immediately before the * realisation event, of the underlying asset.

\[The next section is section 723-35.]

##### <a id="723-35"></a>723-35  Multiple rights created to take advantage of the $50,000 threshold

             (1)  Sections 723-10 and 723-15 apply differently if, having regard to all relevant circumstances, it is reasonable to conclude that the sole or main reason why a right was created as a different right from one or more other rights created in respect of the same thing was so that paragraph 723-10(1)(f) or 723-15(1)(d) would not be satisfied for one or more of the rights mentioned in this subsection.

             (2)  Those sections:

                     (a)  apply to that thing, in relation to each of the rights mentioned in subsection (1) of this section, as if paragraphs 723-10(1)(f) and 723-15(1)(d) were omitted; and

                     (b)  are taken always to have so applied.

##### <a id="723-40"></a>723-40  Application to CGT asset that is also trading stock or revenue asset

                   If a * CGT asset you own is also an item of your * trading stock or a * revenue asset, this Division applies to the asset once in its character as a CGT asset and again in its character as trading stock or a revenue asset.

\[The next section is section 723-50.]

##### <a id="723-50"></a>723-50  Effects if right created over underlying asset is also trading stock or a revenue asset

             (1)  Subsection 723-10(3) or (4) or 723-15(3) applies differently if the right created in respect of the underlying asset is also * trading stock or a * revenue asset at the time of a * realisation event that happens to the right.

             (2)  The gain that is taken into account for the purposes of that subsection is:

                     (a)  if the right is also trading stock—worked out under section 977-35 or 977-40 (about realisation events for trading stock); or

                     (b)  if the right is also a revenue asset—the greater of:

                              (i)  the gain worked out under section 977-15 (about realisation events for CGT assets); and

                             (ii)  the gain worked out under section 977-55 (about realisation events for revenue assets).

#### Subdivision 723-B—Reducing reduced cost base of interests in entity that acquires non-depreciating asset under roll-over

**Table of sections**

723-105    Reduced cost base of interest reduced when interest realised at a loss

723-110    Direct and indirect roll-over replacement for underlying asset

##### <a id="723-105"></a>723-105  Reduced cost base of interest reduced when interest realised at a loss

             (1)  The * reduced cost base of a * primary equity interest, * secondary equity interest, or * indirect primary equity interest, in a company or trust is reduced just before a * realisation event that is a * CGT event happens to the interest if:

                     (a)  apart from this Division, a loss would be * realised for income tax purposes by the CGT event; and

                     (b)  apart from this Division, a loss would have been * realised for income tax purposes by a realisation event if the event had happened, just before the CGT event, to a * CGT asset (the **_underlying asset_**) that the company or trust then owned and that:

                              (i)  was _not_ then a * depreciating asset; or

                             (ii)  was then an item of * trading stock of the company or trust; or

                            (iii)  was then a * revenue asset of the company or trust; and

                     (c)  the loss referred to in paragraph (b) would have been reduced under Subdivision 723-A by an amount (the **_underlying asset loss reduction_**); and

                     (d)  for the entity (the **_transferor_**) that owned the interest just before the CGT event, the interest was a * direct roll-over replacement or * indirect roll-over replacement for the underlying asset.

             (2)  If the interest was a * direct roll-over replacement, its * reduced cost base is reduced by the amount worked out using this formula, unless that amount does not appropriately reflect the matters referred to in subsection (4):

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00500/Html/NBTSConsolValueShiftDemergOtherMeasures2002_image012.gif)

             (3)  For the purposes of the formula in subsection (2):

                    <a name="rcb-interest"></a>**_RCB of interest_** means the interest’s * reduced cost base when the transferor * acquired it.

                    <a name="total-rcb-direct-roll-replac"></a>**_total of RCBs of direct roll-over replacements_** means the total of the * reduced cost bases of all * direct roll-over replacements for the underlying asset when the transferor * acquired them.

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  the interest was an * indirect roll-over replacement; or

                     (b)  the amount worked out under subsection (2) does not appropriately reflect the matters referred to in this subsection;

the interest’s * reduced cost base is reduced by an amount that is appropriate having regard to these matters:

                     (c)  the underlying asset loss reduction; and

                     (d)  the quantum of the interest relative to all * direct roll-over replacements and indirect roll-over replacements that the transferor owns or has previously owned.

##### <a id="723-110"></a>723-110  Direct and indirect roll-over replacement for underlying asset

             (1)  For an entity (the **_transferor_**) that owns a * CGT asset, the CGT asset is a **_direct roll-over replacement_** for something (the **_underlying asset_**) that another entity owns if, and only if:

                     (a)  a * CGT event happened to the underlying asset while the transferor owned it; and

                     (b)  the other entity * acquired the underlying asset as a result of that CGT event; and

                     (c)  there was a * replacement-asset roll-over for the CGT event; and

                     (d)  the transferor received the CGT asset (or CGT assets including it) in respect of the CGT event as the replacement asset (or the replacement assets).

             (3)  For an entity (the **_transferor_**) that owns a * CGT asset, the CGT asset is an **_indirect roll-over replacement_** for something (the **_underlying asset_**) that another entity owns if, and only if:

                     (a)  a * CGT event happened to another CGT asset at a time when the transferor owned it and the other entity already owned the underlying asset; and

                     (b)  for the transferor, the other CGT asset was at that time:

                              (i)  a * direct roll-over replacement for the underlying asset; or

                             (ii)  an indirect roll-over replacement for the underlying asset because of any other application or applications of this subsection; and

                     (c)  there was a * replacement-asset roll-over for the CGT event; and

                     (d)  the transferor received the first CGT asset (or CGT assets including it) in respect of the CGT event as the replacement asset (or the replacement assets).

* * *

If, under a scheme, value is shifted from equity or loan interests in a company or trust to other equity or loan interests in the same company or trust (including interests issued at a discount), this Division:

               (a)     adjusts the value of those interests for income tax purposes to take account of material changes in market value that are attributable to the value shift; and

               (b)     treats the value shift as a partial realisation to the extent that value is shifted between interests held by different owners, and in some other cases.

However, it does so only for interests that are owned by entities involved in the value shift.

##### <a id="725-45"></a>725-45  Main object

             (1)  The main object of this Division is:

                     (a)  to prevent inappropriate losses from arising on the realisation of * equity or loan interests from which value has been shifted to other equity or loan interests in the same entity; and

                     (b)  to prevent inappropriate gains from arising on the realisation of equity or loan interests in the same entity to which the value has been shifted;

so far as those interests are owned by entities involved in the value shift.

             (2)  This is done by:

                     (a)  adjusting the value of those interests for income tax purposes to take account of changes in market value that are attributable to the value shift; and

                     (b)  treating the value shift as a partial realisation to the extent that value is shifted:

                              (i)  between interests held by different owners; or

                             (ii)  in the case of interests in their character as CGT assets—from post-CGT assets to pre-CGT assets; or

                            (iii)  between interests of different characters.

##### <a id="725-50"></a>725-50  When a direct value shift has consequences under this Division

                   A * direct value shift under a * scheme involving * equity or loan interests in an entity (the **_target entity_**) has consequences for you under this Division if, and only if:

                     (a)  the target entity is a company or trust at some time during the * scheme period; and

                     (b)  section 725-55 (Controlling entity test) is satisfied; and

                     (c)  section 725-65 (Cause of the value shift) is satisfied; and

                     (d)  you are an * affected owner of a * down interest, or an * affected owner of an * up interest, or both; and

                     (e)  neither of sections 725-90 and 725-95 (about direct value shifts that are reversed) applies.

Note:          For a down interest of which you are an affected owner, the direct value shift has consequences under this Division only if section 725-70 (about material decrease in market value) is satisfied.

##### <a id="725-55"></a>725-55  Controlling entity test

                   An entity (the **_controller_**) must * control (for value shifting purposes) the target entity at some time during the period starting when the * scheme is entered into and ending when it has been carried out. (That period is the **_scheme period_**.)

For the concept of **_control (for value shifting purposes)_**,
 see sections 727-355 to 727-375.

\[The next section is section 725-65.]

##### <a id="725-65"></a>725-65  Cause of the value shift

             (1)  It must be the case that one or more of the following:

                     (a)  the target entity;

                     (b)  the controller;

                     (c)  an entity that was an * associate of the controller at some time during or after the * scheme period;

                     (d)  an * active participant in the * scheme;

(either alone or together with one or more other entities) did under the scheme the one or more things:

                     (e)  to which the decrease in the market value of the * down interests is reasonably attributable; and

                      (f)  to which the increase in the market value of the * up interests, or the issue of up interests at a * discount, is reasonably attributable, or that is or include the issue of up interests at a * discount.

Active participants (if target entity is closely held)

             (2)  An entity (the **_first entity_**) is an **_active participant_** in the * scheme if, and only if:

                     (a)  at some time during the * scheme period, the target entity has fewer than 300 members (in the case of a company) or fewer than 300 beneficiaries (in the case of a trust); and

                     (b)  the first entity has actively participated in, or directly facilitated, the entering into or carrying out of the * scheme (whether or not it did so at the direction of some other entity); and

                     (c)  the first entity:

                              (i)  owns a * down interest at the * decrease time; or

                             (ii)  owns an * up interest at the * increase time or has an up interest issued to it at a * discount because of the * direct value shift.

When an entity has 300 or more members or beneficiaries

             (3)  Section 124-810 (under which certain companies and trusts are not regarded as having 300 or more members or beneficiaries) also applies for the purposes of this Division.

             (4)  In addition, this Division applies to a * non-fixed trust as if it did not have 300 or more beneficiaries.

##### <a id="725-70"></a>725-70  Consequences for down interest only if there is a material decrease in its market value

             (1)  For a * down interest of which you are an * affected owner, the * direct value shift has consequences under this Division only if the sum of the decreases in the market value of all down interests because of direct value shifts under the same * scheme as the direct value shift is at least $150,000.

Note:          In working out the sum of the decreases in market value of all down interests, it will be necessary to include decreases not only in your down interests, but also in those of other affected owners and of entities that are not affected owners.

             (2)  However, if, having regard to all relevant circumstances, it is reasonable to conclude that the sole or main reason why a * direct value shift happened under a different scheme from one or more other direct value shifts was so that subsection (1) would not be satisfied for one or more of the direct value shifts mentioned in this subsection, subsection (1) does not apply (and is taken never to have applied) to any of the direct value shifts.

\[The next section is section 725-80.]

##### <a id="725-80"></a>725-80  Who is an affected owner of a down interest?

                   An entity is an **_affected owner_** of a * down interest if, and only if, the entity owns the down interest at the * decrease time and at least one of these paragraphs is satisfied:

                     (a)  the entity is the controller;

                     (b)  the entity was an * associate of the controller at some time during or after the * scheme period;

                     (c)  the entity is an * active participant in the * scheme.

##### <a id="725-85"></a>725-85  Who is an affected owner of an up interest?

                   An entity is an **_affected owner_** of an * up interest if, and only if:

                     (a)  there is at least one * affected owner of * down interests; and

                     (b)  the entity owns the up interest at the * increase time, or the interest is an up interest because it was issued to the entity at a * discount;

and at least one of these paragraphs is satisfied:

                     (c)  the entity is the controller;

                     (d)  the entity was an * associate of the controller at some time during or after the * scheme period;

                     (e)  at some time during or after the scheme period, the entity was an associate of an entity that is an affected owner of down interests because it was an associate of the controller at some time during or after that period;

                      (f)  the entity is an * active participant in the * scheme.

##### <a id="725-90"></a>725-90  Direct value shift that will be reversed

             (1)  The * direct value shift does _not_ have consequences for you under this Division if:

                     (a)  the one or more things referred to in paragraph 725-145(1)(b) brought about a state of affairs, but for which the direct value shift would not have happened; and

                     (b)  as at the time referred to in that paragraph, it is more likely than not that, because of the * scheme, that state of affairs will cease to exist within 4 years after that time.

Example:    Under a scheme, the voting rights attached to a class of shares in a company are changed. As a result, the market value of shares in that class decreases, and the market value of other classes of shares in the company increases. The company’s constitution provides that the change is to last for only 3 years.

             (2)  However, this section stops applying if the state of affairs referred to in paragraph (1)(a) still exists:

                     (a)  at the end of those 4 years; or

                     (b)  when a * realisation event happens to * down interests or * up interests of which you are, or any other entity is, an * affected owner;

whichever happens sooner.

             (3)  If this section stops applying, it is taken _never_ to have applied to the * direct value shift.

Note:          This may result in an assessment for an earlier income year having to be amended to give effect to the consequences that the direct value shift would have had for you under this Division if this section hadn’t applied.

##### <a id="725-95"></a>725-95  Direct value shift resulting from reversal

             (1)  A * direct value shift does not have consequences for any entity under this Division if:

                     (a)  section 725-90 applies, and the state of affairs referred to in paragraph 725-90(1)(a) ceases to exist; and

                     (b)  the direct value shift would not have happened but for that state of affairs ceasing to exist.

             (2)  However, if section 725-90 stops applying, this section is taken _never_ to have applied to the later direct value shift.

#### Subdivision 725-B—What is a direct value shift

725-145    When there is a direct value shift

725-150    Issue of equity or loan interests at a discount

725-155    Meaning of down interests, decrease time, up interests and increase time

725-160    What is the nature of a direct value shift?

725-165    If market value decrease or increase is only partly attributable to the scheme

##### <a id="725-145"></a>725-145  When there is a _direct value shift_

             (1)  There is a **_direct value shift_** under a * scheme involving * equity or loan interests in an entity (the **_target entity_**) if:

                     (a)  there is a decrease in the market value of one or more equity or loan interests in the target entity; and

                     (b)  the decrease is reasonably attributable to one or more things done under the scheme, and occurs at or after the time when that thing, or the first of those things, is done; and

                     (c)  either or both of subsections (2) and (3) are satisfied.

Examples of something done under a scheme are issuing new shares at a * discount, buying back shares or changing the voting rights attached to shares.

             (2)  One or more * equity or loan interests in the target entity must be issued at a * discount. The issue must be, or must be reasonably attributable to, the thing, or one or more of the things, referred to in paragraph (1)(b). It must also occur at or after the time referred to in that paragraph.

Example:    A company runs a family business. There are 2 shares originally issued for $2 each. They are owned by husband and wife. The market value of the shares is much greater (represented by the value of the assets of the company less its liabilities). The company issues one more share for $2 to their son.

                   Caution is needed in such a situation. The example would result in a large CGT liability for the husband and wife under this Division, because they have shifted 1/3 of the value of their own shares to their son. No such liability would arise if the share had been issued for its market value.

             (3)  Or, there must be an increase in the market value of one or more * equity or loan interests in the target entity. The increase must be reasonably attributable to the thing, or to one or more of the things, referred to in paragraph (1)(b). It must also occur at or after the time referred to in that paragraph.

##### <a id="725-150"></a>725-150  Issue of equity or loan interests at a _discount_

             (1)  An * equity or loan interest is issued at a **_discount_** if, and only if, the market value of the interest when issued exceeds the amount of the payment that the issuing entity receives. The excess is the amount of the **_discount_**.

             (2)  The payment that the issuing entity receives can include property. If it does, use the market value of the property in working out the amount of the payment.

Amounts for which bonus equities are treated as being issued

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  a * primary equity interest is issued as mentioned in subsection 130-20(1) (about bonus equities issued in relation to original equities); and

                     (b)  subsection 130-20(3) does _not_ apply (about bonus equities that are a dividend or otherwise assessable income);

subsection (1) of this section applies to the interest as if the amount of the payment that the issuing entity receives were equal to the * cost base of the interest when issued (as worked out under section 130-20).

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  a * primary equity interest is issued as mentioned in subsection 6BA(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (about bonus shares issued in relation to original shares); and

                     (b)  subsection 6BA(2) of that Act applies (about bonus shares that are a dividend);

subsection (1) of this section applies to the interest as if the amount of the payment that the issuing entity receives were equal to the consideration worked out under subsection 6BA(2) of that Act.

             (5)  If both of subsections (3) and (4) apply to the issue of the same * primary equity interest, subsection (1) of this section applies to the interest as if the amount of the payment that the issuing entity receives were equal to the greater of the amounts worked out under subsections (3) and (4).

Application of subsections (3), (4) and (5)

             (6)  Subsection (3) does not apply if, for the income year in which the interest is issued, the issuing entity is:

                     (a)  a corporate unit trust within the meaning of section 102J of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; or

                     (b)  a public trading trust within the meaning of section 102R of that Act.

             (7)  Subsections (3), (4) and (5) have effect only for the purposes of working out whether a * direct value shift has happened and, if so, its consequences (if any) under this Division.

##### <a id="725-155"></a>725-155  Meaning of _down interests_, _decrease time_, _up interests_ and _increase time_

             (1)  An * equity or loan interest in the target entity is a **_down interest_** if a decrease in its market value is reasonably attributable to the one or more things referred to in paragraph 725-145(1)(b), and occurs at or after the time referred to in that paragraph. The time when the decrease happens is called the **_decrease time_** for that interest.

             (2)  An * equity or loan interest in the target entity is an **_up interest_** if subsection 725-145(2) or (3) is satisfied for the interest. The time when the interest is issued at a * discount, or the increase in market value happens, is called the **_increase time_** for that interest.

##### <a id="725-160"></a>725-160  What is the nature of a direct value shift?

             (1)  The * direct value shift has 2 aspects.

             (2)  Overall, it consists of:

                     (a)  the decreases in market value of the down interests; and

                     (b)  the issue at a * discount of the up interests covered by subsection 725-145(2); and

                     (c)  the increases in market value of the up interests covered by subsection 725-145(3).

             (3)  This Division also proceeds on the basis that the * direct value shift is from _each_ of the * down interests to _each_ of the * up interests.

##### <a id="725-165"></a>725-165  If market value decrease or increase is only partly attributable to the scheme

                   If it is reasonable to conclude that an increase or decrease in market value, or the issuing of an * equity or loan interest at a * discount, is only partly caused by the doing of the one or more things under the * scheme, this Division applies to the increase, decrease, or issue at a discount, to that extent only.

#### Subdivision 725-C—Consequences of a direct value shift

**Table of sections**

General

725-205    Consequences depend on character of down interests and up interests

725-210    Consequences for down interests depend on pre-shift gains and losses

Special cases

725-220    Neutral direct value shifts

725-225    Issue of bonus shares or units

725-230    Off-market buy-backs

#### General

##### <a id="725-205"></a>725-205  Consequences depend on character of down interests and up interests

             (1)  The consequences for you of the * direct value shift depend on the character of the * down interests and * up interests of which you are an * affected owner.

             (2)  There are consequences for all your * down interests and * up interests in their character as * CGT assets. However, some of them may also be * trading stock or * revenue assets. There are additional consequences for those interests in their character as trading stock or revenue assets.

Note:          For example, you may own a down interest that is a CGT asset and a revenue asset.

                   Sections 725-240 to 725-255 set out the consequences for you of a shift in value from that interest in its character as a CGT asset. The cost base of the asset will be decreased, which will affect the calculation of a capital gain when a CGT event happens to the interest.

                   Section 725-320 sets out the consequences for you of a shift in value from that interest in its character as a revenue asset. The adjustment made under that section will affect the calculation of any profit on the sale of the interest.

                   Any overlap between the capital gain and the profit realised on the sale of the interest is then dealt with under section 118-20.

                   In some instances, the direct value shift may result in a taxing event generating a gain for you in the income year in which the shift happens. That gain will be both a capital gain (because the down interest can be characterised as a CGT asset) and an increase in your assessable income (because the down interest can be characterised as a revenue asset). Again, any overlap is dealt with under section 118-20.

##### <a id="725-210"></a>725-210  Consequences for down interests depend on pre-shift gains and losses

             (1)  The consequences for a * down interest also depend on whether it has a * pre-shift gain or a * pre-shift loss.

             (2)  It has a **_pre-shift_** **_gain_** if, immediately before the * decrease time, its market value was _greater than_ its * adjustable value.

             (3)  It has a **_pre-shift_** **_loss_** if, immediately before the * decrease time, its market value was _equal to or less than_ its * adjustable value.

\[The next section is section 725-220.]

#### Special cases

##### <a id="725-220"></a>725-220  Neutral direct value shifts

             (1)  The consequences are different if the total decrease in market value of your * down interests is equal to the sum of:

                     (a)  the total increase in market value of your * up interests; and

(b)  the total * discounts given to you on the issue of your up interests.

             (2)  In that case, this Subdivision and Subdivisions 725-D to 725-F apply to you as if the * direct value shift:

                     (a)  consisted only of:

                              (i)  the decreases in market value of your * down interests; and

                             (ii)  the issue at a * discount of your * up interests covered by subsection 725-145(2); and

                            (iii)  the increases in market value of your up interests covered by subsection 725-145(3); and

                     (b)  were from each of your down interests to each of your up interests.

             (3)  This section has effect despite section 725-160.

##### <a id="725-225"></a>725-225  Issue of bonus shares or units

             (1)  The consequences are different if you are an * affected owner of * up interests (the **_bonus interests_**) that the target entity issues to you, at a * discount, under the * scheme, in relation to * down interests (the **_original interests_**) of which you are an affected owner.

Effect of treatment under subsection 130-20(3)

             (2)  To the extent that the * direct value shift is _to_ the bonus interests _from_ original interests in relation to which the target entity issued bonus interests to which:

                     (a)  subsection 130-20(3) applies (because none of them is a dividend or otherwise assessable income); and

                     (b)  item 1 of the table in that subsection applies (because the original interests are post-CGT assets);

these paragraphs apply:

                     (c)  the respective * cost bases and * reduced cost bases of those original interests are not reduced;

                     (d)  the bonus interests referred to in subsection (1) do not give rise to a * taxing event generating a gain for you under the table in section 725-245 on any of those original interests.

             (3)  To the extent that the * direct value shift is _from_ the original interests _to_ bonus interests to which subsection 130-20(3) applies (because none of them is a dividend or otherwise assessable income) and:

                     (a)  item 1 of the table in that subsection applies (because the original interests are post-CGT assets); or

                     (b)  item 2 of that table applies (because the original interests are pre-CGT assets and an amount has been paid for the bonus interests that you were required to pay); 

the respective * cost bases and * reduced cost bases of those bonus interests are not uplifted.

Effect of treatment under subsection 6BA(3) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936

             (4)  To the extent that the * direct value shift is _to_ the bonus interests _from_ original interests in relation to which the target entity issued bonus interests to which subsection 6BA(3) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ applies (either because they are shares issued for no consideration and none of them is a dividend or because they qualify for the intercorporate dividend rebate):

                     (a)  the respective * adjustable values of those original interests, in their character as * trading stock or * revenue assets, are not reduced; and

                     (b)  the bonus interests referred to in subsection (1) do not give rise to a * taxing event generating a gain for you under the table in section 725-335 on any of those original interests.

             (5)  To the extent that the * direct value shift is _from_ the original interests to bonus interests to which subsection 6BA(3) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ applies, the respective * adjustable values of those bonus interests of which you are an affected owner, in their character as trading stock or revenue assets, are not uplifted.

##### <a id="725-230"></a>725-230  Off-market buy-backs

             (1)  The consequences are different if:

                     (a)  a decrease in the market value of a * down interest of which you are an * affected owner is reasonably attributable to the target entity proposing to buy back that interest for less than its market value; and

                     (b)  the target entity does buy back that down interest; and

                     (c)  subsection 159GZZZQ(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ treats you as having received the down interest’s market value worked out as if the buy-back had not occurred and was never proposed to occur.

             (2)  The * adjustable value of the * down interest is not reduced, and there is no * taxing event generating a gain.

Note:          The down interest is not dealt with here because it is already dealt with in Division 16K of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

             (3)  Also, to the extent that the * direct value shift is from the * down interest to * up interests of which you are an * affected owner, uplifts in the * adjustable value of the up interests are worked out under either or both of:

                     (a)  item 8 of the table in subsection 725-250(2); and

                     (b)  item 9 of the table in subsection 725-335(3);

as if the down interest were one owned by another affected owner.

##### <a id="725-240"></a>725-240  CGT consequences; meaning of _adjustable value_

             (1)  The CGT consequences for you of a * direct value shift are of one or more of these 3 kinds:

                     (a)  there are one or more * taxing events generating a gain for * down interests of which you are an affected owner (see subsection (2));

                     (b)  the * cost base and * reduced cost base of down interests of which you are an * affected owner are reduced (see subsection (3));

                     (c)  the cost base and reduced cost base of * up interests of which you are an affected owner are uplifted (see subsection (4)).

Note:          If there is a taxing event generating a gain, CGT event K8 happens. See section 104-240.

Taxing event generating a gain

             (2)  To work out:

                     (a)  whether under the table in section 725-245 there is a * taxing event generating a gain for you on a * down interest; and

                     (b)  if so, the amount of the gain;

assume that the **_adjustable value_** from time to time of that or any other * equity or loan interest in the * target entity is its * cost base.

Note:          For example, for that purpose the question whether the interest has a pre-shift gain or a pre-shift loss is determined on the basis that the interest’s adjustable value is its cost base.

Reduction or uplift of cost base and reduced cost base

             (3)  The * cost base and the * reduced cost base of a * down interest are reduced at the * decrease time to the extent that section 725-250 provides for the * adjustable value of the interest to be reduced.

             (4)  The * cost base and the * reduced cost base of an * up interest are uplifted at the * increase time to the extent that section 725-250 provides for the * adjustable value of the interest to be uplifted.

             (5)  However, the * cost base or * reduced cost base is _uplifted_ only to the extent that the amount of the uplift is still reflected in the market value of the interest when a later * CGT event happens to the interest.

             (6)  To work out:

                     (a)  whether the * cost base or * reduced cost base of the interest is reduced or uplifted; and

                     (b)  if so, by how much;

assume that:

                     (c)  the **_adjustable value_** from time to time of that or any other * equity or loan interest in the * target entity is its cost base or reduced cost base, as appropriate; and

                     (d)  if the interest is an * up interest because it was issued at a * discount—the **_adjustable value_** of the interest immediately before it was issued was its cost base or reduced cost base, as appropriate, when it was issued.

Note:          For example, for that purpose the question whether the interest has a pre-shift gain or a pre-shift loss is determined on the basis that the interest’s adjustable value is its cost base or reduced cost base, as appropriate.

Reductions and uplifts also apply to pre-CGT assets

             (7)  A reduction or uplift occurs regardless of whether the entity that owns the interest * acquired it before, on or after 20 September 1985.

##### <a id="725-245"></a>725-245  Table of _taxing events generating a gain_ for interests as CGT assets

                   To the extent that the * direct value shift is from * down interests of which you are an * affected owner, and that are specified in an item in the table, to * up interests specified in that item, those up interests give rise to a **_taxing event generating a gain_** for you on each of those down interests. The gain is worked out under section 725-365.

##### <a id="725-310"></a>725-310  Consequences for down interest or up interest as trading stock

             (1)  The consequences of the * direct value shift for your * trading stock are of one or more of these 3 kinds:

                     (a)  the * adjustable values of * down interests of which you are an * affected owner are reduced (see subsection (2));

                     (b)  the adjustable values of * up interests of which you are an affected owner are uplifted (see subsection (3));

                     (c)  there are one or more * taxing events generating a gain for down interests of which you are an affected owner (see subsection (5)).

Effect of reduction or uplift of adjustable value

             (2)  If the * adjustable value of a * down interest that is your trading stock is reduced under section 725-335, you are treated as if:

                     (a)  * immediately before the * decrease time, you had sold the interest to someone else (at * arm’s length and in the ordinary course of business) for its * adjustable value immediately before the decrease time; and

                     (b)  immediately after the decrease time, you had bought the interest back for the reduced adjustable value.

             (3)  If the * adjustable value of an * up interest that is your * trading stock is uplifted under section 725-335, you are treated as if:

                     (a)  * immediately before the * increase time, you had sold the interest to someone else (at * arm’s length and in the ordinary course of business) for its * adjustable value immediately before the increase time; and

                     (b)  immediately after the increase time, you had bought the interest back for the uplifted adjustable value.

             (4)  However, the increase in the cost of an * up interest because of paragraph (3)(b) is taken into account from time to time only to the extent that the amount of the increase is still reflected in the market value of the interest.

Note:          The situations where the increase in cost would be taken into account include:

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>in working out your deductions for the cost of trading stock acquired during the income year in which the increase time happens; and

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>the end of an income year if the interest’s closing value as trading stock is worked out on the basis of its cost; and

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>the start of the income year in which the interest is disposed of, if that happens in a later income year and the interest’s closing value as trading stock at the end of the previous income year was worked out on the basis of its cost.

                   If the interest stops being trading stock, section 70-110 treats you as having disposed of it.

Taxing event generating a gain

             (5)  For each * taxing event generating a gain under an item in the table in subsection 725-335(3), the gain is included in your assessable income for the income year in which the * decrease time happens.

##### <a id="725-315"></a>725-315  _Adjustable value_ of trading stock

                   If a * down interest or * up interest is your trading stock, its **_adjustable value_** at a particular time is:

                     (a)  if the interest has been * trading stock of yours ever since the start of the income year in which that time occurs—its * value as trading stock at the start of the income year; or

                     (b)  otherwise—its cost.

Note 1:       If an interest has been affected by an earlier direct value shift during the same income year, it will be treated as having already been sold and repurchased (because of an earlier application of section 725-310). As a result, the cost on repurchase becomes its adjustable value immediately before the decrease time or increase time for the later direct value shift.

Note 2:       The adjustable value of an interest that is an up interest because it was issued at a discount is worked out under paragraph (b).

##### <a id="725-320"></a>725-320  Consequences for down interest or up interest as a revenue asset

             (1)  The consequences of the * direct value shift for your * revenue assets are of one or more of these 3 kinds:

                     (a)  the * adjustable values of * down interests of which you are an * affected owner are reduced (see subsection (2));

                     (b)  the adjustable values of * up interests of which you are an affected owner are uplifted (see subsection (3));

                     (c)  one or more * taxing events generating a gain for down interests of which you are an affected owner (see subsection (5)).

Effect of reduction or uplift of adjustable value

             (2)  If the * adjustable value of a * down interest that is your * revenue asset is decreased under section 725-335, you are treated as if:

                     (a)  * immediately before the * decrease time, you had sold the interest to someone else for its * adjustable value immediately before the decrease time; and

                     (b)  immediately afterwards, you had bought the interest back for the reduced adjustable value; and

                     (c)  from the time when you bought it back, the interest continued to be a revenue asset, for the same reasons as it was a revenue asset before you sold it.

             (3)  If the * adjustable value of an * up interest that is your * revenue asset is uplifted under section 725-335, you are treated as if:

                     (a)  * immediately before the * increase time, you had sold the interest to someone else for its * adjustable value immediately before the increase time; and

                     (b)  immediately afterwards, you had bought the interest back for the uplifted adjustable value; and

                     (c)  from the time when you bought it back, the interest continued to be a revenue asset, for the same reasons as it was a revenue asset before you sold it.

             (4)  However, the uplift in * adjustable value is taken into account only to the extent that the amount of the uplift is still reflected in the market value of the interest when it is disposed of or otherwise realised.

Taxing event generating a gain

             (5)  For each * taxing event generating a gain under an item in the table in subsection 725-335(3), the gain is included in your assessable income for the income year in which the * decrease time happens.

##### <a id="725-325"></a>725-325  _Adjustable value_ of revenue asset

             (1)  If a * down interest is your * revenue asset, its **_adjustable value_** immediately before the * decrease time is the total of the amounts that would be subtracted from the gross disposal proceeds in calculating any profit or loss on disposal of the interest if you disposed of it immediately before the decrease time.

             (2)  If an * up interest is your * revenue asset and it increases in market value because of the * direct value shift, its **_adjustable value_** immediately before the * increase time is the total of the amounts that would be subtracted from the gross disposal proceeds in calculating any profit or loss on disposal of the interest if you disposed of it immediately before the increase time.

             (3)  If an * up interest is your * revenue asset and it is issued at a * discount, it is taken to have an **_adjustable value_** immediately before it is issued equal to the consideration paid or given by you for the interest.

Note:          If an interest has been affected by an earlier direct value shift during the same income year, it will be treated as having already been sold and repurchased (because of an earlier application of section 725-320). As a result, the cost on repurchase becomes its adjustable value immediately before the decrease time or increase time for the later direct value shift.

\[The next section is section 725-335.]

##### <a id="725-335"></a>725-335  How to work out those consequences

             (1)  This section sets out the consequences of the * direct value shift for a * down interest or * up interest as * trading stock or a * revenue asset.

             (2)  If you have both trading stock and revenue assets, items 1 and 2 of the table in subsection (3) can apply once to the trading stock and again to the revenue assets. The other items apply (if at all) to the trading stock and revenue assets together.

Decreases and uplifts in adjustable value

             (3)  To the extent that the * direct value shift is from * down interests specified in an item in the table to * up interests specified in that item:

                     (a)  the * adjustable value of each of those down interests is decreased by the amount worked out under the section (if any) specified for the down interests in the last column of that item; and

                     (b)  the adjustable value of each of those * up interests is uplifted by the amount worked out under the section (if any) specified for the up interests in that column.

Taxing events generating a gain

             (4)  To the extent that the * direct value shift is from * down interests:

                     (a)  of which you are an * affected owner; and

                     (b)  that are specified in item 2, 4 or 7 in the table in subsection (3);

to * up interests specified in that item, those up interests give rise to a **_taxing event generating a gain_** for you under that item on each of those down interests. The gain is worked out under section 725-365.

##### <a id="725-340"></a>725-340  Multiple trading stock or revenue asset consequences for the same down interest or up interest

             (1)  A * down interest or * up interest of which you are an * affected owner may be covered by 2 or more items in the table in subsection 725-335(3).

             (2)  If the * adjustable value of the same * down interest or * up interest is decreased or uplifted under 2 or more items, it is decreased or uplifted by the total of the amounts worked out under those items.

             (3)  If for a particular * down interest there is a * taxing event generating a gain under an item, that taxing event is in addition to:

                     (a)  each taxing event generating a gain for that interest under any other item in the table; and

                     (b)  each decrease in the * adjustable value of the interest under that or any other item in the table.

                   Use the following method statement:

                     (a)  to work out the amount of the gain for a * taxing event generating a gain under:

                              (i)  section 725-245; or

                             (ii)  item 2, 4 or 7 of the table in subsection 725-335(3); and

                     (b)  to work out the decrease in * adjustable value of a * down interest under:

                              (i)  item 1, 2, 3, 4 or 6 of the table in subsection 725-250(2); or

                             (ii)  item 1, 2, 4 or 7 of the table in subsection 725-335(3).

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.    Group together all * down interests that:

               (a)     are of the kind referred to in the relevant item; and

               (b)     immediately before the * decrease time, had the same * adjustable value as the down interest; and

               (c)     immediately before that time had the same market value as the down interest; and

               (d)     sustained the same decrease in market value as the down interest because of the * direct value shift.

Step 2.    Work out the value shifted from that group of * down interests to the * up interests referred to in the relevant item using the following formula:

                   ![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00500/Html/NBTSConsolValueShiftDemergOtherMeasures2002_image013.gif)

Step 3.    Work out the notional adjustable value of the value shifted from that group of * down interests to those * up interests using the formula:

                   ![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00500/Html/NBTSConsolValueShiftDemergOtherMeasures2002_image014.gif)

Step 4.    The decrease in the * adjustable value  of the * down interest under the relevant item is equal to:

##### <a id="725-370"></a>725-370  Uplifts in adjustable values of up interests under certain table items

                   Use the following method statement to work out the uplift in * adjustable value of an * up interest under:

                     (a)  item 1 or 2 of the table in subsection 725-250(2); or

                     (b)  item 1 of the table in subsection 725-335(3).

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.    If the market value of the * up interest increases because of the * direct value shift, group together all up interests of the kind referred to in the relevant item that:

               (a)     immediately before the * increase time, had the same * adjustable value as the up interest; and

               (b)     sustained the same increase in market value as the up interest because of the * direct value shift.

              If the * up interest is issued at a * discount, group together all * up interests of the kind referred to in the relevant item that:

               (c)     immediately before the * increase time, had the same * adjustable value as the up interest; and

               (d)     because of the direct value shift, are issued at the same discount as the up interest.

Step 2\. The notional adjustable value of the value shifted from the * down interests referred to in the relevant item to all the * up interests referred to in that item has already been worked out under one or more applications of step 3 of the method statement in section 725-365.

Step 3\. Use the following formula to work out how much of that notional adjustable value is attributable to the value shifted to the group of * up interests referred to in step 1 of this method statement:

                   ![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00500/Html/NBTSConsolValueShiftDemergOtherMeasures2002_image017.gif)

                   ![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00500/Html/NBTSConsolValueShiftDemergOtherMeasures2002_image018.gif)

* * *

##### <a id="725-375"></a>725-375  Uplifts in adjustable values of up interests under other table items

                   Use the following method statement to work out the uplift in * adjustable value of an * up interest under:

                     (a)  item 3, 4, 5 or 8 of the table in subsection 725-250(2); or

                     (b)  item 2, 3, 6 or 9 of the table in subsection 725-335(3).

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.    If the market value of the * up interest increases because of the direct value shift, group together all * up interests of the kind referred to in the relevant item that sustained the same increase in market value as the up interest because of the direct value shift.

              If the up interest is issued at a discount, group together all up interests of the kind referred to in the relevant item that are issued at a discount of the same amount as the up interest because of the direct value shift.

Step 2.    The value shifted  to that group of * up interests from the * down interests referred to in the relevant item is the amount worked out using the formula:

                   ![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00500/Html/NBTSConsolValueShiftDemergOtherMeasures2002_image019.gif)

              where:

              **_sum of the group increases or discounts_** means (as appropriate):

               (a)     the sum of the increases in market value of all * up interests in the group because of the * direct value shift; or

               (b)     the sum of the * discounts at which all * up interests in the group were issued because of the * direct value shift.

              **_total value of the direct value shift_** means:

               (a)     if the sum of the decreases in market value of all * down interests because of the * direct value shift is equal to or greater than the sum of the increases in market value of all * up interests and all * discounts given because of the shift—the sum of the decreases; or

               (b)     if the sum of the decreases in market value of all down interests because of the direct value shift is less than the sum of the increases in market value of all up interests and all discounts given because of the shift—the sum of the increases and discounts.

Step 3.    The uplift in the * adjustable value  of the * up interest under the relevant item is equal to:

                   ![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00500/Html/NBTSConsolValueShiftDemergOtherMeasures2002_image020.gif)

##### <a id="725-380"></a>725-380  Decreases in adjustable value of down interests (with pre-shift losses)

                   Use the following method statement to work out the decrease in * adjustable value of a * down interest under:

                     (a)  item 5 or 7 of the table in subsection 725-250(2); or

                     (b)  item 3, 5 or 8 of the table in subsection 725-335(3).

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.    Group together all * down interests of the kind referred to in the relevant item that:

               (a)     immediately before the * decrease time, had the same * adjustable value as the down interest; and

               (b)     immediately before that time had the same market value as the down interest; and

               (c)     sustained the same decrease in market value as the down interest because of the * direct value shift.

If there is a net shift of value between 2 related entities because of a non-arm’s length dealing, this Division:

               (a)     prevents losses from arising, because of the value shift, on realisation of direct or indirect equity or loan interests in the losing entity; and

               (b)     within limits, prevents gains from arising, because of the value shift, on realisation of direct or indirect equity or loan interests in the gaining entity.

However, it does so only for interests that are owned by entities involved in the value shift.

727-25      Effect of this Division on realisations at a loss that occur before the nature or extent of an indirect value shift can be fully determined

##### <a id="727-5"></a>727-5  What is an indirect value shift?

             (1)  An indirect value shift arises when there is a net shift of value from one entity to another.

Example:    Company A transfers property to company B in return for a cash payment. If the market value of the property is $180 million but the cash payment is only $50 million, there is a net shift of value from company A to company B of $130 million.

             (2)  It is called _indirect_ because the transaction will have the indirect effect of shifting value from equity or loan interests in the losing entity to equity or loan interests in the gaining entity.

                   This is because the net shift in value between the entities will usually _decrease_ the market value of interests in the losing entity and _increase_ the market value of interests in the gaining entity.

Example:    Assume that company C owns all the shares in company A and company D owns all the shares in company B. The net shift of value from company A to company B will reduce the value of company C’s shares in company A and increase the value of company D’s shares in company B.

             (3)  It will also produce corresponding effects further up a chain of entities.

Example:    Assume that company E owns all the shares in company C and company D. The net shift of value from company A to company B will also reduce the value of company E’s shares in company C and increase the value of its shares in company D.

             (4)  This Division is _not_ concerned with the tax treatment of the net shift in value between the entities at the bottom of the chains. Instead, it deals with the effects on the market value of interests (both direct and indirect) in those entities.

             (5)  An indirect value shift distorts the relationship between the market value of an equity or loan interest and its value for income tax purposes. When the interest is realised, this can produce an inappropriate loss for income tax purposes, or an inappropriate gain.

Example:    If company E sold its shares in company C, the indirect value shift could (apart from this Division) result in a loss for income tax purposes. Company E could defer the corresponding gain on its shares in company D by not selling these.

##### <a id="727-10"></a>727-10  How does this Division deal with indirect value shifts?

             (1)  To prevent an inappropriate loss or gain from arising on realisation of an interest, this Division reduces the amount of the loss or gain (realisation time method). However, a choice can be made to adjust the interest’s value for income tax purposes in a way that takes account of the indirect value shift (adjustable value method).

             (2)  This Division does _not_ create taxing events giving rise to gains or losses.

##### <a id="727-15"></a>727-15  When does an indirect value shift have consequences under this Division?

             (1)  Indirect value shift is defined very broadly, but the application of this Division is limited in various ways.

             (2)  The losing entity must be a company or trust (except a superannuation entity). However, the gaining entity can be any kind of entity, including an individual.

             (3)  This Division does _not_ apply if entities deal with each other at arm’s length, or provide economic benefits in return for full market value.

             (4)  The losing entity and the gaining entity must be connected by having had the same _ultimate controller_. In the case of closely held entities, they may instead be connected by having had a high level of _common ownership_.

             (5)  The only interests affected are those owned by entities involved in the indirect value shift or by their associates.

             (6)  There are a range of exclusions, such as:

                     (a)  exclusions for minor indirect value shifts; and

                     (b)  a series of rules designed to provide safe harbour treatment for common transactions relating to services; and

                     (c)  anti-overlap provisions to prevent double-counting.

             (7)  Rules of thumb are included to make it easier to determine the market value of some kinds of economic benefits.

             (8)  To reduce compliance costs for:

                     (a)  entities in the Simplified Tax System; and

                     (b)  entities that meet the CGT small business net asset threshold ($5 million);

interests owned by those entities are not affected by this Division.

\[The next section is section 727-25.]

##### <a id="727-25"></a>727-25  Effect of this Division on realisations at a loss that occur before the nature or extent of an indirect value shift can be fully determined

             (1)  To determine whether a scheme gives rise to an indirect value shift, it must be possible to identify all the economic benefits under the scheme, and the providers and recipients of those benefits.

             (2)  Before then, interests that might be affected by the scheme may be realised at a loss. Subdivision 727-K contains special rules that apply if that happens.

727-125    No consequences if losing entity is a superannuation entity

##### <a id="727-95"></a>727-95  Main object

                   The main object of this Division is:

                     (a)  to prevent inappropriate losses from arising on the realisation of direct or indirect equity or loan interests in an entity from which there has been a net shift of value because of a non-arm’s length dealing; and

                     (b)  to prevent inappropriate gains from arising on the realisation of direct or indirect equity interests in the entity to which that value has been shifted;

in cases where the 2 entities are related as set out in this Division.

##### <a id="727-100"></a>727-100  When an indirect value shift has consequences under this Division

                   An * indirect value shift (see Subdivision 727-B) has consequences under this Division if, and only if:

                     (a)  the * losing entity is at the time of the indirect value shift a company or trust (except one listed in section 727-125 (about superannuation entities)); and

                     (b)  in relation to either or both of the following:

                              (i)  the losing entity * providing one or more economic benefits to the gaining entity * in connection with the * scheme from which the indirect value shift results;

                             (ii)  the gaining entity providing one or more economic benefits to the losing entity in connection with the scheme;

                            the 2 entities are not dealing with each other at * arm’s length; and

                     (c)  either or both of sections 727-105 and 727-110 are satisfied; and

                     (d)  no exclusion in Subdivision 727-C applies.

Note 1:       The consequences for direct and indirect interests in the losing entity or in the gaining entity are set out in Subdivision 727-F. If those consequences are to be worked out using the realisation time method (under Subdivision 727-G), there are further exclusions for certain 95% services indirect value shifts: see section 727-700.

Note 2:       An indirect value shift does not have consequences for interests in the losing entity or gaining entity owned immediately before the IVS time by an entity that:

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>is eligible to be an STS taxpayer for each income year that includes any of the IVS period; or

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>would satisfy the maximum net asset value test in section 152-15 throughout the IVS period.

                   See subsection 727-470(2).

##### <a id="727-105"></a>727-105  Ultimate controller test

                   It must be the case that, at some time during the * IVS period:

                     (a)  the * losing entity and the * gaining entity have the same * ultimate controller; or

                     (b)  the ultimate controller of the losing entity is the same entity that was the ultimate controller of the gaining entity at a different time during that period; or

                     (c)  the gaining entity is the ultimate controller of the losing entity; or

                     (d)  the losing entity is the ultimate controller of the gaining entity.

For the concept of **_IVS period_**, see section 727-150.

For the concept of **_ultimate controller_**, see section 727-350.

##### <a id="727-110"></a>727-110  Common-ownership nexus test (if both losing and gaining entities are closely held)

             (1)  Or, it must be the case that:

                     (a)  at some time during the * IVS period, neither the * losing entity nor the * gaining entity has 300 or more members (in the case of a company) or 300 or more beneficiaries (in the case of a trust); and

                     (b)  the losing entity and the gaining entity have a * common-ownership nexus within the IVS period.

For the concept of **_IVS period_**, see section 727-150.

For the concept of **_common-ownership nexus_**, see section 727-400.

             (2)  Section 124-810 (under which certain companies and trusts are not regarded as having 300 or more members or beneficiaries) also applies for the purposes of this Division.

             (3)  In addition, this Division applies to a * non-fixed trust as if it did not have 300 or more beneficiaries.

##### <a id="727-125"></a>727-125  No consequences if losing entity is a superannuation entity

                   An * indirect value shift has no consequences under this Division if the * losing entity is one of these in relation to the income year in which the indirect value shift happens:

                     (a)  a * complying superannuation fund; or

                     (b)  a * non-complying superannuation fund; or

                     (c)  a * complying approved deposit fund; or

                     (d)  a * non-complying approved deposit fund; or

                     (e)  a * pooled superannuation trust.

727-165    Preventing double-counting of economic benefits

##### <a id="727-150"></a>727-150  How to determine whether a scheme results in an indirect value shift

             (1)  A * scheme can result in one or more * indirect value shifts only if one or more economic benefits have been, are being, or are to be, * provided * in connection with the scheme.

             (2)  The question whether the * scheme has that result must be determined by reference to the facts and circumstances that exist at the earliest time (either when the scheme is entered into or later) when it is reasonable to conclude that:

                     (a)  all the economic benefits that have been, are being, or are to be, * provided * in connection with the scheme can be identified; and

                     (b)  for each of those economic benefits:

                              (i)  the entity that has provided, is providing, or is to provide, the economic benefit can be identified; and

                             (ii)  the entity to which the economic benefit has been, is being, or is to be, provided can be identified; and

                            (iii)  if the economic benefit is to be provided—those entities are in existence, and the providing of the economic benefit is not contingent; and

                     (c)  there are no other economic benefits that are to be provided in connection with the scheme if some contingency is met.

That time is called the **_IVS time_** for the scheme.

Note:          In most cases, the IVS time will be at or soon after the scheme is entered into. However, if:

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>direct or indirect interests in a company or trust are realised at a loss  when the IVS time for the scheme has not yet happened (even if it never happens); and

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>the company or trust has provided, is providing, is to provide, or might provide, economic benefits in connection with the scheme;

                   there may be consequences for those interests similar to those of an indirect value shift resulting from the scheme. See Subdivision 727-K.

             (3)  The * scheme results in an **_indirect value shift_** from one entity (the **_losing entity_**) to another entity (the **_gaining entity_**) if the total market value of the one or more economic benefits (the **_greater benefits_**) that the losing entity has * provided, is providing, or is to provide, to the gaining entity * in connection with the scheme exceeds:

                     (a)  the total market value of the one or more economic benefits (**_lesser benefits_**) that the gaining entity has provided, is providing, or is to provide, to the losing entity in connection with the scheme; or

                     (b)  if there are no economic benefits covered by paragraph (a)—nil.

That excess is the amount of the indirect value shift.

             (4)  The market value of an economic benefit is to be determined as at the earliest time when it is reasonable to conclude that:

                     (a)  the economic benefit can be identified; and

                     (b)  paragraph (2)(b) is satisfied for that benefit.

For more rules affecting how the market value of an economic benefit is determined, see Subdivision 727-D.

             (5)  Neither the * losing entity nor the * gaining entity needs to be a party to the * scheme. A benefit can be provided by act or omission.

             (6)  The indirect value shift happens at the * IVS time.

             (7)  The **_IVS period_** for a * scheme starts immediately before the scheme is entered into and ends at the * IVS time.

             (8)  A contingency that is artificial, or is virtually certain to be met, is treated under this Division as if it had been met.

##### <a id="727-155"></a>727-155  Providing economic benefits

Examples

             (1)  These are some examples of an entity providing an economic benefit to another entity:

                     (a)  the first entity pays an amount to the other entity (in this case the market value of the benefit is the amount of the payment);

                     (b)  the first entity provides an asset or services to the other entity;

                     (c)  the first entity does something that creates an asset in the hands of the other entity (for example, a company issues shares to its members);

                     (d)  the first entity incurs a liability to the other entity, or increases a liability it already owes to the other entity;

                     (e)  the first entity terminates all or part of a liability owed by the other entity;

                      (f)  the first entity does something that increases the market value of an asset that the other entity holds.

             (2)  These examples are not intended to limit the meaning of providing an economic benefit.

Things treated as economic benefits

             (3)  This Division applies as if the ending of:

                     (a)  a * primary equity interest or * secondary equity interest in an entity; or

                     (b)  a right that the owner of a * primary equity interest or * secondary equity interest in an entity has because of owning the interest;

were an economic benefit that the owner of the interest provides to that entity.

##### <a id="727-160"></a>727-160  When an economic benefit is provided _in connection with_ a scheme

             (1)  An economic benefit has been, is being, is to be, or might be, * provided by an entity to another entity **_in connection with_**a * scheme if, and only if:

                     (a)  the benefit has been, is being, is to be, or might be, provided under the scheme; or

                     (b)  the providing of the benefit is reasonably attributable to:

                              (i)  something that has been, is being, is to be, or might be, done or omitted under the scheme (whether before, at the time of, or after, the providing of the benefit) by an entity that is either of those entities or a third entity; or

                             (ii)  2 or more such things.

             (2)  An entity referred to in paragraph (1)(b) need not be a party to the * scheme. A benefit can be provided by act or omission.

##### <a id="727-165"></a>727-165  Preventing double-counting of economic benefits

Rights to have economic benefits provided

             (1)  If an economic benefit that has been, is being, is to be, or might be, * provided as mentioned in subsection 727-150(3) or 727-855(1) consists of a right to have economic benefits provided, that subsection applies to the right but does not also apply to those economic benefits.

Example:    Acme Ltd enters into an agreement with Paragon Pty Ltd under which Acme is to provide services to Paragon over a 5 year period in return for payments.

                   Paragon’s rights under the agreement are economic benefits that Acme provides to Paragon when the agreement is made. The services are economic benefits that Acme is to provide to Paragon.

                   Because of this subsection, the market value of the rights is taken into account in working out whether there has been an indirect value shift, but the market value of the services is not.

Effect of an economic benefit on interests in the entity to which it is provided

             (2)  If an economic benefit has been, is being, or is to be, * provided to an entity, then, for the purposes of subsection 727-150(3) or 727-855(1), disregard an economic benefit to the extent that:

                     (a)  it consists of an increase in the market value of:

                              (i)  an * equity or loan interest in the entity; or

                             (ii)  an * indirect equity or loan interest in the entity; and

                     (b)  the increase is reasonably attributable to the first-mentioned benefit.

#### General

##### <a id="727-215"></a>727-215  Amount does not exceed $50,000

             (1)  An * indirect value shift does not have consequences under this Division if the amount of it does not exceed $50,000.

             (2)  However, subsection (1) does not apply to an * indirect value shift (and is taken never to have applied to it) if:

                     (a)  before, at the same time as, or after it, another indirect value shift happens for which the same entity is the losing entity as for the first indirect value shift; and

                     (b)  having regard to all relevant circumstances, it is reasonable to conclude that the sole or main reason why one of the indirect value shifts happened under a different * scheme from the other was so that its amount would not exceed $50,000.

##### <a id="727-220"></a>727-220  Disposal of asset at cost, or at undervalue if full value is not reflected in adjustable values of equity or loan interests in the losing entity

             (1)  An * indirect value shift does not have consequences under this Division if the conditions in this section are met.

             (2)  The * greater benefits must consist entirely of:

                     (a)  the * losing entity transferring a * CGT asset to the * gaining entity; or

                     (b)  a right to have the losing entity transfer an asset to the gaining entity.

             (3)  There must be * lesser benefits and, as at the * IVS time, the total market value of the lesser benefits must not be less than the greatest of these amounts:

                     (a)  the asset’s * cost base at that time;

                     (b)  the asset’s cost;

                     (c)  the asset’s market value immediately before the most recent time (if any), since the * losing entity * acquired the asset, when an * affected owner has acquired:

                              (i)  a * primary equity interest in the losing entity; or

                             (ii)  an * indirect primary equity interest in the losing entity.

             (4)  A * primary equity interest in an entity is an **_indirect primary equity interest_** in another entity if, and only if:

                     (a)  the first entity owns a primary equity interest in the other entity; or

                     (b)  the first entity owns a primary equity interest that is an indirect primary equity interest in the other entity because of one or more other applications of this subsection.

\[The next section is section 727-230.]

#### Indirect value shifts involving services

##### <a id="727-230"></a>727-230  Services provided by losing entity to gaining entity for at least their direct cost

                   An * indirect value shift does not have consequences under this Division if:

                     (a)  to the extent of at least 95% of their total market value, the * greater benefits consist entirely of:

                              (i)  a right to have services that are covered by section 727-240 provided directly by the losing entity to the gaining entity; or

                             (ii)  services that are covered by section 727-240 and have been, are being, or are to be, so provided;

                            or both; and

                     (b)  there are * lesser benefits and, as at the * IVS time, the total market value of the lesser benefits is not less than the total of:

                              (i)  the present value of the direct cost to the losing entity of providing the services; and

                             (ii)  the present value of a reasonable allocation of the total direct cost to the losing entity of providing services that include the first-mentioned services (so far as it is not already covered by subparagraph (i)).

To work out the costs and present values referred to in paragraph (b),
 see section 727-245.

##### <a id="727-235"></a>727-235  Services provided by gaining entity to losing entity for no more than a commercially realistic price

             (1)  An * indirect value shift does not have consequences under this Division if:

                     (a)  there are * lesser benefits and, to the extent of at least 95% of their total market value, the lesser benefits consist entirely of:

                              (i)  a right to have services that are covered by section 727-240 provided directly by the gaining entity to the losing entity; or

                             (ii)  services that are covered by section 727-240 and have been, are being, or are to be, so provided;

                            or both; and

                     (b)  as at the * IVS time, the total market value of the greater benefits is not more than the total of:

                              (i)  the present value of the direct cost to the gaining entity of providing the services; and

                             (ii)  the present value of a reasonable allocation of the total direct cost to the gaining entity of providing services that include the first-mentioned services (so far as it is not already covered by subparagraph (i)); and

                            (iii)  the present value of a reasonable allocation of the indirect cost to the gaining entity of providing the first-mentioned services; and

                            (iv)  the mark-up worked out under subsection (2) or (3) of this section.

To work out the costs and present values referred to in paragraph (1)(b),
 see section 727-245.

             (2)  If it is reasonable to estimate that an entity providing the same quantity of services of the same kind in the same market would charge for them on the basis of a particular percentage mark-up, or on the basis of a percentage mark-up within a particular range, the mark-up for the purposes of subparagraph (1)(b)(iv) is:

•    the total of the respective present values of the costs mentioned in subparagraphs (1)(b)(i), (ii) and (iii);

multiplied by:

•    that percentage mark-up, or the highest percentage in that range.

             (3)  Otherwise, the mark-up for the purposes of subparagraph (1)(b)(iv) is 10% of the total of the respective present values of the costs mentioned in subparagraphs (1)(b)(i), (ii) and (iii).

##### <a id="727-240"></a>727-240  What services certain provisions apply to

             (1)  Sections 727-230, 727-235, 727-700 and 727-725 apply only to services consisting of:

                     (a)  doing work (including professional work and giving professional advice or any other kind of advice); or

Note:       Examples include accounting or legal services; advertising services and financial management services.

                     (b)  providing (including allowing use of) facilities for entertainment, recreation or instruction; or

                     (c)  leasing, renting, hiring, or allowing the use of, any asset; or

                     (d)  packaging, transporting or storing any property; or

                     (e)  providing insurance; or

                      (f)  services provided, by a banker to a customer, in the course of the banker carrying on the business of banking; or

                     (g)  lending money or providing any other form of financial accommodation.

             (2)  It does not matter whether services covered by paragraph (1)(a) also involve supplying property.

##### <a id="727-245"></a>727-245  How to work out certain amounts for the purposes of sections 727-230 and 727-235

             (1)  The costs mentioned in paragraph 727-230(b) or 727-235(1)(b) are to be worked out:

                     (a)  in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices; and

                     (b)  to the extent that the services are to be provided in the future, on the basis of a reasonable estimate of those costs.

             (2)  To avoid doubt, the direct cost or indirect cost mentioned in paragraph 727-230(b) or 727-235(1)(b) does _not_ include:

                     (a)  to the extent that the services consist of or include lending money or providing any other form of financial accommodation—the amount of the loan or other accommodation; or

                     (b)  to the extent that the services consist of or include leasing, renting, hiring, or allowing the use of, any asset:

                              (i)  the cost of acquiring the asset; or

                             (ii)  the cost of acquiring an interest in, or right in respect of, the asset in order to provide the services.

Example:    Acme Ltd is the holding company of Group Financier Pty Ltd. Group Financier Pty Ltd borrows $20 million at 7% per annum, and on lends it to other subsidiaries of Acme Ltd at 8% per annum.

                   The $20 million does not form part of Group Financier Pty Ltd’s direct cost of the services it provides to the other subsidiaries in the form of the on lending. However, the 7% interest that Group Financier Pty Ltd pays on the $20 million does form part of that direct cost.

             (3)  The present values mentioned in paragraph 727-230(b) or 727-235(1)(b) are to be worked out using a discount rate equal to the rate that, for the purposes of section 109N of _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, is the benchmark interest rate for the income year in which the * IVS time occurs.

Note:          That section is about distributions to entities connected with a private company.

#### Anti-overlap provisions

##### <a id="727-250"></a>727-250  Distribution by an entity to a member or beneficiary

             (1)  An * indirect value shift does not have consequences under this Division if:

                     (a)  the * greater benefits consist entirely of:

                              (i)  a distribution of income or capital that the * losing entity makes to the * gaining entity; or

                             (ii)  a right to a distribution of income or capital that the losing entity is to make to the gaining entity;

                            because the gaining entity holds * primary equity interests in the losing entity; and

                     (b)  either:

                              (i)  an amount covered by one or more of subsections (2), (3) and (4); or

                             (ii)  the total of 2 or more such amounts;

                            equals or exceeds the amount of the distribution.

Conditions

             (2)  This subsection covers an amount that the assessable income or exempt income of the gaining entity for any income year includes because of the distribution or right.

             (3)  This subsection covers an amount by which the * cost base or * reduced cost base (or both) of some or all of the * primary equity interests referred to in subsection (1) changes because of the distribution or right.

             (4)  This subsection covers an amount that, because of the distribution or right, is taken into account:

                     (a)  under section 116-20 in working out the * capital proceeds of a * CGT event that happens during any income year to some or all of the * primary equity interests referred to in subsection (1); or

                     (b)  in working out a * capital gain that an entity makes from CGT event E4 or G1 happening during any income year to some or all of those primary equity interests; or

                     (c)  in working out whether a loss or gain is * realised for income tax purposes by a * realisation event that happens to some or all of those primary equity interests (in their character as * trading stock or * revenue assets).

Application of section to deemed dividend

             (5)  If a * corporate tax entity makes a * distribution that is not otherwise a distribution of income or capital, this section applies as if the distribution were a distribution of income or capital the entity made.

Note:          Subsection (5) extends this section to cover something that is taken to be a dividend paid by a company. Compare item 1 of the table in subsection 960-120(1).

\[The next section is section 727-260.]

#### Miscellaneous

##### <a id="727-260"></a>727-260  Shift down a wholly-owned chain of entities

             (1)  An * indirect value shift does not have consequences under this Division if the * gaining entity is a * wholly-owned subsidiary of the * losing entity throughout the * IVS period.

Exception: impact on market value of primary loan interest

             (2)  However, subsection (1) does not apply if the * indirect value shift has produced a * disaggregated attributable decrease, in the market value of an * affected interest in the * losing entity that is also a * primary loan interest in an entity covered by subsection (3), for the owner of the interest.

             (3)  This subsection covers:

                     (a)  the * losing entity; and

                     (b)  an entity that owns * primary equity interests in an entity that this subsection covers because of one or more previous applications of it.

##### <a id="727-300"></a>727-300  What the rules in this Subdivision are for

                   This Subdivision is used in determining whether there has been an * indirect value shift and, if so:

                     (a)  whether it has consequences under this Division; and

                     (b)  if it does, the amount of it.

\[The next section is section 727-315.]

##### <a id="727-315"></a>727-315  Transfer, for its adjustable value, of depreciating asset acquired for less than $1,500,000

             (1)  This Division applies to an economic benefit consisting of:

                     (a)  an entity transferring to another entity a * depreciating asset (except a building or structure) for which the transferring entity has deducted or can deduct an amount under Division 40; or

                     (b)  a right to have an entity transfer such a depreciating asset to another entity;

as if the economic benefit’s market value were equal to the greater (the **_residual value_**) of:

                     (c)  the asset’s * adjustable value at the time when the economic benefit was or is * provided; and

                     (d)  the value assigned to the asset at that time in the transferring entity’s books;

but only if:

                     (e)  as at that time, the * cost of the unit to the transferring entity is less than $1,500,000; and

                      (f)  it is reasonable for the transferring entity to conclude that the unit’s actual market value at that time was, is, or will be, not less than 80%, and not more than 120%, of the residual value; and

                     (g)  both the transferring entity and the other entity choose to have the market value of that economic benefit treated as being equal to the residual value.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  each of 2 or more economic benefits of the kind mentioned in subsection (1) has been, is being, is to be, or might be, provided by the same transferring entity, to the same other entity, * in connection with the same * scheme; and

                     (b)  it is reasonable for the transferring entity to conclude that the total of the * depreciating assets’ actual market values at the respective times when the economic benefits were or are * provided was, is, or will be, not less than 80%, and not more than 120%, of the total of their respective residual values under subsection (1);

paragraph (1)(f) is taken to be satisfied for each of the economic benefits.

unless an entity (other than the first entity and its associates) either alone or together with its associates in fact controls the company.

Actual control test

             (3)  An entity also **_controls (for value shifting purposes)_** a company if the entity, either alone or together with its * associates, in fact controls the company.

Other tests

             (2)  An entity also **_controls (for value shifting purposes)_** a * fixed trust if:

                     (a)  the entity, or an * associate of the entity, whether alone or with other associates (the **_relevant entity_**), has the power to obtain the beneficial enjoyment of the trust’s capital or income (whether or not by exercising its power of appointment or revocation, and whether with or without another entity’s consent); or

                     (b)  the relevant entity is able to control the application of the trust’s capital or income in any manner (whether directly or indirectly); or

##### <a id="727-365"></a>727-365  _Control (for value shifting purposes)_ of a non-fixed trust

Trustee tests

             (1)  An entity **_controls (for value shifting purposes)_** a * non-fixed trust if:

                     (a)  the entity or an * associate of the entity is a trustee of the trust; or

                     (b)  the entity, or the entity and its * associates between them, can remove or appoint the trustee, or one or more of the trustees, of the trust; or

                             (ii)  2 or more entities, at least one of which is the entity or an associate of the entity.

Tests based on control of the trust income or capital

             (2)  An entity also **_controls (for value shifting purposes)_** a * non-fixed trust if the entity, or the entity and its * associates between them:

                     (a)  have the power to obtain the beneficial enjoyment of trust income or capital; or

                     (c)  can, under a * scheme, gain the enjoyment or control referred to in paragraph (a) or (b).

             (3)  An entity also **_controls (for value shifting purposes)_** a * non-fixed trust if:

                     (a)  the entity, or any of its * associates, can benefit under the trust otherwise than because of a * fixed entitlement to a share of the income or capital of the trust; or

                     (c)  the right to receive a distribution of capital of a company; or

                     (d)  the right to receive a distribution of trust income or trust capital;

is both direct and indirect, and (apart from this section) would be counted more than once in applying subsection 727-355(1) or (2) or section 727-360, only the direct interest is to be counted.

##### <a id="727-375"></a>727-375  Tests in this Subdivision are exhaustive

                   An entity does not **_control (for value shifting purposes)_** a company or trust except as provided in this Subdivision.

Additional condition about profile of percentage ultimate stakes held by 2 or more ultimate owners

             (2)  In order to satisfy the test in item 1, 2 or 3 in the table in subsection (1), at least one of subsections (3), (4) and (5) must be satisfied.

             (3)  For at least one of the * ultimate owners referred to in that item, the percentage of the * ultimate stake that owner has as mentioned in paragraph (a) in the last column of that item must be at least 40%, and so must the percentage of the ultimate stake that owner has as mentioned in paragraph (b) in the last column of that item.

             (4)  Alternatively, for _each_ of those * ultimate owners, the percentage of the * ultimate stake that owner has as mentioned in that paragraph (a) must be the same as the percentage of the ultimate stake that owner has as mentioned in that paragraph (b).

             (5)  Alternatively, the number of those * ultimate owners must not exceed 16.

##### <a id="727-405"></a>727-405  _Ultimate stake_ of a particular percentage in a company

             (1)  This section sets out 3 tests of whether an entity has an **_ultimate stake_** of a particular percentage (the **_test percentage_**) in a company.

Note:          In applying the tests, follow the rules in section 727-415.

Voting power

             (2)  The first test is that, after tracing, to the * ultimate owners who ultimately hold it, the direct and indirect ownership of all * shares in the company that carry the right to exercise voting power in the company, that ownership is held by the entity to the extent of the test percentage of that voting power.

Dividends

             (3)  The second test is that, after tracing, to the * ultimate owners who ultimately hold it, the direct and indirect ownership of all * shares in the company that carry the right to receive any dividends that the company may pay, that ownership is held by the entity to the extent of the test percentage of those dividends.

Capital distributions

             (4)  The third test is that, after tracing, to the * ultimate owners who ultimately hold it, the direct and indirect ownership of all * shares in the company that carry the right to receive any distribution of capital of the company, that ownership is held by the entity to the extent of the test percentage of the distribution.

Certain shares ignored

             (5)  In tracing the ownership of * shares in a company, ignore * shares whose * dividends can reasonably be regarded as being equivalent to the payment of interest on a loan having regard to:

                     (a)  how the dividends are calculated; and

                     (b)  the conditions applying to the payment of the dividends; and

                     (c)  any other relevant matters.

##### <a id="727-410"></a>727-410  _Ultimate stake_ of a particular percentage in a fixed trust

             (1)  This section sets out 2 tests of whether an entity has an **_ultimate stake_** of a particular percentage (the **_test percentage_**) in a * fixed trust.

Note:          In applying the tests, follow the rules in section 727-415.

Income distributions

             (2)  The first test is that, after tracing, to the * ultimate owners who ultimately hold them, the direct and indirect rights to receive distributions of trust income, those rights are held by the entity to the extent of the test percentage of each such distribution.

Capital distributions

             (3)  The second test is that, after tracing, to the * ultimate owners who ultimately hold them, the direct and indirect rights to receive distributions of trust capital, those rights are held by the entity to the extent of the test percentage of each such distribution.

##### <a id="727-415"></a>727-415  Rules for tracing

             (1)  In applying sections 727-400, 727-405 and 727-410, follow the rules in this section.

Interposed entities

             (2)  Tracing is to be done through any interposed entities.

Ownership or rights held jointly

             (3)  If some of the ownership or rights of a particular kind in relation to a company or trust are held by 2 or more entities jointly or in common, each of the entities is treated as holding a proportion of the ownership or rights so held. The proportion is to be worked out on a reasonable basis, so that the total of the proportions equals the total of the ownership or rights so held.

Ownership or rights held by associate

             (4)  If, at a particular time:

                     (a)  an * ultimate owner is an * associate of another ultimate owner; and

                     (b)  the associate ultimately holds some of the ownership or rights of a particular kind in relation to a company or trust;

then, in determining whether the other ultimate owner is one of 2 or more ultimate owners because of whom the conditions in an item in the table in section 727-400 are satisfied, the ownership or rights of that kind in relation to the company or trust held by the associate at that time:

                     (c)  to the extent of a particular percentage, may be treated as being instead held by the other ultimate owner; and

#### Operative provisions

##### <a id="727-455"></a>727-455  Consequences of the indirect value shift

                   The consequences (if any) of an * indirect value shift must be worked out using the * realisation time method unless the * adjustable value method is chosen in accordance with section 727-550.

Note:          Later provisions of this Subdivision set out the interests to which those consequences apply (see sections 727-460 to 727-525), which are in turn determined by who are the affected owners (see section 727-530).

#### Affected interests

##### <a id="727-460"></a>727-460  _Affected interests_ in the losing entity

                   These are the **_affected interests_** in the * losing entity:

                     (a)  each * equity or loan interest that an * affected owner owns in the losing entity immediately before the * IVS time; and

                     (b)  each equity or loan interest that:

                              (i)  an affected owner owns in another affected owner immediately before the IVS time; and

                             (ii)  is an * indirect equity or loan interest in the losing entity;

(except one covered by an exception in section 727-470).

##### <a id="727-465"></a>727-465  _Affected interests_ in the gaining entity

                   If immediately before the * IVS time the * gaining entity is a company or trust (except one listed in section 727-125 (about superannuation entities)), these are the **_affected interests_** in the gaining entity:

                     (a)  each * equity or loan interest that an * affected owner owns in the gaining entity immediately before the * IVS time; and

                     (b)  each equity or loan interest that:

                              (i)  an affected owner owns in another affected owner immediately before the IVS time; and

                             (ii)  is an * indirect equity or loan interest in the gaining entity.

(except one covered by an exception in section 727-470).

##### <a id="727-470"></a>727-470  Exceptions

Mere active participants

             (1)  An * equity or loan interest that an * active participant in the * scheme owns in another active participant immediately before the * IVS time is not an * affected interest in the * losing entity or in the * gaining entity unless one of the active participants is also covered by 1, 2, 3 or 4 in the table in subsection 727-530(1) (about who is an affected owner).

Entity that is eligible to be an STS taxpayer, or satisfies the maximum net asset value test for small business relief

             (2)  An * equity or loan interest that an entity (the **_owner_**) owns immediately before the * IVS time is not an * affected interest in the * losing entity or in the * gaining entity if the owner:

                     (a)  is eligible to be an * STS taxpayer for each income year that includes any of the * IVS period; or

                     (b)  would satisfy the maximum net asset value test in section 152-15 throughout the * IVS period.

             (3)  If the owner is not in existence for part of the * IVS period, disregard that part in applying subsection (2).

Interests in superannuation entities not covered

             (4)  An * equity or loan interest in an * affected owner is not an * affected interest in the * losing entity or in the * gaining entity if the affected owner is an entity listed in section 727-125 (about superannuation entities) in relation to the income year in which the * IVS time happens.

Choice binds all affected owners

             (4)  The choice binds all * affected owners for the * indirect value shift.

##### <a id="727-555"></a>727-555  Giving other affected owners information about the choice

             (1)  An entity that makes a choice under section 727-550 (including a choice made jointly with one or more other entities) must inform all entities that it knows to be * affected owners for the * indirect value shift about the content of the choice. The entity must do so in writing within one month after making the choice.

                    Penalty:  30 penalty units.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  a choice under section 727-550 is made jointly by 2 or more entities; and

                     (b)  one of the entities complies with subsection (1);

no other entity need comply with that subsection in relation to that choice.

             (3)  If an * affected owner for an * indirect value shift has reason to believe that an entity may have made a choice under section 727-550 (including a choice made jointly with one or more other entities), the affected owner may give the entity a written notice asking whether the entity has made such a choice.

             (4)  Within one month after receiving a notice under subsection (3), an entity must inform the * affected owner in writing whether the entity has made a choice under section 727-550 and, if so, about the content of the choice.

                    Penalty:  30 penalty units.

             (5)  The Commissioner may extend the period for complying with a provision of this section.

#### Operative provisions

##### <a id="727-610"></a>727-610  Consequences of indirect value shift

             (1)  This Subdivision sets out the **_realisation time method_** of working out the consequences (if any) of an * indirect value shift.

             (2)  If those consequences are to be worked out using that method, this Subdivision applies to each * realisation event:

                     (a)  by which a loss would, apart from this Division, be * realised for income tax purposes; and

                     (b)  that happens to an * affected interest in the * losing entity; and

                     (c)  that is the first realisation event that happens to that interest at or after the * IVS time; and

                     (d)  that happens:

                              (i)  if the amount of the indirect value shift is $500,000 or more—at any time after the IVS time; or

                             (ii)  otherwise—within 4 years after the IVS time.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  those consequences are to be worked out using that method; and

                     (b)  the * gaining entity is a company or trust (except one listed in section 727-125 (about superannuation entities)) immediately before the * IVS time;

this Subdivision applies to each * realisation event:

                     (c)  by which a gain would, apart from this Division, be *realised for income tax purposes; and

                     (d)  that happens to an * affected interest in the * gaining entity; and

                     (e)  that is the first realisation event that happens to that interest at or after the IVS time.

             (4)  The consequences for the * affected interest depend on its character. There are consequences for the interest in its character as a * CGT asset. However, if the interest is also * trading stock or a * revenue asset, there are additional consequences for it in that character.

             (5)  In working out the consequences for an * affected interest in the * losing entity or * gaining entity, in the interest’s character as * trading stock, a * realisation event is disregarded for the purposes of identifying under paragraph (2)(c) or (3)(e) the first realisation event that happens to that interest at or after the * IVS time, if:

                     (a)  the realisation event consists of the ending of an income year; and

                     (b)  the * value of the interest as trading stock on hand of an entity at the end of the income year is the interest’s * cost; and

                     (c)  the interest became part of the entity’s trading stock on hand during that income year, or the value of the interest as trading stock of the entity on hand at the start of the income year was also the interest’s cost.

##### <a id="727-615"></a>727-615  Reduction of loss on realisation event for affected interest in losing entity

                   If this Subdivision applies to a * realisation event that happens to an * affected interest in the * losing entity, a loss that would, apart from this Division, be * realised for income tax purposes by the event is reduced by an amount that is reasonable having regard to:

                     (a)  a reasonable estimate of the amount (if any) by which the * indirect value shift has reduced the interest’s market value; and

                     (b)  if the interest is also an affected interest in the * gaining entity—a reasonable estimate of the extent (if any) to which the interest’s market value at the time of the realisation event still reflects the effect of the indirect value shift on the market value of * equity or loan interests in the gaining entity.

##### <a id="727-620"></a>727-620  Reduction of gain on realisation event for affected interest in gaining entity

                   If this Subdivision applies to a * realisation event that happens to an * affected interest in the * gaining entity, a gain that would, apart from this Division, be * realised for income tax purposes by the event is reduced by an amount that is reasonable having regard to:

                     (a)  a reasonable estimate of the amount (if any) by which the * indirect value shift has increased the interest’s market value; and

                     (b)  a reasonable estimate of the extent (if any) to which the interest’s market value at the time of the realisation event still reflects the effect of the indirect value shift on the market value of * equity or loan interests in the gaining entity.

##### <a id="727-625"></a>727-625  Total gain reductions not to exceed total loss reductions

             (1)  This section ensures that the total (**_total gain reductions_**) of the amounts by which section 727-620 reduces gains * realised for income tax purposes by * realisation events happening at the same time does not exceed the total (**_total loss reductions_**) of:

                     (a)  the amounts by which section 727-615 reduces losses that:

                              (i)  would, apart from this Division, be * realised for income tax purposes by * realisation events happening before or at that time; and

                     (b)  the amounts by which section 727-850 (as applying to the * scheme from which the * indirect value shift results) reduces losses that:

                              (i)  would, apart from this Division, be realised for income tax purposes by realisation events happening before the * IVS time to * equity or loan interests, or * indirect equity or loan interests, in the * losing entity; and

                             (ii)  have not already been taken into account in a previous application of this section.

             (2)  If, apart from this section, the total gain reductions would exceed the total loss reductions, the amount by which section 727-620 reduces each of the gains is itself reduced by the amount worked out using this formula:

##### <a id="727-630"></a>727-630  How cap in section 727-625 applies if affected interest is also trading stock or a revenue asset

             (1)  This section affects how to work out the total gain reductions and the total loss reductions for the purposes of section 727-625 if:

                     (a)  a * realisation event covered by that section happens to an * equity or loan interest, or to an * indirect equity or loan interest, in the * losing entity or in the * gaining entity; and

                     (b)  the interest is also * trading stock or a * revenue asset at the time of the event.

Trading stock

             (2)  In the case of an * equity or loan interest, or an * indirect equity or loan interest, in the * losing entity that is * trading stock at that time:

                     (a)  the amount (if any) by which section 727-615 or 727-850 reduces a loss worked out under section 977-25 or 977-30 (about realisation events for trading stock) that would, apart from this Division, be * realised for income tax purposes by the event is taken into account; and

                     (b)  the amount (if any) by which section 727-615 or 727-850 reduces a loss worked out under section 977-10 (about realisation events for CGT assets) that would, apart from this Division, be * realised for income tax purposes by the event is _not_ taken into account;

in working out the total loss reductions.

             (3)  In the case of an * affected interest in the * gaining entity that is * trading stock at that time:

                     (a)  the amount (if any) by which section 727-620 reduces a gain worked out under section 977-35 or 977-40 (about realisation events for trading stock) that would, apart from this Division, be * realised for income tax purposes by the event is taken into account; and

                     (b)  the amount (if any) by which section 727-620 reduces a gain worked out under section 977-15 (about realisation events for CGT assets) that would, apart from this Division, be * realised for income tax purposes by the event is _not_ taken into account;

in working out the total gain reductions.

Revenue asset

             (4)  In the case of an * equity or loan interest, or an * indirect equity or loan interest, in the * losing entity that is a * revenue asset at that time, the greater of the following is taken into account in working out the total loss reductions:

                     (a)  the amount (if any) by which section 727-615 or 727-850 reduces a loss worked out under section 977-55 (about realisation events for revenue assets) that would, apart from this Division, be * realised for income tax purposes by the event;

                     (b)  the amount (if any) by which section 727-615 or 727-850 reduces a loss worked out under section 977-10 (about realisation events for CGT assets) that would, apart from this Division, be * realised for income tax purposes by the event.

             (5)  In the case of an * affected interest in the * gaining entity that is a * revenue asset at that time, the greater of the following amounts is taken into account in working out the total gain reductions:

                     (a)  the amount (if any) by which section 727-620 reduces a gain worked out under section 977-55 (about realisation events for revenue assets) that would, apart from this Division, be * realised for income tax purposes by the event;

                     (b)  the amount (if any) by which section 727-620 reduces a gain worked out under section 977-15 (about realisation events for CGT assets) that would, apart from this Division, be * realised for income tax purposes by the event.

##### <a id="727-635"></a>727-635  Splitting an equity or loan interest

                   If an * equity or loan interest in the * losing entity or in the * gaining entity is split into 2 or more equity or loan interests at or after the * IVS time:

                     (a)  each of the 2 or more interests inherits whatever characteristics would have been relevant to applying this Subdivision to the first interest if the split had not happened; and

                     (b)  those characteristics include characteristics the first interest has inherited because of any other application or applications of this section or section 727-640; and

                     (c)  if a characteristic of the first interest involves an amount or quantity, the amount or quantity for that characteristic as inherited by each of the 2 or more interests is a reasonable proportion of the amount or quantity for that characteristic of the first interest.

##### <a id="727-640"></a>727-640  Merging equity or loan interests

                   If 2 or more * equity or loan interests (the **_original interests_**) in the * losing entity or in the * gaining entity are merged into 1 or more * equity or loan interests (the **_new interests_**) at or after the * IVS time:

                     (a)  each of the new interests inherits whatever characteristics would have been relevant to applying this Subdivision to the original interests if the merging had not happened; and

                     (b)  those characteristics include characteristics inherited by any of the original interests because of any other application or applications of this section or section 727-635; and

                     (c)  if a characteristic of any of the original interests involves an amount or quantity, the amount or quantity for that characteristic as inherited by any of the new interests is a reasonable proportion of the amount or quantity for that characteristic of the original interest.

##### <a id="727-645"></a>727-645  Effect of CGT roll-over

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  this Subdivision applies to a * realisation event that is a * CGT event that happens to an * affected interest in the * losing entity; and

                     (b)  section 727-615 reduces a loss that would, apart from this Division, be * realised for income tax purposes by the CGT event; and

                     (c)  there is a roll-over for the CGT event;

the interest’s * reduced cost base at the time of the CGT event is taken to have been reduced by the amount by which section 727-615 reduces that loss, but is so taken only for the purposes of working out:

                     (d)  the interest’s reduced cost base, from time to time after the roll-over, for the entity that * acquired the interest because of the CGT event; and

                     (e)  in the case of a * replacement-asset roll-over—the reduced cost base of the replacement CGT asset, from time to time after the roll-over, for the entity that * disposed of the interest.

Note:          Because of the roll-over, the loss reduction under section 727-615 will have no tax effect. This subsection ensures that the loss reduction is passed on, through the reduction in reduced cost base, to prevent or reduce a loss arising on a later CGT event.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  this Subdivision applies to a * realisation event that is a * CGT event that happens to an * affected interest in the * gaining entity; and

                     (b)  section 727-620 reduces a gain that would, apart from this Division, be * realised for income tax purposes by the CGT event; and

                     (c)  there is a roll-over for the CGT event;

the interest’s * cost base at the time of the CGT event is taken to have been uplifted by the amount by which section 727-620 reduces that gain, but is so taken only for the purposes of working out:

                     (d)  the interest’s cost base, from time to time after the roll-over, for the entity that * acquired the interest because of the CGT event; and

                     (e)  in the case of a * replacement-asset roll-over—the cost base of the replacement CGT asset, from time to time after the roll-over, for the entity that * disposed of the interest.

Note:          Because of the roll-over, the gain reduction under section 727-620 will have no tax effect. This subsection ensures that the gain reduction is passed on, through the uplift in cost base, to prevent or reduce a gain arising on a later CGT event.

#### Further exclusion for certain 95% services indirect value shifts if realisation time method must be used

##### <a id="727-700"></a>727-700  When 95% services indirect value shift is excluded

             (1)  If the * indirect value shift is a * 95% services indirect value shift, this Subdivision does not apply to a * realisation event that:

                     (a)  happens to an * affected interest in the * losing entity that is owned by an entity (the **_owner_**); and

                     (b)  is covered by subsection 727-610(2);

unless:

                     (c)  the conditions in section 727-705 are met for the indirect value shift; or

                     (d)  the conditions in section 727-710, 727-715 or 727-720 are met for the indirect value shift and for that realisation event.

             (2)  An * indirect value shift is a **_95% services indirect value shift_** if, and only if, to the extent of at least 95% of their total market value, the * greater benefits consist entirely of:

                     (a)  a right to have services that are covered by section 727-240 provided directly by the * losing entity to the * gaining entity; or

                     (b)  services that are covered by section 727-240 and have been, are being, or are to be, so provided;

or both.

             (3)  This section does not limit any other exclusion in this Subdivision or in Subdivision 727-C.

#### 95% services indirect value shifts that are _not_ excluded

##### <a id="727-705"></a>727-705  Another provision of the income tax law affects amount related to services by at least $100,000

                   The conditions in this section are met if:

                     (a)  the * losing entity or the * gaining entity lodges an * income tax return for an income year during some or all of which the owner owned the interest; and

                     (b)  a provision of this Act:

                              (i)  reduces or excludes an amount that is included in the return; or

                             (ii)  increases an amount that is so included; or

                            (iii)  includes an amount not included in the return;

                            for the purposes of working out the taxable income, a * tax loss, or a * net capital loss, of that entity for that income year; and

                     (c)  the amount is related to the right mentioned in paragraph 727-700(2)(a), or to some or all of the services mentioned in paragraph 727-700(2)(a) or (b), from the point of view of the losing entity providing the services or of the gaining entity receiving them; and

                     (d)  if the amount is so reduced or increased—the reduction or increase is at least $100,000; and

                     (e)  if the amount is so excluded or included—the amount is at least $100,000; and

                      (f)  at some time after the return is lodged, the entity that lodged it is aware, or ought reasonably to be aware, of the reduction, exclusion, increase or inclusion.

Example:    If the Commissioner has notified an entity affected by a determination under Part IVA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, the entity ought reasonably to be aware of the effect of the determination.

##### <a id="727-710"></a>727-710  Ongoing or recent service arrangement reduces value of losing entity by at least $100,000

             (1)  Either or both of these must be true:

                     (a)  when the * realisation event mentioned in subsection 727-700(1) happens, some or all of the services mentioned in paragraph 727-700(2)(a) or (b) have not yet been provided; or

                     (b)  some or all of those services have been provided in the income year (of the * losing entity) in which the realisation event happens, or in the previous income year.

             (2)  It must be reasonable to conclude that the total (the **_total market value_**) of the market values, immediately before the * realisation event, of * primary interests in the * losing entity then owned by * affected owners is less than it would have been if none of the following had happened:

                     (a)  the * 95% services indirect value shift; and

                     (b)  all other * predominantly-services indirect value shifts that satisfy subsection (1) (or that would satisfy it if they were * 95% services indirect value shifts).

             (3)  It must also be reasonable to conclude that the total market value is less than it would have been by at least:

                     (a)  $100,000, if the total of the * adjustable values, immediately before the * realisation event, of the * primary interests referred to in subsection (2) is less than or equal to $2,000,000; or

                     (b)  5% of the total of those * adjustable values, if that total is greater than $2,000,000 and less than or equal to $10,000,000; or

                     (c)  $500,000, if that total is greater than $10,000,000.

             (4)  For the purposes of subsections (2) and (3), disregard an * indirect value shift referred to in paragraph (2)(a) or (b) if services are provided directly by the * losing entity to the * gaining entity under the * scheme before the income year (of the losing entity) before the one in which the * realisation event happened.

##### <a id="727-715"></a>727-715  Service arrangements reduce value of losing entity that _is_ a group service provider by at least $500,000

             (1)  At some time during the period (the **_ownership period_**) when the owner owned the interest, the sole or dominant activity of the * losing entity must consist of providing services directly to one or more entities (the **_group entities_**) each of which is covered by one or more of the following paragraphs:

                     (a)  the * gaining entity;

                     (b)  an * affected owner;

                     (c)  an entity that has at that time the same * ultimate controller as the losing entity or the gaining entity;

                     (d)  if the conditions in section 727-110 (common-ownership nexus test) are satisfied for the * indirect value shift—an entity that has with the losing entity or with the gaining entity a * common-ownership nexus within that period.

             (2)  It must be reasonable to conclude that the total (the **_total market value_**) of the market values, immediately before the * realisation event, of * primary interests in the * losing entity then owned by * affected owners is less than it would have been if none of the following had happened:

                     (a)  the * 95% services indirect value shift; and

                     (b)  each * predominantly-services indirect value shift for which the same entity is the losing entity as for the 95% services indirect value shift, and that happened:

                              (i)  if the amount of the * indirect value shift is $500,000 or more—at any time during the ownership period; or

                             (ii)  otherwise—during the ownership period but within 4 years before the realisation event, or at the same time as the realisation event.

Thresholds for reduction of the total market value

             (3)  It must also be reasonable to conclude that the total market value is less than it would have been by at least $500,000, and by at least the lesser of:

                     (a)  5% of the total of the * adjustable values of * primary interests in the * losing entity owned by * affected owners at:

                              (i)  if subsection (4) applies—the time determined under that subsection; or

                             (ii)  otherwise—the start of the income year in which the * realisation event happens; and

                     (b)  the amount worked out under the table.

             (4)  If the owner of the interest is an * affected owner because of item 1, 2, 3 or 4 in the table in subsection 727-530(1) (about who is an affected owner), the time for the purposes of subparagraph (3)(a)(i) of this section is the latest of:

                     (b)  the most recent time (if any), before or at the time of the * realisation event, when at least one of the group entities has the same * ultimate controller as the losing entity or the gaining entity; and

##### <a id="727-720"></a>727-720  Abnormal service arrangement reduces value of losing entity that is _not_ a group service provider by at least $500,000

             (1)  It must be the case that at _no_ time during the period when the owner owned the interest did the sole or dominant activity of the * losing entity consist of providing services as mentioned in subsection 727-715(1).

             (2)  It must be reasonable to conclude that the total (the **_total market value_**) of the market values, immediately before the * realisation event, of * primary interests in the * losing entity then owned by * affected owners is less than it would have been if none of the following had happened:

                     (a)  the * 95% services indirect value shift;

                     (b)  each * predominantly-services indirect value shift that meets either of these conditions:

                              (i)  its amount was less than $500,000 and it happened within 4 years before the realisation event, or at the same time as the realisation event;

                             (ii)  its amount was $500,000 or more and it happened at any time before the realisation event, or at the same time as the realisation event;

                            and that meets all of these conditions:

                            (iii)  the same entity is the losing entity for it as for the 95% services indirect value shift;

                            (iv)  it happened under a different * scheme from the 95% services indirect value shift; and

                             (v)  having regard to all relevant circumstances, it is reasonable to conclude that the sole or main reason why it happened under a different scheme was to prevent the conditions in section 727-705, 727-710, 727-715 or this section from being met.

             (3)  It must also be reasonable to conclude that the total market value is less than it would have been by at least:

                     (a)  $500,000, if the total of the * adjustable values, immediately before the * realisation event, of the * primary interests referred to in subsection (2) is less than or equal to $10,000,000; or

##### <a id="727-755"></a>727-755  Consequences of indirect value shift

             (1)  This Subdivision sets out the **_adjustable value method_** of working out the consequences (if any) of an * indirect value shift.

             (2)  If those consequences are to be worked out using that method:

                     (a)  the * adjustable value of each * affected interest in the * losing entity is reduced as provided in this Subdivision; and

                     (b)  if the * gaining entity is a company or trust (except one listed in section 727-125 (about superannuation entities)) immediately before the * IVS time, the * adjustable value of each * affected interest in the * gaining entity is uplifted as provided in this Subdivision.

             (3)  The consequences for the * affected interest depend on its character. There are consequences for the interest in its character as a * CGT asset. However, if the interest is also * trading stock or a * revenue asset, there are additional consequences for it in that character.

\[The next section is section 727-770.]

#### Reductions of adjustable value

##### <a id="727-770"></a>727-770  Reduction under the adjustable value method

             (1)  This section sets out how to work out the amount (if any) by which the * adjustable value of an * affected interest in the * losing entity is reduced.

             (2)  First, work out under section 727-775 whether the * indirect value shift has produced for the owner of the interest a * disaggregated attributable decrease in the market value of the interest.

             (3)  If it has not, the interest’s * adjustable value is _not_ reduced because of the * indirect value shift.

             (4)  If it has, the amount (if any) by which the interest’s * adjustable value is reduced is worked out on a * loss-focussed basis under section 727-780.

             (5)  However, if a choice is made in accordance with section 727-550 for the reduction _not_ to be worked out on a * loss-focussed basis, the reduction is equal to the * disaggregated attributable decrease.

Reduction not to exceed reasonable amount

             (6)  If the reduction worked out as provided in subsection (4) or (5) is not reasonable in the circumstances, having regard to the objects of this Division, the interest’s * adjustable value is instead reduced by so much of that reduction as is reasonable in the circumstances, having regard to those objects.

Note:          The main object of this Division is set out in section 727-95.

##### <a id="727-775"></a>727-775  Has there been a disaggregated attributable decrease?

             (1)  This section sets out how to determine whether an * indirect value shift has produced, for the owner of an * equity or loan interest, a **_disaggregated attributable decrease_** in the market value of the interest and, if so, the amount of it.

             (2)  Work out the market value of the interest at the * IVS time, but disregarding:

                     (a)  all effects on the market value of the interest during the * IVS period, except effects that are reasonably attributable to the * indirect value shift; and

                     (b)  the effects (if any) of the indirect value shift on the market value of * equity or loan interests, or * indirect equity or loan interests, in the gaining entity.

(This result is called the **_notional resulting market value_**.)

Note:          Paragraph (2)(b) is necessary because the market value of the interest may also have been affected by the increase in the market value of interests in the gaining entity, because the entity in which the interest is held had direct or indirect interests in both the losing entity and the gaining entity.

                   In such a case, the reduction in adjustable value under this Division will usually be offset by an uplift under this Division.

             (3)  If the notional resulting market value is _less than_ the market value (the **_old market value_**) of the interest:

                     (a)  at the start of the * IVS period; or

                     (b)  if the owner last began to own the interest during that period—when the owner last began to own the interest;

the difference is the **_disaggregated attributable decrease_**.

             (4)  The * indirect value shift has _not_ produced a disaggregated attributable decrease for the owner of the interest if the notional resulting market value is _greater than or equal to_the old market value.

             (5)  The market value of the interest at a particular time may be worked out under subsection (2) or (3) by making a reasonable estimate of that market value.

##### <a id="727-780"></a>727-780  Working out the reduction on a _loss-focussed basis_

             (1)  Use the table in subsection (2) of this section to work out on a **_loss-focussed basis_** the amount (if any) by which the interest’s * adjustable value is reduced.

             (2)  This involves comparing the old market value, and the notional resulting market value, with the interest’s * adjustable value (the **_old adjustable value_**) immediately before the * IVS time.

Note 1:       Because of item 1, the indirect value shift cannot cause a loss to arise on disposal of the interest.

Note 2:       Because of item 3 the loss already embedded in the interest is preserved, but the indirect value shift does not increase it.

\[The next section is section 727-800.]

#### Uplifts of adjustable value

##### <a id="727-800"></a>727-800  Uplift under the attributable increase method

             (1)  This section sets out how to work out the amount (if any) by which the * adjustable value of an * affected interest in the * gaining entity is uplifted.

             (2)  First, work out under section 727-805 whether the * indirect value shift has produced for the owner of the interest a * disaggregated attributable increase in the market value of the interest.

             (3)  If it has not, the interest’s * adjustable value is _not_ uplifted because of the * indirect value shift.

             (4)  If it has, the * adjustable value is uplifted by the amount worked out using the scaling-down formula in section 727-810, subject to the rest of this section.

Note:          The uplift will be less than or equal to the disaggregated attributable increase.

Cap if interest has both a disaggregated attributable increase and a disaggregated attributable decrease

             (5)  If the * indirect value shift has also produced for the owner of the interest a * disaggregated attributable decrease in the market value of the interest, the interest’s * adjustable value:

                     (a)  is _not_ uplifted if it is not also reduced under this Division because of the indirect value shift; and

                     (b)  if it is also reduced under this Division because of the indirect value shift—is not uplifted by more than the reduction.

Cap based on notional distribution by gaining entity of dividends or capital equal to total reductions in adjustable value of affected interests in losing entity

             (6)  However, the interest’s * adjustable value is not uplifted by more than the greater of these amounts:

                     (a)  the amount (if any) that the * affected owner of the interest would receive (directly, or indirectly through one or more interposed entities) in respect of the interest if:

                              (i)  the * gaining entity were to pay as * dividends, at the time (the **_payment time_**) immediately before the * IVS time, an amount (the **_total reduction amount_**) equal to the total of the amounts by which the * adjustable values of * equity or loan interests in the * losing entity are reduced under this Subdivision because of the * indirect value shift; and

                             (ii)  those dividends were successively paid or distributed at the payment time by each entity interposed between the gaining entity and that affected owner; and

                     (b)  the amount (if any) that the * affected owner of the interest would receive (directly, or indirectly through one or more interposed entities) in respect of the interest if:

                              (i)  the gaining entity were to pay the total reduction amount at the payment time as a distribution of capital; and

                             (ii)  that capital was successively paid or distributed at the payment time by each entity interposed between the gaining entity and that affected owner.

Uplift not to exceed reasonable amount

             (7)  If the uplift worked out as provided in subsections (4), (5) and (6) is not reasonable in the circumstances, having regard to the objects of this Division, the interest’s * adjustable value is instead uplifted by an amount that is reasonable in the circumstances, having regard to those objects.

Note:          The main object of this Division is set out in section 727-95.

##### <a id="727-805"></a>727-805  Has there been a disaggregated attributable increase?

             (1)  This section sets out how to determine whether an * indirect value shift has produced, for the owner of an * equity or loan interest, a **_disaggregated attributable increase_** in the market value of the interest and, if so, the amount of it.

             (2)  Make a reasonable estimate of the market value of the interest at the * IVS time, but disregarding:

                     (a)  all effects on the market value of the interest during the * IVS period, except effects that are reasonably attributable to the * indirect value shift; and

                     (b)  the effects (if any) of the indirect value shift on the market value of * equity or loan interests, or * indirect equity or loan interests, in the losing entity.

(This result is called the **_notional resulting market value_**.)

Note:          Paragraph (2)(b) is necessary because the market value of the interest may also have been affected by the decrease in the market value of interests in the losing entity, because the entity in which the interest is held had direct or indirect interests in both the losing entity and the gaining entity.

                   In such a case, the increase in adjustable value under this Division will usually be offset by a reduction under this Division.

             (3)  If the notional resulting market value is _greater than_ a reasonable estimate of the market value (the **_old market value_**) of the interest:

                     (a)  at the start of the * IVS period; or

                     (b)  if the owner last began to own the interest during that period—when the owner last began to own the interest;

the difference is the **_disaggregated attributable increase_**.

             (4)  The * indirect value shift has _not_ produced a disaggregated attributable increase for the owner of the interest if the notional resulting market value is _less than or equal to_the old market value.

##### <a id="727-810"></a>727-810  Scaling-down formula

             (1)  The scaling-down formula for the purposes of section 727-800 is:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00500/Html/NBTSConsolValueShiftDemergOtherMeasures2002_image025.gif)

Note:          The numerator in the fraction can never exceed the denominator. This means that the fraction can never exceed 1, so the uplift will never exceed the disaggregated attributable increase.

             (2)  For the purposes of the formula:

                    <a name="total-disaggreg-attribut-decreas"></a>**_total disaggregated attributable decreases_** means the total of:

                     (a)  all * disaggregated attributable decreases that the * indirect value shift has produced, in the market values of * affected interests in the * losing entity, for the entities that owned those interests immediately before the * IVS time; and

                     (b)  if:

                              (i)  section 727-850 (as applying to the * scheme from which the indirect value shift results) reduces losses that are * realised for income tax purposes by * realisation events happening before the * IVS time to * equity or loan interests, or to * indirect equity or loan interests, in the losing entity; and

                             (ii)  the indirect value shift is the only indirect value shift, or is the greater or greatest of 2 or more indirect value shifts, that results from the scheme and for which the losing entity is the losing entity;

                            for each of those realisation events, the amounts that would, if:

                            (iii)  the * presumed indirect value shift were an indirect value shift; and

                            (iv)  the IVS time for the presumed indirect value shift were the time of that realisation event;

                            be the disaggregated attributable decreases that the presumed indirect value shift has produced, in the market value of the equity or loan interests to which that realisation event happened, for the entities that owned those interests immediately before the time of that realisation event.

                    <a name="total-ruction-affected-interest"></a>**_total reductions for affected interests_** means the total of:

                     (a)  all reductions under this Division, because of the indirect value shift, of * adjustable values of affected interests in the losing entity; and

                     (b)  if paragraph (b) of the definition of **_total disaggregated attributable decreases_** applies—the amounts by which section 727-850 reduces the losses (if any) referred to in that paragraph.

\[The next section is section 727-830.]

#### Consequences of the method for various kinds of assets

##### <a id="727-830"></a>727-830  CGT assets

             (1)  The * cost base of an * equity or loan interest is reduced or uplifted immediately before the * IVS time to the extent that this Division provides for the * adjustable value of the interest to be reduced or uplifted.

             (2)  The * reduced cost base of an * equity or loan interest is reduced or uplifted immediately before the * IVS time to the extent that this Division provides for the * adjustable value of the interest to be reduced or uplifted.

             (3)  However, the * cost base or * reduced cost base is _uplifted_ only to the extent that the amount of the uplift is still reflected in the market value of the interest when a later * CGT event happens to the interest.

             (4)  To work out:

                     (a)  whether the * cost base or * reduced cost base of the interest is reduced or uplifted; and

                     (b)  if so, by how much;

assume that the **_adjustable value_** from time to time of that or any other * equity or loan interest is its cost base or reduced cost base, as appropriate.

             (5)  If this Division provides for the * adjustable value of an * equity or loan interest to be _both_ reduced and uplifted:

                     (a)  the reduction and uplift for which subsection (1) or (2) of this section provides offset each other to the extent of whichever of them is the lesser; but

                     (b)  if subsection (3) of this section cancels or reduces the uplift, this subsection is taken always to have applied on that basis.

Reductions and uplifts also apply to pre-CGT assets

             (6)  A reduction or uplift occurs regardless of whether the entity that owns the interest * acquired it before, on or after 20 September 1985.

##### <a id="727-835"></a>727-835  Trading stock

             (1)  This section deals with:

                     (a)  how this Division applies to an * equity or loan interest that is * trading stock of an entity at the time (the **_adjustment time_**) immediately before the * IVS time; and

                     (b)  the income tax consequences of this Division reducing or uplifting the * adjustable value of the interest.

             (2)  The interest’s **_adjustable value_** at a particular time is:

                     (a)  if the interest has been * trading stock of the entity ever since the start of the income year of the entity in which that time occurs—its * value as trading stock at the start of the income year; or

                     (b)  otherwise—its cost.

             (3)  If this Division reduces or uplifts the interest’s * adjustable value, the entity is treated as if:

                     (a)  immediately before the adjustment time, the entity had sold the interest to someone else (at * arm’s length and in the ordinary course of business) for its * adjustable value immediately before that time; and

                     (b)  immediately after the adjustment time, the entity had bought the interest back for the reduced or uplifted adjustable value.

Note:          The notional sale and repurchase are separated in time. As a result, if this section is applied to another indirect value shift that happens later in the same income year, the interest’s adjustable value will be the cost on the notional repurchase: see paragraph (2)(b).

             (4)  However, the increase in the cost of an interest because of paragraph (3)(b) is taken into account from time to time only to the extent that the amount of the increase is still reflected in the market value of the interest.

Note:          The situations where the increase in cost would be taken into account include:

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>in working out your deductions for the cost of trading stock acquired during the income year in which the increase happens; and

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>the end of an income year if the interest’s closing value as trading stock is worked out on the basis of its cost; and

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>the start of the income year in which the interest is disposed of, if that happens in a later income year and the interest’s closing value as trading stock at the end of the previous income year was worked out on the basis of its cost.

             (5)  If this Division provides for the * adjustable value of the interest to be _both_ reduced and uplifted:

                     (a)  the reduction and uplift offset each other to the extent of whichever of them is the lesser, and subsection (3) of this section applies accordingly; but

                     (b)  to the extent that the amount of the uplift is no longer reflected in the market value of the interest, this section is taken always to have applied on the basis that the amount of the uplift was reduced to the same extent.

##### <a id="727-840"></a>727-840  Revenue assets

             (1)  This section deals with:

                     (a)  how this Division applies to an * equity or loan interest that is a * revenue asset of an entity at the time (the **_adjustment time_**) immediately before the * IVS time; and

                     (b)  the income tax consequences of this Division reducing or uplifting the * adjustable value of the interest.

             (2)  The interest’s **_adjustable value_** at a particular time is the total of the amounts that would be subtracted from the gross disposal proceeds in calculating any profit or loss on disposal of the interest if the entity disposed of it at that time.

             (3)  If this Division reduces or uplifts the interest’s * adjustable value, the entity is treated as if:

                     (a)  immediately before the adjustment time, the entity had sold the interest to someone else (at * arm’s length and in the ordinary course of business) for its adjustable value immediately before that time; and

                     (b)  immediately after the adjustment time, the entity had bought the interest back for the reduced or uplifted adjustable value.

Note:          The notional sale and repurchase are separated in time. As a result, if this section is applied to another indirect value shift that happens later in the same income year, the interest’s adjustable value will be based on the cost on the notional repurchase: see subsection (2).

             (4)  However, an uplift in the * adjustable value of the interest is taken into account only to the extent that the amount of the uplift is still reflected in the market value of the interest when it is disposed of or otherwise realised.

             (5)  If this Division provides for the * adjustable value of the interest to be _both_ reduced and uplifted:

                     (a)  the reduction and uplift offset each other to the extent of whichever of them is the lesser, and subsection (3) of this section applies accordingly; but

                     (b)  to the extent that the amount of the uplift is no longer reflected in the market value of the interest, this section is taken always to have applied on the basis that the amount of the uplift was reduced to the same extent.

##### <a id="727-850"></a>727-850  Consequences of scheme under this Subdivision

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  as at the time when a * scheme is entered into, or a later time, an entity (the **_prospective losing entity_**) has * provided, is providing, is to provide, or might provide, one or more economic benefits * in connection with the scheme; and

                     (b)  the prospective losing entity is a company or trust (except one listed in section 727-125 (about superannuation entities)); and

                     (c)  a * realisation event happens to an * equity or loan interest, or to an * indirect equity or loan interest, in the prospective losing entity at a time when no * IVS time for the scheme has yet happened (whether or not one happens later); and

                     (d)  apart from this Division, a loss would be * realised for income tax purposes by the realisation event; and

                     (e)  because of section 727-855, the scheme results in a * presumed indirect value shift affecting the realisation event; and

                      (f)  section 727-860 (about prospective gaining entities) is satisfied; and

                     (g)  no exclusion in Subdivision 727-C applies to the presumed indirect value shift because of section 727-865; and

                     (h)  on the assumptions set out in subsection 727-865(3), the interest would be an * affected interest in the prospective losing entity;

the loss is reduced by an amount that is reasonable having regard to a reasonable estimate of the amount (if any) by which the scheme has reduced the interest’s market value during the period that ends at the time of the realisation event and started at the later of:

                      (i)  when the scheme was entered into; and

                      (j)  the time of the last realisation event that happened to the interest.

Note 1:       This Subdivision does not reduce gains from realisation events, but loss reductions under this Subdivision are taken into account in working out:

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>gain reductions under Subdivision 727-G for interests in a gaining entity that are realised after the IVS time for the scheme (see section 727-625); or

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>uplifts under Subdivision 727-H in the adjustable values of interests in a gaining entity (see section 727-810).

Note 2:       Section 727-865 provides for how other provisions of this Division apply for the purposes of this Subdivision.

Further exclusion for certain 95% services indirect value shifts

             (2)  The loss is not reduced if the * presumed indirect value shift is a * 95% services indirect value shift because of subsection 727-865(2), unless:

                     (a)  the conditions in section 727-705 (as applying because of that subsection) are met for the presumed indirect value shift; or

                     (b)  the conditions in section 727-710, 727-715 or 727-720 (as applying because of that subsection) are met for the presumed indirect value shift and for the realisation event.

##### <a id="727-855"></a>727-855  Presumed indirect value shift

             (1)  The * scheme results in a **_presumed indirect value shift_** affecting the * realisation event if, and only if, as at the time of the realisation event, it is reasonable to conclude that the total market value of the economic benefits (the **_greater benefits_**) that:

                     (a)  the * prospective losing entity has * provided, is providing, is to provide, or might provide, * in connection with the * scheme, to another entity, or to each of 2 or more other entities; and

                     (b)  can be identified (even if the other entity or entities cannot be identified or are not all in existence, or the provision of some or all of the economic benefits is contingent);

exceeds:

                     (c)  the total market value of the economic benefits (the **_lesser benefits_**) that:

                              (i)  have been, are being, are to be, or might be, provided _to_ the prospective losing entity in connection with the scheme; and

                             (ii)  can be identified (even if the entity or entities providing the benefits cannot be identified or are not all in existence, or the provision of some or all of the economic benefits is contingent); or

                     (d)  if there are no economic benefits covered by paragraph (c)—nil.

That excess is the amount of the presumed indirect value shift, which happens at the time of the realisation event.

             (2)  The market value of an economic benefit is to be determined as at the earliest time when it is reasonable to conclude that:

                     (a)  the economic benefit can be identified; and

                     (b)  paragraph 727-150(2)(b) is satisfied for that benefit;

if that time is before the * realisation event.

             (3)  Otherwise, the market value of the economic benefit is to be determined as at the time immediately before the * realisation event, taking account of any contingency to which provision of the benefit is subject at that time.

For more rules affecting how the market value of an economic benefit is determined, see Subdivision 727-D (as applying because of
 subsection 727-865(1)).

             (4)  An entity referred to in paragraph (1)(a) need not be a party to the * scheme. A benefit can be provided by act or omission.

##### <a id="727-860"></a>727-860  Conditions about the prospective gaining entity

             (1)  By the deadline set out in subsection (5), the conditions in subsections (2) and (3) must be satisfied for at least one of these entities:

                     (a)  the entity or entities referred to in paragraph 727-855(1)(a);

                     (b)  if at the time of the * realisation event it is reasonable to conclude that the entity, or at least one of the entities, referred to in paragraph 727-855(1)(a) will be one of 2 or more entities, but it cannot be determined which—those 2 or more entities.

             (2)  Enough must be known about the identity of an entity covered by subsection (1) for it to be reasonable to conclude that, if:

                     (a)  the * presumed indirect value shift were an * indirect value shift resulting from the * scheme; and

                     (b)  the * IVS period for the scheme ended at the time of the * realisation event; and

                     (c)  that entity were the * gaining entity for the indirect value shift;

                     (d)  the * prospective losing entity were the * losing entity for the indirect value shift; and

either or both of these would be satisfied for the indirect value shift:

                     (e)  section 727-105 (Ultimate controller test); and

                      (f)  section 727-110 (Common-ownership nexus test).

             (3)  Enough must be known about the identity of the entity referred to in subsection (2) for it also to be reasonable to conclude that, in relation to either or both of the following:

                     (a)  the * prospective losing entity * providing one or more economic benefits to that entity * in connection with the * scheme; or

                     (b)  that entity providing one or more economic benefits to the prospective losing entity in connection with the scheme;

that entity and the prospective losing entity were not, are not, will not be, or would not be, dealing with each other at * arm’s length.

             (4)  Each entity that is covered by subsection (1), and for which subsections (2) and (3) are satisfied, is called a **_prospective gaining entity_** for the * scheme.

             (5)  The deadline is:

                     (a)  if the entity that owned the * equity or loan interest immediately before the * realisation event must lodge an * income tax return for the income year in which the event happens—the time by which the return must be lodged; or

                     (b)  otherwise—the end of the 6 months immediately after that income year.

##### <a id="727-865"></a>727-865  How other provisions of this Division apply to support this Subdivision

             (1)  To avoid doubt, these provisions apply for the purposes of working out whether there has been a * presumed indirect value shift and, if so, the amount of it:

                     (a)  sections 727-155, 727-160 and 727-165 (about economic benefits);

                     (b)  section 727-315 (Transfer, for its adjustable value, of depreciating asset acquired for less than $1,500,000).

             (2)  For the purposes of section 727-850, these provisions:

                     (a)  Subdivision 727-C (Exclusions), except section 727-260 (about a shift down a wholly-owned chain of entities);

                     (b)  sections 727-700 to 727-725 (about 95% services indirect value shifts), except subsection 727-700(1);

apply to the * presumed indirect value shift on the assumptions set out in subsection (3).

             (3)  The assumptions are:

                     (a)  the * presumed indirect value shift is an * indirect value shift resulting from the * scheme; and

                     (b)  the * prospective losing entity for the scheme is the * losing entity for that indirect value shift; and

                     (c)  each * prospective gaining entity for the scheme is the * gaining entity for that indirect value shift; and

                     (d)  the * greater benefits under the presumed indirect value shift are the greater benefits under that indirect value shift; and

                     (e)  the * lesser benefits (if any) under the presumed indirect value shift are the lesser benefits under that indirect value shift; and

                      (f)  the time of the realisation event mentioned in paragraph 727-850(1)(c) is the * IVS time for the scheme; and

                     (g)  the * IVS period for the scheme ends at the time of the realisation event; and

                     (h)  section 727-105 (Ultimate controller test) is satisfied for that indirect value shift according to what it is reasonable to conclude under subsection 727-860(2) as applying to the presumed indirect value shift; and

                      (i)  section 727-110 (Common-ownership nexus test) is satisfied for that indirect value shift according to what it is reasonable to conclude under subsection 727-860(2) as applying to the presumed indirect value shift; and

                      (j)  a reference to the realisation event mentioned in subsection 727-700(1) were a reference to the realisation event mentioned in paragraph 727-850(1)(c); and

                     (k)  the interest to which the realisation event mentioned in paragraph 727-850(1)(c) happens were the interest referred to in paragraph 727-700(1)(a); and

                      (l)  a reference in any of sections 727-700 to 727-725 (about 95% services indirect value shifts), except subsection 727-700(1), to the owner were a reference to the entity that, at the time of the realisation event mentioned in paragraph 727-850(1)(c), owns the interest to which the event happens.

             (4)  Sections 727-635 and 727-640 affect how this Subdivision applies to * equity or loan interests, and * indirect equity or loan interests, in the * prospective losing entity that are split or merged during the period:

                     (a)  starting when the * scheme is entered into; and

                     (b)  ending at the time of the * realisation event mentioned in paragraph 727-850(1)(c);

in the same way as those sections affect how Subdivision 727-G would apply to those interests on the assumptions set out in subsection (3) of this section.

             (5)  The application of a provision because of this section is additional to, and is not intended to limit, any other application of the provision.

##### <a id="727-870"></a>727-870  Effect of CGT roll-over

             (1)   If:

                     (a)  the * realisation event mentioned in paragraph 727-850(1)(c) is a * CGT event; and

                     (b)  section 727-850 reduces a loss that would, apart from this Division, be * realised for income tax purposes by the CGT event; and

                     (c)  there is a roll-over for the CGT event;

the interest’s * reduced cost base at the time of the CGT event is taken to have been reduced by the amount by which section 727-850 reduces that loss, but is so taken only for the purposes of working out:

                     (d)  the interest’s reduced cost base, from time to time after the roll-over, for the entity that * acquired the interest because of the CGT event; and

                     (e)  in the case of a * replacement-asset roll-over—the reduced cost base of the replacement CGT asset, from time to time after the roll-over, for the entity that * disposed of the interest.

Note:          Because of the roll-over, the loss reduction under section 727-850 will have no tax effect. This subsection ensures that the loss reduction is passed on, through the reduction in reduced cost base, to prevent or reduce a loss arising on a later CGT event.

##### <a id="727-875"></a>727-875  Application to CGT asset that is also trading stock or revenue asset

                   If an * equity or loan interest is also an item of * trading stock or a * revenue asset, this Subdivision applies to the interest once in its character as a CGT asset and again in its character as trading stock or a revenue asset.

#### Subdivision 727-L—Indirect value shift resulting from a direct value shift

**Table of sections**

727-905    How this Subdivision affects the rest of this Division

727-910    Treatment of value shifted under the direct value shift

##### <a id="727-905"></a>727-905  How this Subdivision affects the rest of this Division

             (1)  This Subdivision affects how the rest of this Division applies to a * scheme (the **_IVS scheme_**) that is or includes a scheme (the **_DVS scheme_**) under which there is a * direct value shift.

             (2)  If the * direct value shift:

                     (a)  has consequences under Division 725 for an entity as an * affected owner of * down interests (or would do so apart from section 725-90 (about direct value shifts that will be reversed)); and

                     (b)  also has consequences under that Division for another entity as an affected owner of * up interests (or would do so apart from section 725-90);

the rest of this Subdivision has effect, for the purposes of Subdivisions 727-A to 727-K, in order to determine:

                     (c)  whether the IVS scheme results in an * indirect value shift, from the first entity to the other entity, that has consequences under this Division; and

                     (d)  whether the IVS scheme has consequences under Subdivision 727-K because it results in a * presumed indirect value shift affecting a * realisation event happening to * equity or loan interests, or to * indirect equity or loan interests, in the first entity; and

                     (e)  those consequences.

Note:          Section 725-50 sets out when a direct value shift has consequences under Division 725.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  the IVS scheme is the DVS scheme; and

                     (b)  subsection 725-145(2) is satisfied for the * direct value shift (because one or more equity or loan interests in the target entity are issued at a discount); but

                     (c)  subsection 725-145(3) (about an increase in the market value of one or more equity or loan interests in the target entity) is not satisfied for the direct value shift;

Subdivisions 727-A to 727-K apply to the IVS scheme only as provided in this section.

             (4)  Otherwise, those Subdivisions apply to the IVS scheme as provided in this section in addition to any other application they have to the scheme.

##### <a id="727-910"></a>727-910  Treatment of value shifted under the direct value shift

             (1)  The first entity is treated as * providing economic benefits to the other entity, * in connection with the IVS scheme, at the time of a decrease (or future decrease) in the market value of any of the * down interests, to the extent that the decrease is (or will be) covered by subsection 725-155(1).

             (2)  Despite subsections 727-150(4) and 727-855(2) and (3), the market value of all economic benefits that subsection (1) of this section treats the first entity as providing to the other entity:

                     (a)  is to be determined as at the time immediately before the * IVS time, or immediately before the * realisation event, as appropriate; and

                     (b)  is equal to the total value shifted from the * down interests to the * up interests, as worked out under one or more applications of step 2 of the method statement in section 725-365 or 725-380.

             (3)  The 2 entities are treated as not dealing with each other at * arm’s length in relation to the providing of those benefits.

             (4)  None of those benefits is treated as consisting of, or including, services provided or a right to have services provided.

Note:          This means that the exclusions in Subdivisions 727-C and 727-G for indirect value shifts involving services will not apply.

             (5)  Except as provided in this section, none of the following is treated as the * providing of economic benefits * in connection with the IVS scheme:

                     (a)  a decrease (or future decrease) in the market value of * down interests owned by the first entity or the other entity, to the extent that the decrease is (or will be) covered by subsection 725-155(1);

                     (b)  an increase (or future increase) in the market value of * up interests owned by the first entity or the other entity, to the extent that the increase is (or will be) covered by subsection 725-145(3);

                     (c)  an issue of * up interests at a * discount to the first entity or the other entity, to the extent that the issue is (or will be) covered by subsection 725-145(2).

Note:          Value shifted from down interests owned by the other entity to up interests owned by the first entity are dealt with by a separate application of this Subdivision to those interests (because of paragraphs 727-905(2)(a) and (b).

             (1)  Division 727 applies to a scheme entered into on or after 1 July 2002.

             (2)  It also applies to a scheme entered into on or after 27 June 2002, but only in relation to:

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not apply to an indirect value shift, or a presumed indirect value shift, if:

                     (a)  the economic benefits taken into account in determining that the scheme has resulted in that indirect value shift or presumed indirect value shift include economic benefits provided by:

                              (i)  an act referred to in Division 138 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ as the trigger event; or

##### <a id="977-5"></a>977-5  Realisation event

                   For a * CGT asset, a **_realisation event_** is a * CGT event (except CGT event E4 and CGT event G1).

##### <a id="977-10"></a>977-10  Loss realised for income tax purposes

             (1)  A loss is **_realised for income tax purposes_** by a * realisation event that happens to a * CGT asset if, and only if, an entity makes a * capital loss from the event. That capital loss is the loss realised by the event.

             (2)  If a provision of this Act reduces the loss that would, apart from that provision, be * realised for income tax purposes by the event, the * capital loss is reduced by the same amount.

##### <a id="977-15"></a>977-15  Gain realised for income tax purposes

             (1)  A gain is **_realised for income tax purposes_** by a * realisation event that happens to a * CGT asset if, and only if, an entity makes a * capital gain from the event. That capital gain is the gain that is realised by the event.

             (2)  If a provision of this Act reduces the gain that would, apart from that provision, be * realised for income tax purposes by the event, the * capital gain is reduced by the same amount.

#### Trading stock

##### <a id="977-20"></a>977-20  Realisation event

                   For an item of * trading stock, a **_realisation event_** is a disposal of the item or the ending of an income year.

##### <a id="977-25"></a>977-25  Disposal of trading stock: loss realised for income tax purposes

             (1)  A loss is **_realised for income tax purposes_** by a * realisation event consisting of disposal of an item of * trading stock if, and only if:

                     (a)  the item is disposed of, for less than its * cost, in the same income year in which it became part of the trading stock on hand of the entity disposing of it; or

                     (b)  the item is disposed of in a later income year for less than its * value as trading stock of the entity on hand at the start of the later income year.

             (2)  The loss that is realised for income tax purposes by the event is the difference between the amount included in the entity’s assessable income because of the disposal and:

                     (a)  the amount that the entity can deduct for the item’s * cost; or

                     (b)  the item’s * value as * trading stock on hand at the start of the later income year;

as appropriate.

             (3)  If a provision of this Act reduces the loss that would, apart from that provision, be * realised for income tax purposes by the event:

                     (a)  the amount that the entity can deduct for the item’s * cost; or

                     (b)  the item’s * value as trading stock on hand at the start of the later income year;

as appropriate, is reduced by the same amount.

##### <a id="977-30"></a>977-30  Ending of an income year: loss realised for income tax purposes

             (1)  A loss is **_realised for income tax purposes_** by a * realisation event that happens to an item of * trading stock  and consists of the ending of an income year if, and only if, the * value of the item, as trading stock of an entity on hand at the end of that income year, is less than:

                     (a)  its * cost, if it became part of the trading stock on hand of the entity during that income year; or

                     (b)  otherwise, its value as trading stock of the entity on hand at the start of that income year.

             (2)  The loss that is realised for income tax purposes by the event is the difference between the * value of the item, as * trading stock of the entity on hand at the end of that income year and:

                     (a)  the amount that the entity can deduct for the item’s * cost; or

                     (b)  the item’s * value as trading stock on hand at the start of the income year;

as appropriate.

             (3)  If a provision of this Act reduces the loss that would, apart from that provision, be * realised for income tax purposes by the event:

                     (a)  the amount that the entity can deduct for the item’s * cost; or

                     (b)  the item’s * value as * trading stock on hand at the start of the income year;

as appropriate, is reduced by the same amount.

##### <a id="977-35"></a>977-35  Disposal of trading stock: gain realised for income tax purposes

             (1)  A gain is **_realised for income tax purposes_** by a * realisation event consisting of disposal of an item of * trading stock if, and only if:

                     (a)  the item is disposed of, for more than its * cost, in the same income year in which it became part of the trading stock on hand of the entity disposing of it; or

                     (b)  the item is disposed of in a later income year for more than its * value as trading stock of the entity on hand at the start of the later income year.

             (2)  The gain that is realised for income tax purposes by the event is the difference between the amount included in the entity’s assessable income because of the disposal and:

                     (a)  the amount that the entity can deduct for the item’s * cost; or

                     (b)  the item’s * value as trading stock on hand at the start of the later income year;

as appropriate.

##### <a id="977-40"></a>977-40  Ending of an income year: gain realised for income tax purposes

             (1)  A gain is **_realised for income tax purposes_** by a * realisation event that happens to an item of * trading stock  and consists of the ending of an income year if, and only if, the * value of the item, as trading stock of an entity on hand at the end of that income year, is greater than:

                     (a)  its * cost, if it became part of the trading stock on hand of the entity during that income year; or

                     (b)  otherwise, its value as trading stock of the entity on hand at the start of that income year.

             (2)  The gain that is realised for income tax purposes by the event is the difference between the * value of the item, as * trading stock of the entity on hand at the end of that income year and:

                     (a)  the amount that the entity can deduct for the item’s * cost; or

                     (b)  the item’s * value as trading stock on hand at the start of the income year;

as appropriate.

             (3)  If a provision of this Act reduces the gain that would, apart from that provision, be * realised for income tax purposes by the event:

                     (a)  the amount that the entity can deduct for the item’s * cost; or

                     (b)  the item’s * value as * trading stock on hand at the start of the income year;

as appropriate, is increased by the same amount.

Entities can obtain CGT relief for a demerger.

Owners of ownership interests in the head entity of a demerger group can obtain a roll-over to defer CGT consequences for the CGT events that happen to their interests under the demerger (see Subdivision 125-B).

Capital gains and capital losses made by members of the demerger group from certain CGT events that happen under the demerger are disregarded (see Subdivision 125-C).

Note 1:       Section 125-80 sets out what the roll-over is.

Note 2:       You have to make cost base adjustments even if there is no CGT event: see section 125-90.

Example:    Peter owns shares (his original interests) in Company A, a public company. Company B is a wholly owned subsidiary of Company A. Company A announces a demerger utilising a proportionate capital reduction and the disposal of all its shares in Company B to its 320,000 shareholders. Following the demerger all of the shareholders in Company A, including Peter, will own all of the shares in Company B (their new interests).

             (2)  You cannot choose to obtain a roll-over under this Subdivision for an original interest if:

                     (a)  you are a foreign resident; and

                     (b)  the new interest you * acquire under the * demerger in exchange for that original interest does not have the * necessary connection with Australia just after you acquire it.

Note:          Section 136-25 tells you when an asset has the necessary connection with Australia.

##### <a id="125-60"></a>125-60  Meaning of _ownership interest_ and related terms

             (1)  An **_ownership interest_** in a company or trust is:

                     (a)  for a company, a * share in the company or an option, right or similar interest issued by the company that gives the owner an entitlement to * acquire a share in the company; and

                     (b)  for a trust, a unit or other interest in the trust or an option, right or similar interest issued by the trustee that gives the owner an entitlement to acquire a unit or other interest in the trust.

             (2)  However, this Subdivision applies to a * dual listed company voting share in a company as if it were not an **_ownership interest_** if there are not more than 5 of those * shares in the company.

             (3)  A **_dual listed company voting share_** is a * share in a company:

                     (a)  issued:

                              (i)  in the * head entity of a * demerger group; and

                             (ii)  as part of a * dual listed company arrangement; and

                            (iii)  mainly for the purpose of ensuring that shareholders of both companies involved in the arrangement vote as a single decision-making body on matters affecting them; and

                     (b)  that does not carry rights to financial entitlements (except the return of the amount paid up on the share and a dividend that is the equivalent of a dividend paid on an ordinary share).

             (4)  A **_dual listed company arrangement_** is an * arrangement under which 2 publicly listed companies, while maintaining their separate legal entity status, shareholdings and listings, align their strategic directions and the economic interests of their respective shareholders through:

                     (a)  the appointment of common (or almost identical) boards of directors; and

                     (b)  management of the operations of the 2 companies on a unified basis; and

                     (c)  the shareholders of both companies voting in effect as a single decision-making body on substantial issues affecting their combined interests; and

                     (d)  equalised distributions to shareholders in accordance with an equalisation ratio applying between the 2 companies, both generally and in the event of a winding up of one or both of the companies; and

                     (e)  cross-guarantees as to, or similar financial support for, each other’s substantial obligations or operations, except where the effect of the relevant regulatory requirements prevents those guarantees or that financial support.

             (5)  However, an arrangement is not a **_dual listed company arrangement_** unless one but not both of the companies is an Australian resident.

##### <a id="125-65"></a>125-65  Meanings of _demerger group_, _head entity_ and _demerger subsidiary_

             (1)  A **_demerger group_** comprises the * head entity of the group and one or more * demerger subsidiaries.

Note:          An entity may be a member of one or more demerger groups.

             (2)  A trust cannot be a member of a **_demerger group_** unless * CGT event E4 is capable of applying to all of the units and interests in the trust.

Note:          A discretionary trust cannot be a member of a demerger group.

             (3)  A company or trust is the **_head entity_** of a * demerger group if no other member of the group owns * ownership interests in the company or trust.

             (4)  If apart from this subsection, a company or trust would be the * head entity of a * demerger group and the company or trust, and all of its * demerger subsidiaries, are also demerger subsidiaries of another company or trust in another demerger group, the first-mentioned company or trust is not the **_head entity_** of a demerger group.

             (5)  A company or trust (the **_first company or trust_**) that would, apart from this subsection, be a member of a **_demerger group_** is not a member of the **_demerger group_** if:

                     (a)  the first company or trust owns, either alone or together with another company or trust that would, apart from this subsection, be a member of the * demerger group, more than 20% but less than 80% of the * ownership interests in a * listed public company or * listed widely held trust; and

                     (b)  the listed public company or listed widely held trust chooses that the first company or trust not be a member of the demerger group.

             (6)  A company is a **_demerger subsidiary_** of another company or a trust that is a member of a * demerger group if the other company or the trust, either alone or together with other members of the group, owns, or has the right to * acquire, * ownership interests in the company that carry between them:

                     (a)  the right to receive more than 20% of any distribution of income or capital by the company; or

                     (b)  the right to exercise, or control the exercise of, more than 20% of the voting power of the company.

             (7)  A trust is a **_demerger subsidiary_** of another trust or a company that is a member of a * demerger group if the other trust or the company, either alone or together with other members of the group, owns, or has the right to * acquire, * ownership interests in the trust that carry between them the right to receive more than 20% of any distribution of income or capital by the trustee.

##### <a id="125-70"></a>125-70  Meanings of _demerger_, _demerged entity_ and _demerging entity_

             (1)  A **_demerger_** happens to a * demerger group if:

                     (a)  there is a restructuring of the demerger group; and

                     (b)  under the restructuring:

                              (i)  members of the demerger group * dispose of at least 80% of their total * ownership interests in another member of the demerger group to owners of original interests in the * head entity of the demerger group; or

                             (ii)  at least 80% of the total ownership interests of members of the demerger group in another member of the demerger group end and new interests are issued to owners of original interests in the head entity; or

                            (iii)  the demerged entity issues sufficient new ownership interests in itself with the result that owners of original interests in the head entity own at least 80% of the total ownership interests in the demerged entity; or

                            (iv)  some combination of the processes referred to in subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) happens with the effect that members of the demerger group stop owning at least 80% of the total ownership interests owned by members of the demerger group in another member of the group; and

Note:       CGT event C2 and CGT event C3 are the only relevant CGT events in a subparagraph (ii) case.

                     (c)  under the restructuring:

                              (i)  a * CGT event happens to an original interest owned by an entity in the head entity of the group and the entity * acquires a new interest and nothing else; or

                             (ii)  no CGT event happens to an original interest owned by an entity in the head entity of the group and the entity acquires a new interest and nothing else; and

                     (d)  the acquisition by entities of new interests happens only because those entities own or owned original interests; and

                     (e)  the new interests acquired are:

                              (i)  if the head entity is a company—ownership interests in a company; or

                             (ii)  if the head entity is a trust—ownership interests in a trust; and

                      (f)  just before the restructuring, it is reasonable for the head entity to assume that more than 50% of original interests in the head entity of the demerger group are owned by:

                              (i)  Australian residents; or

                             (ii)  foreign residents whose new interests have the * necessary connection with Australia just after they acquire them; and

                     (g)  neither the original interests nor the new interests are in a trust that is a * superannuation fund; and

                     (h)  the requirements of subsection (2) are met.

Example:    To continue the example from subsection 125-55(1), Peter owns 400 post-CGT shares in Company A. Companies A and B are both members of a demerger group. Company A is the head entity of the demerger group and Company B is a demerger subsidiary.

                   Company A proceeds to demerge 100% of its shares in Company B to its shareholders.

                   Company A enters into a proportionate capital reduction, returning 40 cents per share to its ordinary shareholders. Peter is entitled to $160 (40c times 400 shares) under the capital reduction.

                   For Peter, the capital reduction amount of $160 is compulsorily applied to acquire Company A’s shares in Company B, at $6.75 (a discount of 10% to current market value). Company A rounds up the fractional amounts in calculating the number of whole shares to be distributed to each shareholder. This gives Peter 24 shares in Company B (160 divided by 6.75, rounded up to the nearest whole number).

Note:          Acquiring new interests by an owner of original interests may include the allocation of the owner’s entitlement to new interests to a nominee:

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">          </span>to sell on the owner’s behalf; or

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">          </span>to hold pending the owner being located.

             (2)  Each owner (an **_original owner_**) of original interests in the * head entity of the * demerger group must:

                     (a)  * acquire, under the * demerger, the same proportion, or as nearly as practicable the same proportion, of new interests in the * demerged entity as the original owner owned in the head entity just before the demerger; and

                     (b)  just after the demerger, have the same proportionate total * market value of * ownership interests in the head entity and demerged entity as the original owner owned in the head entity just before the demerger.

Note 1:       There is an exception: see section 125-75.

Note 2:       Dual listed company voting shares are not treated as ownership interests: see section 125-60.

Note 3:       Fractional interests will generally not affect your ability to choose a roll-over.

Example:    To continue the example from subsection (1), Company A concludes, given the circumstances of the demerger, that the market values of Peter’s and the other shareholders’ shares in A and B are expected to be in proportion with their original interests in Company A, and advises the shareholders of this position.

             (3)  In working out whether an original owner complies with subsection (2):

                     (a)  disregard * ownership interests that are original interests the owner owns in the * demerged entity; and

                     (b)  an anticipated reasonable approximation of the * market value of ownership interests is sufficient.

Example:    An anticipated reasonable approximation of market values of ownership interests may include:

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">          </span>valuations provided to shareholders in scheme documents;

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">          </span>the price selected for use under a sale facility;

                   and may be made by reference to long-term value.

Exception: off-market buy-backs

             (4)  A buy-back of * shares that is an off-market purchase for the purposes of Division 16K of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ is not a * demerger.

Exception: roll-over available under another provision

             (5)  Circumstances where an owner of original interests can obtain a roll-over under a provision of this Act outside this Division for all of the CGT events that happened to the owner’s original interests under the circumstances cannot be a **_demerger_**.

Note:          An owner might be able to obtain a roll-over for the CGT events under Subdivision 124-E, 124-G, 124
