accrued to the joined group before the joining time (subsection&#160;(8) states

what it means for a loss to accrue to the joined group before the joining time).

</dd>

</dl></dl>
Profit accruing to the joined group before the joining time
<dl compact="">

<dt>(7)</dt><dd>A profit accrued to the joined group before the joining time if, on the

following assumptions:

</dd> </dl>
<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>that it was distributed to holders of <sup>*</sup>membership interests as

it accrued; and</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>that entities interposed between the <sup>*</sup>head company and the

it;

Loss accruing to the joined group before the joining time
<dl compact="">

<dt>(8)</dt><dd>A loss accrued to the joined group before the joining time if and to the

extent that, assuming that as it arose it were instead a profit that was

accruing, a distribution of that profit would have been a distribution made to

the joined group out of profits that accrued to the joined group before the

###  NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (CONSOLIDATION, VALUE SHIFTING, DEMERGERS AND OTHER MEASURES) ACT 2002Schedule&#160;3&#151;Consolidation: new Subdivision&#160;705-B (tax cost setting amount on group formation) 
**
Income Tax Assessment Act 1997


Subdivision&#160;705-B&#151;Case of group formation Guide to Subdivision&#160;705-B





\[This is the end of the Guide.]
Application and object
Application
<dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>This Subdivision has effect for the head company core purposes set out in

subsection 701-1(2) if one or more entities become <sup>*</sup>subsidiary

members of a <sup>*</sup>consolidated group at the time (the _formation time_) it comes into existence as a consolidated group.

</dd> </dl>

Back to Top

<dl compact="">

Note:	This is the first exception to Subdivision&#160;705-A: see

paragraph 705-15(a).

 </dl>
Object
<dl compact="">

<dt>(2)</dt><dd>The object of this Subdivision is to modify the rules in

Subdivision&#160;705-A (which basically determine the tax cost setting amount

for assets of an entity joining an existing <sup>*</sup>consolidated group) so

that they have effect, and take account of different circumstances that apply,

when a consolidated group comes into existence.

</dd> </dl>
<dl compact="">

Note:	The main circumstance is where one of the entities has

membership interests in another. In such a case, the order in which the rules

in Subdivision&#160;705-A are applied will affect the tax cost setting amounts

for the assets of the entities.

 </dl>
Modified application of Subdivision&#160;705-A
<dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>Subdivision&#160;705-A has effect in relation to each entity becoming a

<sup>*</sup>subsidiary member of the <sup>*</sup>consolidated group at the

formation time in the same way as that Subdivision has effect in relation to an

entity becoming a subsidiary member of a consolidated group in circumstances

covered by that Subdivision.</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>However, that effect of Subdivision&#160;705-A is subject to modifications set out in this Subdivision. </dd> </dl>
Object
<dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>The object of this section is to ensure that where, on becoming

<sup>*</sup>subsidiary members, entities hold assets consisting of

<sup>*</sup>membership interests in other subsidiary members, the

<sup>*</sup>head company's cost of becoming the holder of the assets of all of

the entities that become subsidiary members correctly reflects the group's cost

of acquiring the entities.

</dd> </dl>
Tax cost setting amounts to be worked out from top down
<dl compact="">

<dt>(2)</dt><dd>If, on becoming <sup>*</sup>subsidiary members, entities hold

<sup>*</sup>membership interests in any other entities that become subsidiary

members, the <sup>*</sup>tax cost setting amounts for the assets of entities

holding membership interests must be worked out before the tax cost setting

amounts for the assets of the entities in which the membership interests are

held.

</dd> </dl>
<dl compact="">

Note:	The tax cost setting amount in respect of assets of any

subsidiary member in which the head company, but no other subsidiary member,

holds membership interests can be worked out in any order in relation to the

calculations for other subsidiary members.

 </dl>
Tax cost setting amount for higher entity&apos;s membership interests to be used in working out lower entity&apos;s tax cost setting amount
<dl compact="">

<dt>(3)</dt><dd>The tax cost setting amount worked out for assets of an entity mentioned

in subsection&#160;(2) consisting of <sup>*</sup>membership interests in

another such entity is to be used as the amount for those interests under

subsection 705-65(1) (step 1 of allocable cost amount) in working out the tax

cost setting amount for assets of that other entity.

</dd> </dl>
<dl compact="">

Note 1:	Subsection 705-65(1) adds together amounts worked out in

accordance with section&#160;705-65 representing the cost of the membership

interests that each member of the group holds in the entity. If any of those

membership interests is held by another subsidiary member, subsection&#160;(3)

above will replace the amount otherwise applicable with the tax cost setting

amount that will have been worked out for the interests in accordance with

subsection&#160;(2) above. Note 2:	The tax cost setting amount worked out for the membership interests has no relevance other than for the purpose mentioned in subsection&#160;(3). This is because, under the single entity principle, intra group membership interests are ignored while entities are members of the group. If an entity ceases to be a member, section&#160;701-15 and Division&#160;711 set the tax cost of membership interests in the entity at that time.  </dl>

Value shifting etc. provisions not to apply to later CGT events involving membership interests
<dl compact="">

<dt>(4)</dt><dd>However, despite subsection&#160;(3), subsection 705-65(4) (which prevents

the later operation of value shifting etc. provisions) still applies to the

<sup>*</sup>membership interests.

</dd> </dl>
Rights and options to acquire membership interests
<dl compact="">

<dt>(5)</dt><dd>For the purposes of this section, if, on becoming a <sup>*</sup>subsidiary

member, an entity holds a right or option (including a contingent right or

option), created or issued by another entity that becomes a subsidiary member

at the same time, to acquire a <sup>*</sup>membership interest in that other

entity, that right or option is treated as if it were a membership interest in

that other entity.

</dd> </dl>
Object
<dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>The object of this section is to ensure that, in working out the group's

<sup>*</sup>allocable cost amount for certain entities that become

<sup>*</sup>subsidiary members of the group at the formation time, an

adjustment is made to take account of roll-overs under Subdivision&#160;126-B

or section&#160;160ZZO of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ before the

Adjustment to result of step 3 in allocable cost amount for head company roll-over recipient
<dl compact="">

amount for the head company roll-over recipient, the result of step 3 in the

table in section&#160;705-60 is reduced (if the head company roll-over

adjustment amount is an excess), or increased (if the head company roll-over

adjustment amount is a shortfall), by the amount worked out as follows:

2  Basic rule about application of section&#160;160AFE

(1)	Section&#160;160AFE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ as amended by this Schedule applies in relation to a taxpayer for each of its:

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>income years starting after 30&#160;June 2003; and</dd>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note:	If you have a substituted accounting period, item&#160;5 or

7 may apply instead of this item.

 </dl></dl>

3  Different application for members of certain groups

(1)	This item applies to a taxpayer if:

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>the taxpayer becomes a member of a consolidated group or MEC group on the

(2)	Section&#160;160AFE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ as amended by this Schedule applies in relation to the taxpayer for each of its:

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>income years starting on or after the consolidation day; and</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>non-membership periods (if any) under section&#160;701-30 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ starting on or after the consolidation day.

</dd>

Note:	If you become the head company of a consolidated group on

start of your income year, item&#160;6 will apply instead of this item.

 </dl></dl>

4  Transitional provision for section&#160;160AFE

For the purposes of paragraph 160AFE(3)(d) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ as in force immediately after the commencement of this Schedule, take account of an amount utilised or applied under section&#160;160AFE of that Act as in force either before or after that commencement for a year of income ending before or after that commencement. 

5  Modification of basic rule

(1)	This item applies to a taxpayer instead of item&#160;2 if the taxpayer:

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>has a substituted accounting period; and</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>is not a member of a consolidated group or a MEC group.

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

(2)	Section&#160;160AFE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ as amended by this Schedule applies to the taxpayer from 1&#160;July 2003\. That section applies from 1&#160;July 2003 until the start of the taxpayer's next income year as if that period were an income year.
 (3)	Section&#160;160AFE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ as in force just before the commencement of this Schedule (the _old sectionÂ 160AFE_) applies to the taxpayer from the start of the taxpayer's income year in which 1&#160;July 2003 occurs until the end of 30&#160;June 2003 as if that period were an income year.

6  Consolidation day on or after 1&#160;July 2002 and before 1&#160;July 2003

(1)	This item applies to a taxpayer instead of item&#160;3 if:

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>the taxpayer becomes the head company of a consolidated group or MEC group

on the day (also the _consolidation day_) the group comes into

existence; and</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>the consolidation day is on or after 1&#160;July 2002 and before

1&#160;July 2003 and is not the start of an income year (whether or not the

taxpayer has a substituted accounting period).

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

(2)	Section&#160;160AFE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ as amended by this Schedule applies to the taxpayer from the consolidation day. That section applies from the consolidation day until the end of the taxpayer's income year in which that day occurs as if that period were an income year.
 (3)	If:

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>the consolidation day is after 1&#160;July 2002; and</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>the taxpayer does not have a substituted accounting period;

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

the old section&#160;160AFE applies to the taxpayer from 1&#160;July 2002 until just before the consolidation day. If the taxpayer so chooses, it applies as if that period were an income year.

(4)	If the taxpayer has a substituted accounting period, the old section&#160;160AFE applies to the taxpayer from the start of the taxpayer's income year in which the consolidation day occurred until just before the consolidation day. If the taxpayer so chooses, it applies as if that period were an income year.

7  Consolidation day on or after 1&#160;July 2003

(1)	This item applies to a taxpayer instead of item&#160;2 if:

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>the taxpayer has a substituted accounting period; and</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>the taxpayer becomes the head company of a consolidated group or MEC group

on the day (also the _consolidation day_) the group comes into

existence; and</dd>

<dt>(c)</dt><dd>the consolidation day is on or after 1&#160;July 2003 and is not the start

of the taxpayer's next income year.

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

(2)	Section&#160;160AFE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ as amended by this Schedule applies to the taxpayer from 1&#160;July 2003\. That section applies from 1&#160;July 2003 until the start of the taxpayer's next income year as if that period were an income year.
 (3)	The old section&#160;160AFE applies to the taxpayer from the start of the taxpayer's income year in which 1&#160;July 2003 occurs until the end of 30&#160;June 2003\. If the taxpayer so chooses, it applies as if that period were an income year.

8  Applying old section&#160;160AFE to part years

<center>Back to Top</center>

(1)	Subitem&#160;(2) has effect for the purposes of applying the old section&#160;160AFE:

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>to a taxpayer as mentioned in item&#160;5, 6 or 7; and</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>for a period that is shorter than an income year.

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

(2)	The requirement in paragraph&#160;(1D)(b) of that section that the income company be a group company in relation to the credit company in relation to the current year of income has effect as if it were a requirement that the income company be a group company in relation to the credit company:

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>continuously for a period of at least 12 months ending on the day before

the day on which section&#160;160AFE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ as amended by this Schedule starts to apply to the taxpayer; or</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>from the time when the income company and the credit company were both in

existence, if that period is shorter.

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

9  Applying old section&#160;160AFE to non-membership periods

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>becomes a subsidiary member of a consolidated group or MEC group; and</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>has a period referred to in section&#160;701-30 as a non-membership period.

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

(2)	The requirement in paragraph&#160;(1D)(b) of the old section&#160;160AFE that the income company be a group company in relation to the credit company in relation to the current year of income has effect as if it were a requirement that the income company be a group company in relation to the credit company:

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>continuously for a period of at least 12 months ending on the last day of

the non-membership period; or</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>from the time when the income company and the credit company were both in

existence, if that period is shorter.

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

10  Parts of income years not earlier income years

Any period that is shorter than an income year and that is treated as if it were an income year for the purposes of item&#160;5, 6 or 7 of this Schedule is taken not to be an earlier income year for the purposes of section&#160;160AFE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ as amended by this Schedule.

11  Transitional provision for section&#160;160AF

(1)	This item applies if:

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>because of item&#160;5, 6 or 7, old section&#160;160AFE applies to a

taxpayer as if a period were an income year (the _notional income year_); and</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>the taxpayer has an initial excess credit (within the meaning of old

section&#160;160AFE) in relation to the notional income year; and</dd>

<dt>(c)</dt><dd>the taxpayer transfers all or part (the extent of the transfer being the

_transfer amount_) of that initial excess credit under old

section&#160;160AFE for utilisation by another company in the notional income

year.

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

(2)	Section&#160;160AF of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ applies to the taxpayer for the year of income in which the notional income year ends as if the amount of foreign tax paid by the taxpayer mentioned in paragraph 160AF(1)(b) of that Act were reduced by the transfer amount.
 (3)	This item operates separately in relation to each class of foreign income identified in subsection 160AF(7) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, as if the taxpayer's foreign income of that class for a year of income were the whole of the taxpayer's foreign income for that year.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>An exempting entity is a corporate tax entity that is effectively owned by

 Guide to Subdivision&#160;208-F
 208-105  What this Subdivision is about

This Subdivision:

*	creates an exempting account for each former exempting entity; and

*	identifies when exempting credits and debits arise in those accounts and the amount of those credits and debits; and

*	identifies when there is an exempting surplus or deficit in the account; and

*	identifies when franking credits and debits arise in the franking account of an entity because it is an exempting entity, or former exempting entity.

 208-190  What this Subdivision is about

Generally, a franked distribution from an exempting entity will only generate a tax effect for the recipient under Division&#160;207 if the recipient is also an exempting entity.
 A concession is made to employees of the entity who receive a franked distribution because they hold shares under an eligible employee share scheme.

Subdivision&#160;208-H&#151;Tax effect of a distribution franked with an exempting credit
 Guide to Subdivision&#160;208-H
 208-220  What this Subdivision is about

Generally, a distribution franked with an exempting credit will only generate a tax effect for the recipient under Division&#160;207 if a tax effect would have been generated for the recipient had the recipient received a franked distribution when the distributing entity was an exempting entity.

_Step 3_.	If the step 2 amount exceeds the step 1 amount, the excess is the company's _preliminary unrealised net loss_ at the relevant time.
 _Step 4_.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(2)</dt><dd>An alteration time is the trigger for making reductions and other

adjustments to the reduced cost base of significant equity and debt interests

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

 725-1  What this Division is about

If, under a scheme, value is shifted from equity or loan interests in a company or trust to other equity or loan interests in the same company or trust (including interests issued at a discount), this Division:

	(a)	adjusts the value of those interests for income tax purposes to take account of material changes in market value that are attributable to the value shift; and
 	(b)	treats the value shift as a partial realisation to the extent that value is shifted between interests held by different owners, and in some other cases.

However, it does so only for interests that are owned by entities involved in the value shift.

725-145  When there is a direct value shift

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>There is a _direct value shift_ under a <sup>*</sup>scheme

involving <sup>*</sup>equity or loan interests in an entity (the _target entity_) if:

</dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>there is a decrease in the market value of one or more equity or loan

interests in the target entity; and</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>the decrease is reasonably attributable to one or more things done under

the scheme, and occurs at or after the time when that thing, or the first of

those things, is done; and</dd>

<dt>(c)</dt><dd>either or both of subsections&#160;(2) and (3) are satisfied.

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

Examples of something done under a scheme are issuing new shares at a <sup>*</sup>discount, buying back shares or changing the voting rights attached to shares.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(2)</dt><dd>One or more <sup>*</sup>equity or loan interests in the target entity must be

issued at a <sup>*</sup>discount. The issue must be, or must be reasonably

attributable to, the thing, or one or more of the things, referred to in

paragraph&#160;(1)(b). It must also occur at or after the time referred to in

that paragraph.

</dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Example:	A company runs a family business. There are 2 shares

originally issued for $2 each. They are owned by husband and wife. The market

value of the shares is much greater (represented by the value of the assets of

the company less its liabilities). The company issues one more share for $2 to

their son. 	Caution is needed in such a situation. The example would result in a large CGT liability for the husband and wife under this Division, because they have shifted 1/3 of the value of their own shares to their son. No such liability would arise if the share had been issued for its market value.  </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(3)</dt><dd>Or, there must be an increase in the market value of one or more

<sup>*</sup>equity or loan interests in the target entity. The increase must be

725-160  What is the nature of a direct value shift?

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>The <sup>*</sup>direct value shift has 2 aspects.</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>Overall, it consists of: </dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

		If it is reasonable to conclude that an increase or decrease in market value,

General
 725-205  Consequences depend on character of down interests and up interests

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>The consequences for you of the <sup>*</sup>direct value shift depend on

the character of the <sup>*</sup>down interests and <sup>*</sup>up interests of

which you are an <sup>*</sup>affected owner.</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>There are consequences for all your <sup>*</sup>down interests and <sup>*</sup>up interests in their character as <sup>*</sup>CGT assets. However, some of them may also be <sup>*</sup>trading stock or <sup>*</sup>revenue assets. There are additional consequences for those interests in their character as trading stock or revenue assets. </dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note:	For example, you may own a down interest that is a CGT

asset and a revenue asset. 	Sections&#160;725-240 to 725-255 set out the consequences for you of a shift in value from that interest in its character as a CGT asset. The cost base of the asset will be decreased, which will affect the calculation of a capital gain when a CGT event happens to the interest. 	Section&#160;725-320 sets out the consequences for you of a shift in value from that interest in its character as a revenue asset. The adjustment made under that section will affect the calculation of any profit on the sale of the interest. 	Any overlap between the capital gain and the profit realised on the sale of the interest is then dealt with under section&#160;118-20\. 	In some instances, the direct value shift may result in a taxing event generating a gain for you in the income year in which the shift happens. That gain will be both a capital gain (because the down interest can be characterised as a CGT asset) and an increase in your assessable income (because the down interest can be characterised as a revenue asset). Again, any overlap is dealt with under section&#160;118-20\.  </dl></dl>

725-210  Consequences for down interests depend on pre-shift gains and losses

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>The consequences for a <sup>*</sup>down interest also depend on whether it

has a <sup>*</sup>pre-shift gain or a <sup>*</sup>pre-shift loss.</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>It has a _pre-shift_ _gain_ if, immediately before the <sup>*</sup>decrease time, its market value was _greater than_ its <sup>*</sup>adjustable value.</dd> <dt>(3)</dt><dd>It has a _pre-shift_ _loss_ if, immediately before the <sup>*</sup>decrease time, its market value was _equal to or less than_ its <sup>*</sup>adjustable value. </dd> </dl></dl>

Note:	If an interest has been affected by an earlier direct value

shift during the same income year, it will be treated as having already been

sold and repurchased (because of an earlier application of

section&#160;725-320). As a result, the cost on repurchase becomes its

adjustable value immediately before the decrease time or increase time for the

later direct value shift.

 interest; and
 	(d)	sustained the same decrease in market value as the down interest because of the <sup>*</sup>direct value shift.

_Step 2_.	Work out the value shifted from that group of <sup>*</sup>down interests to the <sup>*</sup>up interests referred to in the relevant item using the following formula:

 727-1  What this Division is about

If there is a net shift of value between 2 related entities because of a non-arm's length dealing, this Division:

	(a)	prevents losses from arising, because of the value shift, on 
<center>Back to Top</center>
 realisation of direct or indirect equity or loan interests in the losing entity; and
 	(b)	within limits, prevents gains from arising, because of the value shift, on realisation of direct or indirect equity or loan interests in the gaining entity.

However, it does so only for interests that are owned by entities involved in the value shift.

727-5  What is an indirect value shift?

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>An indirect value shift arises when there is a net shift of value from one

entity to another.

</dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Example:	Company A transfers property to company B in return for

a cash payment. If the market value of the property is $180 million but the

cash payment is only $50 million, there is a net shift of value from company A

to company B of $130 million.

 </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(2)</dt><dd>It is called _indirect_ because the transaction will have the

indirect effect of shifting value from equity or loan interests in the losing

entity to equity or loan interests in the gaining entity.</dd> 		This is because the net shift in value between the entities will usually _decrease_ the market value of interests in the losing entity and _increase_ the market value of interests in the gaining entity.  </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Example:	Assume that company C owns all the shares in company A

and company D owns all the shares in company B. The net shift of value from

company A to company B will reduce the value of company C's shares in company A

and increase the value of company D's shares in company B.

 </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(3)</dt><dd>It will also produce corresponding effects further up a chain of entities.

Example:	Assume that company E owns all the shares in company C

and company D. The net shift of value from company A to company B will also

reduce the value of company E's shares in company C and increase the value of

<dt>(4)</dt><dd>This Division is _not_ concerned with the tax treatment of the net

shift in value between the entities at the bottom of the chains. Instead, it

deals with the effects on the market value of interests (both direct and

indirect) in those entities.</dd> <dt>(5)</dt><dd>An indirect value shift distorts the relationship between the market value of an equity or loan interest and its value for income tax purposes.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Example:	If company E sold its shares in company C, the indirect

value shift could (apart from this Division) result in a loss for income tax

purposes. Company E could defer the corresponding gain on its shares in company

D by not selling these.

727-10  How does this Division deal with indirect value shifts?

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>To prevent an inappropriate loss or gain from arising on realisation of an

interest, this Division reduces the amount of the loss or gain (realisation

time method). However, a choice can be made to adjust the interest's value for

income tax purposes in a way that takes account of the indirect value shift

(adjustable value method).</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>This Division does _not_ create taxing events giving rise to gains or losses. </dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>A <sup>*</sup>scheme can result in one or more <sup>*</sup>indirect value

shifts only if one or more economic benefits have been, are being, or are to

be, <sup>*</sup>provided <sup>*</sup>in connection with the scheme.</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>The question whether the <sup>*</sup>scheme has that result must be determined by reference to the facts and circumstances that exist at the earliest time (either when the scheme is entered into or later) when it is reasonable to conclude that: </dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>all the economic benefits that have been, are being, or are to be,

<sup>*</sup>provided <sup>*</sup>in connection with the scheme can be

identified; and</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>for each of those economic benefits:

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(i)</dt><dd>the entity that has provided, is providing, or is to provide, the economic

benefit can be identified; and</dd>

<dt>(ii)</dt><dd>the entity to which the economic benefit has been, is being, or is to be,

provided can be identified; and</dd>

<dt>(iii)</dt><dd>if the economic benefit is to be provided&#151;those entities are in

existence, and the providing of the economic benefit is not contingent; and

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(c)</dt><dd>there are no other economic benefits that are to be provided in connection

with the scheme if some contingency is met.

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

That time is called the _IVS time_ for the scheme.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note:	In most cases, the IVS time will be at or soon after the

scheme is entered into. However, if:

 </dl></dl>

*	direct or indirect interests in a company or trust are realised at a loss  when the IVS time for the scheme has not yet happened (even if it never happens); and
 *	the company or trust has provided, is providing, is to provide, or might provide, economic benefits in connection with the scheme;

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

	there may be consequences for those interests similar to those

of an indirect value shift resulting from the scheme. See

Subdivision&#160;727-K.

 </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(3)</dt><dd>The <sup>*</sup>scheme results in an _indirect value shift_

from one entity (the _losing entity_) to another entity (the

_gaining entity_) if the total market value of the one or more

economic benefits (the _greater benefits_) that the losing entity

<sup>*</sup>in connection with the scheme exceeds:

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>if there are no economic benefits covered by paragraph&#160;(a)&#151;nil.

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

That excess is the amount of the indirect value shift.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(5)</dt><dd>Neither the <sup>*</sup>losing entity nor the <sup>*</sup>gaining entity

another entity:

</dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>the first entity pays an amount to the other entity (in this case the

market value of the benefit is the amount of the payment);</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>the first entity provides an asset or services to the other entity;</dd>

<dt>(c)</dt><dd>the first entity does something that creates an asset in the hands of the

other entity (for example, a company issues shares to its members);</dd>

<dt>(d)</dt><dd>the first entity incurs a liability to the other entity, or increases a

liability it already owes to the other entity;</dd>

<dt>(e)</dt><dd>the first entity terminates all or part of a liability owed by the other

entity;</dd>

<dt>(f)</dt><dd>the first entity does something that increases the market value of an

asset that the other entity holds.

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>the benefit has been, is being, is to be, or might be, provided under the

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>If an economic benefit that has been, is being, is to be, or might be,

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Example:	Acme Ltd enters into an agreement with Paragon Pty Ltd

under which Acme is to provide services to Paragon over a 5 year period in

return for payments. 	Paragon's rights under the agreement are economic benefits that Acme provides to Paragon when the agreement is made. The services are economic benefits that Acme is to provide to Paragon. 	Because of this subsection, the market value of the rights is taken into account in working out whether there has been an indirect value shift, but the market value of the services is not.  </dl></dl>

Subdivision&#160;727-G&#151;The realisation time method
 727-600  What this Subdivision is about

Under the realisation time method:

*	losses on realisation of affected interests in the losing entity are reduced; and

*	gains on realisation of affected interests in the gaining entity are reduced, within limits worked out by reference to the reductions in losses on affected interests in the losing entity; and

*	certain 95% services indirect value shifts are disregarded. 

This Subdivision also explains how its reduction of a loss or gain affects CGT assets, trading stock and revenue assets.

Subdivision&#160;727-H&#151;The adjustable value method
 Guide to Subdivision&#160;727-H
 727-750  What this Subdivision is about

Under the adjustable value method:

*	the adjustable values of affected interests in the losing entity are reduced; and

*	the adjustable values of affected interests in the gaining entity are uplifted, within limits worked out by references to the reductions in the adjustable values of affected interests in the losing entity.

The consequences of that are:

*	the cost base and reduced cost base of the interests are reduced or uplifted (or both); and

*	if the interests are also trading stock or revenue assets, there are further consequences for them in their character as such.

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(3)</dt><dd>The consequences for the <sup>*</sup>affected interest depend on its

Entities can obtain CGT relief for a demerger.
 Owners of ownership interests in the head entity of a demerger group can obtain a roll-over to defer CGT consequences for the CGT events that happen to their interests under the demerger (see Subdivision&#160;125-B).
 Capital gains and capital losses made by members of the demerger group from certain CGT events that happen under the demerger are disregarded (see Subdivision&#160;125-C).

You can choose to obtain a roll-over if a CGT event happens to your interests in a company or trust because of a demerger of an entity from the group of which the company or trust is the head entity.
 There are cost base adjustments if you receive new interests under a demerger and no CGT event happens to your original interests.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note 1:	Section&#160;125-80 sets out what the roll-over is. Note 2:	You have to make cost base adjustments even if there is no CGT event: see section&#160;125-90\. Example:	Peter owns shares (his original interests) in Company A, a public company. Company B is a wholly owned subsidiary of Company A. Company A announces a demerger utilising a proportionate capital reduction and the disposal of all its shares in Company B to its 320,000 shareholders. Following the demerger all of the shareholders in Company A, including Peter, will own all of the shares in Company B (their new interests).  </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Example:	To continue the example from subsection 125-55(1), Peter

owns 400 post-CGT shares in Company A. Companies A and B are both members of a

demerger group. Company A is the head entity of the demerger group and Company

B is a demerger subsidiary. 	Company A proceeds to demerge 100% of its shares in Company B to its shareholders. 	Company A enters into a proportionate capital reduction, returning 40 cents per share to its ordinary shareholders. Peter is entitled to $160 (40c times 400 shares) under the capital reduction. 	For Peter, the capital reduction amount of $160 is compulsorily applied to acquire Company A's shares in Company B, at $6.75 (a discount of 10% to current market value). Company A rounds up the fractional amounts in calculating the number of whole shares to be distributed to each shareholder. This gives Peter 24 shares in Company B (160 divided by 6.75, rounded up to the nearest whole number). Note:	Acquiring new interests by an owner of original interests may include the allocation of the owner's entitlement to new interests to a nominee:  </dl></dl>

*	to sell on the owner's behalf; or
 *	to hold pending the owner being located.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

before the demerger; and</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>just after the demerger, have the same proportionate total

and demerged entity as the original owner owned in the head entity just before

the demerger.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note 1:	There is an exception: see section&#160;125-75\. Note 2:	Dual listed company voting shares are not treated as ownership interests: see section&#160;125-60\. Note 3:	Fractional interests will generally not affect your ability to choose a roll-over. Example:	To continue the example from subsection&#160;(1), Company A concludes, given the circumstances of the demerger, that the market values of Peter's and the other shareholders' shares in A and B are expected to be in proportion with their original interests in Company A, and advises the shareholders of this position.  </dl></dl>
