             (2)  A person is entitled to be paid by the Commonwealth an amount equal to the difference between the amount payable for the supply of a pharmaceutical benefit on terms that are appropriate for the supply of the benefit to a general patient and an amount equal to the Commonwealth price for the supply of the benefit if:

                     (a)  an approved supplier did not supply the benefit to the person on those terms because the supplier was not satisfied that the person was entitled to receive the benefit on those terms; and

                     (b)  the Secretary is satisfied that the person was entitled at the time to receive the benefit on those terms.

             (3)  Subsection (4) applies if:

                     (a)  under this Act an approved supplier charged a person an amount in respect of a supply of a pharmaceutical benefit; and

                     (b)  at the time of the supply, the person was eligible to be issued with a concession card or an entitlement card but was not the holder of such a card.

             (4)  If the Secretary is satisfied:

                     (a)  that the failure to issue a concession card or entitlement card was not caused by some wilful action of the person; and

                     (b)  that in the circumstances the person should be treated as if:

                              (i)  the person had been at the time when the pharmaceutical benefit was supplied the holder of a concession card or entitlement card; and

                             (ii)  the prescription upon which the pharmaceutical benefit had been supplied were a concession card prescription or entitlement card prescription (as the case may be);

the person is entitled to be paid by the Commonwealth an amount equal to any amount paid by the person that would not have been payable if the pharmaceutical benefit had been supplied on a concession card prescription or an entitlement card prescription (as the case may be).

                            in excess of the maximum quantity or number of units (if any) applicable under a determination of the Minister under subsection 85A(2); or

                     (b)  the pharmaceutical benefit is to be administered in a manner other than the manner (if any) applicable under a determination of the Minister under subsection 85A(2).

PBS prescriber responsible for storage and security

             (3)  A PBS prescriber who, under this section, records and retains medicare numbers, or medicare numbers and expiry dates in relation to those numbers, in the PBS prescriber’s records must ensure:

                     (a)  that the record of those numbers, or numbers and dates, is protected, by such security safeguards as it is reasonable in the circumstances to take, against loss, against unauthorised access, use, modification or disclosure, and against other misuse; and

                     (b)  that if it is necessary for access to the record of those numbers, or numbers and dates, to be given to a person in connection with the provision of services to the PBS prescriber, everything reasonably within the power of the PBS prescriber is done to prevent unauthorised use or disclosure of information contained in that record.

             (4)  Ministerial determinations for the purposes of subsection (1) are disallowable instruments within the meaning of section 46A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

             (1)  Subject to this section, the Secretary may, upon application by a pharmacist for approval to supply pharmaceutical benefits at particular premises, approve that pharmacist for the purpose of supplying pharmaceutical benefits at those premises.

             (2)  Where a pharmacist desires to supply pharmaceutical benefits at more than 1 premises, a separate application shall be made in respect of each of the premises and, where approval is granted in respect of 2 or more premises, a separate approval shall be granted in respect of each of the premises.

             (3)  Subject to this section, where an approved pharmacist desires to supply pharmaceutical benefits at premises other than premises in respect of which approval has been granted, the Secretary may on application by the approved pharmacist, grant approval in respect of those other premises. 

          (3A)   Subject to subsections (3AA) and (3AE), an application under this section must be referred to the Authority.

       (3AA)  Subsection (3A) does not apply to an application for an approval arising out of a change in the ownership of a pharmacy situated at particular premises if the change results or resulted from:

                     (a)  the sale of the pharmacy; or

                     (b)  the acquisition, following the death of a person who was the owner or one of the owners of the pharmacy, of that person’s interest in the business of the pharmacy; or

                     (c)  a change in the constitution of a partnership that owned the pharmacy;

if the pharmacy is to continue to operate at the same premises.

       (3AB)  In subsections (3AA) and (3AE):

                    <a name="pharmaci"></a>**_pharmacy_** means a business in the course of the carrying on of which pharmaceutical benefits are supplied.

       (3AC)  For the purposes of paragraph (3AA)(b), if a person who is the owner or one of the owners of the business of a pharmacy dies, another person will be taken to have acquired the interest of the deceased person only after:

                     (a)  a grant of probate of the will, or letters of administration of the estate, of the owner who has died, by a court of a State or Territory having jurisdiction in relation to the owner; and

                     (b)  the transfer to that other person of that interest.

       (3AD)  Despite the grant of that probate or those letters of administration being taken to have had effect from the date of death of the owner, any permission to supply pharmaceutical benefits at particular premises that is granted under section 91 in respect of:

                     (a)  a period preceding that grant of probate or those letters of administration; or

                     (b)  the premises would not be accessible by members of the public for the purpose of receiving pharmaceutical benefits at times that, in the opinion of the Secretary, are reasonable.

             (4)  Nothing in this section authorizes the Secretary to grant approval to a pharmacist in respect of premises at which that pharmacist is not permitted, under the law of the State or Territory in which the premises are situated, to carry on business.

             (5)  Where the Secretary makes a decision granting or rejecting an application made by a pharmacist under this section, the Secretary shall cause to be served on the pharmacist, notice in writing of that decision.

Note:          In certain circumstances, the Minister may substitute for a decision of the Secretary rejecting an application for approval, a decision granting the approval (see section 90A).

       (5AA)  If, under this section, a pharmacist is granted approval to supply pharmaceutical benefits at particular premises, the pharmacist may also supply pharmaceutical benefits from those premises.

          (5A)  A pharmacist who:

                     (a)  before 18 December 1990, was granted an approval to supply pharmaceutical benefits at or from particular premises; and

                     (b)  supplied pharmaceutical benefits on or before 18 December 1990 from other premises without the Secretary having granted approval under subsection (3) in respect of those other premises;

is to be taken to have been granted in respect of those other premises, or whichever of those premises was the premises from which the pharmacist last supplied pharmaceutical benefits before 18 December 1990, an approval under subsection (3).

          (5B)  The reference in paragraph (5A)(b) to supplying pharmaceutical benefits includes a reference to supplying drugs and medicinal preparations for which payment was made as if they were pharmaceutical benefits.

          (5C)  Subsection (5A) does not apply if:

                     (a)  the approval referred to in paragraph (5A)(a) was not in force immediately before the commencement of section 20 of the _Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993_; or

             (6)  For the purposes of this section, a reference to a pharmacist is taken to include a reference to a person who owns, or is about to own, a business for the supply of pharmaceutical benefits at particular premises.

             (7)  Subsection (6) does not permit an application to be made under subsection (1) by a beneficiary of a deceased approved pharmacist who is not himself or herself a pharmacist before the interest in the business of the deceased pharmacist is transferred to the beneficiary in the course of the administration of the estate of the deceased pharmacist.

             (8)  Nothing in this section prevents the approval of more than one pharmacist for the purpose of supplying pharmaceutical benefits at particular premises.

##### <a id="90A"></a>90A  Minister may substitute decision approving pharmacist

             (1)  This section applies in relation to a decision of the Secretary under section 90 rejecting an application by a pharmacist for approval to supply pharmaceutical benefits at particular premises, if:

                     (b)  the decision was made on the basis that the application did not comply with the requirements of the relevant rules determined by the Minister under section 99L.

             (2)  The Minister may substitute for the Secretary’s decision a decision approving the pharmacist for the purpose of supplying pharmaceutical benefits at the particular premises if the Minister is satisfied that:

                     (b)  by the Minister personally.

             (5)  Subject to subsection 90B(5), the Minister does not have a duty to consider whether to exercise the power under subsection (2) in respect of the Secretary’s decision.

             (7)  A decision by the Minister not to exercise the power under subsection (2) in respect of the Secretary’s decision does not prevent the pharmacist from making an application to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal under subsection 105AB(7) for review of the Secretary’s decision.

             (8)  For the purposes of this section (other than subsection (7)):

                     (a)  a reference to a decision of the Secretary includes a reference to a decision of the Secretary that has been affirmed by a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or an order of a federal court; and

### Division 3A—Price reductions

#### Subdivision A—Preliminary

##### <a id="99AC"></a>99AC  What this Division is about

* * *

This Division is about price reductions for listed brands of pharmaceutical items.

Subdivision B requires there to be at least a 16% price reduction in the price of a new brand of a pharmaceutical item (other than a combination item) when it lists. The listing of the new brand of the pharmaceutical item also provides a trigger for price reductions to occur under Subdivision D (see section 99ACH) for:

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(a)   other existing brands of the

pharmaceutical item; and</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(b)   existing brands of

pharmaceutical items that have the same drug and manner of administration; and</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(c)   existing brands of

pharmaceutical items that have a drug in the same therapeutic group and the

same manner of administration.</li>

Subdivision C sets out the circumstances in which price reductions are required for combination items.

Subdivision CA sets out the circumstances in which price reductions are required for new brands of pharmaceutical items that have the same drug as an existing brand of a pharmaceutical item that is subject to an outstanding staged reduction under section 99ACK. The listing of the new brand or brands also provides a trigger for price reductions to occur under Subdivision D (see sections 99ACM and 99ACN) for existing brands of pharmaceutical items that have that drug.

Subdivision D provides for other price reductions for pharmaceutical items (including for combination items in some cases). These price reductions:

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(a)   are triggered when

Subdivision B applies to require a 16% price reduction to a new brand of a

pharmaceutical item; or</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(b)   are triggered when

Subdivision CA applies to a new brand of a pharmaceutical item that has the

same drug as an existing brand of a pharmaceutical item that is subject to an

outstanding staged reduction; or</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(c)   arise if the pharmaceutical

item has a drug on F2 on a particular day.</li>

The average unadjusted price reduction

             (3)  The **_average unadjusted price reduction_** for all the brands of pharmaceutical items to which this section applies is the percentage worked out as follows:

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.   For each brand of a pharmaceutical item to which this section applies, multiply:

               (a)     the applicable approved ex‑manufacturer price of the brand; by

              (b)     the total number of the supplies of the agreed quantity for the brand that were supplies in respect of which the Commonwealth provided benefits under section 85, during the period of 10 months starting on 1 December 2010.

Step 2.   For each amount worked out under step 1, work out the amount of that step 1 amount that represents a percentage equal to the unadjusted price reduction for the brand.

Step 3.   Divide:

               (a)     the sum of all the amounts worked out under step 2 for all of the brands of pharmaceutical items to which this section applies; by

              (b)     the sum of all the amounts worked out under step 1 for all of those brands.

Step 4.   The amount worked out under step 3, multiplied by 100 and expressed as a percentage, is the **_average unadjusted price reduction_** for all the brands of pharmaceutical items to which this section applies.

* * *

             (4)  For the purposes only of subsection (3), if:

                     (a)  a combination item has a drug to which subsection 85AB(5) applies; and

                     (b)  there is only one listed brand (the **_single brand_**) of the combination item; and

                     (d)  a brand of the pharmaceutical item (a **_related brand_**):

                              (i)  is a brand to which this section applies; and

                             (ii)  has the same manner of administration as the single brand;

then:

                     (e)  the single brand is taken to be a brand of a pharmaceutical item to which this section applies; and

                      (f)  subject to subsection (5), the unadjusted price reduction for the single brand is taken to be the percentage by which the approved ex‑manufacturer price of the single brand would be reduced if the approved price to pharmacists of the brand were to be reduced under section 99ACC to take account of:

                              (i)  the unadjusted price reduction for the related brand being applied to the component drug; and

                             (ii)  in a case where the single brand contains one or more other component drugs in relation to which there are one or more other related brands of pharmaceutical items—the unadjusted price reductions for the other related brands being applied to the other component drugs.

             (5)  The unadjusted price reduction for the single brand is taken to be 0% if the single brand is a brand of a combination item in relation to which the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee has advised the Minister under subsection 101(4AC).

Working out the adjusted approved ex‑manufacturer price

             (6)  If subsection (1) applies in relation to a brand of a pharmaceutical item, the adjusted approved ex‑manufacturer price of the brand is worked out as follows:

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.   Divide 23% by the average unadjusted price reduction, worked out under subsection (3), for all the brands of pharmaceutical items to which this section applies. The result is the **_guaranteed adjustment proportion_**.

Step 2.   For each of those brands of pharmaceutical items, multiply the guaranteed adjustment proportion by the unadjusted price reduction for the brand of the pharmaceutical item.

Step 3.   For each of those brands, reduce the applicable approved ex‑manufacturer price of the brand by the percentage worked out under step 2.

Step 4.   If the lowest price disclosed, in compliance with price disclosure requirements under section 99ADD, for the pharmaceutical item during the period of 10 months starting on 1 December 2010, is higher than the amount worked out under step 3, work out the difference between:

               (a)     the applicable approved ex‑manufacturer price of the brand; and

              (b)     that lowest price;

 expressed as a percentage of that applicable approved ex‑manufacturer price.

Step 5.   The **_GAP‑adjusted reduction_** for the brand is:

               (a)     unless step 4 applies—the percentage worked out under step 2; or

              (b)     if step 4 applies—the percentage worked out under step 4.

Step 6.   Work out, under subsection (3), the average unadjusted price reduction for all the brands of pharmaceutical items to which this section applies, as if the unadjusted price reduction for each brand were the GAP‑adjusted reduction for the brand.

Step 7.   If the average unadjusted price reduction worked out under step 6 is at least 23%, reduce the applicable approved ex‑manufacturer price of the brand by a percentage of that price equal to the GAP‑adjusted reduction for the brand. The result is the **_GAP‑adjusted approved ex‑manufacturer price_** of the brand.

Step 8.   If step 7 applies, the **_adjusted approved ex‑manufacturer price_** of a brand to which this section applies is the GAP‑adjusted approved ex‑manufacturer price of the brand.

Step 9.   If the average unadjusted price reduction worked out under step 6 is less than 23%, repeat steps 1 to 6, as many times as necessary until step 7 is satisfied, as if:

               (a)     the reference in step 1 to the average unadjusted price reduction were a reference to the average unadjusted price reduction last worked out under step 6; and

              (b)     the reference in step 2 to the unadjusted price reduction for a brand of a pharmaceutical item were a reference to the GAP‑adjusted reduction for the brand last worked out under step 5.

* * *

             (7)  However, if, in applying or repeating steps 1 to 6 of the method statement in subsection (6), step 4 of the method statement applies in relation to all the brands of pharmaceutical items to which this section applies:

                     (a)  steps 6 to 9 of the method statement cease to apply; and

                     (b)  the **_adjusted approved ex‑manufacturer price_** of a brand to which this section applies is worked out by reducing the applicable approved ex‑manufacturer price of the brand by a percentage of that price equal to the GAP‑adjusted reduction for the brand last worked out under step 5 of the method statement.

Effect of the unadjusted price reduction for a brand being less than 10%

             (8)  If, but for this subsection, the unadjusted price reduction for a brand of a pharmaceutical item would be less than 10%, the unadjusted price reduction for the brand is taken to be 0% for the purposes of:

                     (a)  working out under subsection (3) the average unadjusted price reduction for all the brands of pharmaceutical items to which this section applies; and

                     (b)  working out under subsection (6) the adjusted approved ex‑manufacturer price of the brand.

The weighted average disclosed price of a brand

             (9)  Until the Minister determines the weighted average disclosed price of a brand of a pharmaceutical item in respect of the period of 10 months ending on 30 September 2011, that weighted average disclosed price is taken, for the purposes of any reference in this section to:

                     (a)  the applicable approved ex‑manufacturer price of the brand; or

                     (b)  the unadjusted price reduction for the brand;

to be the price worked out in accordance with the regulations made for the purposes of subsection 99ADB(6).

           (10)  In any proceeding for the condemnation of substances as forfeited to the Commonwealth, a certificate by the Chief Executive Medicare to the effect that the substances are prescription drugs within the meaning of this Division is prima facie evidence of that matter.

##### <a id="99ZP"></a>99ZP  Right of compensation in certain circumstances for substances destroyed

             (1)  Despite the destruction of drug like substances that are taken to be condemned as forfeited to the Commonwealth under subsection 99ZO(5) because no application for their return was made, a person may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction under this section for compensation in respect of those substances.

             (2)  A right to compensation exists if:

                     (a)  the substances are not prohibited exports; and

                     (b)  the substances were not used or otherwise involved in the commission of an offence; and

                     (c)  the person establishes, to the satisfaction of the court:

                              (i)  that he or she would have had an entitlement to the return of the substances; and

                             (ii)  that there were circumstances providing a reasonable cause for the failure to apply for that return within 60 days after the notice was given to the exporter.

             (3)  If a right to compensation exists under subsection (2), the court must order the payment by the Commonwealth to the person of an amount equal to the market value of the substances at the time of their destruction.

##### <a id="99ZQ"></a>99ZQ  Disposal of forfeited substances

             (1)  If drug like substances:

                     (a)  are taken to have been seized and condemned as forfeited to the Commonwealth under subsection 99ZO(5); or

                     (b)  are actually seized under subsection 99ZO(7) and condemned as forfeited to the Commonwealth under subsection 99ZO(8);

the title to the substances vests in the Commonwealth to the exclusion of all other interests and cannot be called into question.

             (2)  Substances to which subsection (1) applies must be destroyed in accordance with the guidelines issued under section 99ZS.

##### <a id="99ZR"></a>99ZR  Liability for acts done in good faith

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), neither the Commonwealth, the Chief Executive Medicare nor any person performing duty as a Customs officer or as a Departmental employee (within the meaning of the _Human Services (Medicare) Act 1973_) is liable for any act done in good faith by such a Customs officer, by the Chief Executive Medicare, or by such an employee in the performance of functions or duties, or the exercise of powers, under this Division.

             (2)  If drug like substances that the Chief Executive Medicare would, but for the operation of this subsection, be obliged under subsection 99ZO(2) or (7) to return or reconsign:

                     (a)  have ceased to be usable because of effluxion of time or otherwise; or

                     (b)  have been lost;

the Chief Executive Medicare is not required to return or reconsign the substances but, if the exporter seeks compensation under this subsection, must pay the exporter such amount as is agreed between the exporter and the Chief Executive Medicare, or, failing agreement, as is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, to cover the cost to the exporter:

                     (c)  of replacing the substances; and

                     (d)  if the substances would, but for their detention, have been carried or sent by the exporter to a place outside Australia and the exporter continues to require that the substances are sent to that place—of sending the substances to that place.

##### <a id="99ZS"></a>99ZS  Guidelines for detention of, dealing with, and disposal of, substances

             (1)  The CEO of Customs may, by notice in writing, issue guidelines for the performance of functions and duties, and for the exercise of powers, by Customs officers, in relation to matters arising under this Division including, in particular, matters relating to:

                     (a)  dealing with drug like substances transferred to the Chief Executive Medicare by Customs officers; and

                     (b)  dealing with claims for the return of such substances; and

                     (c)  if it is required to dispose of such substances—the manner of their disposal; and

                     (d)  if such substances are found on examination to be prohibited exports—the transfer of those substances, and any documents relating to them, to the agency nominated in the guidelines to deal with prohibited exports of that kind.

             (3)  At any time, the CEO of Customs or the Chief Executive Medicare may, by written notice, issue further guidelines that vary or revoke the existing guidelines.

                     (b)  the substances are prescription drugs and the exporter establishes:

                              (i)  that no Commonwealth benefit has been paid or is payable; or 

                             (ii)  that the substances are for the personal use of the exporter, of a person accompanying the exporter or of a person covered by paragraph 86A(2)(a), (b) or (c).
