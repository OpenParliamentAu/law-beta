    <i>Core provisions</i>

    <b>
      <i>Depreciating assets</i>
    </b>are assets with a limited effective life that are reasonably expected
    to decline in value.

Broadly, the
    <b>
      <i>effective life</i>
    </b>of a depreciating asset is the period it can be used to produce income.

The
    <b>
      <i>decline in value</i>
    </b>is based on the cost and effective life of the depreciating asset, not
    its actual change in value. It begins at
    <b>
      <i>start time</i>
    </b>, when you begin to use the asset (or when you have it installed ready
    for use). It continues while you use the asset (or have it installed).

Usually, the owner of a depreciating asset
    <b>
      <i>holds</i>
    </b>the asset and can therefore claim deductions for its decline in value.
    Sometimes the economic owner will be different to the legal owner and the
    economic owner will be the holder.

    <i>Cost</i>

The

      <i>cost</i>
    </b>of a depreciating asset includes both:

* expenses you incur to start holding the asset; and

* additional expenses that contribute to its present condition and location
    (e.g. improvements).

When you stop holding a depreciating asset you may have to include an
    amount in your assessable income, or deduct an amount under a
    <b>
      <i>balancing adjustment</i>
    </b>. The adjustment reconciles the decline with the actual change in value.

**Operative provisions**

**40-25  Deducting amounts for depreciating assets**

_You deduct the decline in value_

	(1)	You can deduct an amount equal to the decline in value for an income year (as worked out under this Division) of a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset that you <sup>*</sup>held for any time during the year.

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Note 1:	Sections&#160;40-70 and 40-75 show you how to work out

the decline for most depreciating assets. There is a limit on the decline: see

subsections 40-70(3) and 40-75(7).</dd> Note 2:	STS taxpayers work out the amount they can deduct under Division&#160;328\. Note 3:	Generally, only one taxpayer can deduct amounts for a depreciating asset. However, if you and another taxpayer jointly hold the asset, each of you deduct amounts for it: see section&#160;40-35.</dl> _Reduction of deduction_

	(2)	You must reduce your deduction by the part of the asset's decline in value that is attributable to your use of the asset, or your having it <sup>*</sup>installed ready for use, for a purpose other than a <sup>*</sup>taxable purpose.

<center>Back to Top</center>

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Example:	Ben holds a depreciating asset that he uses for private

purposes for 30% of his total use in the income year.</dd> 	If the asset declines by $1,000 for the year, Ben would have to reduce his deduction by $300 (30% of $1,000).</dl> _Further reduction: leisure facilities and boats_

	(3)	You may have to make a further reduction for a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset that is a <sup>*</sup>leisure facility or a boat attributable to your use of it, or your having it <sup>*</sup>installed ready for use, for a <sup>*</sup>taxable purpose.
 	(4)	That reduction is the part of the asset's decline in value that is attributable to your use of the asset, or your having it <sup>*</sup>installed ready for use, at a time when:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>its use did not constitute a <sup>*</sup>fringe benefit; or</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>for a <sup>*</sup>leisure facility&#151;you did not use it or hold it for use as mentioned in paragraph 26-50(3)(b) (about using it in the course of your business or for your employees); or</dd> <dt>(c)</dt><dd>for a boat&#151;you did not use it or hold it for use as mentioned in paragraph 26-50(5)(b), (c) or (d) (about using it mainly for letting on hire, mainly for transporting the public or goods for payment or for a purpose that is essential to the efficient conduct of your business).</dd> </dl></dl>

_Exception: low-value pools_

	(5)	Subsections&#160;(2), (3) and (4) do not apply to <sup>*</sup>depreciating assets allocated to a low-value pool.

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Note:	See Subdivision&#160;40-E for low-value

pools.</dd></dl> _Exception: Use of 1/3 of actual expenses method for a car_

	(6)	Subsections&#160;(2), (3) and (4) do not apply to a <sup>*</sup>car for an income year for which you use the "one-third of actual expenses" method. Instead, you reduce your deduction by <sup>2</sup>/3 of the car's decline in value.

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Note:	See Division&#160;28 for that

method.</dd></dl> _Meaning of taxable purpose_

	(7)	A **_taxable purpose_** is:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>the <sup>*</sup>purpose of producing assessable income; or</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>the purpose of <sup>*</sup>exploration or prospecting; or</dd> <dt>(c)</dt><dd>the purpose of <sup>*</sup>mining site rehabilitation; or</dd> <dt>(d)</dt><dd><sup>*</sup>environmental protection activities.</dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Note:	Where you have had a deduction under this Division an

amount may be included in your assessable income if the expenditure was

financed by limited recourse debt that has terminated: see Division&#160;243.

</dd></dl> **40-30  What a _depreciating asset_ is** 	(1)	A **_depreciating asset_** is an asset that has a limited <sup>*</sup>effective life and can reasonably be expected to decline in value over the time it is used, except:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>land; or</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>an item of <sup>*</sup>trading stock; or</dd> <dt>(c)</dt><dd>an intangible asset, unless it is mentioned in subsection&#160;(2).</dd> </dl></dl>

	(2)	These intangible assets are **_depreciating assets_** if they are not <sup>*</sup>trading stock:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd><sup>*</sup>mining, quarrying or prospecting rights;</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd><sup>*</sup>mining, quarrying or prospecting information;</dd> <dt>(c)</dt><dd>items of <sup>*</sup>intellectual property;</dd> <dt>(d)</dt><dd><sup>*</sup>in-house software;</dd> <dt>(e)</dt><dd><sup>*</sup>IRUs;</dd> <dt>(f)</dt><dd><sup>*</sup>spectrum licences;</dd> <dt>(g)</dt><dd><sup>*</sup>datacasting transmitter licences.</dd> </dl></dl>

	(3)	This Division applies to an improvement to land, or a fixture on land, whether the improvement or fixture is removable or not, as if it were an asset separate from the land.

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Note 1:	Whether such an asset is a depreciating asset depends on

whether it falls within the definition in subsection&#160;(1).</dd> Note 2:	This Division does not apply to capital works for which you can deduct amounts under Division&#160;43: see subsection 40-45(2).</dl> 
<center>Back to Top</center>
 	(4)	Whether a particular composite item is itself a **_depreciating asset_** or whether its components are separate **_depreciating assets_** is a question of fact and degree which can only be determined in the light of all the circumstances of the particular case.

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Example 1:	A car is made up of many separate components, but

usually the car is a depreciating asset rather than each component.</dd> Example 2:	A floating restaurant consists of many separate components (like the ship itself, stoves, fridges, furniture, crockery and cutlery), but usually these components are treated as separate depreciating assets.</dl> 	(5)	This Division applies to a renewal or extension of a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset that is a right as if the renewal or extension were a continuation of the original right. 

**40-35  Jointly held depreciating assets**

	(1)	This Division and Division&#160;328 apply to a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset (the **_underlying asset_**) that you <sup>*</sup>hold, and that is also held by one or more other entities, as if _your interest in_ the underlying asset were itself the underlying asset.

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Note:	Partners do not hold partnership assets: see

section&#160;40-40.</dd></dl> 	(2)	As a result, the decline in value of the underlying asset is not itself taken into account.

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Example:	Buford Corp owns an office block that it leases to 2

companies, Smokey Pty Ltd and Bandit Pty Ltd. Smokey and Bandit decide to

install a fountain in front of the building.</dd> 	They discuss it with Buford who agrees to pay half the cost (because the fountain won't be removable at the end of the lease). Smokey and Bandit split the rest of the cost between them. 	Smokey and Bandit would each hold the asset under item&#160;3 of the table in section&#160;40-40 and Buford would hold it under item&#160;10\. They would be joint holders, so each would write-off its _interest_ in the fountain. </dl> **40-40  Meaning of _hold_ a depreciating asset** 		Use this table to work out who **_holds_** a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset. An entity identified in column 3 of an item in the table as _not_ **_holding_** a depreciating asset cannot **_hold_** the asset under another item.

Example 1:	Power Finance leases a luxury car to Kris who

subleases it to Rachael. As lessee, item&#160;1 makes Rachael the holder of the

car. Power, as the legal owner, would normally hold the car under

item&#160;10.</dd> 	However, item&#160;1 makes it clear that Power, as lessor, does _not_ hold the car. As the lessee, item&#160;1 would normally mean that Kris held the car but, again, she is also a lessor and so is not the holder (she also doesn't have the right to use the car during the sublease). Example 2:	Sandra sells a packing machine to Jenny under a hire purchase agreement. Jenny holds the machine under item&#160;6 because, although she is not the legal owner until she exercises her option to purchase, she possesses the machine now and can exercise an option to become its legal owner. 	Jenny is reasonably expected to exercise that option because the final payment will be well below the expected market value of the machine at the end of the agreement. Sandra, as the machine's legal owner, would normally be its holder under item&#160;10 but item&#160;6 makes it clear that the legal owner is _not_ the holder. Note 1:	Some assets may have holders under more than one item in the table. Note 2:	As well as hire purchase agreements, items&#160;5 and 6 cover cases like assets subject to chattel mortgages, sales subject to retention of title clauses and assets subject to bare trusts. </dl> **40-45  Assets to which this Division does not apply** _Research and development_

	(1)	This Division does not apply to <sup>*</sup>plant that you have used or had <sup>*</sup>installed ready for use exclusively for the purpose of carrying on <sup>*</sup>research and development activities unless you have elected under subsection 73B(18) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ that the research and development provisions do not apply to it.

_Capital works_

	(2)	This Division does not apply to capital works for which you can deduct amounts under Division&#160;43, or for which you could deduct amounts under that Division but for expenditure being incurred, or capital works being started, before a particular day.

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Note:	Section&#160;43-20 lists the capital works to which that

Division applies.</dd></dl> _IRUs_

	(3)	This Division does not apply to an <sup>*</sup>IRU to the extent to which expenditure on the IRU was incurred at or before 11.45 am, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 21&#160;September 1999 (the **_IRU time_**).
 	(4)	This Division does not apply to an <sup>*</sup>IRU over an international telecommunications submarine cable system if the system had been used for telecommunications purposes at or before the IRU time.

_Films_

	(5)	This Division does not apply to a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset if you or another taxpayer has deducted or can deduct amounts for it under:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>Division&#160;10BA of Part&#160;III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (about Australian films); or</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>Division&#160;10B of Part&#160;III of that Act if the depreciating asset relates to a copyright in an Australian film within the meaning of that Division. </dd> </dl></dl>

**40-50  Assets for which you deduct under another Subdivision**

	(1)	You cannot deduct an amount for a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset under this Subdivision if you or another taxpayer has deducted or can deduct amounts for it under Subdivision&#160;40-F (about primary production depreciating assets) or 40-G (about capital expenditure of primary producers and other landholders).
 	(2)	You cannot deduct an amount for <sup>*</sup>in-house software under this Subdivision if you have allocated expenditure on the software to a software development pool under Subdivision&#160;40-E. 

**40-55  Use of certain car methods**

		You cannot deduct any amount for the decline in value of a <sup>*</sup>car for an income year if you use the "cents per kilometre" method, or the "12% of original value" method, for the car for that year.

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Note:	See Division&#160;28 for those methods.

</dd></dl> **40-60  When a depreciating asset starts to decline in value** 	(1)	A <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset you <sup>*</sup>hold starts to decline in value from when its <sup>*</sup>start time occurs.
 	(2)	The **_start time_** of a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset is when you first use it, or have it <sup>*</sup>installed ready for use, for any purpose.

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Note:	Previous use by a transition entity is ignored: see

section&#160;58-70.</dd></dl> 
<center>Back to Top</center>
 	(3)	However, there is another **_start time_** for a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset you <sup>*</sup>hold if a <sup>*</sup>balancing adjustment event referred to in paragraph 40-295(1)(b) occurs for the asset and you start to use the asset again. Its second **_start time_** is when you start using it again. 

**40-65  Choice of methods to work out the decline in value**

	(1)	You have a choice of 2 methods to work out the decline in value of a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset. You must choose to use either the <sup>*</sup>diminishing value method or the <sup>*</sup>prime cost method.

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Note 1:	Once you make the choice for an asset, you cannot change

it: see section&#160;40-130.</dd> Note 2:	For the diminishing value method, see section&#160;40-70\. For the prime cost method, see section&#160;40-75\. Note 3:	In some cases you do not have to make the choice because you can deduct the asset's cost: see section&#160;40-80.</dl> _Exception: asset acquired from associate_

	(2)	For a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset that you acquire from an <sup>*</sup>associate of yours where the associate has deducted or can deduct an amount for the asset under this Division, you must use the same method that the associate was using.

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Note:	You can require the associate to tell you which method the

associate was using: see section&#160;40-140.</dd></dl> _Exception: holder changes but user same or associate of former user_

	(3)	For a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset that you acquire from a former <sup>*</sup>holder of the asset, you must use the same method that the former holder was using for the asset if:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>the former holder or another entity (each of which is the **_former user_**) was using the asset at a time before you became the holder; and</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>while you hold the asset, the former user or an <sup>*</sup>associate of the former user uses the asset.</dd> </dl></dl>

	(4)	However, you must use the <sup>*</sup>diminishing value method if:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>you do not know, and cannot readily find out, which method the former

holder was using; or</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>the former holder did not use a method.</dd> </dl></dl>

_Exception: low-value pools_

	(5)	You work out the decline in value of a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset in a low-value pool under Subdivision&#160;40-E rather than under this Subdivision. 

**40-70  Diminishing value method**

	(1)	You work out the decline in value of a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset for an income year using the **_diminishing value method_** in this way:

	(6)	Instead of the asset's <sup>*</sup>effective life under the table in subsection 40-95(7), you use the number of years remaining in that effective life as at the start of the income year in which you acquire the asset.

_Limit on decline_

	(7)	The decline in value of a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset under this section for an income year cannot be more than:

_Depreciating assets used for certain purposes_

	(2)	The decline in value of a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset you start to <sup>*</sup>hold in an income year is the asset's <sup>*</sup>cost if:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Note 1:	The opening adjustable value of a depreciating asset is

reduced by an amount applied in reduction of deductible expenditure under the

debt forgiveness provisions: see section&#160;40-90.</dd> Note 2:	The opening adjustable value of a depreciating asset for which a balancing adjustment event occurs because you still hold the asset and you expect not to use it is affected by subsection 40-285(4). </dl> **40-90  Debt forgiveness** 	(1)	This section applies if an amount (the **_debt forgiveness amount_**) is applied in reduction of deductible expenditure for a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset in an income year (within the meaning of Division&#160;245 of Schedule&#160;2C to the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) under section&#160;245-155 of that Schedule.

 (8)	The **_effective life_** of an intangible <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset that is not mentioned in the table in subsection&#160;(7) and is not an <sup>*</sup>IRU (for example, a <sup>*</sup>mining, quarrying or prospecting right) cannot be longer than the term of the asset as extended by any reasonably assured extension or renewal of that term.
 	(9)	The **_effective life_** of an <sup>*</sup>IRU is the <sup>*</sup>effective life of the international telecommunications submarine cable over which the IRU is granted. 

**40-100  Commissioner's determination of effective life**

	(1)	The Commissioner may make a written determination specifying the **_effective life_** of <sup>*</sup>depreciating assets. The determination may specify conditions for particular depreciating assets.
 	(2)	A determination may specify a day from which it takes effect for <sup>*</sup>depreciating assets specified in the determination.
 	(3)	A determination may operate retrospectively to a day specified in the determination if:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>there was no applicable determination at that day for the

<sup>*</sup>depreciating asset covered by the determination; or</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>the determination specifies a shorter <sup>*</sup>effective life for the depreciating asset covered by the determination than was previously applicable.</dd> </dl></dl>

	(4)	The Commissioner is to make a determination of the **_effective life_** of a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset by estimating the period (in years, including fractions of years) it can be used by any entity for a <sup>*</sup>taxable purpose or for the purpose of producing <sup>*</sup>exempt income:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>assuming it will be subject to wear and tear at a rate that is reasonable

for the Commissioner to assume; and</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>assuming it will be maintained in reasonably good order and condition; and</dd> <dt>(c)</dt><dd>having regard to the period within which it is likely to be scrapped, sold for no more than scrap value or abandoned. </dd> </dl></dl>

**40-105  Self-assessing effective life**

	(1)	You work out the **_effective life_** of a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset yourself by estimating the period (in years, including fractions of years) it can be used by any entity for a <sup>*</sup>taxable purpose or for the purpose of producing <sup>*</sup>exempt income:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>having regard to the wear and tear you reasonably expect from your

expected circumstances of use; and</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>assuming that it will be maintained in reasonably good order and condition.</dd> </dl></dl>

	(2)	If, in working out that period, you conclude that the asset would be likely to be scrapped, sold for no more than scrap value or abandoned before the end of that period, its **_effective life_** ends at the earlier time.
 	(3)	You work out the period in subsection&#160;(1) or (2) as from the <sup>*</sup>start time of the <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset.

_Exception: intangibles_

	(4)	This section does not apply to an intangible <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset mentioned in the table in subsection 40-95(7). 

**40-110  Recalculating effective life**

	(1)	You may choose to recalculate the <sup>*</sup>effective life of a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset from a later income year if the effective life you have been using is no longer accurate because of changed circumstances relating to the nature of the use of the asset.

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Example:	Some examples of changes in circumstances that may

result in your recalculating the effective life of a depreciating asset

are:</dd></dl> *	your use of the asset turns out to be more or less rigorous than you expected (or was anticipated by the Commissioner's determination);
 *	there is a downturn in demand for the goods or services the asset is used to produce that will result in the asset being scrapped;
 *	legislation prevents the asset's continued use;
 *	changes in technology make the asset redundant.

	(2)	You must recalculate a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset's <sup>*</sup>effective life from a later income year if:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>you:</dd> </dl></dl>

<center>Back to Top</center>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(i)</dt><dd>self-assessed its effective life; or</dd>

<dt>(ii)</dt><dd>are using an effective life worked out under section&#160;40-100 (about

<dt>(iii)</dt><dd>are using an effective life because of subsection 40-95(4) or (5); and</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>its <sup>*</sup>cost is increased in that year by at least 10%.</dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Note 1:	You may conclude that the effective life is the same.</dd> Note 2:	For the elements of the cost of a depreciating asset, see Subdivision&#160;40-C. Example 1:	Paul purchases a photocopier and self-assesses its effective life at 6 years. In a later year he incurs expenditure to increase the quality of the reproductions it makes. He recalculates its effective life, but concludes that it remains the same. Example 2:	Fiona also purchases a photocopier and self-assesses its effective life at 6 years. In a later year she incurs expenditure to incorporate a more robust paper handling system. She recalculates its effective life, and concludes that it is increased to 7 years.</dl> 	(3)	You must recalculate a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset's <sup>*</sup>effective life for the income year in which you started to <sup>*</sup>hold it if:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>you are using an effective life because of subsection 40-95(4) or (5);

and</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>the asset's <sup>*</sup>cost is increased after you started to hold it in that year by at least 10%.</dd> </dl></dl>

	(4)	A recalculation under this section must be done using section&#160;40-105 (about self-assessing effective life).

_Exception: intangibles_

	(5)	This section does not apply to an intangible <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset mentioned in the table in subsection 40-95(7). 

**40-115  Splitting a depreciating asset**

	(1)	If a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset you <sup>*</sup>hold is split into 2 or more assets, this Division applies as if you had stopped holding the original asset and started holding the assets into which it is split.

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Note 1:	For the cost of the split assets, see

section&#160;40-205.</dd> Note 2:	A balancing adjustment event does not occur just because you split a depreciating asset: see section&#160;40-295.</dl> 	(2)	If you stop <sup>*</sup>holding part of a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset, this Division applies as if, just before you stopped holding that part, you had split the original asset into the part you stopped holding and the rest of the original asset. (The rest of the original asset is then taken to be a different asset from the original asset.)

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Example:	Bronwyn sells Tim a part interest in a depreciating

asset she owns. They become joint holders under section&#160;40-35\. She is

taken to have split the underlying asset into the interest she retains and the

interest Tim buys. She now holds an interest (a new depreciating asset) in the

underlying asset and is taken to have stopped holding the interest

sold.</dd></dl> 	(3)	If you grant or assign an interest in an item of <sup>*</sup>intellectual property, subsection&#160;(2) applies to you as if you had stopped <sup>*</sup>holding part of the item. 

**40-120  Replacement spectrum licences**

	(1)	If:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>some (but not all) of a <sup>*</sup>spectrum licence you <sup>*</sup>hold

is assigned or resumed; and</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>your original licence is replaced by one or more other spectrum licences (possibly including a modified version of your original licence); and</dd> <dt>(c)</dt><dd>the replacement licences together cover exactly the same rights as were covered by your original licence just after the assignment or resumption;</dd> </dl></dl>

<def><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

this Division applies as if your original licence (as it existed just after the

assignment or resumption) had been split into the replacement licences.

 </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Example:	MGP Communications Ltd buys a spectrum licence on

1&#160;July 2003 for $5 million. The licence specifies areas A, B, C and D. The

company assigns the spectrum relating to area C. Area C represents 20% of the

market value of the overall licence. $1m of the adjustable value is allocated

to it and $4m is allocated to the remaining licence.</dd> 	The Australian Communication Authority adjusts the licence to specify only areas A and B, and issues a new licence specifying area D. 	Area D represents 25% of the market value of the spectrum remaining in the licence. The adjustable value of the new licence is therefore $1m and the adjustable value of the original (modified) licence is $3m.</dl> 
<center>Back to Top</center>
 	(2)	If a <sup>*</sup>spectrum licence you <sup>*</sup>hold is replaced by 2 or more spectrum licences (possibly including a modified version of your original licence) that together cover exactly the same rights as your original licence, this Division applies as if the original licence had been split into the replacement licences. 

**40-125  Merging depreciating assets**

		If a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset or assets that you <sup>*</sup>hold is or are merged into another depreciating asset, this Division applies as if you had stopped holding the original asset or assets and started holding the merged asset.

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Note 1:	For the cost of the merged asset, see

section&#160;40-210.</dd> Note 2:	A balancing adjustment event does not occur just because you merge depreciating assets: see section&#160;40-295\. </dl> **40-130  Choices** 	(1)	A choice you can make under this Division about a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset must be made:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>by the day you lodge your <sup>*</sup>income tax return for the income

year to which the choice relates; or</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>within a further time allowed by the Commissioner.</dd> </dl></dl>

	(2)	Your choice, once made, applies to that income year and all later income years.

_Exception: recalculating effective life_

	(3)	However, subsection&#160;(2) does not apply to a choice to recalculate the <sup>*</sup>effective life of a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset under section&#160;40-110\. 

**40-135  Certain anti-avoidance provisions**

		These anti-avoidance provisions:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>section&#160;51AD (Deductions not allowable in respect of property under

certain leveraged arrangements) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_;</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>Division&#160;16D (Certain arrangements relating to the use of property) of Part&#160;III of that Act;</dd> </dl></dl>

<def><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

apply to your deductions under this Division for a <sup>*</sup>depreciating

asset you <sup>*</sup>hold as if you were the owner of the asset instead of any

other person.

 </dl></dl>

**40-140  Getting tax information from associates**

	(1)	If you acquire a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset from an <sup>*</sup>associate of yours where the associate has deducted or can deduct an amount for the asset under this Division, you may give the associate a written notice requiring the associate to tell you:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>the method the associate was using to work out the decline in value of the

asset; and</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>the <sup>*</sup>effective life the associate was using.</dd> </dl></dl>

	(2)	The notice must:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>be given within 60 days of your acquiring the asset; and</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>specify a period of at least 60 days within which the information must be given; and</dd> <dt>(c)</dt><dd>set out the effect of subsection&#160;(3).</dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Note:	Subsections&#160;(4) and (5) explain how this subsection

operates if the associate is a partnership.</dd></dl> _Requirement to comply with notice_

	(3)	The <sup>*</sup>associate must not intentionally refuse or fail to comply with the notice.

Penalty:	10 penalty units.

_Giving the notice to a partnership_

	(4)	If the <sup>*</sup>associate is a partnership:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>you may give it to the partnership by giving it to any of the partners

(this does not limit how else you can give it); and</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>the obligation to comply with the notice is imposed on each of the partners (not on the partnership), but may be discharged by any of them.</dd> </dl></dl>

	(5)	A partner must not intentionally refuse or fail to comply with that

 obligation, unless another partner has already complied with it.

Penalty:	10 penalty units.

_Limits on giving a notice_

	(6)	Only one notice can be given in relation to the same <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset. 

**40-145  Application of _Criminal Code_**

_\[This is the end of the Guide.]_

**Operative provisions**

**40-175  Cost**

		The **_cost_** of a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset you <sup>*</sup>hold consists of 2 elements. 

**40-180  First element of cost**

	(1)	The first element is worked out as at the time when you began to <sup>*</sup>hold the <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset (except for a case to which item&#160;3 or 4 of the table in subsection&#160;(2) applies). It is:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>if an item in that table applies&#151;the amount specified in that item; or</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>otherwise&#151;the amount you are taken to have paid to hold the asset under section&#160;40-185.</dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Note:	The first element of the cost may be modified by a later

provision in this Subdivision.</dd></dl> 	(2)	If more than one item in this table covers the asset, apply the last item that covers it.

**40-185  Amount you are taken to have paid to hold a depreciating asset or to receive a benefit**

	(1)	This Division applies to you as if you had paid, to <sup>*</sup>hold a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset or for an economic benefit for such an asset, the greater of these amounts:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>the sum of the amounts that would have been included in your assessable

because you gave something to start holding the asset or receive the benefit,

included; or</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>the sum of the applicable amounts set out in this table for holding the asset or receiving the benefit.</dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Example:	Gold Medals Ltd manufactures some medals for a local

sporting association's annual meeting in return for a die cut stamping machine.

The medals have a market value of $20,000\. The machine has an arm's length

value of $100,000 but Gold Medals has to contribute $75,000 towards acquiring

it from the association. Gold Medals will have to

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

	in its assessable income because of section&#160;21A of the

_Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.</dd> 	The first element of the machine's cost will be the greater of:</dl> *	the amount it paid ($75,000) plus the market value of the non-cash benefits it provided ($20,000), which comes to $95,000; and

**40-195  Apportionment of cost**

		If you pay an amount for 2 or more things that include at least one <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset, or that include a contribution to bringing a depreciating asset to its present condition and location, you take into account as part of its <sup>*</sup>cost only that part of what you paid that is reasonably attributable to the asset.

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Example:	Ian buys 3 assets (one depreciating asset and 2 other

assets) under the one transaction. He pays $30,000 for the 3 assets. $25,000 of

that amount is reasonably attributable to the depreciating asset.</dd> 	The first element of the depreciating asset's _cost_ is $25,000\. </dl> 
<center>Back to Top</center>
 **40-200  Exclusion from cost** 		The <sup>*</sup>cost of a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset that is not <sup>*</sup>plant does not include any amount that was incurred:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>before 1&#160;July 2001; or</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>under a contract entered into before that day. </dd> </dl></dl>

**40-205  Cost of a split depreciating asset**

		If you split a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset into separate assets as mentioned in section&#160;40-115, the first element of the **_cost_** of each of the separate assets is a reasonable proportion of the sum of these amounts:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

split; and</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>the amount you are taken to have paid under section&#160;40-185 for any economic benefit involved in splitting the original asset.</dd> </dl></dl>

Example:	Barry owns a spectrum licence that covers 3 areas: Area

**40-215  Adjustment: double deduction**

	(1)	Each element of the <sup>*</sup>cost of a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset is reduced by any portion of that element of cost that you have deducted or can deduct, or that has been or will be taken into account in working out an amount you can deduct, other than under this Division.

 **Guide to Subdivision&#160;40-D**

**40-280  What this Subdivision is about**

You may have to make an adjustment to your taxable income if you stop holding a depreciating asset.
 The adjustment is generally based on the difference between the actual value of the asset when you stop holding it and its adjustable value.

**Operative provisions**

**40-285  Balancing adjustments**

	(1)	An amount is included in your assessable income if:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>a <sup>*</sup>balancing adjustment event occurs for a

<sup>*</sup>depreciating asset you <sup>*</sup>held and:</dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(i)</dt><dd>whose decline in value you worked out under Subdivision&#160;40-B; or</dd>

<dt>(ii)</dt><dd>whose decline in value you would have worked out under that Subdivision

if you had used the asset; and</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>the asset's <sup>*</sup>termination value is more than its

<sup>*</sup>adjustable value just before the event occurred.</dd> </dl></dl>

<def><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

The amount included is the difference between those amounts, and it is included

for the income year in which the balancing adjustment event occurred.

 </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Note 1:	The most common balancing adjustment event is where you

sell the depreciating asset.</dd> Note 2:	There is a different calculation if you had used different car expense methods for a car: see section&#160;40-370.</dl> 	(2)	You can deduct an amount if:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>a <sup>*</sup>balancing adjustment event occurs for a

<sup>*</sup>depreciating asset you <sup>*</sup>held and:</dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(i)</dt><dd>whose decline in value you worked out under Subdivision&#160;40-B; or</dd>

<dt>(ii)</dt><dd>whose decline in value you would have worked out under that Subdivision

if you had used the asset; and</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

<center>Back to Top</center>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>the asset's <sup>*</sup>termination value is less than its

<sup>*</sup>adjustable value just before the event occurred.</dd> </dl></dl>

<def><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

The amount you can deduct is the difference between those amounts, and you can

deduct it for the income year in which the balancing adjustment event occurred.

 </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Note:	There is a different calculation if you had used different

car expense methods for a car: see

section&#160;40-370.</dd></dl> 	(3)	The <sup>*</sup>adjustable value of a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset you <sup>*</sup>hold after this section applies to it is then zero.
 	(4)	However, subsection&#160;(3) does not apply to a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset for which you have a <sup>*</sup>cost under item&#160;3 or 4 of the table in subsection 40-180(2). Instead, the asset's <sup>*</sup>opening adjustable value for the income year (the **_later year_**) after the one in which the <sup>*</sup>balancing adjustment event occurred is that cost plus any amounts included in the second element of that cost after the event occurred and before the start of the later year.

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Note:	Those items deal with a case where a balancing adjustment

event happens because you still hold an asset you expected not to use.

</dd></dl> **40-290  Reduction for non-taxable use** 	(1)	You must reduce the amount (the **_balancing adjustment amount_**) included in your assessable income, or the amount you can deduct, under section&#160;40-285 for a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset if your deductions for the asset have been reduced under section&#160;40-25.
 	(2)	The reduction is:

**_total decline_** is the sum of:

	(3)	You must further reduce the amount included in your assessable income, or the amount you can deduct, under section&#160;40-285 for a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset (the **_current asset_**) if:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>the asset's <sup>*</sup>cost (for you) was worked out under

section&#160;40-205 (Cost of a split depreciating asset) or 40-210 (Cost of

merged depreciating assets); and</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>you used the depreciating asset from which the current asset was split, or a depreciating asset that was merged into the current asset, or had it <sup>*</sup>installed ready for use, for a purpose other than a <sup>*</sup>taxable purpose.</dd> </dl></dl>

	(4)	The further reduction is such amount as is reasonable having regard to the extent of the use referred to in paragraph&#160;(3)(b).

_Exception: mining, quarrying or prospecting information_

	(5)	This section does not apply to <sup>*</sup>mining, quarrying or prospecting information. 

**40-295  Meaning of _balancing adjustment event_**

	(1)	A **_balancing adjustment event_** occurs for a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset if:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>you stop <sup>*</sup>holding the asset; or</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>you stop using it, or having it <sup>*</sup>installed ready for use, for any purpose and you expect never to use it, or have it installed ready for use, again; or</dd> <dt>(c)</dt><dd>you have not used it and:</dd> </dl></dl>

installed; and</dd>

<dt>(ii)</dt><dd>you decide never to use it.</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Note:	A balancing adjustment event occurs under paragraph

40-295(1)(a) when you start holding a depreciating asset as trading

stock.</dd></dl> 	(2)	A **_balancing adjustment event_** occurs for a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset if:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>for any reason, a change occurs in the <sup>*</sup>holding of, or in the

interests of entities in, the asset; and</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>the entity or one of the entities that held the asset before the change has an interest in it after the change; and</dd> <dt>(c)</dt><dd>the asset was a partnership asset before the change or becomes one as a result of the change.</dd> </dl></dl>

	(3)	However, a **_balancing adjustment event_** does not occur for a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset merely because you split it into 2 or more depreciating assets or you merge it with one or more other depreciating assets.

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Note:	A balancing adjustment event will occur if you stop holding

part of a depreciating asset.

</dd></dl> **40-300  Meaning of _termination value_** 	(1)	The **_termination value_** of a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset is worked out as at the time when the <sup>*</sup>balancing adjustment event occurs. It is:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>if an item in the table in subsection&#160;(2) applies&#151;the amount

specified in that item; or</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>otherwise&#151;the amount you are taken to have received under section&#160;40-305 for the asset.</dd> </dl></dl>

Note:	Section&#160;40-345 sets out what the relief

is.</dd></dl> 	(2)	In applying an item in the table in subsection&#160;(1), disregard the following so far as they relate to the <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset you disposed of:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>an exemption in Division&#160;118 (which contains the general exemptions

from CGT); and</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>subsection 122-25(3) (which excludes certain assets from roll-over relief under Subdivision&#160;122-A).</dd> </dl></dl>

_Choosing roll-over relief_

	(3)	There is also roll-over relief if:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>there is a <sup>*</sup>balancing adjustment event for a

<sup>*</sup>depreciating asset because of subsection 40-295(2) (about a change

in the holding of, or in interests in, the asset); and</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>the entity or entities that <sup>*</sup>held the asset before the change (also the **_transferor_**) and the entity or entities that have an interest in the asset after the change (also the **_transferee_**) jointly choose the roll-over relief.</dd> </dl></dl>

<center>Back to Top</center>

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Example:	The change could be a variation in the constitution of a

partnership or in the interests of the partners.</dd> Note:	Section&#160;40-345 sets out what the relief is.</dl> 	(4)	The choice must:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>be in writing; and</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>contain enough information about the transferor's holding of the property for the transferee to work out how this Division applies to the transferee's holding of the <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset; and</dd> <dt>(c)</dt><dd>be made within 6 months after the end of the transferee's income year in which the <sup>*</sup>balancing adjustment event occurred, or within a longer period allowed by the Commissioner.</dd> </dl></dl>

	(5)	If a person dies before the end of the time allowed for jointly choosing roll-over relief, the trustee of the person's estate may be a party to the choice.
 	(6)	The transferor must keep the choice or a copy of it for 5 years after the <sup>*</sup>balancing adjustment event occurred.

Penalty:	30 penalty units.

	(7)	The transferee must keep the choice or a copy of it until the end of 5 years after the next <sup>*</sup>balancing adjustment event occurs for the <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset.

Penalty:	30 penalty units.

_Exception: Subdivision 170-D applies_

	(8)	There can be no roll-over relief if Subdivision&#160;170-D (about transactions by a company that is a member of a linked group) applies to the disposal of the <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset or the change in interests in it. 

**40-345  What the roll-over relief is**

	(1)	Section&#160;40-285 does not apply to the <sup>*</sup>balancing adjustment event for the transferor.
 	(2)	The transferee can deduct the decline in value of the <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset using the same method and <sup>*</sup>effective life (or <sup>*</sup>remaining effective life if that method is the <sup>*</sup>prime cost method) that the transferor was using. 

**40-350  Additional consequences**

	(1)	For the purposes of Division&#160;45:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>if the transferor, or a partnership of which the transferor was a member,

leased the <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset to another entity for most of the

time that the transferor or partnership <sup>*</sup>held the asset, the

transferee is taken also to have done so; and</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>if the transferor, or a partnership of which the transferor was a member, leased the asset to another entity for a period on or after 22&#160;February 1999, the transferee is taken also to have done so; and</dd> <dt>(c)</dt><dd>if the main <sup>*</sup>business of the transferor, or a partnership of which the transferor was a member, was to lease assets, the main business of the transferee is taken also to have been to lease assets.</dd> </dl></dl>

	(2)	However, subsection&#160;(1) does not apply to roll-over relief under subsection 40-340(3) if the sum of the amounts specified in paragraph 45-5(1)(e) or 45-10(1)(f), or subsection 45-5(4) or 45-10(4), is at least equal to the market value of the <sup>*</sup>plant or interest concerned. 

**40-360  Notice to allow transferee to work out how this Division applies**

	(1)	This section applies if there is roll-over relief because of subsection 40-340(1).
 	(2)	The transferor must give the transferee a notice containing enough information about the transferor's <sup>*</sup>holding of the property for the transferee to work out how this Division applies to the transferee's holding of the <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset.
 	(3)	The transferor must give the notice within 6 months after the end of the transferee's income year in which the <sup>*</sup>balancing adjustment event occurred, or within a longer period allowed by the Commissioner.
 	(4)	The transferee must keep the notice until the end of 5 years after the earlier of these events:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>the transferee disposes of the property;</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>the property is lost or destroyed.</dd> </dl></dl>

Penalty:	30 penalty units. 

**40-365  Involuntary disposals**

	(1)	You may exclude some or all of an amount that has been included in your assessable income for a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset (the **_original asset_**) as a result of a <sup>*</sup>balancing adjustment event to the extent that you choose to treat it as an amount to be applied under 
<center>Back to Top</center>
 subsection&#160;(5) for one or more replacement assets.
 	(2)	You can only make this choice if you stop <sup>*</sup>holding the asset because:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>the original asset is lost or destroyed; or</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>the original asset is compulsorily acquired by an <sup>*</sup>Australian government agency; or</dd> <dt>(c)</dt><dd>you dispose of the original asset to an Australian government agency after a notice was served on you by or on behalf of the agency:</dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(i)</dt><dd>inviting you to negotiate with the agency with a view to the agency

acquiring it by agreement; and</dd>

<dt>(ii)</dt><dd>informing you that, if the negotiations are unsuccessful, it will be

compulsorily acquired by the agency.</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

	(3)	You can only make this choice for a replacement asset if you incur the expenditure on the replacement asset, or you start to <sup>*</sup>hold it:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>no earlier than one year, or within a further period the Commissioner

allows, before the <sup>*</sup>balancing adjustment event occurred; and</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>no later than one year, or within a further period the Commissioner allows, after the end of the income year in which the balancing adjustment event occurred.</dd> </dl></dl>

	(4)	You can only make this choice for a replacement asset if:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>at the end of the income year in which you incurred the expenditure on the

asset, or you started to <sup>*</sup>hold it, you used it, or had it

<sup>*</sup>installed ready for use, wholly for a <sup>*</sup>taxable purpose;

and</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>you can deduct an amount for it.</dd> </dl></dl>

	(5)	The amount covered by the choice is applied in reduction of:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>for the income year in which the replacement asset's <sup>*</sup>start

time occurs&#151;its <sup>*</sup>cost; or</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>for a later year&#151;the sum of its <sup>*</sup>opening adjustable value for that year and any amount included in the second element of its cost for that year.</dd> </dl></dl>

	(6)	If you are making the choice for 2 or more replacement assets, you apportion the amount covered by the choice between those items in proportion to their <sup>*</sup>cost. 

**40-370  Balancing adjustments where there has been use of different car expense methods**

	(1)	An amount is included in your assessable income or you can deduct an amount under this section instead of section&#160;40-285 if:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>a <sup>*</sup>balancing adjustment event occurs for a <sup>*</sup>car you

<sup>*</sup>held; and</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>you have deducted or can deduct an amount for the decline in value of the car for an income year under this Division; and</dd> <dt>(c)</dt><dd>you chose:</dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(i)</dt><dd>the "cents per kilometre" method in Subdivision&#160;28-C; or</dd>

<dt>(ii)</dt><dd>the "12% of original value" method in Subdivision&#160;28-D;</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

		for deducting your car expenses for the car for one or more other income

years. </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Note 1:	This means if you have only used the "log book" method or

the "one-third of actual expenses" method since you began using the car, you

calculate the assessable amount or deductible amount under

section&#160;40-285.</dd> Note 2:	Also, if you have only used the "cents per kilometre" method or the "12% of original value" method since you began using the car, no amount is assessable or deductible under this section or section&#160;40-285.</dl> 	(2)	Work out the amount you include in your assessable income or the amount you can deduct in this way:

_Method statement_

_Step 1._	Subtract the <sup>*</sup>car's <sup>*</sup>adjustable value just before the <sup>*</sup>balancing adjustment event occurred from the car's <sup>*</sup>termination value.
 _Step 2._	Reduce the step 1 amount by the part of the <sup>*</sup>car's 
<center>Back to Top</center>
 decline in value that is attributable to your using the car, or having it <sup>*</sup>installed ready for use, for purposes other than <sup>*</sup>taxable purposes. You do this by applying the formula in subsection 40-290(2).
 _Step 3._	Multiply the step 2 amount by the total number of days for which you deducted the decline in value of the <sup>*</sup>car under this Division.
 _Step 4._	Divide the step 3 amount by the total number of days you <sup>*</sup>held the <sup>*</sup>car.
 _Step 5._	The step 4 amount is a deduction if it is negative or it is included in your assessable income if it is positive.

	(3)	In working out the <sup>*</sup>adjustable value for the income years for which you chose the "cents per kilometre method" or the "12% of original value" method, you are to assume the decline in value was calculated under this Division on the same basis as those income years when those methods did not apply.
 	(4)	In working out the reduction in step 2 for the income years for which you chose the "cents per kilometre method" or the "12% of original value" method, you must assume that:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>you had not chosen either of those methods for the <sup>*</sup>car; and</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>Division&#160;28 (car expenses) had not applied to the car; and</dd> <dt>(c)</dt><dd>you used the car for <sup>*</sup>taxable purposes:</dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(i)</dt><dd>to the extent of 20% if you used the "cents per kilometre" method; or</dd>

<dt>(ii)</dt><dd>to the extent of one-third if you used the "12% of original value" method.

**Operative provisions**

**40-425  Allocating assets to a low-value pool**

	(1)	You may choose to allocate a <sup>*</sup>low cost asset you <sup>*</sup>hold to a low-value pool for the income year in which you start to use it, or have it <sup>*</sup>installed ready for use, for a <sup>*</sup>taxable purpose.
 	(2)	A **_low-cost asset_** is a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset, except a <sup>*</sup>horticultural plant (including a grapevine) whose <sup>*</sup>cost as at the end of the income year in which you start to use it, or have it <sup>*</sup>installed ready for use, for a <sup>*</sup>taxable purpose is less than $1,000.
 	(3)	You may also choose to allocate a <sup>*</sup>low-value asset to a low-value pool.
 	(4)	You cannot allocate a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset to a low-value pool if:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>its <sup>*</sup>cost does not exceed $300; and</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>you use the asset predominantly for the <sup>*</sup>purpose of producing assessable income that is not income from carrying on a <sup>*</sup>business; and</dd> <dt>(c)</dt><dd>the asset is not part of a set of assets that you started to hold in that income year where the total cost of the set of assets exceeds $300; and</dd> <dt>(d)</dt><dd>the total cost of the asset and any other identical, or substantially identical, asset that you start to hold in that income year does not exceed $300.</dd> </dl></dl>

	(5)	A **_low-value asset_** is a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset, except a <sup>*</sup>horticultural plant (including a grapevine), you 
<center>Back to Top</center>
 <sup>*</sup>hold:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>if you have deducted or can deduct amounts for it under this Division for

a previous income year&#151;for which you used the <sup>*</sup>diminishing value

method; and</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>that has an <sup>*</sup>opening adjustable value for the current year of less than $1,000 (worked out using the diminishing value method); and</dd> <dt>(c)</dt><dd>that is not a <sup>*</sup>low-cost asset.</dd> </dl></dl>

	(6)	A <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>to which Division&#160;58 (about assets previously owned by an exempt

entity) applied for an entity sale situation; and</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>for which you used the <sup>*</sup>diminishing value method; and</dd> <dt>(c)</dt><dd>whose <sup>*</sup>adjustable value as at the end of the income year before the <sup>*</sup>current year is less than $1,000;</dd> </dl></dl>

<def><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

is also a **_low-value asset_**.

 </dl></dl>

_Exception: STS_

	(7)	You cannot allocate a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset to a low-value pool if you deduct amounts for it under Subdivision&#160;328-D (about capital allowances for STS taxpayers). 

**40-430  Rules for assets in low-value pools**

	(1)	Once you have made a choice to allocate a <sup>*</sup>low-cost asset to a low-value pool for an income year, you must allocate all low-cost assets you start to <sup>*</sup>hold in that income year or a later one to the pool.

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Note 1:	This rule does not apply to low-value assets.</dd> Note 2:	If you are an STS taxpayer for the income year, you must deduct amounts for your depreciating assets under Subdivision&#160;328-D unless deductions for particular assets are specifically excluded by that Subdivision.</dl> 	(3)	Once you allocate any <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset to a low-value pool, it must remain in the pool. 

**40-435  Private or exempt use of assets**

		When you allocate a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset to a low-value pool, you must make a reasonable estimate of the percentage (the **_taxable use percentage_**) of your use of the asset (including any past use) that will be for a <sup>*</sup>taxable purpose over:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>for a <sup>*</sup>low-cost asset&#151;its <sup>*</sup>effective life; or</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>for a <sup>*</sup>low-value asset&#151;any period of its effective life that is yet to elapse at the start of the income year for which you allocate it to the pool. </dd> </dl></dl>

**40-440  How you work out the decline in value of assets in low-value pools**

	(1)	You work out the decline in value of <sup>*</sup>depreciating assets in a low-value pool for an income year in this way:

_Step 1._	Work out the amount obtained by taking 18<sup>3</sup>/4% of the taxable use percentage of the <sup>*</sup>cost of each <sup>*</sup>low-cost asset you allocated to the pool for that year. Add those amounts.
 _Step 2._	Add to the step 1 amount 18<sup>3</sup>/4% of the taxable use percentage of any amounts included in the second element of the <sup>*</sup>cost for that year of:

	(a)	assets allocated to the pool for an earlier income year; and
 	(b)	<sup>*</sup>low-value assets allocated to the pool for the <sup>*</sup>current year.

_Step 3._	Add to the step 2 amount 37<sup>1</sup>/2% of the sum of:

	(a)	the <sup>*</sup>closing pool balance for the previous income year; and
 	(b)	the taxable use percentage of the <sup>*</sup>opening adjustable values of <sup>*</sup>low-value assets, at the start of the income year, that you allocated to the pool for that year.

_Step 4._	The result is the decline in value of the <sup>*</sup>depreciating assets in the pool.

	(2)	The **_closing pool balance_** of a low-value pool for an income year is the sum of:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>the <sup>*</sup>closing pool balance of the pool for the previous income

year; and</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>the taxable use percentage of the <sup>*</sup>costs of <sup>*</sup>low-cost assets you allocated to the pool for that year; and</dd> <dt>(c)</dt><dd>the taxable use percentage of the <sup>*</sup>opening adjustable values of any <sup>*</sup>low-value assets you allocated to the pool for that year as at the start of that year; and</dd> <dt>(d)</dt><dd>the taxable use percentage of any amounts included in the second element of the cost for the income year of:</dd> </dl></dl>

<center>Back to Top</center>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(i)</dt><dd>assets allocated to the pool for an earlier income year; and</dd>

<dt>(ii)</dt><dd>low-value assets allocated to the pool for the <sup>*</sup>current

year;</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

<def><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

less the decline in value of the <sup>*</sup>depreciating assets in the pool

worked out under subsection&#160;(1).

 </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Note:	The closing pool balance may be reduced under

section&#160;40-445 if a balancing adjustment event happens.

</dd></dl> **40-445  Balancing adjustment events** 	(1)	If a <sup>*</sup>balancing adjustment event happens to a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset in a low-value pool in an income year, the <sup>*</sup>closing pool balance for that year is reduced (but not below zero) by the taxable use percentage of the asset's <sup>*</sup>termination value.
 	(2)	If the sum of the <sup>*</sup>termination values, or the part of it, applicable under subsection&#160;(1) exceeds the <sup>*</sup>closing pool balance of the pool for that year, the excess is included in your assessable income. 

**40-450  Software development pools**

	(1)	You may choose to allocate amounts of expenditure you incur on <sup>*</sup>in-house software in an income year to a software development pool if it is expenditure on developing, or having another entity develop, computer software.

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Note:	You cannot allocate expenditure on in-house software to a

software development pool if it is expenditure on acquiring computer software

or a right to use computer software.</dd></dl> 	(2)	Once you choose to create a software development pool for an income year, any amounts of the kind referred to in subsection&#160;(1) you incur after the pool is created (whether in that income year or a later one) must be allocated to a software development pool.
 	(3)	However, an amount of expenditure on <sup>*</sup>in-house software can only be allocated to a software development pool if you intend to use the software solely for a <sup>*</sup>taxable purpose.
 	(4)	You must create a separate software development pool for each income year for which you incur amounts of the kind referred to in subsection&#160;(1). 

**40-455  How to work out your deduction**

		For all the expenditure on <sup>*</sup>in-house software in a software development pool that was incurred in a particular income year (**_Year 1_**), you get deductions in successive income years as follows:

**40-460  Your assessable income includes consideration for pooled software**

	(1)	If expenditure on <sup>*</sup>in-house software is (or was) in your software development pool, your assessable income includes any amount you derive as consideration in relation to the software.
 	(2)	However, subsection&#160;(1) does not apply if subsection 40-340(3) (roll-over relief) applies to the change.

**Operative provisions**

**40-515  Water facilities, grapevines and horticultural plants**

	(1)	You can deduct an amount equal to the decline in value for an income year (as worked out under this Subdivision) of a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset that is one of these:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>a <sup>*</sup>water facility;</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>a <sup>*</sup>horticultural plant;</dd> <dt>(c)</dt><dd>a grapevine.</dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Note 1:	Sections&#160;40-540, 40-545 and 40-550 show you how to

work out the decline.</dd> Note 2:	Generally, only one taxpayer can deduct amounts for a depreciating asset. However, if you and another taxpayer jointly hold the asset, each of you deduct amounts for it: see section&#160;40-35.</dl> _Conditions_

	(2)	However, the applicable condition in section&#160;40-525 must be satisfied for the <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset.

_Limit on deduction_

	(3)	You cannot deduct more in total than the amount of capital expenditure incurred on the <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset.

_Reduction of deduction: water facilities_

	(4)	You must reduce your deduction for a <sup>*</sup>water facility for an income year by the part of the facility's decline in value that is attributable to the period (if any) in the income year when it was:

	(3)	You cannot work out the decline in value of a grapevine under this section if you work out its decline in value under section&#160;40-545 (about horticultural plants). 

**40-555  Amounts you cannot deduct**

_Water facilities_

	(1)	You cannot deduct an amount for any income year for capital expenditure on the acquisition of a <sup>*</sup>water facility if any person has deducted or can deduct an amount under this Subdivision for any income year for earlier capital expenditure on:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>the construction or manufacture of the facility; or</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>a previous acquisition of the facility.</dd> </dl></dl>

	(2)	A <sup>*</sup>water facility and an alteration, addition or extension to that facility are not the same water facility for the purposes of subsection&#160;(1).

_Horticultural plants and grapevines_

	(3)	In working out your deduction under this Subdivision for a <sup>*</sup>horticultural plant or a grapevine, disregard expenditure incurred:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>in draining swamp or low-lying land; or</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>in clearing land. </dd> </dl></dl>

**40-560  Non-arm's length transactions**

		If you incurred capital expenditure under an <sup>*</sup>arrangement and:

	(2)	Work out your deduction as follows:

_Method statement_

_Step 1._	Work out the total of the amounts you could have deducted under this Subdivision for the <sup>*</sup>horticultural plant or grapevine for the period:

(a)	starting when the plant could first be used for <sup>*</sup>commercial horticulture or when the grapevine was established; and
 (b)	ending when it was destroyed;

	assuming that, during that period, you satisfied a condition in 
<center>Back to Top</center>
 section&#160;40-525 for the plant or grapevine and used it for commercial horticulture (for a plant) or in a <sup>*</sup>primary production business for the <sup>*</sup>purpose of producing assessable income (for a grapevine).
 _Step 2._	Subtract from the capital expenditure that is attributable to the establishment of the <sup>*</sup>horticultural plant or grapevine:

	(a)	the result from step 1; and
 	(b)	any amount you received (under an insurance policy or otherwise) for the destruction.
 	The remaining amount (if any) is your deduction under subsection&#160;(1).

	(3)	This deduction is in addition to any deduction for the income year under section&#160;40-545 or 40-550\. 

**40-570  How this Subdivision applies to partners and partnerships**

	(1)	This section applies to allocate expenditure to you for the purposes of this Subdivision if you were a partner in a partnership when it incurred capital expenditure during an income year.
 	(2)	For the purposes of this Subdivision, you are taken to have incurred during that income year:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>the amount of the expenditure that the partners agreed you should bear;

or</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>if there was no such agreement&#151;the proportion of the expenditure equal to the proportion of your individual interest in the net income or partnership loss of the partnership for that income year.</dd> </dl></dl>

	(3)	Disregard this Subdivision when working out the net income or partnership loss of the partnership under section&#160;90 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. 

**40-575  Getting tax information if you acquire a horticultural plant or grapevine**

	(1)	If you begin to satisfy a condition in section&#160;40-525 for a <sup>*</sup>horticultural plant or a grapevine, you may give the last entity (if any) that satisfied such a condition for the plant or grapevine a written notice requiring the entity to give you any or all of the following information:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>the amount of establishment expenditure for the plant or grapevine;</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>for a horticultural plant&#151;its <sup>*</sup>effective life and the day on which it could first be used for <sup>*</sup>commercial horticulture;</dd> <dt>(c)</dt><dd>for a grapevine&#151;the day on which it was established.</dd> </dl></dl>

	(2)	The notice must:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>be given within 60 days of your beginning to satisfy that condition; and</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>specify a period of at least 60 days within which the information must be given; and</dd> <dt>(c)</dt><dd>set out the effect of subsection&#160;(3).</dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Note:	Subsections&#160;(4) and (5) explain how this subsection

operates if the last owner is a partnership.</dd></dl> _Requirement to comply with notice_

	(3)	The entity to whom the notice is given must not intentionally refuse or fail to comply with the notice.

Penalty:	10 penalty units.

_Giving the notice to a partnership_

	(4)	If the entity to whom the notice is given is a partnership:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>you may give it to the partnership by giving it to any of the partners

(this does not limit how else you can give it); and</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>the obligation to comply with the notice is imposed on each of the partners (not on the partnership), but may be discharged by any of them.</dd> </dl></dl>

	(5)	A partner must not intentionally refuse or fail to comply with that obligation, unless another partner has already complied with it.

Penalty:	10 penalty units.

_Limits on giving a notice_

	(6)	Only one notice can be given in relation to the same <sup>*</sup>horticultural plant or grapevine.
