###  Table A 
**</center>  **Table A**

**Application, saving or transitional provisions**

_Defence Legislation Amendment Act (No. 1) 1999_(No. 116, 1999)

**Schedule 2** **24  Saving** Sections 13K and 13M of the _Naval Defence Act 1910_ as in force before the commencement of this item continue to apply to an officer of the Navy who was given a notice before that commencement under subsection 13K(1) of that Act as so in force.

_Defence Legislation Amendment (Flexible Career Practices) Act 2000_(No.&#160;113, 2000) 

**4  Application of amendments**

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

		The amendments made by items&#160;3, 4, 5, 8, 9 and 11 of Schedule&#160;1 do

not apply in relation to appointments made before the commencement of this Act.

 </dl></dl>

_Defence Legislation Amendment (Enhancement of the Reserves and Modernisation) Act 2001_ (No. 10, 2001)

**Schedule 2** 91  Saving&#151;appointments under the Naval Defence Act Although item&#160;67 repeals Part&#160;II of the _Naval Defence Act 1910_, that Part continues to apply, in relation to a person who held an appointment under subsection 8(1) of that Act immediately before that item commenced, as if the repeal had not happened.

**92  Saving&#151;enlistments under the Naval Defence Act**

Although item&#160;69 repeals sections&#160;25 to 30A of the _Naval Defence Act 1910_, those sections continue to apply, in relation to a person who was enlisted under subsection 25(3) of that Act immediately before that item commenced, as if the repeal had not happened.

**93  Most of the old provisions may be superseded by new regulations**

(1)	However, the repealed provisions mentioned in items&#160;89, 90, 91 and 92 continue to apply under those items only to the extent that they are consistent with regulations made after the repeal for the purposes of section&#160;124 of the _Defence Act 1903_.
 (2)	If such regulations are made, then:

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>to the extent of the inconsistency, those provisions permanently cease to

apply from the time that the inconsistency arises; and</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>the regulations apply despite being inconsistent with those provisions.

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

**94  Saving&#151;old regulations**

(1)	Regulations that were in effect under any Act immediately before the commencement of this item continue to have effect after that time as if members of an arm of the Defence Force who were members of a particular part or component of that arm immediately before the commencement of this item were still members of that part or component after that time, even if that part or component no longer exists.

Example:	Assume that, immediately before the commencement of this item, regulations imposed training obligations on members of the Air Force Specialist Reserve. Those obligations would continue to apply to former members of that Reserve after commencement, even though the Air Force Specialist Reserve itself is no longer mentioned in the _Air Force Act 1923_ and the members have now become members of the Air Force Reserve.

(2)	However, regulations that continue in effect under this item do so only to the extent that they are not amended or revoked by later regulations.

**95  Regulations about transitional matters**

(1)	The regulations may make provision in relation to other saving and transitional matters in connection with the amendments made by this Schedule.
 (2)	In particular, such regulations may deal with the status, after the commencement of the amendments, of persons who were members of the Defence Force immediately before that time.
 (3)	Subitem&#160;(2) does not limit the scope of subitem&#160;(1).

_Defence Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Act 2001_(No.&#160;141, 2001) 

**4  Application of amendments**

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>Each amendment made by this Act applies to acts and omissions that take

place after the amendment commences.</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>For the purposes of this section, if an act or omission is alleged to have taken place between 2 dates, one before and one on or after the day on which a particular amendment commences, the act or omission is alleged to have taken place before the amendment commences. </dd> </dl></dl>

**Schedule 1** **109  Saving&#151;regulations** Regulations that were in effect for the purposes of section&#160;44E of the _Naval Defence Act 1910_ immediately before the commencement of this item continue to have effect after that time as if they had been made for the purposes of section&#160;44E of that Act, as in force after that time.

_Defence Legislation Amendment Act 2003_ (No. 135, 2003)

**Schedule 2** **38  Transitional&#151;Australian Navy Cadets** To avoid doubt:

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>appointments to the Naval Reserve Cadets in force under paragraph 38(2)(a)

or (b) of the _Naval Defence Act 1910_ immediately before the commencement

of item&#160;33 of this Schedule continue to have effect after that

commencement as if they were appointments to the Australian Navy Cadets; and</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>persons who are cadets in the Naval Reserve Cadets under section&#160;38

of the _Naval Defence Act 1910_ immediately before the commencement of

item&#160;33 of this Schedule continue as cadets in the Australian Navy Cadets

immediately after that commencement, subject to the limitations imposed by that

section (as amended).
