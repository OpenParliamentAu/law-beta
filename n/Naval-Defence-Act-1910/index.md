Schedule 2
91  Saving—appointments under the Naval Defence Act
Although item 67 repeals Part II of the Naval Defence Act 1910, that Part continues to apply, in relation to a person who held an appointment under subsection 8(1) of that Act immediately before that item commenced, as if the repeal had not happened.
92  Saving—enlistments under the Naval Defence Act
Although item 69 repeals sections 25 to 30A of the Naval Defence Act 1910, those sections continue to apply, in relation to a person who was enlisted under subsection 25(3) of that Act immediately before that item commenced, as if the repeal had not happened.
93  Most of the old provisions may be superseded by new regulations
(1)	However, the repealed provisions mentioned in items 89, 90, 91 and 92 continue to apply under those items only to the extent that they are consistent with regulations made after the repeal for the purposes of section 124 of the Defence Act 1903.
(2)	If such regulations are made, then:
	(a)	to the extent of the inconsistency, those provisions permanently cease to apply from the time that the inconsistency arises; and
	(b)	the regulations apply despite being inconsistent with those provisions.
94  Saving—old regulations
(1)	Regulations that were in effect under any Act immediately before the commencement of this item continue to have effect after that time as if members of an arm of the Defence Force who were members of a particular part or component of that arm immediately before the commencement of this item were still members of that part or component after that time, even if that part or component no longer exists.
Example:	Assume that, immediately before the commencement of this item, regulations imposed training obligations on members of the Air Force Specialist Reserve. Those obligations would continue to apply to former members of that Reserve after commencement, even though the Air Force Specialist Reserve itself is no longer mentioned in the Air Force Act 1923 and the members have now become members of the Air Force Reserve.
(2)	However, regulations that continue in effect under this item do so only to the extent that they are not amended or revoked by later regulations.
95  Regulations about transitional matters
(1)	The regulations may make provision in relation to other saving and transitional matters in connection with the amendments made by this Schedule.
(2)	In particular, such regulations may deal with the status, after the commencement of the amendments, of persons who were members of the Defence Force immediately before that time.
(3)	Subitem (2) does not limit the scope of subitem (1).
