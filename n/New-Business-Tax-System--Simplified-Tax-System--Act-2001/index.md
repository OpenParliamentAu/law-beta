Exceptions
<dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>subsection&#160;(1) does not apply if another provision of this Act

(except section&#160;6-5, 8-1, 25-5 or 25-10) would include the amount, or

allow the deduction, at a different time; and</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>paragraph&#160;(1)(a) does not apply to an amount to the extent that it has not been, and will not be, _received_ by you; and</dd> <dt>(c)</dt><dd>paragraph&#160;(1)(b) does not apply to an amount to the extent that it has not been, and will not be, _paid_ by you or for you.</dd> </dl>
<dt></dt><dd>

Example:	Subdivision&#160;385-G allows you to defer including

profit from second wool clips in your assessable income to the next income

year. This Subdivision does not override that

deferral.</dd>

<dt></dt><dd>

Example:	Sylvia chooses to become an STS taxpayer for the 2005-06

income year. In the previous income year, she derived $27,000 of ordinary

income that she did not receive in that previous year. It was included in her

assessable income for that previous year because she was using an accruals

basis of accounting.</dd> 	That amount is not again included when Sylvia receives it in the 2005-06 income year.

Example:	To continue the example, Sylvia incurred business

expenses of $12,000 in the 2004-05 income year. She did not pay these expenses

until the next income year.</dd> 	The expenses were deductible for the 2004-05 income year because she was using an accruals basis of accounting. That amount is not again deductible when she pays it in the 2005-06 income year.

Example:	Sonja's Shoe Shop is an STS taxpayer for the 2003-04

income year, but is forced to leave the STS for the 2004-05 income year because

of increased turnover. After leaving the STS, the business changes its

accounting method to an accruals basis.</dd> 	The customers of Sonja's Shoe Shop owe $10,000 at the end of the 2003-04 income year. That amount is not included in assessable income for that income year because it was not received in that year. 	This section includes the $10,000 in assessable income for the 2004-05 income year. This is because the STS accounting method did not bring it to account in the 2003-04 income year.

Example:	To continue the example, Sonja's Shoe Shop made

purchases of $7,000 in the 2003-04 income year, but could not deduct that

amount because it was not paid during that year.</dd> 	This section allows Sonja's Shoe Shop to deduct the $7,000 for the 2004-05 income year. This is because the STS accounting method did not allow it as a deduction in the 2003-04 income year.

Once you have made the choice for an asset, you cannot change it.

 </dl></dl>

_Exception: horticultural plants_

	(5)	You cannot deduct amounts for <sup>*</sup>horticultural plants (including grapevines) under this Subdivision.

_Exception: asset let on depreciating asset lease_

	(6)	You cannot deduct amounts for a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset under this Subdivision if the asset is being or is intended to be let predominantly on a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset lease.

_Exception: assets in a low-value or software development pool_

	(7)	You cannot deduct amounts for a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset under this Subdivision if:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>the asset was allocated to your low-value pool under

Subdivision&#160;40-E, or to your pool under the former Subdivision&#160;42-L,

 	(1)	You deduct the <sup>*</sup>taxable purpose proportion of the <sup>*</sup>adjustable value of a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset for the income year in which you start to use the asset, or have it <sup>*</sup>installed ready for use, for a <sup>*</sup>taxable purpose if:

<def><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

You cannot deduct any further amount for the asset.

 </dl></dl>

	(2)	An asset to which this section applies is not allocated to a pool.
 	(1)	As an <sup>*</sup>STS taxpayer, you deduct amounts for your <sup>*</sup>depreciating assets (except <sup>*</sup>low-cost assets for which you have deducted or can deduct an amount under section&#160;328-180) through a pool, which allows you to deduct amounts for them as if they were a single asset, thereby simplifying your calculations. You use one rate for the pool.
 	(2)	There are 2 kinds of pools:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>a **_general STS pool_** to which <sup>*</sup>depreciating assets

having <sup>*</sup>effective lives of less than 25 years are allocated; and</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>a **_long life STS pool_** to which depreciating assets having effective lives of 25 years or more are allocated.</dd> </dl></dl>

_Allocating assets to a pool_

	(3)	A <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>that you <sup>*</sup>hold just before, and at the start of, the first

income year for which you are, or last became, an <sup>*</sup>STS taxpayer;

and</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>for which you calculate your deductions under this Subdivision instead of under Division&#160;40; and</dd> <dt>(c)</dt><dd>that has not previously been allocated to your <sup>*</sup>general STS pool or <sup>*</sup>long life STS pool; and</dd> <dt>(d)</dt><dd>that you have started to use, or have <sup>*</sup>installed ready for use, for a <sup>*</sup>taxable purpose;</dd> </dl></dl>

<def><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

is automatically allocated to your general STS pool or long life STS pool

according to its <sup>*</sup>effective life.

 </dl></dl>

	(4)	A <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset that you start to use, or have <sup>*</sup>installed ready for use, for a <sup>*</sup>taxable purpose during an income year while you are an <sup>*</sup>STS taxpayer is allocated to the appropriate pool at the end of that year.

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Note:	The allocation happens even if you no longer hold the asset

at the end of that income year.</dd></dl> _Exception for long life assets_

	(5)	You can choose not to have a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset allocated to a <sup>*</sup>long life STS pool to which it would otherwise have been allocated if you started to use it, or have it <sup>*</sup>installed ready for use, for a <sup>*</sup>taxable purpose before 1&#160;July 2001.

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Note:	If you make this choice, you would continue to deduct

amounts for the asset under Division&#160;40.</dd></dl> 	(6)	You must make that choice for the first income year for which you are an <sup>*</sup>STS taxpayer. Once you have made the choice for an asset, you cannot change it.

_No re-allocation_

	(7)	Once a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset is allocated to your <sup>*</sup>general STS pool or <sup>*</sup>long life STS pool, it is not re-allocated, even if you stop being an <sup>*</sup>STS taxpayer and again become one.

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Note:	You continue to use this Subdivision for your STS pools

after you leave the STS: see section&#160;328-220.</dd> Example:	Greg chooses to leave the STS for the 2002-03 income year. At that time, his long life STS pool contains one depreciating asset that has an effective life of 28 years. 	When Greg chooses to re-enter the STS for the 2008-09 income year, he still holds that asset. The asset has remained in the pool since Greg left the STS and is not re-allocated when he re-enters, even though its remaining effective life is now 22 years.</dl> 	(1)	You calculate your deduction for each pool for an income year using this formula:

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Note:	You use section&#160;328-210 instead if the pool has a low

pool value.</dd></dl> 	(2)	Your deduction for each <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset that you start to use, or have <sup>*</sup>installed ready for use, for a <sup>*</sup>taxable purpose during an income year while you are an <sup>*</sup>STS taxpayer is:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>15% of the <sup>*</sup>taxable purpose proportion of its

years; or</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>2.5% of the taxable purpose proportion of its adjustable value if its effective life is 25 years or more.</dd> </dl></dl>

	(3)	You can also deduct for an income year for which you are an <sup>*</sup>STS taxpayer the amount worked out under subsection&#160;(4) for an amount (the **_cost addition amount_**) included in the second element of the <sup>*</sup>cost of a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset for that year if you started to use the asset, or have it <sup>*</sup>installed ready for use, for a <sup>*</sup>taxable purpose during an earlier income year.

section&#160;40-190.</dd></dl> 	(4)	The amount you can deduct is:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

amount if the asset's <sup>*</sup>effective life is less than 25 years; or</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>2.5% of the taxable purpose proportion of the cost addition amount if the asset's effective life is 25 years or more.</dd> </dl></dl>

	(1)	For the first income year for which you are an <sup>*</sup>STS taxpayer,

the **_opening pool balance_** of a pool is the sum of the

<sup>*</sup>taxable purpose proportions of the <sup>*</sup>adjustable values of

<sup>*</sup>depreciating assets allocated to the pool under subsection

328-185(3).

	(2)	For a later income year, the **_opening pool balance_** of a pool

is that pool's <sup>*</sup>closing pool balance for the previous income year,

reduced or increased by any adjustment required under section&#160;328-225

(about change in the business use of an asset).

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Note:	You continue to deduct amounts using your STS pools after

you leave the STS: see section&#160;328-220.</dd></dl> 	(3)	However, if you stop being an <sup>*</sup>STS taxpayer and again become one for an income year, the **_opening pool balance_** of a pool includes the sum of the <sup>*</sup>taxable purpose proportions of the <sup>*</sup>adjustable values of <sup>*</sup>depreciating assets allocated to the pool under subsection 328-185(3) for that year.
 		You work out the **_closing pool balance_** of a pool for an income year in this way:

_Method statement_

_Step 1._	Add to the <sup>*</sup>opening pool balance of the pool for the income year:

	(a)	the sum of the <sup>*</sup>taxable purpose proportions of the <sup>*</sup>adjustable values of <sup>*</sup>depreciating assets you started to use, or have <sup>*</sup>installed ready for use, for a <sup>*</sup>taxable purpose during the income year and that are allocated to that pool; and
 	(b)	the taxable purpose proportion of any cost addition amounts (see subsection 328-190(3)) for the income year for assets allocated to the pool.

_Step 2._	Subtract from the step 1 amount:

	(a)	the <sup>*</sup>taxable purpose proportions of the <sup>*</sup>termination values of <sup>*</sup>depreciating assets allocated to the pool and for which a <sup>*</sup>balancing adjustment event occurred during the income year; and
 	(b)	your deduction under subsection 328-190(1) for the pool for the income year; and
 	(c)	your deductions under subsection 328-190(2) for <sup>*</sup>depreciating assets you started to use, or have <sup>*</sup>installed ready for use, for a <sup>*</sup>taxable purpose during the income year and that are allocated to that pool; and
 	(d)	your deductions under subsection 328-190(3) for the income year for cost addition amounts for assets allocated to the pool.

_Step 3._	The result is the **_closing pool balance_** of the pool for the income year.

<center>Back to Top</center>

	(1)	You must, for the first income year for which you are, or last became, an

<sup>*</sup>STS taxpayer, make a reasonable estimate for that year of the

proportion you will use, or have <sup>*</sup>installed ready for use, each

<sup>*</sup>depreciating asset that you <sup>*</sup>held just before, and at

the start of, that year for a <sup>*</sup>taxable purpose if:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>the asset has not previously been allocated to your <sup>*</sup>general

STS pool or <sup>*</sup>long life STS pool; and</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>you have started to use it, or have it installed ready for use, for a taxable purpose; and</dd> <dt>(c)</dt><dd>you calculate your deductions for it under this Subdivision.</dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Note 1:	That proportion will be 100% for an asset that you expect

to use, or have installed ready for use, solely for a taxable purpose.</dd> Note 2:	Your estimate will be zero for an income year if another provision of this Act denies a deduction for that year: see section&#160;328-230.</dl> 	(2)	You must also make this estimate for each <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset that you <sup>*</sup>hold and start to use, or have <sup>*</sup>installed ready for use, for a <sup>*</sup>taxable purpose while you are an <sup>*</sup>STS taxpayer. You must make the estimate for the income year in which you start to use it, or have it installed ready for use, for such a purpose.
 	(3)	The **_taxable purpose proportion_** of a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset's <sup>*</sup>adjustable value, or of an amount included in the second element of its <sup>*</sup>cost, is that part of that amount that represents:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>the proportion you estimated under subsection&#160;(1) or (2); or</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>if you have had to make an adjustment under section&#160;328-225 for the asset&#151;the proportion most recently applicable to the asset under that section.</dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Note:	An amount included in the second element of the cost of a

depreciating asset is referred to in this Division as a cost addition amount:

see subsection 328-190(3).</dd></dl> 	(4)	The **_taxable purpose proportion_** of a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset's <sup>*</sup>termination value is that part of that amount that represents:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>if you have not had to make an adjustment under section&#160;328-225 for

the asset&#151;the proportion you estimated under subsection&#160;(1) or (2); or</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>if you have had to make at least one such adjustment and the asset is allocated to a <sup>*</sup>general STS pool&#151;the average of:</dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(i)</dt><dd>the proportion you estimated under subsection&#160;(1) or (2); and</dd>

<dt>(ii)</dt><dd>the proportion applicable to the asset for each of the 3 income years you

<sup>*</sup>held the asset after the one in which the asset was allocated to

the pool; or</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(c)</dt><dd>if you have had to make at least one such adjustment and the asset is

allocated to a long life STS pool&#151;the average of:</dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(i)</dt><dd>the proportion you estimated under subsection&#160;(1) or (2); and</dd>

<dt>(ii)</dt><dd>the proportion applicable to the asset for each of the 20 income years

you <sup>*</sup>held the asset after the one in which the asset was allocated

to the pool.</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Example:	When Bria's van was allocated to her general STS pool

for the 2001-02 income year, she estimated that it would be used 50% for

deliveries in her florist business. Due to increasing deliveries, Bria

estimates the van's business use to be 70% for the 2002-03 year, and 90% for

the 2003-04 year. She makes an adjustment under section&#160;328-225 for both

those years.</dd> 	Bria sells the van for $3,000 at the start of the 2005-06 income year. She must now average the business use estimates for the van for the year it was allocated to the pool and the next 3 years to work out the taxable purpose proportion of its termination value. The average is worked out as follows:</dl> *	50% (original estimate); plus
 *	70% (2002-03 estimate); plus
 *	90% (2003-04 estimate); plus
 *	90% (no change on previous year);

	(1)	Your deduction for a <sup>*</sup>general STS pool or <sup>*</sup>long life

STS pool for an income year is the amount worked out under subsection&#160;(2)

(instead of an amount calculated under section&#160;328-190) if that amount is

less than $1,000 but more than zero.

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Note:	See section&#160;328-215 for the result when the amount is

less than zero.</dd></dl> 	(2)	The amount is the sum of:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>the pool's <sup>*</sup>opening pool balance for the income year; and</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>the <sup>*</sup>taxable purpose proportion of the <sup>*</sup>adjustable value of each <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset you started to use, or have <sup>*</sup>installed ready for use, for a <sup>*</sup>taxable purpose during the income year and that is allocated to that pool; and</dd> <dt>(c)</dt><dd>the taxable purpose proportion of any cost addition amounts (see subsection 328-190(3)) for the income year for assets allocated to the pool;</dd> </dl></dl>

<def><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

less the sum of the taxable purpose proportion of the <sup>*</sup>termination

values of depreciating assets allocated to that pool and for which a

<sup>*</sup>balancing adjustment event occurred during the income year.

 </dl></dl>

	(3)	In that case, the <sup>*</sup>closing pool balance of the pool for that income year then becomes zero.

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Example:	Amanda's Graphics, an STS taxpayer, has an opening pool

balance of $1,200 for its general STS pool for the 2004-05 income year.</dd> 	During that year, Amanda acquired a new computer for $2,000\.

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

	Amanda also sold her business car for $1,900 during that year.

The car was used 100% in the business.</dd> 	To work out whether she can deduct an amount under this section, Amanda uses this calculation:</dl> <sub> ![A graphic exists here.](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004C01191/Html/2CF8D449B0B68AAACA256F710055930B/$FILE/78of200109.gif)</sub>

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

	Because the result is less than $1,000, Amanda can deduct the

$900 for the income year. The pool's closing balance for the year is

zero.</dd></dl> 	(1)	This section sets out adjustments you may have to make if a <sup>*</sup>balancing adjustment event occurs for a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset for which you calculate your deductions under this Subdivision.
 	(2)	If the asset is allocated to a pool and:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>the <sup>*</sup>closing pool balance of the pool for the income year in

which the event occurred is less than zero; or</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>the amount worked out under subsection 328-210(2) for that income year is less than zero;</dd> </dl></dl>

<def><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

the amount by which that balance or amount is less than zero is included in

your assessable income for that year.

 </dl></dl>

	(3)	In that case, the <sup>*</sup>closing pool balance of the pool for that income year then becomes zero.
 	(4)	If the asset was one for which you deducted an amount under section&#160;328-180 (about low-cost assets), you include the <sup>*</sup>taxable purpose proportion of the asset's <sup>*</sup>termination value in your assessable income.
 	(1)	If you stop being an <sup>*</sup>STS taxpayer for an income year, this Subdivision continues to apply to your <sup>*</sup>general STS pool and <sup>*</sup>long life STS pool for that year and later years.
 	(2)	However, <sup>*</sup>depreciating assets you started to use, or have <sup>*</sup>installed ready for use, for a <sup>*</sup>taxable purpose while you are not an <sup>*</sup>STS taxpayer cannot be allocated to a pool under this Subdivision until you again become an STS taxpayer.
 	(1)	You must, for each income year (the **_present year_**) after the year in which a <sup>*</sup>depreciating asset is allocated to a pool, make a reasonable estimate of the proportion you use the asset, or have it 
<center>Back to Top</center>
 <sup>*</sup>installed ready for use, for a <sup>*</sup>taxable purpose in that year.
 	(1A)	You must make an adjustment for the present year if your estimate for that year under subsection&#160;(1) is different by more than 10 percentage points from:

**328-280  What this Subdivision is about**

STS taxpayers do not need to account for their trading stock in some circumstances. This Subdivision modifies the rules in Division&#160;70 about trading stock for STS taxpayers.

**Table of sections**

**Operative provisions**

328-285	Trading stock for STS taxpayers
 328-290	Adjustments in certain cases
 328-295	Value of trading stock on hand

_\[This is the end of the Guide.]_

	(1)	You do not have to account for changes in the <sup>*</sup>value of your

<sup>*</sup>trading stock for an income year if:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>you are an <sup>*</sup>STS taxpayer for that year; and</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>the difference between the value of all your trading stock on hand at the start of that year and the value you reasonably estimate of all your trading stock on hand at the end of that year is not more than $5,000.</dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Note 1:	As a result, sections&#160;70-35 and 70-45 (about

comparing the value of each item of trading stock on hand at the start and end

of an income year) will not apply to you for the income year.</dd> Note 2:	When making a reasonable estimate of the value of trading stock on hand:</dl> 
<center>Back to Top</center>
 *	special valuation rules may be used, for example, obsolete stock, natural increase of livestock, horse breeding stock; and
 *	the estimated value disregards an amount equal to the amount of input tax credits (if any) to which you would be entitled for an item if the acquisition of the item had been solely for a creditable purpose: see subsection 70-45(1A).

_Exception: choice to account for trading stock_

	(2)	However, you can choose to account for changes in the <sup>*</sup>value of your <sup>*</sup>trading stock for an income year.

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Note:	If you make this choice, you will have to do a stocktake

and account for the change in the value of all your trading stock: see

Subdivision&#160;70-C.</dd></dl> 		If you are an <sup>*</sup>STS taxpayer for an income year and you account for changes in the <sup>*</sup>value of your <sup>*</sup>trading stock for the income year, you must:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>value each item of your trading stock on hand at the end of the income

year in accordance with section&#160;70-45; and</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>take into account the <sup>*</sup>value of all your <sup>*</sup>trading stock, in accordance with section&#160;70-35, in working out your assessable income and deductions.</dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Note 1:	You account for changes in the value of your trading

stock for the income year if:</dd></dl> *	you choose to do so; or
 *	the estimated difference between the value of your trading stock at the start and at the end of that year is more than $5,000.

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Note 2:	Section&#160;70-35 includes in assessable income any

excess of the value of trading stock at the end of the income year over the

value at the start of the income year, and allows a deduction for any excess of

the value at the start of the income year over the value at the end of the

income year.</dd></dl> 	(1)	If you are an <sup>*</sup>STS taxpayer for an income year, the <sup>*</sup>value of all your <sup>*</sup>trading stock on hand at the start of the income year is:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>the same amount as was taken into account under this Act at the end of the

previous income year; or</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>zero if no item of trading stock was taken into account under this Act at the end of the previous income year.</dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Note:	The amount taken into account at the end of the previous

income year is worked out under either section&#160;70-45 or

subsection&#160;(2) of this section.</dd></dl> 	(2)	If subsection 328-285(1) applies to you for an income year and you have not made a choice under subsection 328-285(2) for that year, this Act applies to you as if the <sup>*</sup>value of all your <sup>*</sup>trading stock on hand at the end of the year were equal to the value of all your trading stock on hand at the start of the year.

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

Note:	If subsection 328-285(1) does not apply, the value of

trading stock on hand at the end of the year is worked out using

section&#160;70-45.</dd> Example:	Angela operates a riding school, and also sells riding gear. She is an STS taxpayer. 	At the start of the 2003-04 income year, the opening value of Angela's trading stock is $30,000\. Using her reliable inventory system, she estimates the closing value to be $34,000\. 	The closing value for the 2003-04 income year, and the opening value for the 2004-05 income year, will be $30,000.</dl> **328-360  What this Subdivision is about**

This Subdivision explains that you can choose to be an STS taxpayer only if you are carrying on a business. In addition, you (and others who can be expected to act in concert with you in your business) together must have:

*	an average annual business turnover of less than $1m; and

*	depreciating assets with an end of year value below $3m.

You normally work out your average turnover using any 3 of the last 4 years, but there are special rules for some other cases.

	(2)	For the purpose of working out your <sup>*</sup>STS average turnover under subsection&#160;(1) where you or a grouped entity carried on a <sup>*</sup>business for part only of one or more of those years, use a reasonable estimate of what your <sup>*</sup>STS group turnover would have been for that year or those years if you and the grouped entity had carried on a business throughout those years.
 	(3)	You work out your **_STS average turnover_** for an income year (also the **_present year_**) in this way if you are not eligible to be an <sup>*</sup>STS taxpayer for that year using subsection&#160;(1):

Example:	Kevin starts his locksmith business on 1&#160;January

2002\. He decides that he would like to enter the STS. He works out his STS

average turnover for the income year as $420,000, calculated as

follows:</dd></dl> *	Kevin's estimated turnover for the period 1&#160;January 2002 to 30&#160;June 2002 is $200,000; and
 *	he estimates that, if he had been in business for the period 1&#160;July 2001 to 31&#160;December 2001, his turnover would have been $190,000, making a total of $390,000 for the year; and
 *	his estimated turnover for the 2002-03 year is $420,000, and the estimate for the 2003-04 year is $450,000.

<dl compact=""><dt></dt><dd>

	The total STS turnover for the 3 years is $1,260,000, and the

average for those years is $420,000\. The value of Kevin's depreciating assets

	(2)	To the extent that the <sup>*</sup>taxable supplies an entity makes in an income year includes <sup>*</sup>gambling supplies, use an amount equal to 11 times the entity's <sup>*</sup>global GST amount for those supplies rather than the <sup>*</sup>value of the business supplies in working out the entity's <sup>*</sup>STS group turnover.

_Partnerships_

	(5)	An entity controls a partnership if the entity, its <sup>*</sup>STS affiliates or the entity together with its STS affiliates have the right to at least 40% of the partnership net income, or have at least a 40% interest in assets used in the partnership <sup>*</sup>business (except assets that are leased to the partnership).

	(7)	If the control percentage mentioned in this section is at least 40%, but less than 50%, then the Commissioner may determine that the first entity does not control the other entity if the Commissioner is satisfied, or thinks it reasonable to assume, that the other entity is controlled by an entity other than, or by entities that do not include, the first entity or any of its <sup>*</sup>STS affiliates.
 	(8)	An entity is an **_STS affiliate_** of yours if the entity acts, or could reasonably be expected to act, in accordance with your directions or wishes, or in concert with you, in relation to the affairs of the entity's <sup>*</sup>business.
 	(9)	Another partner in a partnership in which you are a partner is not your **_STS affiliate_** only because the partner acts, or could reasonably be expected to act, in concert with you in relation to the affairs of the partnership.
