## An Act to impose National Residue Survey Levies that are duties of excise

##### <a id="1"></a>1  Short title \[see Note 1]

                   This Act may be cited as the _National Residue Survey (Excise) Levy Act 1998_.

##### <a id="2"></a>2  Commencement \[see Note 1]

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), this Act commences on a day to be fixed by Proclamation.

             (2)  If this Act does not commence under subsection (1) within the period of 6 months beginning on the day on which this Act receives the Royal Assent, it commences on the first day after the end of that period.

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Simplified outline

                   The following is a simplified outline of this Act:

<div style="BORDER-RIGHT: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-RIGHT: 5pt; BORDER-TOP: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-LEFT: 5pt; PADDING-BOTTOM: 5pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 2cm; BORDER-LEFT: windowtext 1pt solid; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0cm; PADDING-TOP: 5pt; BORDER-BOTTOM: windowtext 1pt solid">

•      This Act imposes National Residue Survey Levies that are duties of excise.

•        Each Schedule imposes a particular levy and makes provision for:

               (a)     the operative rate of the levy; and

               (b)     the maximum rate of the levy; and

               (c)     the person who is liable to pay the levy; and

               (d)     any exemptions from the levy.</div>

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Definitions

                   Unless the contrary intention appears, a word or expression has the same meaning in a Schedule to this Act as it has in the _Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991_.

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Act to bind Crown

                   This Act binds the Crown in right of each of the States, of the Australian Capital Territory, of the Northern Territory and of Norfolk Island. However, it does not bind the Crown in right of the Commonwealth.

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Duties of excise

                   This Act authorises the imposition of a levy only so far as the levy is a duty of excise within the meaning of section 55 of the Constitution.

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Imposition of levy

                   The Schedules have effect.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Regulations

                   The Governor-General may make regulations prescribing matters:

                     (a)  required or permitted by this Act to be prescribed; or

                     (b)  necessary or convenient to be prescribed for carrying out or giving effect to this Act.

             (2)  For the purposes of this Schedule, in determining the weight of a carcase immediately after it has been dressed, no adjustment of that weight is to be made on account of shrinkage.

             (3)  For the purposes of this Schedule, the question whether companies were or are related to each other is to be determined in the same manner as the question whether 2 corporations are related to each other is determined under the _Corporations Act 2001_.

             (2)  The rate of National Residue Survey Levy imposed by this Schedule on a particular kind of eligible coarse grain is the rate that, under the regulations, is applicable to that grain. However, the rate must not exceed 0.03% of the value of the grain.

             (3)  Different rates may be prescribed by the regulations for different kinds of leviable coarse grain.

             (4)  Subclause (3) does not affect the application of subsection 33(3A) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.
