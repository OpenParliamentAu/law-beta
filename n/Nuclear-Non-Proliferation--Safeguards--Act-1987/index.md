 Section 4

The States concluding this Treaty, hereinafter referred to as the "Parties to the Treaty",
 Considering the devastation that would be visited upon all mankind by a nuclear war and the consequent need to make every effort to avert the danger of such a war and to take measures to safeguard the security of peoples, 
 Believing that the proliferation of nuclear weapons would seriously enhance the danger of nuclear war,
 In conformity with resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly calling for the conclusion of an agreement on the prevention of wider dissemination of nuclear weapons,
 Undertaking to co-operate in facilitating the application of International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards on peaceful nuclear activities, 
 Expressing their support for research, development and other efforts to further the application, within the framework of the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards system, of the principle of safeguarding effectively the flow of source and special fissionable materials by use of instruments and other techniques at certain strategic points,
 Affirming the principle that the benefits of peaceful applications of nuclear technology, including any technological by-products which may be derived by nuclear-weapon States from the development of nuclear explosive devices, should 
<center>Back to Top</center>
 be available for peaceful purposes to all Parties to the Treaty, whether nuclear-weapon or non-nuclear-weapon States,
 Convinced that, in furtherance of this principle, all Parties to the Treaty are entitled to participate in the fullest possible exchange of scientific information for, and to contribute alone or in co-operation with other States to, the further development of the applications of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, 
 Declaring their intention to achieve at the earliest possible date the cessation of the nuclear arms race and to undertake effective measures in the direction of nuclear disarmament, 
 Urging the co-operation of all States in the attainment of this objective, 
 Recalling the determination expressed by the Parties to the 1963 Treaty banning nuclear weapon tests in the atmosphere, in outer space and under water in its Preamble to seek to achieve the discontinuance of all test explosions of nuclear weapons for all time and to continue negotiations to this end, 
 Desiring to further the easing of international tension and the strengthening of trust between States in order to facilitate the cessation of the manufacture of nuclear weapons, the liquidation of all their existing stockpiles, and the elimination from national arsenals of nuclear weapons and the means of their delivery pursuant to a Treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control, 
 Recalling that, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, States must refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations, and that the establishment and maintenance of international peace and security are to be promoted with the least diversion for armaments of the world's human and economic resources, 
 Have agreed as follows: 
 <center>Article I</center>
 Each nuclear-weapon State Party to the Treaty undertakes not to transfer to any recipient whatsoever nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices or control over such weapons or explosive devices directly, or indirectly; and not in any way to assist, encourage, or induce any non-nuclear-weapon State to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, or control over such weapons or explosive devices. 
 <center>Article II</center>
 Each non-nuclear-weapon State Party to the Treaty undertakes not to receive the transfer from any transferor whatsoever of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices or of control over such weapons or explosive devices directly, or indirectly; not to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices; and not to seek or receive any assistance in the manufacture of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. 
 <center>Article III</center>
 1.	Each non-nuclear-weapon State Party to the Treaty undertakes to accept safeguards, as set forth in an agreement to be negotiated and concluded with the International Atomic Energy Agency in accordance with the Statute of the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Agency's safeguards system, for the exclusive purpose of verification of the fulfilment of its obligations assumed under this Treaty with a view to preventing diversion of nuclear energy from peaceful uses to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. Procedures for the safeguards required by this Article shall be followed with respect to source or special fissionable material whether it is being produced, processed or used in any principal nuclear facility or is outside any such facility. The safeguards required by this Article shall be applied on all source or special fissionable material in all peaceful nuclear activities within the territory of such State, under its jurisdiction, or carried out under its control anywhere. 
 2.	Each State Party to the Treaty undertakes not to provide: _(a)_ source or special fissionable material, or _(b)_ equipment or material especially designed or prepared for the processing, use or production of special fissionable material, to any non-nuclear-weapon State for peaceful purposes, unless the source or special fissionable material shall be subject to the safeguards required by this Article.
 3.	The safeguards required by this Article shall be implemented in a manner designed to comply with Article IV of this Treaty, and to avoid hampering the economic or technological development of the Parties or international co-operation in the field of peaceful nuclear activities, including the international exchange of nuclear material and equipment for the processing, use or production of nuclear material for peaceful purposes in accordance with the provisions of this Article and the principle of safeguarding set forth in the Preamble of the Treaty.
 4.	Non-nuclear-weapon States Party to the Treaty shall conclude agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency to meet the requirements of this Article either individually or together with other States in accordance with the Statute of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Negotiation of such agreements shall commence within 180 days from the original entry into force of this Treaty. For States depositing their instruments of ratification or accession after the 180-day period, negotiation of such agreements shall 
<center>Back to Top</center>
 commence not later than the date of such deposit. Such agreements shall enter into force not later than eighteen months after the date of initiation of negotiations.
 <center>Article IV</center>
 1.	Nothing in this Treaty shall be interpreted as affecting the inalienable right of all the Parties to the Treaty to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination and in conformity with Articles I and II of this Treaty.
 2.	All the Parties to the Treaty undertake to facilitate, and have the right to participate in, the fullest possible exchange of equipment, materials and scientific and technological information for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Parties to the Treaty in a position to do so shall also co-operate in contributing alone or together with other States or international organizations to the further development of the applications of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, especially in the territories of non-nuclear-weapon States Party to the Treaty, with due consideration for the needs of the developing areas of the world. 
 <center>Article V</center>
 Each Party to the Treaty undertakes to take appropriate measures to ensure that, in accordance with this Treaty, under appropriate international observation and through appropriate international procedures, potential benefits from any peaceful applications of nuclear explosions will be made available to non-nuclear-weapon States Party to the Treaty on a non-discriminatory basis and that the charge to such Parties for the explosive devices used will be as low as possible and exclude any charge for research and development. Non-nuclear-weapon States Party to the Treaty shall be able to obtain such benefits, pursuant to a special international agreement or agreements, through an appropriate international body with adequate representation of non-nuclear-weapon States. Negotiations on this subject shall commence as soon as possible after the Treaty enters into force. Non-nuclear-weapon States Party to the Treaty so desiring may also obtain such benefits pursuant to bilateral agreements.
 <center>Article VI</center>
 Each of the Parties to the Treaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control. 
 <center>Article VII</center>
 Nothing in this Treaty affects the right of any group of States to conclude regional treaties in order to assure the total absence of nuclear weapons in their respective territories.
 <center>Article VIII</center>
 1.	Any Party to the Treaty may propose amendments to this Treaty. The text of any proposed amendment shall be submitted to the Depositary Governments which shall circulate it to all Parties to the Treaty. Thereupon, if requested to do so by one-third or more of the Parties to the Treaty, the Depositary Governments shall convene a conference, to which they shall invite all the Parties to the Treaty, to consider such an amendment.
 2.	Any amendment to this Treaty must be approved by a majority of the votes of all the Parties to the Treaty, including the votes of all nuclear-weapon States Party to the Treaty and all other Parties which, on the date the amendment is circulated, are members of the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency. The amendment shall enter into force for each Party that deposits its instrument of ratification of the amendment upon the deposit of such instruments of ratification by a majority of all the Parties, including the instruments of ratification of all nuclear-weapon States Party to the Treaty and all other Parties which, on the date the amendment is circulated, are members of the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency.

The Director General shall report each such arrangement to the Board. 
 <center>Article 78</center>
 In circumstances which may lead to special inspections for the purposes specified in Article 74, Australia and the Agency shall consult forthwith. As a result of such consultations the Agency may: 
 (a)	Make inspections in addition to the routine inspection effort provided for in Articles 79 to 83; and
 (b)	Obtain access, in agreement with Australia, to information or locations in addition to those specified in Article 77\. Any disagreement concerning the need for additional access shall be resolved in accordance with Articles 21 and 22; in case action by Australia is essential and urgent, Article 18 shall apply.
 <center><u>Frequency and intensity of routine inspections</u></center>
 <center>Article 79</center>
 The Agency shall keep the number, intensity and duration of routine inspections, applying optimum timing, to the minimum consistent with the effective implementation of the safeguards procedures set forth in this Agreement, and shall make the optimum and most economical use of inspection resources available to it. 
 <center>Article 80</center>
 The Agency may carry out one routine inspection per year in respect of facilities and material balance areas outside facilities with a content or annual throughput, whichever is greater, of nuclear material not exceeding five effective kilograms.
 <center>Article 81</center>
 The number, intensity, duration, timing and mode of routine inspections in respect of facilities with a content or annual throughput of nuclear material exceeding five effective kilograms shall be determined on the basis that in the maximum or limiting case the inspection regime shall be no more intensive than is necessary and sufficient to maintain continuity of knowledge of the flow and inventory of nuclear material, and the maximum routine inspection effort in respect of such facilities shall be determined as follows:
 (a)	For reactors and sealed storage installations the maximum total of routine inspection per year shall be determined by allowing one sixth of a man-year of inspection for each such facility;
 (b)	For facilities, other than reactors or sealed storage installations, involving plutonium or uranium enriched to more than 5%, the maximum total of routine inspection per year shall be determined by allowing for each such facility 305\[radical]E man-days of inspection per year, where E is the inventory or annual throughput of nuclear material, whichever is greater, expressed in effective kilograms. The maximum established for any such facility shall not, however, be less than 1.5 man-years of inspection; and 
 (c)	For facilities not covered by paragraphs (a) or (b), the maximum total of routine inspection per year shall be determined by allowing for each such facility one third of a man-year of inspection plus 0.4<sub> ![A graphic exists here.](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004C00020/Html/21A94F6D2E9512DBCA256F71004C2A50/$FILE/1202.gif)</sub>E man-days of inspection per year, where E is the inventory or annual throughput of nuclear material, whichever is greater, expressed in effective kilograms.
 Australia and the Agency may agree to amend the figures for the maximum inspection effort specified in this Article, upon determination by the Board that such amendment is reasonable.
 <center>Article 82</center>
 Subject to Articles 79 to 81 the criteria to be used for determining the actual number, intensity, duration, timing and mode of routine inspections in respect of any facility shall include:
 (a)	<u>The form of the nuclear material,</u> in particular, whether the nuclear material is in bulk form or contained in a number of separate items; its chemical composition and, in the case of uranium, whether it is of low or high enrichment; and its accessibility;
 (b)	<u>The effectiveness of Australia's national accounting and control system,</u> including the extent to which the operators of facilities are functionally independent of the national accounting and control system; the extent to which the measures specified in Article 33 have been implemented by Australia; the promptness of reports provided to the Agency; their consistency with the Agency's independent verification; and the amount and accuracy of the material unaccounted for, as verified by the Agency;
 (c)	<u>Characteristics of Australia's nuclear fuel cycle,</u> in particular, the number and types of facilities containing nuclear material subject to safeguards, the characteristics of such facilities relevant to safeguards, notably the degree of containment; the extent to which the design of such 
<center>Back to Top</center>
 facilities facilitates verification of the flow and inventory of nuclear material; and the extent to which information from different material balance areas can be correlated; 
 (d)	<u>International interdependence,</u> in particular, the extent to which nuclear material is received from or sent to other States for use or processing; any verification activities by the Agency in connection therewith; and the extent to which Australia's peaceful nuclear activities are interrelated with those of other States; and
 (e)	<u>Technical developments in the field of safeguards,</u> including the use of statistical techniques and random sampling in evaluating the flow of nuclear material.
 <center>Article 83</center>
 Australia and the Agency shall consult if Australia considers that the inspection effort is being deployed with undue concentration on particular facilities.
 <center><u>Notice of inspections</u></center>
 <center>Article 84</center>
 The Agency shall give advance notice to Australia before arrival of inspectors at facilities or material balance areas outside facilities, as follows: 
 (a)	For ad hoc inspections pursuant to Article 72 (c), at least 24 hours; for those pursuant to Article 72 (a) and (b) as well as the activities provided for in Article 49, at least one week;
 (b)	For special inspections pursuant to Article 74, as promptly as possible after the Agency and Australia have consulted as provided for in Article 78, it being understood that notification of arrival normally will constitute part of the consultations; and

 Such notice of inspections shall include the names of the inspectors and shall indicate the facilities and the material balance areas outside facilities to be visited and the periods during which they will be visited. If the inspectors are to arrive from outside Australia the Agency shall also give advance notice of the place and time of their arrival in Australia.
 <center>Article 85</center>
 Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 84, the Agency may, as a supplementary measure, carry out without advance notification a portion of the routine inspections pursuant to Article 81 in accordance with the principle of random sampling. In performing any unannounced inspections, the Agency shall fully take into account any operational programme provided by Australia pursuant to Article 65 (b). Moreover, whenever practicable, and on the basis of the operational programme, it shall advise Australia periodically of its general programme of announced and unannounced inspections, specifying the general periods when inspections are foreseen. In carrying out any unannounced inspections, the Agency shall make every effort to minimize any practical difficulties for Australia and for facility operators, bearing in mind the relevant provisions of Articles 45 and 90\. Similarly Australia shall make every effort to facilitate the task of the inspectors.
 <center><u>Designation of inspectors</u></center>
 <center>Article 86</center>
 The following procedures shall apply to the designation of inspectors: 
 (a)	The Director General shall inform Australia in writing of the name, qualifications, nationality, grade and such other particulars as may be relevant, of each Agency official he proposes for designation as an inspector for Australia;
 (b)	Australia shall inform the Director General within thirty days of the receipt of such a proposal whether it accepts the proposal;

 However, in respect of inspectors needed for the activities provided for in Article 49 and to carry out ad hoc inspections pursuant to Article 72(a) and (b) the designation procedures shall be completed if possible within thirty days after the entry into force of this Agreement. If such designation appears impossible within this time limit, inspectors for such purposes shall be designated on a temporary basis.
 <center>Article 87</center>
 Australia shall grant or renew as quickly as possible appropriate visas, where required, for each inspector designated for Australia.
 <center><u>Conduct and visits of inspectors</u></center>
 <center>Article 88 </center>
 Inspectors, in exercising their functions under Articles 49 and 72 to 76, shall carry out their activities in a manner designed to avoid hampering or delaying the construction, commissioning or operation of facilities, or affecting their safety. In particular, inspectors shall not operate any facility themselves or direct the staff of a facility to carry out any operation. If inspectors 
<center>Back to Top</center>
 consider that in pursuance of Articles 75 and 76, particular operations in a facility should be carried out by the operator, they shall make a request therefor.
 <center>Article 89</center>
 When inspectors require services available in Australia, including the use of equipment, in connection with the performance of inspections, Australia shall facilitate the procurement of such services and the use of such equipment by inspectors.
 <center>Article 90</center>
 Australia shall have the right to have inspectors accompanied during their inspections by representatives of Australia, provided that inspectors shall not thereby be delayed or otherwise impeded in the exercise of their functions. 
 <center>STATEMENTS ON THE AGENCY'S VERIFICATION ACTIVITIES </center>
 <center>Article 91</center>
 The Agency shall inform Australia of: 
 (a)	The results of inspections, at intervals to be specified in the Subsidiary Arrangements; and
 (b)	The conclusions it has drawn from its verification activities in Australia, in particular by means of statements in respect of each material balance area, which shall be made as soon as possible after a physical inventory has been taken and verified by the Agency and a material balance has been struck.
 <center>INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</center>
 <center>Article 92</center>
 <center><u>General provisions</u></center>
 Nuclear material subject or required to be subject to safeguards under this Agreement which is transferred internationally shall, for purposes of this Agreement, be regarded as being the responsibility of Australia:
 (a)	In the case of import into Australia, from the time that such responsibility ceases to lie with the exporting State, and no later than the time at which the material reaches its destination; and
 (b)	In the case of export out of Australia, up to the time at which the recipient State assumes such responsibility, and no later than the time at which the nuclear material reaches its destination. 
 The point at which the transfer of responsibility will take place shall be determined in accordance with suitable arrangements to be made by the States concerned. Neither Australia nor any other State shall be deemed to have such responsibility for nuclear material merely by reason of the fact that the nuclear material is in transit on or over its territory or its territorial waters, or that it is being transported on a ship under its flag or in its aircraft. 
 <center><u>Transfers out of Australia</u></center>
 <center>Article 93</center>
 (a)	Australia shall notify the Agency of any intended transfer out of Australia of nuclear material subject to safeguards under this Agreement if the shipment exceeds one effective kilogram, or if, within a period of three months, several separate shipments are to be made to the same State, each of less than one effective kilogram but the total of which exceeds one effective kilogram.
 (b)	Such notification shall be given to the Agency after the conclusion of the contractual arrangements leading to the transfer and normally at least two weeks before the nuclear material is to be prepared for shipping.
 (c)	Australia and the Agency may agree on different procedures for advance notification.
 (d)	The notification shall specify:
 	(i)	The identification and, if possible, the expected quantity and composition of the nuclear material to be transferred, and the material balance area from which it will come;
 	(ii)	The State for which the nuclear material is destined;
 	(iii)	The dates on and locations at which the nuclear material is to be prepared for shipping;
 	(iv)	The approximate dates of dispatch and arrival of the nuclear material; and
 	(v)	At what point of the transfer the recipient State will assume responsibility for the nuclear material for the purpose of this Agreement, and the probable date on which that point will be reached. 
 <center>Article 94</center>
 The notification referred to in Article 93 shall be such as to enable the Agency to make, if necessary, an ad hoc inspection to identify, and if possible verify the quantity and composition of the nuclear material before it is transferred out of Australia and, if the Agency so wishes or Australia so requests, to affix seals to the nuclear material when it has been prepared for shipping. However, the transfer of the nuclear material shall not be delayed in any way by any action taken or contemplated by the Agency pursuant to such a notification.
 <center>Article 95</center>
 If the nuclear material will not be subject to Agency safeguards in the recipient State, Australia shall make arrangements for the Agency to receive, within three months of the time when the recipient State assumes responsibility for the nuclear material from Australia, confirmation by the recipient State of the transfer.
 <center><u>Transfers into Australia</u></center>

<center>Back to Top</center>
 <center>Article 96</center>
 (a)	Australia shall notify the Agency of any expected transfer into Australia of nuclear material required to be subject to safeguards under this Agreement if the shipment exceeds one effective kilogram, or if within a period of three months, several separate shipments are to be received from the same State, each of less than one effective kilogram but the total of which exceeds one effective kilogram.
 (b)	The Agency shall be notified as much in advance as possible of the expected arrival of the nuclear material, and in any case not later than the date on which Australia assumes responsibility for the nuclear material. 
 (c)	Australia and the Agency may agree on different procedures for advance notification.
 (d)	The notification shall specify:
 	(i)	The identification and, if possible, the expected quantity and composition of the nuclear material;
 	(ii)	At what point of the transfer Australia will assume responsibility for the nuclear material for the purpose of this Agreement, and the probable date on which that point will be reached; and
 	(iii)	The expected date of arrival, the location where, and the date on which, the nuclear material is intended to be unpacked.
 <center>Article 97</center>
 The notification referred to in Article 96 shall be such as to enable the Agency to make, if necessary, an ad hoc inspection to identify, and if possible verify the quantity and composition of, the nuclear material at the time the consignment is unpacked. However, unpacking shall not be delayed by any action taken or contemplated by the Agency pursuant to such a notification. 
 <center>Article 98</center>
 <center><u>Special reports</u></center>
 Australia shall make a special report as envisaged in Article 69 if any unusual incident or circumstances, including the occurrence of significant delay, lead Australia to believe that there is or may have been loss of nuclear material during an international transfer.

 _Have agreed_ as follows:
 <center>Article 1</center>
 For the purposes of this Convention: 
 (a)	"nuclear material" means plutonium except that with isotopic concentration exceeding 80% in plutonium-238; uranium-233; uranium enriched in the isotopes 235 or 233; uranium containing the mixture of isotopes as occurring in nature other than in the form of ore or ore-residue; any material containing one or more of the foregoing; 
 (b)	"uranium enriched in the isotope 235 or 233" means uranium containing the isotopes 235 or 233 or both in an amount such that the abundance ratio of the sum of these isotopes to the isotopes 238 is greater than the ratio of isotopes 235 to the isotope 238 occuring in nature;
 (c)	"international nuclear transport" means the carriage of a consignment of nuclear material by any means of transportation intended to go beyond the territory of the State where the shipment originates beginning with the departure from a facility of the shipper in that State and ending with the arrival at a facility of the receiver within the State of ultimate destination.
 <center>Article 2 </center>
 1.	This Convention shall apply to nuclear material used for peaceful purposes while in international nuclear transport. 
 2.	With the exception of articles 3 and 4 and paragraph 3 of article 5, this Convention shall also apply to nuclear material used for peaceful purposes while in domestic use, storage and transport.
 3.	Apart from the commitments expressly undertaken by States Parties in the articles covered by paragraph 2 with respect to nuclear material used for peaceful purposes while in domestic use, storage and transport, nothing in this Convention shall be interpreted as affecting the sovereign rights of a State regarding the domestic use, storage and transport of such nuclear material. 
 <center>Article 3</center>
 Each State Party shall take appropriate steps within the framework of its national law and consistent with international law to ensure as far as practicable that, during international nuclear transport, nuclear material within its territory, or on board a ship or aircraft under its jurisdiction insofar as such ship or aircraft is engaged in the transport to or from that State, is protected at the levels described in Annex I.
 <center>Article 4 </center>
 1.	Each State Party shall not export or authorize the export of nuclear material unless the State Party has received assurances that such material will be protected during the international nuclear transport at the levels described in Annex I.
 2.	Each State Party shall not import or authorize the import of nuclear material from a State not party to this Convention unless the State Party has received assurances that such material will during the international nuclear transport be protected at the levels described in Annex I.
 3.	A State Party shall not allow the transit of its territory by land or internal waterways or through its airports or seaports of nuclear material between States that are not parties to this Convention unless the State Party has received assurances as far as practicable that this nuclear material will be protected during international nuclear transport at the levels described in Annex I.
 4.	Each State Party shall apply within the framework of its national law the levels of physical protection described in Annex I to nuclear material being 
<center>Back to Top</center>
 transported from a part of that State to another part of the same State through international waters or airspace.
 5.	The State Party responsible for receiving assurances that the nuclear material will be protected at the levels described in Annex I according to paragraphs 1 to 3 shall identify and inform in advance States which the nuclear material is expected to transit by land or internal waterways, or whose airports or seaports it is expected to enter.
 6.	The responsibility for obtaining assurances referred to in paragraph 1 may be transferred, by mutual agreement, to the State Party involved in the transport as the importing State.
