(b)   <u>The effectiveness of Australia’s national accounting and control system,</u> including the extent to which the operators of facilities are functionally independent of the national accounting and control system; the extent to which the measures specified in Article 33 have been implemented by Australia; the promptness of reports provided to the Agency; their consistency with the Agency’s independent verification; and the amount and accuracy of the material unaccounted for, as verified by the Agency;

(c)   <u>Characteristics of Australia’s nuclear fuel cycle,</u> in particular, the number and types of facilities containing nuclear material subject to safeguards, the characteristics of such facilities relevant to safeguards, notably the degree of containment; the extent to which the design of such facilities facilitates verification of the flow and inventory of nuclear material; and the extent to which information from different material balance areas can be correlated; 

(d)   <u>International interdependence,</u> in particular, the extent to which nuclear material is received from or sent to other States for use or processing; any verification activities by the Agency in connection therewith; and the extent to which Australia’s peaceful nuclear activities are interrelated with those of other States; and

(e)   <u>Technical developments in the field of safeguards,</u> including the use of statistical techniques and random sampling in evaluating the flow of nuclear material.

**Article 83**

Australia and the Agency shall consult if Australia considers that the inspection effort is being deployed with undue concentration on particular facilities.

<u>Notice of inspections</u>

**Article 84**

The Agency shall give advance notice to Australia before arrival of inspectors at facilities or material balance areas outside facilities, as follows: 

(a)   For ad hoc inspections pursuant to Article 72 (c), at least 24 hours; for those pursuant to Article 72 (a) and (b) as well as the activities provided for in Article 49, at least one week;

(b)   For special inspections pursuant to Article 74, as promptly as possible after the Agency and Australia have consulted as provided for in Article 78, it being understood that notification of arrival normally will constitute part of the consultations; and

(c)   For routine inspections pursuant to Article 73, at least 24 hours in respect of the facilities referred to in Article 81 (b) and sealed storage installations containing plutonium or uranium enriched to more than 5%, and one week in all other cases.

Such notice of inspections shall include the names of the inspectors and shall indicate the facilities and the material balance areas outside facilities to be visited and the periods during which they will be visited. If the inspectors are to arrive from outside Australia the Agency shall also give advance notice of the place and time of their arrival in Australia.

**Article 85**

Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 84, the Agency may, as a supplementary measure, carry out without advance notification a portion of the routine inspections pursuant to Article 81 in accordance with the principle of random sampling.

<u>Conduct and visits of inspectors</u>

**Article 88**

Inspectors, in exercising their functions under Articles 49 and 72 to 76, shall carry out their activities in a manner designed to avoid hampering or delaying the construction, commissioning or operation of facilities, or affecting their safety. In particular, inspectors shall not operate any facility themselves or direct the staff of a facility to carry out any operation. If inspectors consider that in pursuance of Articles 75 and 76, particular operations in a facility should be carried out by the operator, they shall make a request therefor.

**Article 89**

When inspectors require services available in Australia, including the use of equipment, in connection with the performance of inspections, Australia shall facilitate the procurement of such services and the use of such equipment by inspectors.

**Article 90**

Australia shall have the right to have inspectors accompanied during their inspections by representatives of Australia, provided that inspectors shall not thereby be delayed or otherwise impeded in the exercise of their functions. 

STATEMENTS ON THE AGENCY’S VERIFICATION ACTIVITIES 

**Article 91**

The Agency shall inform Australia of: 

(a)   The results of inspections, at intervals to be specified in the Subsidiary Arrangements; and

(b)   The conclusions it has drawn from its verification activities in Australia, in particular by means of statements in respect of each material balance area, which shall be made as soon as possible after a physical inventory has been taken and verified by the Agency and a material balance has been struck.

INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS

**Article 92**

<u>General provisions</u>

Nuclear material subject or required to be subject to safeguards under this Agreement which is transferred internationally shall, for purposes of this Agreement, be regarded as being the responsibility of Australia:

(a)   In the case of import into Australia, from the time that such responsibility ceases to lie with the exporting State, and no later than the time at which the material reaches its destination; and

(b)   In the case of export out of Australia, up to the time at which the recipient State assumes such responsibility, and no later than the time at which the nuclear material reaches its destination. 

The point at which the transfer of responsibility will take place shall be determined in accordance with suitable arrangements to be made by the States concerned. Neither Australia nor any other State shall be deemed to have such responsibility for nuclear material merely by reason of the fact that the nuclear material is in transit on or over its territory or its territorial waters, or that it is being transported on a ship under its flag or in its aircraft. 

<u>Transfers out of Australia</u>

**Article 93**

(a)   Australia shall notify the Agency of any intended transfer out of Australia of nuclear material subject to safeguards under this Agreement if the shipment exceeds one effective kilogram, or if, within a period of three months, several separate shipments are to be made to the same State, each of less than one effective kilogram but the total of which exceeds one effective kilogram.

(b)   Such notification shall be given to the Agency after the conclusion of the contractual arrangements leading to the transfer and normally at least two weeks before the nuclear material is to be prepared for shipping.

(c)   Australia and the Agency may agree on different procedures for advance notification.

(d)   The notification shall specify:

                (i)     The identification and, if possible, the expected quantity and composition of the nuclear material to be transferred, and the material balance area from which it will come;

               (ii)     The State for which the nuclear material is destined;

              (iii)     The dates on and locations at which the nuclear material is to be prepared for shipping;

              (iv)     The approximate dates of dispatch and arrival of the nuclear material; and

               (v)     At what point of the transfer the recipient State will assume responsibility for the nuclear material for the purpose of this Agreement, and the probable date on which that point will be reached. 

**Article 94**

The notification referred to in Article 93 shall be such as to enable the Agency to make, if necessary, an ad hoc inspection to identify, and if possible verify the quantity and composition of the nuclear material before it is transferred out of Australia and, if the Agency so wishes or Australia so requests, to affix seals to the nuclear material when it has been prepared for shipping. However, the transfer of the nuclear material shall not be delayed in any way by any action taken or contemplated by the Agency pursuant to such a notification.

**Article 95**

If the nuclear material will not be subject to Agency safeguards in the recipient State, Australia shall make arrangements for the Agency to receive, within three months of the time when the recipient State assumes responsibility for the nuclear material from Australia, confirmation by the recipient State of the transfer.

<u>Transfers into Australia</u>

**Article 96**

(a)   Australia shall notify the Agency of any expected transfer into Australia of nuclear material required to be subject to safeguards under this Agreement if the shipment exceeds one effective kilogram, or if within a period of three months, several separate shipments are to be received from the same State, each of less than one effective kilogram but the total of which exceeds one effective kilogram.

(b)   The Agency shall be notified as much in advance as possible of the expected arrival of the nuclear material, and in any case not later than the date on which Australia assumes responsibility for the nuclear material. 

(c)   Australia and the Agency may agree on different procedures for advance notification.

(d)   The notification shall specify:

                (i)     The identification and, if possible, the expected quantity and composition of the nuclear material;

               (ii)     At what point of the transfer Australia will assume responsibility for the nuclear material for the purpose of this Agreement, and the probable date on which that point will be reached; and

              (iii)     The expected date of arrival, the location where, and the date on which, the nuclear material is intended to be unpacked.

**Article 97**

The notification referred to in Article 96 shall be such as to enable the Agency to make, if necessary, an ad hoc inspection to identify, and if possible verify the quantity and composition of, the nuclear material at the time the consignment is unpacked. However, unpacking shall not be delayed by any action taken or contemplated by the Agency pursuant to such a notification. 

**Article 98**

<u>Special reports</u>

Australia shall make a special report as envisaged in Article 69 if any unusual incident or circumstances, including the occurrence of significant delay, lead Australia to believe that there is or may have been loss of nuclear material during an international transfer.

1.    Levels of physical protection for nuclear material during storage incidental to international nuclear transport include: 

        (a)   For Category III materials, storage within an area to which access is controlled;

       (b)   For Category II materials, storage within an area under constant surveillance by guards or electronic devices, surrounded by a physical barrier with a limited number of points of entry under appropriate control or any area with an equivalent level of physical protection;

        (c)   For Category I material, storage within a protected area as defined for Category II above, to which, in addition, access is restricted to persons whose trustworthiness has been determined, and which is under surveillance by guards who are in close communication with appropriate response forces. Specific measures taken in this context should have as their object the detection and prevention of any assault, unauthorized access or unauthorized removal of material.

2.    Levels of physical protection for nuclear material during international transport include:

        (a)   For Category II and III materials, transportation shall take place under special precautions including prior arrangement among sender, receiver, and carrier, and prior agreement between natural or legal persons subject to the jurisdiction and regulation of exporting and importing States, specifying time, place and procedures for transferring transport responsibility;

       (b)   For Category I materials, transportation shall take place under special precautions identified above for transportation of Category II and III materials, and in addition, under constant surveillance by escorts and under conditions which assure close communication with appropriate response forces; 

        (c)   For natural uranium other than in the form of ore or ore‑residue, transportation protection for quantities exceeding 500 kilograms U shall include advance notification of shipment specifying mode of transport, expected time of arrival and confirmation of receipt of shipment.
