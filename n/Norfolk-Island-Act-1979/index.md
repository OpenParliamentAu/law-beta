## An Act to provide for the government of Norfolk Island

                   WHEREAS by an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, made and passed in the sixth and seventh years of the reign of Her Majesty Queen Victoria intituled “An Act to amend so much of an Act of the last Session, for the Government of New South Wales and Van Diemen’s Land, as relates to Norfolk Island,” it was, amongst other things, enacted that it should be lawful for Her Majesty, by Letters Patent under the Great Seal of the United Kingdom, to sever Norfolk Island from the Government of New South Wales and to annex it to the Government and Colony of Van Diemen’s Land:

                   AND WHEREAS Her Majesty Queen Victoria, in exercise of the powers vested in Her by the said Act, by a Commission under the Great Seal of the United Kingdom bearing date the twenty-fourth day of October, 1843, appointed that from and after the twenty-ninth day of September, 1844, Norfolk Island should be severed from the Government of New South Wales and annexed to the Government and Colony of Van Diemen’s Land:

                   AND WHEREAS by an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, called the Australian Waste Lands Act 1855, it was, amongst other things, provided that it should be lawful for Her Majesty at any time, by Order in Council, to separate Norfolk Island from the Colony of Van Diemen’s Land and to make such provision for the Government of Norfolk Island as might seem expedient:

                   AND WHEREAS on 8 June 1856 persons who had previously inhabited Pitcairn Island settled on Norfolk Island:

                   AND WHEREAS by an Order in Council dated the twenty-fourth day of June, 1856, made by Her Majesty in pursuance of the last-mentioned Act, it was ordered and declared, amongst other things, that from and after the date of the proclamation of the Order in New South Wales Norfolk Island should be thereby separated from the said Colony of Van Diemen’s Land (now called Tasmania) and that from that date all power, authority, and jurisdiction of the Governor, Legislature, Courts of Justice, and Magistrates of Tasmania over Norfolk Island should cease and determine, and that from the said date Norfolk Island should be a distinct and separate Settlement, the affairs of which should until further Order in that behalf by Her Majesty be administered by a Governor to be for that purpose appointed by Her Majesty with the advice and consent of Her Privy Council: and it was thereby further ordered that the Governor and Commander-in-Chief for the time being of the Colony of New South Wales should be, and he thereby was, constituted Governor of Norfolk Island, with the powers and authorities in the said Order mentioned:

                   AND WHEREAS the said Order in Council was proclaimed in New South Wales on 1 November 1856:

                   AND WHEREAS by an Order in Council dated the fifteenth day of January, 1897, made in pursuance of the said last-mentioned Act, Her Majesty, after reciting that it was expedient that other provision should be made for the government of Norfolk Island, and that, in prospect of the future annexation of Norfolk Island to the Colony of New South Wales or to any Federal body of which that Colony might thereafter form part, in the meantime the affairs of Norfolk Island should be administered by the Governor of New South Wales as therein provided, was pleased to revoke the said Order in Council of the twenty-fourth day of June, One thousand eight hundred and fifty-six, and to order that the affairs of Norfolk Island should thenceforth, and until further Order should be made in that behalf by Her Majesty, be administered by the Governor and Commander-in-Chief for the time being of the Colony of New South Wales and its Dependencies:

                   AND WHEREAS the said Order in Council was published in the New South Wales _Government Gazette_ on 19 March 1897, and took effect at that date:

                   AND WHEREAS by an Order in Council dated the eighteenth day of October, One thousand nine hundred, made in pursuance of the said last mentioned Act, Her Majesty was pleased to revoke the said Order in Council of the fifteenth day of January, One thousand eight hundred and ninety-seven, and to order that the affairs of Norfolk Island should thenceforth, and until further Order should be made in that behalf by Her Majesty, be administered by the Governor for the time being of the State of New South Wales and its Dependencies:

                   AND WHEREAS the said Order in Council was published in the New South Wales _Government Gazette_ on 1 January 1901, and took effect at that date:

                   AND WHEREAS by an Order in Council dated the 30th day of March, 1914, His Majesty King George V, by virtue and in exercise of the power in that behalf by the said last-mentioned Act or otherwise in His Majesty vested, after reciting that the Parliament had passed an Act No. 15 of 1913, entitled “An Act to provide for the acceptance of Norfolk Island as a territory under the authority of the Commonwealth, and for the government thereof” and that it was expedient that the said Order in Council of 18th of October, 1900, should be revoked and that Norfolk Island should be placed under the authority of the Commonwealth of Australia, was pleased to revoke the said Order in Council of 18th of October, 1900, and to order that Norfolk Island be placed under the authority of the Commonwealth of Australia:

                   AND WHEREAS the said Order in Council was published in the _Gazette_ on 17 June 1914, and took effect from 1 July 1914, being the date of commencement of the _Norfolk Island__Act 1913_:

                   AND WHEREAS Norfolk Island was, by the _Norfolk  Island__Act 1913_, declared to be accepted by the Commonwealth as a Territory under the authority of the Commonwealth:

                   AND WHEREAS Norfolk Island has been governed by the Commonwealth initially under the provisions of the _Norfolk  Island__Act 1913_, and subsequently under the provisions of the _Norfolk  Island__Act 1957_:

                   AND WHEREAS the residents of Norfolk  Island include descendants of the settlers from Pitcairn Island:

                   AND WHEREAS the Parliament recognises the special relationship of the said descendants with Norfolk Island and their desire to preserve their traditions and culture:

                   AND WHEREAS the Parliament considers it to be desirable and to be the wish of the people of Norfolk Island that Norfolk Island achieve, over a period of time, internal self-government as a Territory under the authority of the Commonwealth and, to that end, to provide, among other things, for the establishment of a representative Legislative Assembly and of other separate political and administrative institutions on Norfolk Island:

                   AND WHEREAS the Parliament intends that within a period of 5 years after the coming into operation of this Act consideration will be given to extending the powers conferred by or under this Act on the Legislative Assembly and the other political and administrative institutions of Norfolk Island, and that provision be made in this Act to enable the results of such consideration to be implemented:

                   BE IT THEREFORE ENACTED by the Queen, and the Senate and House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia, as follows:
