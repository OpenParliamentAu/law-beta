South Wales Government Gazette on 19 March 1897, and took effect at that date: <p><lf>   AND WHEREAS by an Order in Council dated the eighteenth day of October, One thousand nine hundred, made in pursuance of the said last mentioned Act, Her Majesty was pleased to revoke the said Order in Council of the fifteenth day of January, One thousand eight hundred and ninety-seven, and to order that

<p><lf>   AND WHEREAS the residents of Norfolk Island include descendants of the settlers from Pitcairn Island: <p><lf>   AND WHEREAS the Parliament recognises the special relationship of the said descendants with Norfolk Island and their desire to preserve their traditions and culture: <p><lf>   AND WHEREAS the Parliament considers it to be desirable and to be the wish of the people of Norfolk Island that Norfolk Island achieve, over a period of time, internal self-government as a Territory under the authority of the Commonwealth and, to that end, to provide, among other things, for the
