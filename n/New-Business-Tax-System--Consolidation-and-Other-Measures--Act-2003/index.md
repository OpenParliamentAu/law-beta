Operative provisions

705-305  Object of this Subdivision

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

		The object of this Subdivision is to avoid the time and expense involved in

correcting errors affecting <sup>*</sup>tax cost setting amount calculations.

This is done by providing for <sup>*</sup>capital gains or <sup>*</sup>capital

losses to reverse the errors.

 </dl></dl>

705-310  Operation of Part&#160;IVA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

		To avoid doubt, this Subdivision does not limit the operation of

Part&#160;IVA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

 </dl></dl>

705-315  Errors that attract special adjustment action

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>Section&#160;705-320 (about later adjustments to correct <sup>*</sup>tax

cost setting amount calculation errors) applies if the conditions in this

section are satisfied.

</dd> </dl></dl>

_Tax cost setting amount taken into account_

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(2)</dt><dd>The first condition is that the <sup>*</sup>head company of a

<sup>*</sup>consolidated group worked out a <sup>*</sup>tax cost setting

amount, in purported compliance with this Division, for an asset of an entity

that becomes a <sup>*</sup>subsidiary member of the group that is an asset of a

kind referred to in section&#160;705-35 as a reset cost base asset.

</dd> </dl></dl>

_Error in calculation_

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(3)</dt><dd>The second condition is that:

</dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>the <sup>*</sup>head company made one or more errors in working out the

<sup>*</sup>tax cost setting amount; and</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>those errors caused the tax cost setting amount to differ from its correct

amount.

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

If the errors caused the tax cost setting amount to be more, the difference is an _overstated amount_. If the errors caused the tax cost setting amount to be less, the difference is an _understated amount_.

_Unreasonable to require recalculation_

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(4)</dt><dd>The third condition is that, having regard to the following factors:

</dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>the net size of the errors compared to the size of the

<sup>*</sup>allocable cost amount for the joining entity;</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>the number of <sup>*</sup>tax cost setting amounts that would have to be

recalculated, and the difficulty of making the recalculations;</dd>

<dt>(c)</dt><dd>the number of adjustments, in assessments that could be amended and in

future <sup>*</sup>income tax returns, that would be necessary to correct the

errors;</dd>

<dt>(d)</dt><dd>the difficulty in obtaining any necessary information;

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

it is not reasonable to require a recalculation of the amounts involved.

_Exception where error due to fraud or evasion_

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(5)</dt><dd>However, the conditions in this section are _not_

satisfied if the errors were to any extent due to fraud or evasion.

</dd> </dl></dl>

_Requirement to notify_

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(6)</dt><dd>The <sup>*</sup>head company of the <sup>*</sup>consolidated group must,

as soon as practicable after becoming aware that it made one or more errors in

working out the <sup>*</sup>tax cost setting amount, notify the Commissioner in

the <sup>*</sup>approved form:

</dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>that it had made the errors; and</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>of the amount of the overstated amount or understated amount.

</dd>

705-320  Tax cost setting amounts taken to be correct

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>For the purposes of this Act (other than this Subdivision) and for the

purposes of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_, any <sup>*</sup>tax

cost setting amounts that were worked out by the <sup>*</sup>head company, so

far as they were due to the errors, are taken to have been correct if the

conditions in section&#160;705-315 are satisfied.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note 1:	If the conditions in section&#160;705-315 are satisfied,

CGT event L6 happens (see section&#160;104-525). Note 2:	Subsection&#160;(1) means that the Commissioner cannot amend any assessments necessary to correct the errors, and that (except as mentioned in subsection&#160;(2)) no offences or administrative penalties arise in respect of the errors.  </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(2)</dt><dd>Subsection&#160;(1) does not apply for the purposes of determining whether

there is an offence against section&#160;8N of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_, or an administrative penalty under section&#160;284-75 or 284-145

in Schedule&#160;1 to that Act, in relation to statements made before the

Commissioner became aware of the errors.

</dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note 1:	Section&#160;8N of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ deals with false or misleading statements. Sections&#160;284-75 and

284-145 in Schedule&#160;1 to that Act set out the circumstances in which an

entity is liable for an administrative penalty. Note 2:	The offence and administrative penalty provisions however apply on a modified basis&#151;see subsection 8W(1C) of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_, and subsections 284-80(2) and 284-150(2) in Schedule&#160;1 to that Act.  </dl></dl>

How Subdivision&#160;165-CC applies to consolidated groups

715-75  Extension of single entity rule and entry history rule

loss).

</dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note:	One consequence of this is that the head company is the

only member of a consolidated group that can have a changeover time and be

subject to consequences under Subdivision&#160;165-CC. The head company is

treated as owning all CGT assets owned by group members, and as making relevant

losses.

Effect on Subdivision&#160;165-CC of entity leaving consolidated group

715-80  Application of sections&#160;715-85 to 715-110

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

		Sections&#160;715-85 to 715-110 apply if, at a particular time (the

_leaving time_), an entity (the _leaving entity_)

ceases to be a <sup>*</sup>subsidiary member of a <sup>*</sup>consolidated

group.

 </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note 1:	If a changeover time happened to the head company at or

after the group came into existence and before the leaving time,

Subdivision&#160;165-CC does _not_ apply to the head company at and after

the leaving time, in respect of assets that leave with the leaving entity, in

relation to the changeover time. 	This is because the head company can no longer make a capital loss, or become entitled to a deduction, in respect of a CGT event happening to any of those assets. Note 2:	If, just before the leaving time, the head company had a loss denial pool, see section&#160;715-120\.  </dl></dl>

715-85  First changeover time for leaving company at or after leaving time

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>on the basis that the reference time under subsection 165-115A(2A) is the

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>making the additional assumptions in section&#160;715-290.

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note:	If the leaving entity is a trust, it cannot have a

changeover time (because Subdivision&#160;165-CC applies only to companies), so

</dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note:	One consequence of this is that the head company is the

only member of a consolidated group that can have an alteration time and be

subject to reductions or other consequences under Subdivision&#160;165-CD. The

head company is treated as owning all CGT assets owned by group members, and as

making relevant losses. 	Another consequence is for working out who has a relevant equity interest or relevant debt interest in a company that has an alteration time at which it is a loss company but not a member of a consolidated group. Interests in the loss company that are owned by subsidiary members of the group are treated as being owned by the head company.  </dl></dl>

	of this Act from applying to the assets of the joining entity in

relation to the joining time. 	If the joining entity is _not_ a chosen transitional entity, it is assumed that the process of resetting the tax costs of its assets will bring their tax costs into closer alignment to their market values, and so remove the need to consider unrealised losses on those assets that existed before the joining time.  </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note:	One consequence of this for the operation of

economic benefits provided by or to a subsidiary member of a consolidated group

are treated as provided by or to the head company of the group. As a result:

 </dl></dl>

*	the head company is the only group member that can be a losing entity or gaining entity for an indirect value shift; and

719-250  What this Subdivision is about

This Subdivision modifies the rules about transferring and utilising losses so the rules operate appropriately in relation to MEC groups, taking account of the special characteristics of those groups. The modifications mainly affect:

	(a)	rules about maintaining the same ownership to be able to utilise a loss; and
 	(b)	rules for working out how much of a loss can be utilised by reference to bundles of losses and their available fractions.

Application and object

701C-25  Application and object of this Subdivision

_Application_

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>This Subdivision applies if an entity (the _transitional foreign-held joining entity_) that is a transitional foreign-held subsidiary or a

transitional foreign-held indirect subsidiary becomes a subsidiary member of a

consolidated group at the time (the _formation time_) the group

comes into existence.

</dd> </dl></dl>

_Object_

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(2)</dt><dd>The object of this Subdivision is to ensure that, on becoming a subsidiary

member at the formation time, the tax cost of the assets of any transitional

foreign-held subsidiary is not set and that the tax cost setting amount for

assets of any transitional foreign-held indirect subsidiary that becomes a

subsidiary member at that time takes account of this.

</dd> </dl></dl>

Basic modification

701C-30  Transitional foreign-held subsidiary to be treated as part of head company

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

		The following provisions:

 </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>section&#160;701-10 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_(about

setting the tax cost of assets that an entity brings into the group);</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>Subdivision&#160;705-A of that Act, in its application in accordance with

Subdivision&#160;705-B of that Act;

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

apply, for the purposes of setting the tax cost of an asset of the transitional foreign-held entity at the formation time, as if each subsidiary member of the group that is a transitional foreign-held subsidiary at the formation time were a part of the head company of the group, rather than a separate entity.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note 1:	This section means that references in those provisions to

matters internal to the group operate as if transitional foreign-held

subsidiaries in the group were parts of the head company of the group. For

example:

 </dl></dl>

(a)	provisions operating if the head company holds (whether directly or indirectly) membership interests in another entity operate even if a transitional foreign-held subsidiary actually holds those interests; and
 (b)	provisions operating if the head company owns or controls another entity operate even if one or more transitional foreign-held subsidiaries actually own or control that other entity; and
 (c)	provisions operating if an entity is interposed between the head company and another entity operate even if the first entity is actually interposed between a transitional foreign-held subsidiary and the other entity.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note 2:	If the transitional foreign-held entity is a transitional

foreign-held subsidiary, this section means the assets of the entity do not

have their tax cost reset at the formation time. This is because

Subdivision&#160;705-A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, in its

application in accordance with Subdivision&#160;705-B of that Act, resets the

tax cost of assets of _subsidiary_ members of a group, but not assets of

the head company.

 </dl></dl>

Other modifications

701C-35  Trading stock value not set for assets of transitional foreign-held subsidiaries

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

		Subsection 701-35(4) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_(setting

value of trading stock at tax-neutral amount) does not apply to the assets of

the transitional foreign-held entity if it is a transitional foreign-held

subsidiary.

 </dl></dl>

701C-40  Cost setting rules for exit cases&#151;modification of core rules

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

		Section&#160;701-15 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies as

if the following subsection were added at the end of the section:

 </dl></dl>

_Application to transitional foreign-held subsidiaries_

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(4)</dt><dd>If an entity that ceases to be a subsidiary member is a transitional

foreign-held subsidiary when it does so:

</dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>this section applies to each membership interest in the transitional

foreign-held subsidiary that is held by an entity (an _eligible non-resident_) of a kind mentioned in subparagraph 701C-20(b)(i), (ii),

<dt>(iii)</dt><dd>or (iv) of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_ in

the same way as it applies to a membership interest in the transitional

foreign-held subsidiary that is held by the head company; and</dd></dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>for that purpose, the definition of _head company core purposes_ in subsection 701-1(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies to the eligible non-resident in the same way as it applies to

the head company.

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

701C-50  Cost setting rules for exit cases&#151;reference to modification of core rule

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

		Section&#160;711-5 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies as if

the following note were added at the end of the section:

 </dl></dl>

<center>Back to Top</center>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note:	If the leaving entity is a transitional foreign-held

subsidiary (within the meaning of section&#160;701C-20 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997)_, this Division will, in accordance with

subsection 701-15(4) of this Act (see section&#160;701C-40 of the

first-mentioned Act), apply to membership interests that an eligible

non-resident mentioned in that subsection holds in the entity in the same way

as it applies to membership interests that the head company holds in the entity.

210-5  How is this achieved?

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

PDFs, which are the vehicles for venture capital investment. If the PDF makes a

distribution franked with a venture capital credit, the relevant venture

capital investor receives a certain part of a distribution from the PDF as

exempt income and, in addition, is entitled to a tax offset equal to the

 Guide to Subdivision&#160;210-G
 210-85  What this Subdivision is about
 This Subdivision:

*	creates a venture capital sub-account for each PDF; and

*	identifies when venture capital credits and debits arise in the sub-account and the amount of those credits and debits; and

*	identifies when there is a venture capital surplus or deficit in the sub-account; and

*	creates a liability to pay venture capital deficit tax if the account is in deficit at certain times.

210-95  Venture capital deficit tax

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>Venture capital deficit tax is payable if a PDF's venture capital

sub-account is in deficit at the end of the PDF's income year, or immediately

before it ceases to be a PDF.</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>A PDF's venture capital sub-account may be in deficit, even if its franking account is not. This can happen because only income tax on income of a particular kind (capital gains on venture capital investments) gives rise to venture capital credits. This means that when a PDF anticipates a venture capital credit, it is not only anticipating that income tax will be paid, but that income tax on income of that kind will be paid. Although income tax may, in fact, later be paid, it will not necessarily be income of the kind that would give rise to a venture capital credit. This results in franking credits arising even while the venture capital sub-account remains in deficit.</dd> <dt>(3)</dt><dd>The discrepancy between the franking account balance and the venture capital sub-account balance can also arise because venture capital credits do not necessarily arise at the same time as the relevant franking credits and debits (see item&#160;1 of the table in section&#160;210-105 and item&#160;2 of the table in section&#160;210-120). </dd> </dl></dl>

 A superannuation fund or other entity that deals with superannuation that receives a distribution franked with a venture capital credit is entitled to a tax offset equal to the credit.

210-160  The significance of a venture capital credit

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>The venture capital credit on a distribution is only significant in the

hands of a relevant venture capital investor (basically a superannuation fund

or other entity that deals with superannuation).</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>That investor  receives a tax offset. In most cases, this will be equal to the venture capital credit.</dd> <dt>(3)</dt><dd>Under section&#160;124ZM of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, that part of the distribution that is franked with a venture capital credit is also treated as exempt income in the hands of the entity. </dd> </dl></dl>

210-165  Recipients for whom the venture capital credit is not significant

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>For other entities, the fact that all or part of the franking credit on a

distribution is also a venture capital credit can be ignored.</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>The franking credit will either generate a gross-up of the entity's assessable income and a corresponding tax offset under Division&#160;207 or, if the right to make an election under section&#160;124ZM of the _Income Tax Assessment 1936_ is exercised, the franked part of the distribution will be treated as exempt income.</dd> <dt>(3)</dt><dd>The unfranked part of the distribution is treated as exempt income under section&#160;124ZM of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. </dd> </dl></dl>

 The Commissioner may make an assessment of a corporate tax entity's liability to pay franking tax, and the franking account balance and the venture capital sub-account balance on which that liability is based. An entity's first return for an income year is treated as an assessment by the Commissioner. To this extent, there is self-assessment.
