###### Schedule 1—Consolidation: amendments of various cost base provisions

Part 1—Adjustments to restrict step 4 reduction in allocable cost amount in Subdivision 705-B and 705-D cases

Income Tax Assessment Act 1997

## 1  Section 705-155

Repeal the section, substitute:

##### <a id="705-155"></a>705-155  Adjustments to restrict step 4 reduction of allocable cost amount to effective distributions to head company in respect of direct membership interests

Object

             (1)  The object of this section is to ensure that, in working out the group’s <sup>* </sup>allocable cost amount for entities that become <sup>* </sup>subsidiary members of the group at the formation time, the reduction under step 4 in the table in section 705-60 (about pre-formation time distributions out of certain profits) is made only for profits that have been effectively distributed to the <sup>* </sup>head company in respect of its direct <sup>* </sup>membership interests in the entities. This ensures consistency with the ordering rule in section 705-145.

When section applies

             (2)  This section applies to a distribution (the **_subject distribution_**) to the extent that the following conditions are satisfied:

                     (a)  the distribution is made by an entity (the **_subject entity_**) that becomes a <sup>* </sup>subsidiary member of the group at the formation time;

                     (b)  in working out the group’s <sup>* </sup>allocable cost amount for the subject entity there would, apart from this section, be a reduction under step 4 in the table in section 705-60 for the distribution.

Step 4 reduction only if subject distribution is made to head company etc.

             (3)  There is no reduction as mentioned in paragraph (2)(b) for the subject distribution unless:

                     (a)  the subject distribution is made to the <sup>* </sup>head company of the group; or

                     (b)  the reduction is in accordance with subsection (5).

Step 4 reduction for effective distribution to head company

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  at the formation time, the <sup>* </sup>head company of the group has a direct <sup>* </sup>membership interest in the subject entity; and

                     (b)  the head company acquired the membership interest directly from another entity, or indirectly as a result of one or more acquisitions from other entities, where:

                              (i)  section 160ZZ0 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ applied to each acquisition; or

                             (ii)  there was a roll-over under Subdivision 126-B for each acquisition;

                            or a combination of these happened; and

                     (c)  while it held the membership interest, the entity, or one of the entities, mentioned in paragraph (b) (the **_recipient of the further distribution_**) received a distribution (the **_further distribution_**) of some of the subject distribution from the subject entity;

the consequences in subsections (5) and (6) apply.

Reduction for further distribution that remains with recipient

             (5)  If:

                     (a)  the following happen:

                              (i)  by the formation time, any of the further distribution (the **_eligible reduction amount_**) had not again been distributed by the recipient of the further distribution;

                             (ii)  the recipient of the further distribution does not become a <sup>* </sup>subsidiary member of the group at the formation time; or

                     (b)  the following happen:

                              (i)  by the formation time, any of the further distribution (the **_eligible reduction amount_**) had been distributed by the recipient of the further distribution to another entity directly, or indirectly though successive distributions by interposed entities;

                             (ii)  that other entity does not become a subsidiary member of the group at the formation time; or

                     (c)  both of the above paragraphs apply;

then, in working out the group’s <sup>* </sup>allocable cost amount for the subject entity, the reduction under step 4 in the table in section 705-60 for the subject distribution only takes place to the extent that it equals the sum of all eligible reduction amounts.

Step 1 reduced cost base adjustment to reverse effect of reduction for further distribution

             (6)  Also, if subsection 160ZK(5) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ or subsection 110-55(7) of this Act applied to the further distribution, then for the purposes of step 1 in the table in section 705-60 in working out the group’s <sup>* </sup>allocable cost amount for the subject entity:

                     (a)  the reference in subsection 705-65(3) to a reduction resulting from the application of subsection 160ZK(5) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; and

                     (b)  the reference in subsection 705-65(5) to a reduction that has taken place under subsection 110-55(7);

include a reference to the reduction in the <sup>* </sup>reduced cost base of the membership interest in the subject entity resulting from the application of subsection 160ZK(5) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, or subsection 110-55(7) of this Act, to the further distribution.

## 2  Section 705-230

Repeal the section, substitute:

##### <a id="705-230"></a>705-230  Adjustments to restrict step 4 reduction of allocable cost amount to effective distributions to head company in respect of direct membership interests

Object

             (1)  The object of this section is to ensure that, in working out the group’s <sup>* </sup>allocable cost amount for the linked entities, the reduction under step 4 in the table in section 705-60 (about pre-formation time distributions out of certain profits) is made only for profits that have been effectively distributed to the <sup>* </sup>head company in respect of its direct <sup>* </sup>membership interests in the entities. This ensures consistency with the ordering rule in section 705-225.

When section applies

             (2)  This section applies to a distribution to the extent that the following conditions are satisfied:

                     (a)  the distribution is made by a linked entity;

                     (b)  in working out the group’s <sup>* </sup>allocable cost amount for the linked entity there would, apart from this section, be a reduction under step 4 in the table in section 705-60 for the distribution.

Step 4 reduction only if subject distribution is made to head company

             (3)  There is no reduction as mentioned in subsection (2) for the distribution unless it is made to the <sup>* </sup>head company of the group.

Repeal the section, substitute:

##### <a id="705-160"></a>705-160  Adjustment to allocation of allocable cost amount to take account of owned profits or losses of certain entities that become subsidiary members

Object

             (1)  The object of this section is to prevent a distortion under section 705-35 in the allocation of <sup>* </sup>allocable cost amount to an entity that becomes a <sup>* </sup>subsidiary member of the group where that entity has direct or indirect <sup>* </sup>membership interests in another entity that has certain profits or tax losses when it becomes a subsidiary member.

                     (e)  the roll-over asset is not a <sup>* </sup>pre-CGT asset at the joining time; and

                      (f)  the roll-over asset becomes that of the head company of the joined group because subsection 701-1(1) (the single entity rule) applies when the joining entity becomes a <sup>* </sup>subsidiary member of the group.

What the step 3A amount is

             (2)  The step 3A amount is:

What the step 3A amount is

             (4)  The step 3A amount is:

                     (a)  if, as a result of the Subdivision 126-B roll-over mentioned in subparagraph (3)(a)(i), or the section 160ZZO roll-over mentioned in subparagraph (3)(a)(ii), a <sup>* </sup>capital loss of the originating company was disregarded or a capital loss of the transferor was not incurred—an increase amount equal to the capital loss; or

What the step 3A amount is

             (4)  The step 3A amount is:

#### Operative provisions

##### <a id="705-305"></a>705-305  Object of this Subdivision

                   The object of this Subdivision is to avoid the time and expense involved in correcting errors affecting <sup>* </sup>tax cost setting amount calculations. This is done by providing for <sup>* </sup>capital gains or <sup>* </sup>capital losses to reverse the errors.

##### <a id="705-310"></a>705-310  Operation of Part IVA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_

                   To avoid doubt, this Subdivision does not limit the operation of Part IVA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

##### <a id="705-315"></a>705-315  Errors that attract special adjustment action

             (1)  Section 705-320 (about later adjustments to correct <sup>* </sup>tax cost setting amount calculation errors) applies if the conditions in this section are satisfied.

Tax cost setting amount taken into account

             (2)  The first condition is that the <sup>* </sup>head company of a <sup>* </sup>consolidated group worked out a <sup>* </sup>tax cost setting amount, in purported compliance with this Division, for an asset of an entity that becomes a <sup>* </sup>subsidiary member of the group that is an asset of a kind referred to in section 705-35 as a reset cost base asset.

Error in calculation

             (3)  The second condition is that:

                     (a)  the <sup>* </sup>head company made one or more errors in working out the <sup>* </sup>tax cost setting amount; and

                     (b)  those errors caused the tax cost setting amount to differ from its correct amount.

If the errors caused the tax cost setting amount to be more, the difference is an **_overstated amount_**. If the errors caused the tax cost setting amount to be less, the difference is an **_understated amount_**.

Unreasonable to require recalculation

             (4)  The third condition is that, having regard to the following factors:

                     (a)  the net size of the errors compared to the size of the <sup>* </sup>allocable cost amount for the joining entity;

                     (b)  the number of <sup>* </sup>tax cost setting amounts that would have to be recalculated, and the difficulty of making the recalculations;

                     (c)  the number of adjustments, in assessments that could be amended and in future <sup>* </sup>income tax returns, that would be necessary to correct the errors;

                     (d)  the difficulty in obtaining any necessary information;

it is not reasonable to require a recalculation of the amounts involved.

Exception where error due to fraud or evasion

(5)However, the conditions in this section are _not_ satisfied if the errors were to any extent due to fraud or evasion.

Requirement to notify

             (6)  The <sup>* </sup>head company of the <sup>* </sup>consolidated group must, as soon as practicable after becoming aware that it made one or more errors in working out the <sup>* </sup>tax cost setting amount, notify the Commissioner in the <sup>* </sup>approved form:

                     (a)  that it had made the errors; and

                     (b)  of the amount of the overstated amount or understated amount.

##### <a id="705-320"></a>705-320  Tax cost setting amounts taken to be correct

             (1)  For the purposes of this Act (other than this Subdivision) and for the purposes of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_, any <sup>* </sup>tax cost setting amounts that were worked out by the <sup>* </sup>head company, so far as they were due to the errors, are taken to have been correct if the conditions in section 705-315 are satisfied.

Note 1:       If the conditions in section 705-315 are satisfied, CGT event L6 happens (see section 104-525).

Note 2:       Subsection (1) means that the Commissioner cannot amend any assessments necessary to correct the errors, and that (except as mentioned in subsection (2)) no offences or administrative penalties arise in respect of the errors.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply for the purposes of determining whether there is an offence against section 8N of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_, or an administrative penalty under section 284-75 or 284-145 in Schedule 1 to that Act, in relation to statements made before the Commissioner became aware of the errors.

Note 1:       Section 8N of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ deals with false or misleading statements. Sections 284-75 and 284-145 in Schedule 1 to that Act set out the circumstances in which an entity is liable for an administrative penalty.

Note 2:       The offence and administrative penalty provisions however apply on a modified basis—see subsection 8W(1C) of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_, and subsections 284-80(2) and 284-150(2) in Schedule 1 to that Act.

\[This is the end of the Guide.]

#### Operative provisions

##### <a id="709-155"></a>709-155  Testing consolidated groups

             (1)  To determine whether a <sup>* </sup>consolidated group is an <sup>* </sup>exempting entity or <sup>* </sup>former exempting entity, the tests in Division 208 are applied to the <sup>* </sup>head company of the group.

             (2)  However, there are some additional rules that can alter the way that Division 208 applies to a <sup>* </sup>consolidated group. These are set out in sections 709-160 to 709-175.

             (3)  In applying those rules to an entity that is a <sup>* </sup>member of a <sup>* </sup>consolidated group:

                     (a)  Division 208 is to be applied before those rules; and

                     (b)  that Division is to be applied just after the entity became a member of the group but, for a <sup>* </sup>subsidiary member, it is to be applied on the assumption that the subsidiary was not a member of the group at that time.

             (4)  Except as mentioned in paragraph (3)(b), Division 208 has no application to a <sup>* </sup>subsidiary member of a <sup>* </sup>consolidated group.

##### <a id="709-160"></a>709-160  Subsidiary member is exempting entity

             (1)  This section operates if:

                     (a)  the <sup>* </sup>head company of a <sup>* </sup>consolidated group is neither an exempting entity nor a <sup>* </sup>former exempting entity; and

                     (b)  a <sup>* </sup>corporate tax entity becomes a <sup>* </sup>subsidiary member of the group at a time (the **_joining time_**); and

                     (c)  the entity is an <sup>* </sup>exempting entity at the joining time.

             (2)  These rules apply to the <sup>* </sup>consolidated group.

#### Operative provisions

##### <a id="713-505"></a>713-505  Head company treated as a life insurance company

                   This Act, and the _Income Tax Rates Act 1986_, apply to the <sup>* </sup>head company of a <sup>* </sup>consolidated group as if it were a <sup>* </sup>life insurance company for an income year if one or more life insurance companies are <sup>* </sup>subsidiary members of the group at any time during that year.

##### <a id="713-510"></a>713-510  Certain subsidiaries of life insurance companies cannot be members of consolidated group

             (1)  An entity cannot be a <sup>* </sup>subsidiary member of the same <sup>* </sup>consolidated group or <sup>* </sup>consolidatable group of which a <sup>* </sup>life insurance company is a <sup>* </sup>member if:

                     (a)  the life insurance company owns, either directly or indirectly, <sup>* </sup>membership interests in the entity; and

                     (b)  either:

                              (i)  some, but not all, of those membership interests are <sup>* </sup>virtual PST assets of the life insurance company; or

                             (ii)  some, but not all, of those membership interests are <sup>* </sup>segregated exempt assets of the life insurance company.

Note:          The entity could, however, be a member of another consolidated group or consolidatable group.

             (2)  An entity cannot continue to be a <sup>* </sup>subsidiary member of a <sup>* </sup>consolidated group if:

                     (a)  a <sup>* </sup>life insurance company is a <sup>* </sup>member of the group; and

                     (b)  the life insurance company owns, either directly or indirectly, <sup>* </sup>membership interests in the entity; and

                     (c)  had the entity not been a subsidiary member of the group, either:

                              (i)  some, but not all, of those membership interests would be <sup>* </sup>virtual PST assets of the life insurance company; or

                             (ii)  some, but not all, of those membership interests would be <sup>* </sup>segregated exempt assets of the life insurance company.

##### <a id="713-515"></a>713-515  Modification of cost setting rules

             (1)  If an entity that becomes a <sup>* </sup>subsidiary member of a <sup>* </sup>consolidated group at a time (the **_joining time_**) is a <sup>* </sup>life insurance company, these assets are **_retained cost base assets_**:

                     (a)  a <sup>* </sup>virtual PST asset, or a <sup>* </sup>segregated exempt asset, of the company; and

                     (b)  another asset of the company that is held by the company for the purpose of discharging its liabilities under the <sup>* </sup>net investment component of ordinary life insurance policies (except policies that provide for <sup>* </sup>participating benefits or <sup>* </sup>discretionary benefits under <sup>* </sup>life insurance business carried on in Australia); and

                     (c)  for a life insurance company that has demutualised under Division 9AA of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ where, in the period starting just after the company demutualises and ending at the joining time, all of the <sup>* </sup>membership interests in the company were owned by the same group—a goodwill asset of the company.

             (2)  If the <sup>* </sup>retained cost base asset is covered by paragraph (1)(a) or (b), its <sup>* </sup>tax cost setting amount is:

                     (a)  for the purposes of working out the tax cost setting amounts for reset cost base assets (see section 705-35)—the asset’s <sup>* </sup>transfer value just before the joining time; and

                     (b)  for all other purposes—the asset’s <sup>* </sup>terminating value.

             (3)  If the <sup>* </sup>retained cost base asset is covered by paragraph (1)(c), its <sup>* </sup>tax cost setting amount is the embedded value (see subsection 121AM(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) on the applicable accounting day (see subsection 121AM(3) of that Act) of the <sup>* </sup>life insurance company concerned reduced by the net value of shareholders’ assets held by the company on that day.

             (4)  The **_net investment component of ordinary life insurance policies_** is the component of <sup>* </sup>life insurance policies (except <sup>* </sup>exempt life insurance policies and <sup>* </sup>virtual PST life insurance policies) that:

                     (a)  is the component in respect of the part of those policies that has not been reinsured under a <sup>* </sup>contract of reinsurance; and

                     (b)  is not the <sup>* </sup>net risk component of those policies.

##### <a id="713-520"></a>713-520  Valuing certain liabilities

             (1)  Despite section 705-70, if the joining entity mentioned in step 2 in the table in section 705-60 is a <sup>* </sup>life insurance company, the joining entity’s liabilities mentioned in this section are to be valued as mentioned in this section.

             (2)  The value of the joining entity’s <sup>* </sup>virtual PST liabilities (if any) is the amount worked out under section 320-190 at the joining time.

             (3)  The value of the joining entity’s <sup>* </sup>exempt life insurance policy liabilities (if any) is the amount worked out under section 320-245 at the joining time.

             (4)  Subsection (5) applies to a liability of the joining entity if:

                     (a)  the liability is under the <sup>* </sup>net risk component of a <sup>* </sup>life insurance policy; and

                     (b)  the joining entity could deduct under section 320-80 an amount for the <sup>* </sup>risk component of claims paid under the policy had it not become a <sup>* </sup>member of the <sup>* </sup>consolidated group.

             (5)  The value of that liability is the <sup>* </sup>current termination value of the <sup>* </sup>net risk component of the <sup>* </sup>life insurance policy at the joining time (calculated by an <sup>* </sup>actuary).

             (6)  The value of the joining entity’s liabilities under the <sup>* </sup>net investment component of ordinary life insurance policies is the amount worked out for those liabilities under subsection 320-190(2) as if those liabilities were <sup>* </sup>virtual PST liabilities.

##### <a id="713-525"></a>713-525  Obligation to value virtual PST assets and segregated exempt assets

                   Division 320 has effect as if:

                     (a)  the joining time when a <sup>* </sup>life insurance company becomes a <sup>* </sup>subsidiary member of a <sup>* </sup>consolidated group; and

                     (b)  the time (the **_leaving time_**) when a life insurance company ceases to be a subsidiary member of a consolidated group;

were a valuation time for the purposes of sections 320-175 and 320-230.

Note:          This means that:

·the company must value its virtual PST assets under section 320-175 (with the consequences set out in section 320-180), and its segregated exempt assets under section 320-230 (with the consequences set out in section 320-235), as at the joining time; and

·the head company must value the life insurance company’s virtual PST assets and its segregated exempt assets as at the leaving time.

##### <a id="713-530"></a>713-530  Certain amounts transferred to leaving entity

             (1)  This section operates if:

                     (a)  a <sup>* </sup>life insurance company ceases to be a subsidiary member of a <sup>* </sup>consolidated group in an income year; and

                     (b)  at the leaving time, no other member of the group is a life insurance company that has a <sup>* </sup>virtual PST; and

                     (c)  either:

                              (i)  at the leaving time, the <sup>* </sup>head company of the group has a <sup>* </sup>net capital loss from <sup>* </sup>virtual PST assets; or

                             (ii)  the head company has an amount referred to in subsection 320-205(2) as a difference that it could not apply to reduce any <sup>* </sup>virtual PST component of the <sup>* </sup>complying superannuation class of the company’s taxable income for the income year in which the leaving time occurred.

             (2)  The <sup>* </sup>net capital loss, or the difference, becomes that of the <sup>* </sup>life insurance company just after the leaving time.

##### <a id="713-500"></a>713-500  Object of Subdivision

                   The object of this Subdivision is to give an opportunity to a group of entities that includes a life insurance company to rearrange the assets of the group for the purposes of one or more of them becoming members of a consolidated group in a way that does not attract any immediate taxation consequences.

##### <a id="713-505"></a>713-505  When this Subdivision applies (first case)

             (1)  This Subdivision provides for a deferral of the taxation consequences that would occur because of an event (the **_deferral event_**) happening involving an entity (the **_originating entity_**) and another entity (the **_recipient entity_**) if:

                     (a)  the event occurs in connection with a life insurance company (the **_member life insurance company_**) becoming a member of a consolidated group; and

                     (b)  the relevant conditions in section 713-520 are met.

             (2)  If the originating entity is a company, the deferral event referred to in subsection (1) is a CGT event referred to in subsection (4) happening to a CGT asset (the **_original asset_**) where, apart from this Subdivision, the happening of the event would have resulted in:

                     (a)  an amount (other than a capital gain) being included in the originating entity’s assessable income; or

                     (b)  the originating entity making a capital gain.

             (3)  If the originating entity is a trust, the deferral event referred to in subsection (1) is a CGT event referred to in subsection (4) happening to a CGT asset (also the **_original asset_**) where, apart from this Subdivision, the happening of the event would have resulted in:

                     (a)  an amount (other than a capital gain) being included in the net income of the trust; or

                     (b)  the trustee making a capital gain.

             (4)  The CGT events are:

                     (a)  CGT events A1, B1, D1, D2, D3, E2, F1 and F2; and

                     (b)  CGT event C2, but only if the CGT asset that ends is a unit in a unit trust that is replaced by an equivalent membership interest (the **_replacement interest_**) in a company or in another trust.

##### <a id="713-510"></a>713-510  When this Subdivision applies (second case)

             (1)  This Subdivision also provides for a deferral of the taxation consequences that would occur if:

                     (a)  a life insurance company transfers an asset (also the **_original asset_**) to its virtual PST or from its virtual PST where, apart from this Subdivision, section 320-200 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ would apply to the transfer; or

                     (b)  a life insurance company transfers an asset (also the **_original asset_**) to its segregated exempt assets where, apart from this Subdivision, section 320-255 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ would apply to the transfer;

where the transfer (also the **_deferral event_**) is made in connection with the life insurance company (also the **_member life insurance company_**) becoming a member of a consolidated group.

             (2)  The relevant conditions in section 713-520 must be met.

##### <a id="713-515"></a>713-515  Entities must choose the relief

             (1)  This Subdivision applies only if the originating entity (for a section 713-505 case) or the life insurance company (for a section 713-510 case) chooses that it apply.

             (2)  The choice must be made:

                     (a)  by the day the originating entity or the life insurance company, or the head company of the consolidated group of which it is a member, lodges its income tax return for the income year in which the deferral event happened; or

                     (b)  within a further time allowed by the Commissioner.

##### <a id="713-520"></a>713-520  Conditions

             (1)  For a section 713-505 case:

                     (a)  the originating entity must be:

                              (i)  a life insurance company that has virtual PST assets or segregated exempt assets and that is a member of a consolidatable group; or

                             (ii)  an entity that is unable to be a member of the same consolidatable group as a life insurance company because of section 713-510 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; or

                            (iii)  an entity that is, directly or indirectly, a subsidiary of a life insurance company and is a member of the same consolidated group as the life insurance company; and

                     (b)  the originating entity and the recipient entity must be members of the same consolidatable group or consolidated group or, if they are not, they would have been apart from section 713-510 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

                     (c)  any asset transferred by the originating entity must be transferred to the recipient entity at its transfer value.

             (2)  For both a section 713-505 case and a section 713-510 case:

                     (a)  the total transfer values of the virtual PST assets of the member life insurance company just before a transfer of assets to which this Subdivision applies must be the same as the total transfer values of those assets just after the transfer; and

                     (b)  the total transfer values of the segregated exempt assets of the member life insurance company just before a transfer of assets to which this Subdivision applies must be the same as the total transfer values of those assets just after the transfer.

             (3)  Any transfer of an asset under the deferral event must happen on or before the later of:

                     (a)  30 June 2004; and

                     (b)  if the head company of the consolidated group of which the member life insurance company is a member has a substituted accounting period—the end of the head company’s income year in which 30 June 2004 occurs.

##### <a id="713-525"></a>713-525  Time of transfer

                   This Act, and the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, apply to the transfer of an asset to which this Subdivision applies as if the asset had been transferred just before the member life insurance company became a member of the consolidated group.

##### <a id="713-530"></a>713-530  What the relief is

             (1)  For a section 713-505 case:

                     (a)  if the originating entity is a company:

                              (i)  any amount (other than a capital gain) that would have been included in the originating entity’s assessable income (the **_deferred amount_**) as a result of the deferral event is not so included; and

                             (ii)  any capital gain (the **_deferred gain_**) that the originating entity would have made as a result of the deferral event is disregarded; and

                     (b)  if the originating entity is a trust:

                              (i)  any amount (other than a capital gain) that would have been included in the member life insurance company’s assessable income (also the **_deferred amount_**) as a result of the deferral event is not so included; and

                             (ii)  any capital gain (also the **_deferred gain_**) that the member life insurance company would have made as a result of the deferral event is disregarded.

             (2)  For a section 713-510 case:

                     (a)  any amount that would have been included in the member life insurance company’s assessable income (also the **_deferred amount_**) under paragraph 320-15(e) or (g) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ as a result of the deferral event is not so included; and

                     (b)  any capital gain (also the **_deferred gain_**) that the member life insurance company would have made as a result of the deferral event is disregarded.

##### <a id="713-535"></a>713-535  Subsequent consequences

             (1)  This section operates if, after the deferral event happens, another event (the **_new event_**) happens where the new event is:

                     (a)  a CGT event happening to:

                              (i)  the original asset; or

                             (ii)  if the deferral event was CGT event C2—the replacement asset; or

                     (b)  the recipient entity ceasing to be a member of the consolidated group of which the member life insurance company is a member; or

                     (c)  if the recipient entity is a life insurance company:

                              (i)  the original asset being transferred to or from the company’s virtual PST under section 320-180, 320-185 or 320-195 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; or

                             (ii)  the original asset being transferred to or from the company’s segregated exempt assets under section 320-235, 320-240 or 320-250 of that Act; or

                     (d)  if the originating entity is a company—the originating entity ceasing to exist.

             (2)  For a section 713-505 case where the originating entity is a company:

                     (a)  the originating entity must include the deferred amount in its assessable income for the income year in which the new event happens; or

                     (b)  the originating entity is taken, just before the new event happened, to have made a capital gain equal to the deferred gain.

Note:          If the originating entity is a subsidiary member of a consolidated group, the head company of the group will have the amount included in its assessable income or will make the capital gain.

             (3)  For a section 713-505 case where the originating entity is a trust:

                     (a)  the member life insurance company must include the deferred amount in its assessable income for the income year in which the new event happens; or

                     (b)  the member life insurance company is taken, just before the new event happened, to have made a capital gain equal to the deferred gain.

             (4)  For a section 713-505 case where the originating entity is a life insurance company or a trust and the deferred amount or the deferred gain relates to an asset that was a virtual PST asset at the time when the deferral event happened, an amount equal to the deferred amount or deferred gain is taken to be an amount of assessable income to which subsection 320-205(3) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies for the relevant entity.

             (5)  For a section 713-510 case:

                     (a)  the member life insurance company must include the deferred amount in its assessable income for the income year in which the new event happens; or

                     (b)  the member life insurance company is taken, just before the new event happened, to have made a capital gain equal to the deferred gain.

             (6)  In addition, if the deferral event involved the transfer of assets from the member life insurance company’s virtual PST, an amount equal to the deferred amount or deferred gain is taken to be an amount of assessable income to which subsection 320-205(3) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies for the relevant entity.

##### <a id="713-540"></a>713-540  Requirement to notify happening of new event

             (1)  For a section 713-505 case, the recipient entity must, if it is not a member of the same consolidated group as the originating entity when the new event happens, notify the originating entity in the approved form of the happening of the new event within 60 days after the new event happens.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply if the new event is the originating entity ceasing to exist.

##### <a id="713-545"></a>713-545  Discount capital gain in certain cases

                   The _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies as if the capital gain referred to in paragraph 713-535(2)(b), (3)(b) or (5)(b) were a discount capital gain if:

                     (a)  the asset to which the deferral event happened is a virtual PST asset; and

                     (b)  the asset was acquired less than 12 months before the deferral event happened; and

                     (c)  the new event happens at least 12 months after the asset was acquired.

#### Object

##### <a id="715-15"></a>715-15  Object of this Subdivision

             (1)  The object of this Subdivision is to give effect to the purposes of Subdivision 165-CC (about change of ownership or control of a company that has an unrealised net loss) in these cases:

                     (a)  on formation of a <sup>* </sup>consolidated group, a <sup>* </sup>CGT asset held directly by the <sup>* </sup>head company is affected by that Subdivision, and the <sup>* </sup>same business test is failed;

                     (b)  on an entity becoming a <sup>* </sup>subsidiary member of a consolidated group, an asset consisting of:

                              (i)  a <sup>* </sup>membership interest that a <sup>* </sup>member of the group (including a chosen transitional entity under Division 701 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_) holds in the entity; or

                             (ii)  a liability that the entity owes to such a member;

                            is affected by that Subdivision, and the same business test is failed;

                     (c)  on a company becoming a subsidiary member:

                              (i)  a CGT asset of the company that becomes an asset of the head company is affected by that Subdivision; and

                             (ii)  because the company is a chosen transitional entity, the asset does not have its tax cost reset; and

                            (iii)  the same business test is failed;

                     (d)  on an entity ceasing to be a subsidiary member, a CGT asset of the head company that becomes an asset of the entity is affected by that Subdivision, and the same business test is failed.

Note:          Subdivision 165-CC also affects an entity that has deferred losses under Subdivision 170-D on assets that it formerly owned. Subdivision 715-D gives effect to the purposes of Subdivision 165-CC if such an entity becomes a member of a consolidated group.

             (2)  This Subdivision achieves its object by supplementing and modifying the application of Subdivision 165-CC to take account of how the rest of this Part treats <sup>* </sup>members of a <sup>* </sup>consolidated group (in particular the provisions about entities becoming or ceasing to be members).

\[The next section is section 715-25.]

#### Effect on Subdivision 165-CC of a company becoming a member of a consolidated group

##### <a id="715-25"></a>715-25  Subdivision 165-CC stops applying to earlier changeover time

             (1)  At and after the time (the **_membership time_**) when a company becomes a <sup>* </sup>member of a <sup>* </sup>consolidated group, Subdivision 165-CC does not apply to the company in relation to a <sup>* </sup>changeover time that happened before the membership time, except for the purposes of section 715-30 (which defines **_1_****_65-CC tagged asset_**).

Note 1:       Subdivision 165-CC is about change of ownership or control of a company that has an unrealised net loss.

Note 2:       If the company has 165-CC tagged assets at the membership time, there are further consequences under this Subdivision and Subdivision 715-D.

                   Also, Subdivision 165-CC can apply to the head company of the group in relation to a changeover time that happens for it at or after the membership time. See section 715-75.

             (2)  Subsection (1) continues to have effect even if the company later stops being a <sup>* </sup>member of the group.

##### <a id="715-30"></a>715-30  Meaning of _165-CC tagged asset_

                   A <sup>* </sup>CGT asset is a **_165-CC tagged asset_** of a company at a particular time if, and only if:

                     (a)  that time is at or after the most recent <sup>* </sup>changeover time (if any) for the company; and

                     (b)  at that changeover time, the company had an unrealised net loss under section 165-115E; and

                     (c)  the asset is covered by subsection 165-115A(1A) as applying to that changeover time; and

                     (d)  the company would not, at that changeover time, satisfy the maximum net asset value test under section 152-15; and

                     (e)  if the company has chosen under subsection 165-115A(1B) in relation to that changeover time—the company <sup>* </sup>acquired the asset for $10,000 or more.

##### <a id="715-35"></a>715-35  Meaning of _final RUNL_

                   A company’s **_final RUNL_** at a particular time (the **_test time_**) is the amount that would have been the company’s <sup>* </sup>residual unrealised net loss at the time of:

                     (a)  if no event that subsection 165-115BB(2) refers to as a relevant event actually happens at the test time—a notional event of that kind happening at the test time; or

                     (b)  otherwise—a notional event of that kind that happens at the test time, and that the company determines under paragraph 165-115BB(1)(b) to have happened _later_ than each event that actually happened at that time.

Note:          This Subdivision reduces a company’s final RUNL as amounts of it are applied for various purposes.

\[The next section is section 715-50.]

#### 165-CC tagged assets that affect tax cost setting amounts

##### <a id="715-50"></a>715-50  Step 1 amount is reduced if membership interest in subsidiary member is 165-CC tagged asset and same business test is failed

             (1)  The amount taken into account under subsection 705-65(1) (about the cost of membership interests in the joining entity) for a <sup>* </sup>membership interest that a <sup>* </sup>member of the joined group holds in the joining entity at the joining time is reduced if:

                     (a)  apart from this section, the amount would be the membership interest’s <sup>* </sup>reduced cost base (if appropriate, as modified by a later provision of section 705-65); and

                     (b)  the membership interest is at that time a <sup>* </sup>165-CC tagged asset of that member, and that member owned it at the <sup>* </sup>changeover time for that member; and

                     (c)  that member’s <sup>* </sup>final RUNL just before the joining time was greater than nil; and

                     (d)  that member does _not_ satisfy the <sup>* </sup>same business test for:

                              (i)  the period (the **_same business test period_**) consisting of the <sup>* </sup>head company’s <sup>* </sup>trial year; and

                             (ii)  the time (the **_test time_**) just before the <sup>* </sup>changeover time.

             (2)  If at the joining time that <sup>* </sup>member holds:

                     (a)  2 or <sup>* </sup>more membership interests in the joining entity; or

                     (b)  at least one membership interest in the joining entity, and at least one membership interest in another member of the joined group;

this section applies to each such membership interest in whichever order that member determines.

Amount of reduction

             (3)  The amount taken into account under subsection 705-65(1) is reduced to the <sup>* </sup>membership interest’s <sup>* </sup>market value at the joining time.

             (4)  However, if that member’s <sup>* </sup>final RUNL (as reduced by any previous reductions under this section) is _less than_ the difference between:

                     (a)  the <sup>* </sup>reduced cost base referred to in paragraph (1)(a); and

                     (b)  the <sup>* </sup>market value referred to in subsection (3);

the amount taken into account under subsection 705-65(1) is instead reduced by that final RUNL.

             (5)  That <sup>* </sup>final RUNL is reduced by the amount of the reduction under subsection (3) or (4).

Rights and options to acquire membership interests

             (6)  Subsection 705-65(6) (which treats rights and options as membership interests) also applies for the purposes of this section.

##### <a id="715-55"></a>715-55  Step 2 amount is affected if liability of subsidiary member is 165-CC tagged asset of another group member and same business test is failed

             (1)  The amount (the **_comparison amount_**) applicable under the table in subsection 705-75(2) (about reduction of the step 2 amount) for an accounting liability of the joining entity that is owed to a <sup>* </sup>member of the joined group at the joining time is reduced if:

                     (a)  apart from this section, the comparison amount would be the <sup>* </sup>reduced cost base (if appropriate, as modified by a later provision of section 705-75) of the asset of that member that is constituted by the accounting liability; and

                     (b)  the asset is at that time a <sup>* </sup>165-CC tagged asset of that member, and that member owned it at the <sup>* </sup>changeover time; and

                     (c)  that member’s <sup>* </sup>final RUNL just before the joining time (as reduced by any reductions under section 715-50) was greater than nil; and

                     (d)  that member does _not_ satisfy the <sup>* </sup>same business test for:

                              (i)  the period (the **_same business test period_**) consisting of the <sup>* </sup>head company’s <sup>* </sup>trial year; and

                             (ii)  the time (the **_test time_**) just before the <sup>* </sup>changeover time.

Note:          Paragraph (1)(c) has the effect that if both this section and section 715-50 apply to the same member of the joined group, section 715-50 is applied before this section.

             (2)  If at the joining time that <sup>* </sup>member holds:

                     (a)  2 or <sup>* </sup>more assets constituted by accounting liabilities of the joining entity; or

                     (b)  at least one asset constituted by an accounting liability of the joining entity, and at least one asset constituted by an accounting liability of another member of the group;

this section applies to each such asset in whichever order that member determines.

Amount of reduction

             (3)  The comparison amount is reduced to the asset’s <sup>* </sup>market value at the joining time.

             (4)  However, if that member’s <sup>* </sup>final RUNL (as reduced by any previous reductions under section 715-50 or this section) is _less than_ the difference between:

                     (a)  the <sup>* </sup>reduced cost base referred to in paragraph (1)(a); and

                     (b)  the asset’s <sup>* </sup>market value at the joining time;

the comparison amount is instead reduced by that final RUNL.

             (5)  That <sup>* </sup>final RUNL is reduced by the amount of the reduction under subsection (3) or (4).

#### 165-CC tagged assets that form loss denial pools of head company when consolidated group is formed

##### <a id="715-60"></a>715-60  Assets that the head company already owns

             (1)  At the time (the **_formation time_**) when a <sup>* </sup>consolidated group comes into existence under paragraph 703-5(1)(a), a **_loss denial pool_** of the <sup>* </sup>head company is created if:

                     (a)  the formation time is _not_ a <sup>* </sup>changeover time for the head company; and

                     (b)  at the formation time, the head company owns a <sup>* </sup>CGT asset:

                              (i)  that is a <sup>* </sup>165-CC tagged asset of the head company at that time; and

                             (ii)  that it owned at the <sup>* </sup>changeover time; and

                            (iii)  that is not a <sup>* </sup>membership interest in a <sup>* </sup>member of the group; and

                            (iv)  that is not a right or option (including a contingent right or option), created or issued by a member of the group, to acquire such a membership interest; and

                             (v)  that is not constituted by a liability owed to the head company by a member of the group;

                            or 2 or more such assets; and

                     (c)  the head company’s <sup>* </sup>final RUNL just before the formation time (as reduced by any reductions under section 715-50 or 715-55) was greater than nil; and

                     (d)  the head company does _not_ satisfy the <sup>* </sup>same business test for:

                              (i)  the period (the **_same business test period_**) consisting of the head company’s <sup>* </sup>trial year; and

                             (ii)  the time (the **_test time_**) just before the <sup>* </sup>changeover time.

Note:          Paragraph (1)(c) has the effect that if the head company has 165-CC tagged assets that are affected by section 715-50 or 715-55 (because they are membership interests in, or accounting liabilities owed by, another group member), those sections are applied before this section.

             (2)  When it is created, the pool consists of the one or more <sup>* </sup>CGT assets referred to in paragraph (1)(b), and its **_loss denial balance_** is equal to the <sup>* </sup>final RUNL referred to in paragraph (1)(c).

Note 1:       The pool is distinct from any other loss denial pool of the head company, for example, one created at the formation time under section 715-70.

Note 2:       170-D deferred losses on 165-CC tagged assets of the head company may be added to the pool by subsection 715-355(1).

\[The next section is section 715-70.]

##### <a id="715-70"></a>715-70  Assets of subsidiary member that become those of head company

             (1)  At the time (the **_formation time_**) when an entity becomes a <sup>* </sup>subsidiary member of a <sup>* </sup>consolidated group, a **_loss denial pool_** of the <sup>* </sup>head company of the group is created if:

                     (a)  the formation time is _not_ a <sup>* </sup>changeover time for the head company; and

                     (b)  the entity is a chosen transitional entity under Division 701 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_; and

                     (c)  subsection (2) or (4) of this section is satisfied.

Note 1:       If the entity is a chosen transitional entity, section 701-15 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_ prevents:

·<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">                      </span>section 701-10 (cost to head company of assets that entity brings into group); and

·<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">                      </span>subsection 701-35(4) (setting value of trading stock at tax-neutral amount);

                   of this Act from applying to the entity’s assets in relation to the formation time.

Note 2:       The pool is distinct from any other loss denial pool of the head company, for example, one created under this section because another entity becomes a subsidiary member of the group at the formation time.

Joining entity has 165-CC tagged assets

             (2)  This subsection is satisfied if:

                     (a)  a <sup>* </sup>CGT asset of the entity, or each of 2 or more CGT assets of the entity:

                              (i)  is a <sup>* </sup>165-CC tagged asset of the entity at the formation time; and

                             (ii)  was owned by the entity at the <sup>* </sup>changeover time; and

                            (iii)  is not a <sup>* </sup>membership interest in a <sup>* </sup>member of the group; and

                            (iv)  is not a right or option (including a contingent right or option), created or issued by a member of the group, to acquire such a membership interest; and

                             (v)  is not constituted by a liability owed to the entity by a member of the group at the formation time; and

                     (b)  the entity’s <sup>* </sup>final RUNL just before the formation time (as reduced by any reductions under section 715-50 or 715-55) was greater than nil; and

                     (c)  the entity does _not_ satisfy the <sup>* </sup>same business test for:

                              (i)  the period (the **_same business test period_**) consisting of the entity’s <sup>* </sup>trial year; and

                             (ii)  the time (the **_test time_**) just before the <sup>* </sup>changeover time.

Note:          Paragraph (2)(b) has the effect that if the entity has 165-CC tagged assets that are affected by section 715-50 or 715-55 (because they are membership interests in, or accounting liabilities owed by, another group member), those sections are applied before this section.

             (3)  When it is created because of subsection (2), the pool consists of the one or more <sup>* </sup>CGT assets referred to in paragraph (2)(a), and its **_loss denial balance_** is equal to the <sup>* </sup>final RUNL referred to in paragraph (2)(b).

Note:          170-D deferred losses on 165-CC tagged assets of the head company may be added to the pool by subsection 715-355(2).

Entity has loss denial pool

             (4)  This subsection is satisfied if, just before the formation time, the entity had a <sup>* </sup>loss denial pool.

             (5)  When it is created because of subsection (4), the <sup>* </sup>head company’s loss denial pool:

                     (a)  consists of the one or more <sup>* </sup>CGT assets of which the entity’s loss <sup>* </sup>denial pool consisted; and

                     (b)  has a **_loss denial balance_** equal to the <sup>* </sup>loss denial balance of the entity’s loss denial pool;

just before the formation time.

#### How Subdivision 165-CC applies to consolidated groups

##### <a id="715-75"></a>715-75  Extension of single entity rule and entry history rule

             (1)  Subsection 701-1(1) (Single entity rule) and section 701-5 (Entry history rule) also have effect for all the purposes of Subdivision 165-CC (about change of ownership or control of a company that has an unrealised net loss).

Note:          One consequence of this is that the head company is the only member of a consolidated group that can have a changeover time and be subject to consequences under Subdivision 165-CC. The head company is treated as owning all CGT assets owned by group members, and as making relevant losses.

             (2)  This section is not intended to limit the effect that subsection 701-1(1) and section 701-5 have apart from this section.

#### Effect on Subdivision 165-CC of entity leaving consolidated group

##### <a id="715-80"></a>715-80  Application of sections 715-85 to 715-110

                   Sections 715-85 to 715-110 apply if, at a particular time (the **_leaving time_**), an entity (the **_leaving entity_**) ceases to be a <sup>* </sup>subsidiary member of a <sup>* </sup>consolidated group.

Note 1:       If a changeover time happened to the head company at or after the group came into existence and before the leaving time, Subdivision 165-CC does _not_ apply to the head company at and after the leaving time, in respect of assets that leave with the leaving entity, in relation to the changeover time.

                   This is because the head company can no longer make a capital loss, or become entitled to a deduction, in respect of a CGT event happening to any of those assets.

Note 2:       If, just before the leaving time, the head company had a loss denial pool, see section 715-120.

##### <a id="715-85"></a>715-85  First changeover time for leaving company at or after leaving time

                   If the leaving entity is a company, its first <sup>* </sup>changeover time at or after the leaving time is determined:

                     (a)  on the basis that the reference time under subsection 165-115A(2A) is the one that would be used in determining whether the leaving time was a changeover time for the _head company_; and

                     (b)  making the additional assumptions in section 715-290.

Note:          If the leaving entity is a trust, it cannot have a changeover time (because Subdivision 165-CC applies only to companies), so section 715-95 applies to it instead: see subsection 715-95(2).

##### <a id="715-90"></a>715-90  How same business test applies if leaving time is changeover time for leaving company

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  the leaving entity is a company; and

                     (b)  the leaving time is a <sup>* </sup>changeover time for the leaving entity.

             (2)  The continuity period referred to in subsection 165-115B(3), as applying to the leaving time as a <sup>* </sup>changeover time for the leaving entity, is taken to have ended just _after_ that time.

Note:          This ensures that the same business test is applied to the business that the leaving entity carries on at the leaving time: see subsection 165-13(3).

##### <a id="715-95"></a>715-95  If ownership and control of leaving entity have _not_ changed since head company’s last changeover time

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  the leaving entity is a company; and

                     (b)  the leaving time is _not_ a <sup>* </sup>changeover time for the leaving entity; and

                     (c)  just before the leaving time, the <sup>* </sup>head company owned at least one <sup>* </sup>CGT asset:

                              (i)  that was a <sup>* </sup>165-CC tagged asset just before the leaving time; and

                             (ii)  that it owned at the latest changeover time for the head company at or after the group came into existence and before the leaving time; and

                     (d)  at least one asset covered by paragraph (c) is an asset (a **_leaving asset_**) that becomes an asset of the leaving entity at the leaving time because subsection 701-1(1) (Single entity rule) ceases to apply to the entity; and

                     (e)  the head company’s <sup>* </sup>final RUNL at the leaving time is greater than nil.

             (2)  This section also applies if the leaving entity is a trust.

             (3)  If the <sup>* </sup>head company does _not_ satisfy the <sup>* </sup>same business test for:

                     (a)  the period (the **_same business test period_**) starting at the _earlier_ of:

                              (i)  the time 12 months before the leaving time; and

                             (ii)  when the head company came into existence;

                            and ending just before the leaving time; and

                     (b)  the time (the **_test time_**) just before the <sup>* </sup>changeover time;

the head company must make one of the choices for which sections 715-100, 715-105 and 715-110 provide.

For provisions about making one of these choices, 
see sections 715-175 to 715-185.

##### <a id="715-100"></a>715-100  First choice: adjustable values of leaving assets reduced to nil

                   The first choice is to reduce the <sup>* </sup>adjustable value of each leaving asset to nil. The choice has effect accordingly, just before the leaving time. The <sup>* </sup>head company’s <sup>* </sup>final RUNL is _not_ reduced because of it.

Note:          The consequences of the choice are worked out under section 715-145.

##### <a id="715-105"></a>715-105  Second choice: head company’s final RUNL applied in reducing adjustable values of leaving assets that are loss assets

             (1)  The second choice is to reduce under this section the <sup>* </sup>adjustable value of each leaving asset (a **_loss asset_**) for which the <sup>* </sup>head company would have had a notional capital loss, or notional revenue loss, under section 165-115F at the time (the **_test time_**) just before the leaving time if the test time had been a <sup>* </sup>changeover time for the head company. The choice has effect accordingly.

Note:          The consequences of the choice are worked out under this section and section 715-145.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  2 or more entities cease to be <sup>* </sup>subsidiary members of the <sup>* </sup>consolidated group at the leaving time; and

                     (b)  2 or more of them make the second choice;

the choices have effect in whichever order the <sup>* </sup>head company determines.

             (3)  This section applies to each of the loss assets in order, according to their respective <sup>* </sup>adjustable values (apart from this section) at the test time: from largest to smallest. (If an asset has more than one such adjustable value, use the greater or greatest of them.)

             (4)  At the test time, the <sup>* </sup>adjustable value of the loss asset is reduced to the asset’s <sup>* </sup>market value at that time.

             (5)  However, if the <sup>* </sup>head company’s <sup>* </sup>final RUNL at the leaving time (as reduced by any previous reductions under this section) is _less than_ the difference between:

                     (a)  the <sup>* </sup>adjustable value of the loss asset (apart from this section) at the test time; and

                     (b)  the asset’s <sup>* </sup>market value at the test time;

the adjustable value is instead reduced at the test time by that final RUNL.

             (6)  That <sup>* </sup>final RUNL is reduced by the amount of the reduction under subsection (4) or (5). If 2 or more such reductions are made for the same asset (because it has 2 or more different characters), that final RUNL is reduced by the greater or greatest of the reductions.

##### <a id="715-110"></a>715-110  Third choice: loss denial pool of leaving entity created

             (1)  The third choice can be made only if every asset covered by paragraph 715-95(1)(c) is a leaving asset. The choice is to have a **_loss denial pool_** of the leaving entity created at the leaving time, consisting of every leaving asset. (To avoid doubt, the choice can be made even if the leaving entity is not a company.)

             (2)  A choice under this section has effect accordingly. The pool is distinct from any other loss denial pool of the leaving entity.

             (3)  When the pool is created, its **_loss denial balance_** is equal to the <sup>* </sup>head company’s <sup>* </sup>final RUNL at the leaving time.

Note:          If the head company makes this choice, the leaving entity can choose to cancel the loss denial pool by reducing reduced cost bases of assets in the pool: see section 715-185.

\[The next section is section 715-120.]

#### Effect of assets in loss denial pool of head company becoming assets of leaving entity

##### <a id="715-120"></a>715-120  What happens

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  at a particular time (the **_leaving time_**), an entity (the **_leaving entity_**) ceases to be a <sup>* </sup>subsidiary member of a <sup>* </sup>consolidated group; and

                     (b)  just before the leaving time, the <sup>* </sup>head company had a <sup>* </sup>loss denial pool; and

                     (c)  at the leaving time, at least one <sup>* </sup>CGT asset (a **_leaving asset_**) that was in the pool just before that time becomes a CGT asset of the leaving entity because subsection 701-1(1) (Single entity rule) ceases to apply to the entity;

             (2)  Each leaving asset leaves the <sup>* </sup>loss denial pool at the leaving time.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  the leaving entity is a company and the leaving time is _not_ a <sup>* </sup>changeover time for the leaving entity; or

                     (b)  the leaving entity is a trust;

the <sup>* </sup>head company must make one of the choices for which sections 715-125, 715-130 and 715-135 provide.

For provisions about making one of these choices, 
see sections 715-175 to 715-185.

##### <a id="715-125"></a>715-125  First choice: adjustable values of leaving assets reduced to nil

                   The first choice is to reduce the <sup>* </sup>adjustable value of each leaving asset to nil. The choice has effect accordingly, just before the leaving time. The <sup>* </sup>loss denial balance of the <sup>* </sup>head company’s <sup>* </sup>loss denial pool is _not_ reduced because of it.

Note:          The consequences of the choice are worked out under section 715-145.

##### <a id="715-130"></a>715-130  Second choice: pool’s loss denial balance applied in reducing adjustable values of leaving assets that are loss assets

             (1)  The second choice is to reduce under this section the <sup>* </sup>adjustable value of each leaving asset (a **_loss asset_**) for which the <sup>* </sup>head company would have had a notional capital loss, or notional revenue loss, under section 165-115F at the time (the **_test time_**) just before the leaving time if the test time had been a <sup>* </sup>changeover time for the head company. The choice has effect accordingly.

Note:          The consequences of the choice are worked out under this section and section 715-145.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  2 or more entities cease to be <sup>* </sup>subsidiary members of the <sup>* </sup>consolidated group; and

                     (b)  2 or more of them make the second choice;

the choices have effect in the same order as the entities cease being subsidiary members. If 2 or more of the entities ceased at the same time, their choices have effect in whichever order the <sup>* </sup>head company determines.

             (3)  This section applies to each of the loss assets in order, according to their respective <sup>* </sup>adjustable values (apart from this section) at the test time: from largest to smallest. (If an asset has more than one such adjustable value, use the greater or greatest of them.)

             (4)  At the test time, the <sup>* </sup>adjustable value of the loss asset is reduced to the asset’s <sup>* </sup>market value at that time.

             (5)  However, if the <sup>* </sup>loss denial balance (as reduced by any previous reductions under this section or section 715-160) of the <sup>* </sup>head company’s <sup>* </sup>loss denial pool<sup> </sup>is _less than_ the difference between:

                     (a)  the <sup>* </sup>adjustable value of the loss asset (apart from this section) at the test time; and

                     (b)  the asset’s <sup>* </sup>market value at the test time;

the adjustable value is instead reduced at the test time by that loss denial balance.

             (6)  That <sup>* </sup>loss denial balance is reduced at the leaving time by the amount of the reduction under subsection (3) or (4). If 2 or more such reductions are made for the same asset (because it has 2 or more different characters), that loss denial balance is reduced by the greater or greatest of the reductions.

##### <a id="715-135"></a>715-135  Third choice: loss denial pool of leaving entity created

             (1)  The third choice can be made only if every asset that was in the <sup>* </sup>loss denial pool just before the leaving time is a leaving asset. The choice is to have a **_loss denial pool_** of the leaving entity created at the leaving time, consisting of every leaving asset. (To avoid doubt, the choice can be made even if the leaving entity is not a company.)

             (2)  A choice under this section has effect accordingly. The pool is distinct from any other loss denial pool of the leaving entity.

             (3)  When the leaving entity’s loss denial pool is created, its **_loss denial balance_** equals the loss denial balance of the head company’s loss denial pool (as reduced by any previous reductions under section 715-130 or 715-160).

Note:          If the head company makes this choice, the leaving entity can choose to cancel the loss denial pool by reducing reduced cost bases of assets in the pool: see section 715-185.

             (4)  The head company’s <sup>* </sup>loss denial pool ceases to exist when the leaving entity’s loss denial pool is created.
