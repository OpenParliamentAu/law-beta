<h9 class="ActHead9">Income Tax Assessment Act 1997</h9>

## 1  Section 705-155

Repeal the section, substitute:

##### <a id="705-155"></a>705-155  Adjustments to restrict step 4 reduction of allocable cost amount to effective distributions to head company in respect of direct membership interests

Object

             (1)  The object of this section is to ensure that, in working out the group’s * allocable cost amount for entities that become * subsidiary members of the group at the formation time, the reduction under step 4 in the table in section 705-60 (about pre-formation time distributions out of certain profits) is made only for profits that have been effectively distributed to the * head company in respect of its direct * membership interests in the entities. This ensures consistency with the ordering rule in section 705-145.

When section applies

             (2)  This section applies to a distribution (the **_subject distribution_**) to the extent that the following conditions are satisfied:

                     (a)  the distribution is made by an entity (the **_subject entity_**) that becomes a * subsidiary member of the group at the formation time;

                     (b)  in working out the group’s * allocable cost amount for the subject entity there would, apart from this section, be a reduction under step 4 in the table in section 705-60 for the distribution.

Step 4 reduction only if subject distribution is made to head company etc.

             (3)  There is no reduction as mentioned in paragraph (2)(b) for the subject distribution unless:

                     (a)  the subject distribution is made to the * head company of the group; or

                     (b)  the reduction is in accordance with subsection (5).

Step 4 reduction for effective distribution to head company

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  at the formation time, the * head company of the group has a direct * membership interest in the subject entity; and

                     (b)  the head company acquired the membership interest directly from another entity, or indirectly as a result of one or more acquisitions from other entities, where:

                              (i)  section 160ZZ0 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ applied to each acquisition; or

                             (ii)  there was a roll-over under Subdivision 126-B for each acquisition;

                            or a combination of these happened; and

                     (c)  while it held the membership interest, the entity, or one of the entities, mentioned in paragraph (b) (the **_recipient of the further distribution_**) received a distribution (the **_further distribution_**) of some of the subject distribution from the subject entity;

the consequences in subsections (5) and (6) apply.

Reduction for further distribution that remains with recipient

             (5)  If:

                     (a)  the following happen:

                              (i)  by the formation time, any of the further distribution (the **_eligible reduction amount_**) had not again been distributed by the recipient of the further distribution;

                             (ii)  the recipient of the further distribution does not become a * subsidiary member of the group at the formation time; or

                     (b)  the following happen:

                              (i)  by the formation time, any of the further distribution (the **_eligible reduction amount_**) had been distributed by the recipient of the further distribution to another entity directly, or indirectly though successive distributions by interposed entities;

                             (ii)  that other entity does not become a subsidiary member of the group at the formation time; or

                     (c)  both of the above paragraphs apply;

then, in working out the group’s * allocable cost amount for the subject entity, the reduction under step 4 in the table in section 705-60 for the subject distribution only takes place to the extent that it equals the sum of all eligible reduction amounts.

Step 1 reduced cost base adjustment to reverse effect of reduction for further distribution

             (6)  Also, if subsection 160ZK(5) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ or subsection 110-55(7) of this Act applied to the further distribution, then for the purposes of step 1 in the table in section 705-60 in working out the group’s * allocable cost amount for the subject entity:

                     (a)  the reference in subsection 705-65(3) to a reduction resulting from the application of subsection 160ZK(5) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; and

                     (b)  the reference in subsection 705-65(5) to a reduction that has taken place under subsection 110-55(7);

include a reference to the reduction in the * reduced cost base of the membership interest in the subject entity resulting from the application of subsection 160ZK(5) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, or subsection 110-55(7) of this Act, to the further distribution.

## 2  Section 705-230

Object

             (1)  The object of this section is to ensure that, in working out the group’s * allocable cost amount for the linked entities, the reduction under step 4 in the table in section 705-60 (about pre-formation time distributions out of certain profits) is made only for profits that have been effectively distributed to the * head company in respect of its direct * membership interests in the entities. This ensures consistency with the ordering rule in section 705-225.

When section applies

             (2)  This section applies to a distribution to the extent that the following conditions are satisfied:

                     (a)  the distribution is made by a linked entity;

                     (b)  in working out the group’s * allocable cost amount for the linked entity there would, apart from this section, be a reduction under step 4 in the table in section 705-60 for the distribution.

Step 4 reduction only if subject distribution is made to head company

             (3)  There is no reduction as mentioned in subsection (2) for the distribution unless it is made to the * head company of the group.

Object

             (1)  The object of this section is to prevent a distortion under section 705-35 in the allocation of * allocable cost amount to an entity that becomes a * subsidiary member of the group where that entity has direct or indirect * membership interests in another entity that has certain profits or tax losses when it becomes a subsidiary member.

Adjustment to allocation of allocable cost amount where direct interest in entity with profits/losses

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  an entity becomes a * subsidiary member of the group at the formation time; and

                     (b)  the entity has * membership interests in a second entity that becomes a subsidiary member of the group at that time; and

                     (c)  in working out the group’s * allocable cost amount for the second entity:

Apportionment of step 3A amount among first level interposed entities

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  under section 705-93, in its application in accordance with this Subdivision, there is a step 3A amount for the purpose of working out the group’s * allocable cost amount for an entity (the **_subject entity_**) that becomes a * subsidiary member of the group at the formation time; and

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00604/Html/NewBusTaxSysConsOtherMeas2003_image007.gif)

                            where:

**_market value of all membership interests in subject entity_** means the * market value, at the formation time, of all * membership interests in the subject entity that are held by entities that become * members of the group at that time.

**_market value of first level entity’s direct and indirect membership interests in subject entity_** means so much of the market value of all membership interests in the subject entity (as defined above) as is attributable to * membership interests that the first level entity holds directly, or indirectly through other interposed entities that become * subsidiary members of the group at the formation time; and

                             (ii)  section 160ZZO of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ applied in relation to a disposal (a **_section 160ZZO roll-over_**) of an asset (also the **_roll-over asset_**); and

                     (b)  the originating company in relation to the Subdivision 126-B roll-over, or the transferor in relation to the section 160ZZO roll-over, was a foreign resident; and

                     (c)  the recipient company in relation to the Subdivision 126-B roll-over, or the transferee in relation to the section 160ZZO roll-over, was an Australian resident and was not the entity that became the * head company of the group; and

                     (d)  between the Subdivision 126-B roll-over, or the section 160ZZO roll-over, and the formation time, no other CGT event happened in relation to the roll-over asset for which there was not a Subdivision 126-B roll-over or a section 160ZZO roll-over; and

                     (e)  the roll-over asset is a * membership interest in an entity that becomes a * subsidiary member at the formation time, other than one that is held at that time by the entity that becomes the head company of the group;

then, subject to subsection (5), there is under section 705-93 a step 3A amount for the purpose of working out the group’s * allocable cost amount for the entity (the **_subject entity_**) that holds the roll-over asset at the formation time.

What the step 3A amount is

             (4)  The step 3A amount is:

                     (a)  if, as a result of the Subdivision 126-B roll-over mentioned in subparagraph (3)(a)(i), or the section 160ZZO roll-over mentioned in subparagraph (3)(a)(ii), a * capital loss of the originating company was disregarded or a capital loss of the transferor was not incurred—an increase amount equal to the capital loss; or

                     (b)  if, as a result of the Subdivision 126-B roll-over mentioned in subparagraph (3)(a)(i), or the section 160ZZO roll-over mentioned in subparagraph (3)(a)(ii), a * capital gain of the originating company was disregarded or a capital gain of the transferor did not accrue—a reduction amount equal to the capital gain.

Apportionment of step 3A amount among first level interposed entities

             (5)  If at the formation time one or more entities, that become * subsidiary members of the group and in which the * head company holds * membership interests, are interposed between the head company and the subject entity, then the step 3A amount is apportioned among those entities and the subject entity in the same way as a step 3A amount is apportioned under subsection (2).

##### <a id="705-227"></a>705-227  Adjustment in working out step 3A of allocable cost amount to take account of membership interests held by linked entities in other linked entities

Object

             (1)  The object of this section is to modify the effect that section 705-93 (step 3A of allocable cost amount) has in accordance with this Subdivision so that it takes account of * membership interests that linked entities hold in other linked entities at the time (the **_linked entity joining time_**) when the linked entities become * subsidiary members of the group.

Apportionment of step 3A amount among first level interposed entities

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  under section 705-93, in its application in accordance with this Subdivision, there is a step 3A amount for the purpose of working out the group’s * allocable cost amount for a particular linked entity (the **_subject entity_**); and

                     (b)  at the linked entity joining time, one or more of the linked entities (the **_first level entities_**) in which the * head company holds * membership interests are interposed between the head company and the subject entity;

then the step 3A amount is apportioned among the first level entities and the subject entity on the following basis:

                     (c)  each first level entity has the following proportion of the step 3A amount:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00604/Html/NewBusTaxSysConsOtherMeas2003_image007.gif)

                            where:

**_market value of all membership interests in subject entity_** means the * market value, at the linked entity joining time, of all * membership interests in the subject entity that are held by entities that become * members of the group at that time.

**_market value of first level entity’s direct and indirect membership interests in subject entity_** means so much of the market value of all membership interests in the subject entity (as defined above) as is attributable to * membership interests that the first level entity holds directly, or indirectly through other linked entities; and

                     (d)  the subject entity has the remainder of the step 3A amount.

Step 3A amount for assets consisting of membership interests held by linked entities in other linked entities

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  before the linked entity joining time:

                              (i)  there was a roll-over under Subdivision 126-B (a **_Subdivision 126-B roll-over_**) in relation to a * CGT event that happened in relation to an asset (the **_roll-over asset_**); or

                             (ii)  section 160ZZO of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ applied in relation to a disposal (a **_section 160ZZO roll-over_**) of an asset (also the **_roll-over asset_**); and

                     (b)  the originating company in relation to the Subdivision 126-B roll-over, or the transferor in relation to the section 160ZZO roll-over, was a foreign resident; and

                     (c)  the recipient company in relation to the Subdivision 126-B roll-over, or the transferee in relation to the section 160ZZO roll-over, was an Australian resident and was not the entity that became the * head company of the group; and

                     (d)  between the Subdivision 126-B roll-over, or the section 160ZZO roll-over, and the linked entity joining time, no other CGT event happened in relation to the roll-over asset for which there was not a Subdivision 126-B roll-over or a section 160ZZO roll-over; and

                     (e)  the roll-over asset is a * membership interest in a linked entity, other than one that is held at that time by the entity that becomes the head company of the group;

then, subject to subsection (5), there is under section 705-93 a step 3A amount for the purpose of working out the group’s * allocable cost amount for the linked entity (the **_subject entity_**) that holds the roll-over asset at the linked entity joining time.

What the step 3A amount is

             (4)  The step 3A amount is:

                     (a)  if, as a result of the Subdivision 126-B roll-over mentioned in subparagraph (3)(a)(i), or the section 160ZZO roll-over mentioned in subparagraph (3)(a)(ii), a * capital loss of the originating company was disregarded or a capital loss of the transferor was not incurred—an increase amount equal to the capital loss; or

                     (b)  if, as a result of the Subdivision 126-B roll-over mentioned in subparagraph (3)(a)(i), or the section 160ZZO roll-over mentioned in subparagraph (3)(a)(ii), a * capital gain of the originating company was disregarded or a capital gain of the transferor did not accrue—a reduction amount equal to the capital gain.

Apportionment of step 3A amount among first level interposed entities

             (5)  If at the linked entity joining time one or more linked entities, in which the * head company holds * membership interests, are interposed between the head company and the subject entity, then the step 3A amount is apportioned among those entities and the subject entity in the same way as a step 3A amount is apportioned under subsection (2).

#### Operative provisions

##### <a id="705-305"></a>705-305  Object of this Subdivision

                   The object of this Subdivision is to avoid the time and expense involved in correcting errors affecting * tax cost setting amount calculations. This is done by providing for * capital gains or * capital losses to reverse the errors.

##### <a id="705-310"></a>705-310  Operation of Part IVA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_

                   To avoid doubt, this Subdivision does not limit the operation of Part IVA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

##### <a id="705-315"></a>705-315  Errors that attract special adjustment action

             (1)  Section 705-320 (about later adjustments to correct * tax cost setting amount calculation errors) applies if the conditions in this section are satisfied.

Tax cost setting amount taken into account

             (2)  The first condition is that the * head company of a * consolidated group worked out a * tax cost setting amount, in purported compliance with this Division, for an asset of an entity that becomes a * subsidiary member of the group that is an asset of a kind referred to in section 705-35 as a reset cost base asset.

Error in calculation

             (3)  The second condition is that:

                     (a)  the * head company made one or more errors in working out the * tax cost setting amount; and

                     (b)  those errors caused the tax cost setting amount to differ from its correct amount.

If the errors caused the tax cost setting amount to be more, the difference is an **_overstated amount_**. If the errors caused the tax cost setting amount to be less, the difference is an **_understated amount_**.

Unreasonable to require recalculation

             (4)  The third condition is that, having regard to the following factors:

                     (a)  the net size of the errors compared to the size of the * allocable cost amount for the joining entity;

                     (b)  the number of * tax cost setting amounts that would have to be recalculated, and the difficulty of making the recalculations;

                     (c)  the number of adjustments, in assessments that could be amended and in future * income tax returns, that would be necessary to correct the errors;

                     (d)  the difficulty in obtaining any necessary information;

it is not reasonable to require a recalculation of the amounts involved.

Exception where error due to fraud or evasion

(5)However, the conditions in this section are _not_ satisfied if the errors were to any extent due to fraud or evasion.

Requirement to notify

             (6)  The * head company of the * consolidated group must, as soon as practicable after becoming aware that it made one or more errors in working out the * tax cost setting amount, notify the Commissioner in the * approved form:

                     (a)  that it had made the errors; and

                     (b)  of the amount of the overstated amount or understated amount.

##### <a id="705-320"></a>705-320  Tax cost setting amounts taken to be correct

             (1)  For the purposes of this Act (other than this Subdivision) and for the purposes of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_, any * tax cost setting amounts that were worked out by the * head company, so far as they were due to the errors, are taken to have been correct if the conditions in section 705-315 are satisfied.

Note 1:       If the conditions in section 705-315 are satisfied, CGT event L6 happens (see section 104-525).

Note 2:       Subsection (1) means that the Commissioner cannot amend any assessments necessary to correct the errors, and that (except as mentioned in subsection (2)) no offences or administrative penalties arise in respect of the errors.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply for the purposes of determining whether there is an offence against section 8N of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_, or an administrative penalty under section 284-75 or 284-145 in Schedule 1 to that Act, in relation to statements made before the Commissioner became aware of the errors.

Note 1:       Section 8N of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ deals with false or misleading statements. Sections 284-75 and 284-145 in Schedule 1 to that Act set out the circumstances in which an entity is liable for an administrative penalty.

Note 2:       The offence and administrative penalty provisions however apply on a modified basis—see subsection 8W(1C) of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_, and subsections 284-80(2) and 284-150(2) in Schedule 1 to that Act.

             (2)  The time of the event is the start of your income year in which the liability is discharged.

             (3)  The conditions are that:

                     (a)  a liability of an entity that became a * subsidiary member of the group was taken into account in working out your * allocable cost amount for the subsidiary member in accordance with Division 705 (your **_ACA_**); and

                     (b)  the liability was later discharged (whether by the making of a payment or by the release, waiver or other extinguishment of the liability) and the sum (the **_realised amount_**) of:

                              (i)  the amount of any payment made to discharge the liability; and

                             (ii)  the market value of any other consideration given to discharge the liability;

                            differs from the amount for the liability that was taken into account in working out your ACA; and

                     (c)  that ACA is different to what it would have been (your **_true ACA_**) if you had taken the realised amount into account in working out your ACA.

             (4)  You make a **_capital gain_** for the head company core purposes mentioned in subsection 701-1(2) if your ACA would have been smaller had you used the realised amount in working out your ACA. The amount of the gain is the difference between the amount you worked out and your true ACA.

             (5)  You make a **_capital loss_** for the head company core purposes mentioned in subsection 701-1(2) if your ACA would have been greater had you used the realised amount in working out your ACA. The amount of the loss is the difference between the amount you worked out and your true ACA.

Operative provisions

709-155    Testing consolidated groups

709-160    Subsidiary member is exempting entity

709-165    Subsidiary member is former exempting entity

709-170    Head company and subsidiary are exempting entities

709-175    Head company is former exempting entity

\[This is the end of the Guide.]

#### Operative provisions

##### <a id="709-155"></a>709-155  Testing consolidated groups

             (1)  To determine whether a * consolidated group is an * exempting entity or * former exempting entity, the tests in Division 208 are applied to the * head company of the group.

             (2)  However, there are some additional rules that can alter the way that Division 208 applies to a * consolidated group. These are set out in sections 709-160 to 709-175.

             (3)  In applying those rules to an entity that is a * member of a * consolidated group:

                     (a)  Division 208 is to be applied before those rules; and

                     (b)  that Division is to be applied just after the entity became a member of the group but, for a * subsidiary member, it is to be applied on the assumption that the subsidiary was not a member of the group at that time.

             (4)  Except as mentioned in paragraph (3)(b), Division 208 has no application to a * subsidiary member of a * consolidated group.

##### <a id="709-160"></a>709-160  Subsidiary member is exempting entity

             (1)  This section operates if:

                     (a)  the * head company of a * consolidated group is neither an exempting entity nor a * former exempting entity; and

                     (b)  a * corporate tax entity becomes a * subsidiary member of the group at a time (the **_joining time_**); and

                     (c)  the entity is an * exempting entity at the joining time.

             (2)  These rules apply to the * consolidated group.

#### Operative provisions

##### <a id="719-430"></a>719-430  Transfer of franking account balance on cessation event

             (1)  This section operates if:

                     (a)  a * cessation event happens to the * provisional head company of a * MEC group (the **_former head company_**); and

                     (b)  another company (the **_new head company_**) is appointed as the provisional head company of the group under subsection 719-60(3).

             (2)  When the new head company is appointed:

                     (a)  the * franking account of the former head company ceases to operate; and

                     (b)  the new head company has a franking account; and

                     (c)  any * franking surplus or * franking deficit in the franking account of the former head company just before the * cessation event happened becomes that of the new head company.

##### <a id="719-435"></a>719-435  Distributions by subsidiary members of MEC group taken to be distributions by head company

             (1)  Part 3-6 operates as if a * frankable distribution made by an * eligible tier-1 company that:

                     (a)  is a member of a * MEC group; and

                     (b)  is not the * provisional head company of the group;

had been made by the provisional head company of the group to a * member of the provisional head company.

Note:          Part 3-6 deals with imputation.

             (2)  Part 3-6 operates as if a * frankable distribution made by a * subsidiary member of a * MEC group (the **_foreign-held subsidiary_**) that is not an * eligible tier-1 company were a frankable distribution made by the * head company of the group to a * member of the head company if:

                     (a)  the foreign-held subsidiary meets the set of requirements in section 703-45, section 701C-10 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_ or section 701C-15 of that Act; and

                     (b)  the frankable distribution is made to a foreign resident.

\[This is the end of the Guide.]

#### Operative provisions

##### <a id="713-505"></a>713-505  Head company treated as a life insurance company

                   This Act, and the _Income Tax Rates Act 1986_, apply to the * head company of a * consolidated group as if it were a * life insurance company for an income year if one or more life insurance companies are * subsidiary members of the group at any time during that year.

##### <a id="713-510"></a>713-510  Certain subsidiaries of life insurance companies cannot be members of consolidated group

             (1)  An entity cannot be a * subsidiary member of the same * consolidated group or * consolidatable group of which a * life insurance company is a * member if:

                     (a)  the life insurance company owns, either directly or indirectly, * membership interests in the entity; and

                     (b)  either:

                              (i)  some, but not all, of those membership interests are * virtual PST assets of the life insurance company; or

                             (ii)  some, but not all, of those membership interests are * segregated exempt assets of the life insurance company.

Note:          The entity could, however, be a member of another consolidated group or consolidatable group.

             (2)  An entity cannot continue to be a * subsidiary member of a * consolidated group if:

                     (a)  a * life insurance company is a * member of the group; and

                     (b)  the life insurance company owns, either directly or indirectly, * membership interests in the entity; and

                     (c)  had the entity not been a subsidiary member of the group, either:

                              (i)  some, but not all, of those membership interests would be * virtual PST assets of the life insurance company; or

                             (ii)  some, but not all, of those membership interests would be * segregated exempt assets of the life insurance company.

##### <a id="713-515"></a>713-515  Modification of cost setting rules

             (1)  If an entity that becomes a * subsidiary member of a * consolidated group at a time (the **_joining time_**) is a * life insurance company, these assets are **_retained cost base assets_**:

                     (a)  a * virtual PST asset, or a * segregated exempt asset, of the company; and

                     (b)  another asset of the company that is held by the company for the purpose of discharging its liabilities under the * net investment component of ordinary life insurance policies (except policies that provide for * participating benefits or * discretionary benefits under * life insurance business carried on in Australia); and

                     (c)  for a life insurance company that has demutualised under Division 9AA of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ where, in the period starting just after the company demutualises and ending at the joining time, all of the * membership interests in the company were owned by the same group—a goodwill asset of the company.

             (2)  If the * retained cost base asset is covered by paragraph (1)(a) or (b), its * tax cost setting amount is:

                     (a)  for the purposes of working out the tax cost setting amounts for reset cost base assets (see section 705-35)—the asset’s * transfer value just before the joining time; and

                     (b)  for all other purposes—the asset’s * terminating value.

             (3)  If the * retained cost base asset is covered by paragraph (1)(c), its * tax cost setting amount is the embedded value (see subsection 121AM(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) on the applicable accounting day (see subsection 121AM(3) of that Act) of the * life insurance company concerned reduced by the net value of shareholders’ assets held by the company on that day.

             (4)  The **_net investment component of ordinary life insurance policies_** is the component of * life insurance policies (except * exempt life insurance policies and * virtual PST life insurance policies) that:

                     (a)  is the component in respect of the part of those policies that has not been reinsured under a * contract of reinsurance; and

                     (b)  is not the * net risk component of those policies.

##### <a id="713-520"></a>713-520  Valuing certain liabilities

             (1)  Despite section 705-70, if the joining entity mentioned in step 2 in the table in section 705-60 is a * life insurance company, the joining entity’s liabilities mentioned in this section are to be valued as mentioned in this section.

             (2)  The value of the joining entity’s * virtual PST liabilities (if any) is the amount worked out under section 320-190 at the joining time.

             (3)  The value of the joining entity’s * exempt life insurance policy liabilities (if any) is the amount worked out under section 320-245 at the joining time.

             (4)  Subsection (5) applies to a liability of the joining entity if:

                     (a)  the liability is under the * net risk component of a * life insurance policy; and

                     (b)  the joining entity could deduct under section 320-80 an amount for the * risk component of claims paid under the policy had it not become a * member of the * consolidated group.

             (5)  The value of that liability is the * current termination value of the * net risk component of the * life insurance policy at the joining time (calculated by an * actuary).

             (6)  The value of the joining entity’s liabilities under the * net investment component of ordinary life insurance policies is the amount worked out for those liabilities under subsection 320-190(2) as if those liabilities were * virtual PST liabilities.

##### <a id="713-525"></a>713-525  Obligation to value virtual PST assets and segregated exempt assets

                   Division 320 has effect as if:

                     (a)  the joining time when a * life insurance company becomes a * subsidiary member of a * consolidated group; and

                     (b)  the time (the **_leaving time_**) when a life insurance company ceases to be a subsidiary member of a consolidated group;

were a valuation time for the purposes of sections 320-175 and 320-230.

Note:          This means that:

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">          </span>the company must value its virtual PST assets under section 320-175 (with the consequences set out in section 320-180), and its segregated exempt assets under section 320-230 (with the consequences set out in section 320-235), as at the joining time; and

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">          </span>the head company must value the life insurance company’s virtual PST assets and its segregated exempt assets as at the leaving time.

##### <a id="713-530"></a>713-530  Certain amounts transferred to leaving entity

             (1)  This section operates if:

                     (a)  a * life insurance company ceases to be a subsidiary member of a * consolidated group in an income year; and

                     (b)  at the leaving time, no other member of the group is a life insurance company that has a * virtual PST; and

                     (c)  either:

                              (i)  at the leaving time, the * head company of the group has a * net capital loss from * virtual PST assets; or

                             (ii)  the head company has an amount referred to in subsection 320-205(2) as a difference that it could not apply to reduce any * virtual PST component of the * complying superannuation class of the company’s taxable income for the income year in which the leaving time occurred.

             (2)  The * net capital loss, or the difference, becomes that of the * life insurance company just after the leaving time.

##### <a id="713-500"></a>713-500  Object of Subdivision

                   The object of this Subdivision is to give an opportunity to a group of entities that includes a life insurance company to rearrange the assets of the group for the purposes of one or more of them becoming members of a consolidated group in a way that does not attract any immediate taxation consequences.

##### <a id="713-505"></a>713-505  When this Subdivision applies (first case)

             (1)  This Subdivision provides for a deferral of the taxation consequences that would occur because of an event (the **_deferral event_**) happening involving an entity (the **_originating entity_**) and another entity (the **_recipient entity_**) if:

                     (a)  the event occurs in connection with a life insurance company (the **_member life insurance company_**) becoming a member of a consolidated group; and

                     (b)  the relevant conditions in section 713-520 are met.

             (2)  If the originating entity is a company, the deferral event referred to in subsection (1) is a CGT event referred to in subsection (4) happening to a CGT asset (the **_original asset_**) where, apart from this Subdivision, the happening of the event would have resulted in:

                     (a)  an amount (other than a capital gain) being included in the originating entity’s assessable income; or

                     (b)  the originating entity making a capital gain.

             (3)  If the originating entity is a trust, the deferral event referred to in subsection (1) is a CGT event referred to in subsection (4) happening to a CGT asset (also the **_original asset_**) where, apart from this Subdivision, the happening of the event would have resulted in:

                     (a)  an amount (other than a capital gain) being included in the net income of the trust; or

                     (b)  the trustee making a capital gain.

             (4)  The CGT events are:

                     (a)  CGT events A1, B1, D1, D2, D3, E2, F1 and F2; and

                     (b)  CGT event C2, but only if the CGT asset that ends is a unit in a unit trust that is replaced by an equivalent membership interest (the **_replacement interest_**) in a company or in another trust.

##### <a id="713-510"></a>713-510  When this Subdivision applies (second case)

             (1)  This Subdivision also provides for a deferral of the taxation consequences that would occur if:

                     (a)  a life insurance company transfers an asset (also the **_original asset_**) to its virtual PST or from its virtual PST where, apart from this Subdivision, section 320-200 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ would apply to the transfer; or

                     (b)  a life insurance company transfers an asset (also the **_original asset_**) to its segregated exempt assets where, apart from this Subdivision, section 320-255 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ would apply to the transfer;

where the transfer (also the **_deferral event_**) is made in connection with the life insurance company (also the **_member life insurance company_**) becoming a member of a consolidated group.

             (2)  The relevant conditions in section 713-520 must be met.

##### <a id="713-515"></a>713-515  Entities must choose the relief

             (1)  This Subdivision applies only if the originating entity (for a section 713-505 case) or the life insurance company (for a section 713-510 case) chooses that it apply.

             (2)  The choice must be made:

                     (a)  by the day the originating entity or the life insurance company, or the head company of the consolidated group of which it is a member, lodges its income tax return for the income year in which the deferral event happened; or

                     (b)  within a further time allowed by the Commissioner.

##### <a id="713-520"></a>713-520  Conditions

             (1)  For a section 713-505 case:

                     (a)  the originating entity must be:

                              (i)  a life insurance company that has virtual PST assets or segregated exempt assets and that is a member of a consolidatable group; or

                             (ii)  an entity that is unable to be a member of the same consolidatable group as a life insurance company because of section 713-510 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; or

                            (iii)  an entity that is, directly or indirectly, a subsidiary of a life insurance company and is a member of the same consolidated group as the life insurance company; and

                     (b)  the originating entity and the recipient entity must be members of the same consolidatable group or consolidated group or, if they are not, they would have been apart from section 713-510 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

                     (c)  any asset transferred by the originating entity must be transferred to the recipient entity at its transfer value.

             (2)  For both a section 713-505 case and a section 713-510 case:

                     (a)  the total transfer values of the virtual PST assets of the member life insurance company just before a transfer of assets to which this Subdivision applies must be the same as the total transfer values of those assets just after the transfer; and

                     (b)  the total transfer values of the segregated exempt assets of the member life insurance company just before a transfer of assets to which this Subdivision applies must be the same as the total transfer values of those assets just after the transfer.

             (3)  Any transfer of an asset under the deferral event must happen on or before the later of:

                     (a)  30 June 2004; and

                     (b)  if the head company of the consolidated group of which the member life insurance company is a member has a substituted accounting period—the end of the head company’s income year in which 30 June 2004 occurs.

##### <a id="713-525"></a>713-525  Time of transfer

                   This Act, and the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, apply to the transfer of an asset to which this Subdivision applies as if the asset had been transferred just before the member life insurance company became a member of the consolidated group.

##### <a id="713-530"></a>713-530  What the relief is

             (1)  For a section 713-505 case:

                     (a)  if the originating entity is a company:

                              (i)  any amount (other than a capital gain) that would have been included in the originating entity’s assessable income (the **_deferred amount_**) as a result of the deferral event is not so included; and

                             (ii)  any capital gain (the **_deferred gain_**) that the originating entity would have made as a result of the deferral event is disregarded; and

                     (b)  if the originating entity is a trust:

                              (i)  any amount (other than a capital gain) that would have been included in the member life insurance company’s assessable income (also the **_deferred amount_**) as a result of the deferral event is not so included; and

                             (ii)  any capital gain (also the **_deferred gain_**) that the member life insurance company would have made as a result of the deferral event is disregarded.

             (2)  For a section 713-510 case:

                     (a)  any amount that would have been included in the member life insurance company’s assessable income (also the **_deferred amount_**) under paragraph 320-15(e) or (g) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ as a result of the deferral event is not so included; and

                     (b)  any capital gain (also the **_deferred gain_**) that the member life insurance company would have made as a result of the deferral event is disregarded.

##### <a id="713-535"></a>713-535  Subsequent consequences

             (1)  This section operates if, after the deferral event happens, another event (the **_new event_**) happens where the new event is:

                     (a)  a CGT event happening to:

                              (i)  the original asset; or

                             (ii)  if the deferral event was CGT event C2—the replacement asset; or

                     (b)  the recipient entity ceasing to be a member of the consolidated group of which the member life insurance company is a member; or

                     (c)  if the recipient entity is a life insurance company:

                              (i)  the original asset being transferred to or from the company’s virtual PST under section 320-180, 320-185 or 320-195 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; or

                             (ii)  the original asset being transferred to or from the company’s segregated exempt assets under section 320-235, 320-240 or 320-250 of that Act; or

                     (d)  if the originating entity is a company—the originating entity ceasing to exist.

             (2)  For a section 713-505 case where the originating entity is a company:

                     (a)  the originating entity must include the deferred amount in its assessable income for the income year in which the new event happens; or

                     (b)  the originating entity is taken, just before the new event happened, to have made a capital gain equal to the deferred gain.

Note:          If the originating entity is a subsidiary member of a consolidated group, the head company of the group will have the amount included in its assessable income or will make the capital gain.

             (3)  For a section 713-505 case where the originating entity is a trust:

                     (a)  the member life insurance company must include the deferred amount in its assessable income for the income year in which the new event happens; or

                     (b)  the member life insurance company is taken, just before the new event happened, to have made a capital gain equal to the deferred gain.

             (4)  For a section 713-505 case where the originating entity is a life insurance company or a trust and the deferred amount or the deferred gain relates to an asset that was a virtual PST asset at the time when the deferral event happened, an amount equal to the deferred amount or deferred gain is taken to be an amount of assessable income to which subsection 320-205(3) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies for the relevant entity.

             (5)  For a section 713-510 case:

                     (a)  the member life insurance company must include the deferred amount in its assessable income for the income year in which the new event happens; or

                     (b)  the member life insurance company is taken, just before the new event happened, to have made a capital gain equal to the deferred gain.

             (6)  In addition, if the deferral event involved the transfer of assets from the member life insurance company’s virtual PST, an amount equal to the deferred amount or deferred gain is taken to be an amount of assessable income to which subsection 320-205(3) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies for the relevant entity.

##### <a id="713-540"></a>713-540  Requirement to notify happening of new event

             (1)  For a section 713-505 case, the recipient entity must, if it is not a member of the same consolidated group as the originating entity when the new event happens, notify the originating entity in the approved form of the happening of the new event within 60 days after the new event happens.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply if the new event is the originating entity ceasing to exist.

##### <a id="713-545"></a>713-545  Discount capital gain in certain cases

                   The _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies as if the capital gain referred to in paragraph 713-535(2)(b), (3)(b) or (5)(b) were a discount capital gain if:

                     (a)  the asset to which the deferral event happened is a virtual PST asset; and

                     (b)  the asset was acquired less than 12 months before the deferral event happened; and

                     (c)  the new event happens at least 12 months after the asset was acquired.

#### Object

##### <a id="715-15"></a>715-15  Object of this Subdivision

             (1)  The object of this Subdivision is to give effect to the purposes of Subdivision 165-CC (about change of ownership or control of a company that has an unrealised net loss) in these cases:

                     (a)  on formation of a * consolidated group, a * CGT asset held directly by the * head company is affected by that Subdivision, and the * same business test is failed;

                     (b)  on an entity becoming a * subsidiary member of a consolidated group, an asset consisting of:

                              (i)  a * membership interest that a * member of the group (including a chosen transitional entity under Division 701 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_) holds in the entity; or

                             (ii)  a liability that the entity owes to such a member;

                            is affected by that Subdivision, and the same business test is failed;

                     (c)  on a company becoming a subsidiary member:

                              (i)  a CGT asset of the company that becomes an asset of the head company is affected by that Subdivision; and

                             (ii)  because the company is a chosen transitional entity, the asset does not have its tax cost reset; and

                            (iii)  the same business test is failed;

                     (d)  on an entity ceasing to be a subsidiary member, a CGT asset of the head company that becomes an asset of the entity is affected by that Subdivision, and the same business test is failed.

Note:          Subdivision 165-CC also affects an entity that has deferred losses under Subdivision 170-D on assets that it formerly owned. Subdivision 715-D gives effect to the purposes of Subdivision 165-CC if such an entity becomes a member of a consolidated group.

             (2)  This Subdivision achieves its object by supplementing and modifying the application of Subdivision 165-CC to take account of how the rest of this Part treats * members of a * consolidated group (in particular the provisions about entities becoming or ceasing to be members).

\[The next section is section 715-25.]

#### Effect on Subdivision 165-CC of a company becoming a member of a consolidated group

##### <a id="715-25"></a>715-25  Subdivision 165-CC stops applying to earlier changeover time

             (1)  At and after the time (the **_membership time_**) when a company becomes a * member of a * consolidated group, Subdivision 165-CC does not apply to the company in relation to a * changeover time that happened before the membership time, except for the purposes of section 715-30 (which defines **_165-CC tagged asset_**).

Note 1:       Subdivision 165-CC is about change of ownership or control of a company that has an unrealised net loss.

Note 2:       If the company has 165-CC tagged assets at the membership time, there are further consequences under this Subdivision and Subdivision 715-D.

                   Also, Subdivision 165-CC can apply to the head company of the group in relation to a changeover time that happens for it at or after the membership time. See section 715-75.

             (2)  Subsection (1) continues to have effect even if the company later stops being a * member of the group.

##### <a id="715-30"></a>715-30  Meaning of _165-CC tagged asset_

                   A * CGT asset is a **_165-CC tagged asset_** of a company at a particular time if, and only if:

                     (a)  that time is at or after the most recent * changeover time (if any) for the company; and

                     (b)  at that changeover time, the company had an unrealised net loss under section 165-115E; and

                     (c)  the asset is covered by subsection 165-115A(1A) as applying to that changeover time; and

                     (d)  the company would not, at that changeover time, satisfy the maximum net asset value test under section 152-15; and

                     (e)  if the company has chosen under subsection 165-115A(1B) in relation to that changeover time—the company * acquired the asset for $10,000 or more.

##### <a id="715-35"></a>715-35  Meaning of _final RUNL_

                   A company’s **_final RUNL_** at a particular time (the **_test time_**) is the amount that would have been the company’s * residual unrealised net loss at the time of:

                     (a)  if no event that subsection 165-115BB(2) refers to as a relevant event actually happens at the test time—a notional event of that kind happening at the test time; or

                     (b)  otherwise—a notional event of that kind that happens at the test time, and that the company determines under paragraph 165-115BB(1)(b) to have happened _later_ than each event that actually happened at that time.

Note:          This Subdivision reduces a company’s final RUNL as amounts of it are applied for various purposes.

\[The next section is section 715-50.]

#### 165-CC tagged assets that affect tax cost setting amounts

##### <a id="715-50"></a>715-50  Step 1 amount is reduced if membership interest in subsidiary member is 165-CC tagged asset and same business test is failed

             (1)  The amount taken into account under subsection 705-65(1) (about the cost of membership interests in the joining entity) for a * membership interest that a * member of the joined group holds in the joining entity at the joining time is reduced if:

                     (a)  apart from this section, the amount would be the membership interest’s * reduced cost base (if appropriate, as modified by a later provision of section 705-65); and

                     (b)  the membership interest is at that time a * 165-CC tagged asset of that member, and that member owned it at the * changeover time for that member; and

                     (c)  that member’s * final RUNL just before the joining time was greater than nil; and

                     (d)  that member does _not_ satisfy the * same business test for:

                              (i)  the period (the **_same business test period_**) consisting of the * head company’s * trial year; and

                             (ii)  the time (the **_test time_**) just before the * changeover time.

             (2)  If at the joining time that * member holds:

                     (a)  2 or * more membership interests in the joining entity; or

                     (b)  at least one membership interest in the joining entity, and at least one membership interest in another member of the joined group;

this section applies to each such membership interest in whichever order that member determines.

Amount of reduction

             (3)  The amount taken into account under subsection 705-65(1) is reduced to the * membership interest’s * market value at the joining time.

             (4)  However, if that member’s * final RUNL (as reduced by any previous reductions under this section) is _less than_ the difference between:

                     (a)  the * reduced cost base referred to in paragraph (1)(a); and

                     (b)  the * market value referred to in subsection (3);

the amount taken into account under subsection 705-65(1) is instead reduced by that final RUNL.

             (5)  That * final RUNL is reduced by the amount of the reduction under subsection (3) or (4).

Rights and options to acquire membership interests

             (6)  Subsection 705-65(6) (which treats rights and options as membership interests) also applies for the purposes of this section.

##### <a id="715-55"></a>715-55  Step 2 amount is affected if liability of subsidiary member is 165-CC tagged asset of another group member and same business test is failed

             (1)  The amount (the **_comparison amount_**) applicable under the table in subsection 705-75(2) (about reduction of the step 2 amount) for an accounting liability of the joining entity that is owed to a * member of the joined group at the joining time is reduced if:

                     (a)  apart from this section, the comparison amount would be the * reduced cost base (if appropriate, as modified by a later provision of section 705-75) of the asset of that member that is constituted by the accounting liability; and

                     (b)  the asset is at that time a * 165-CC tagged asset of that member, and that member owned it at the * changeover time; and

                     (c)  that member’s * final RUNL just before the joining time (as reduced by any reductions under section 715-50) was greater than nil; and

                     (d)  that member does _not_ satisfy the * same business test for:

                              (i)  the period (the **_same business test period_**) consisting of the * head company’s * trial year; and

                             (ii)  the time (the **_test time_**) just before the * changeover time.

Note:          Paragraph (1)(c) has the effect that if both this section and section 715-50 apply to the same member of the joined group, section 715-50 is applied before this section.

             (2)  If at the joining time that * member holds:

                     (a)  2 or * more assets constituted by accounting liabilities of the joining entity; or

                     (b)  at least one asset constituted by an accounting liability of the joining entity, and at least one asset constituted by an accounting liability of another member of the group;

this section applies to each such asset in whichever order that member determines.

Amount of reduction

             (3)  The comparison amount is reduced to the asset’s * market value at the joining time.

             (4)  However, if that member’s * final RUNL (as reduced by any previous reductions under section 715-50 or this section) is _less than_ the difference between:

                     (a)  the * reduced cost base referred to in paragraph (1)(a); and

                     (b)  the asset’s * market value at the joining time;

the comparison amount is instead reduced by that final RUNL.

             (5)  That * final RUNL is reduced by the amount of the reduction under subsection (3) or (4).

#### 165-CC tagged assets that form loss denial pools of head company when consolidated group is formed

##### <a id="715-60"></a>715-60  Assets that the head company already owns

             (1)  At the time (the **_formation time_**) when a * consolidated group comes into existence under paragraph 703-5(1)(a), a **_loss denial pool_** of the * head company is created if:

                     (a)  the formation time is _not_ a * changeover time for the head company; and

                     (b)  at the formation time, the head company owns a * CGT asset:

                              (i)  that is a * 165-CC tagged asset of the head company at that time; and

                             (ii)  that it owned at the * changeover time; and

                            (iii)  that is not a * membership interest in a * member of the group; and

                            (iv)  that is not a right or option (including a contingent right or option), created or issued by a member of the group, to acquire such a membership interest; and

                             (v)  that is not constituted by a liability owed to the head company by a member of the group;

                            or 2 or more such assets; and

                     (c)  the head company’s * final RUNL just before the formation time (as reduced by any reductions under section 715-50 or 715-55) was greater than nil; and

                     (d)  the head company does _not_ satisfy the * same business test for:

                              (i)  the period (the **_same business test period_**) consisting of the head company’s * trial year; and

                             (ii)  the time (the **_test time_**) just before the * changeover time.

Note:          Paragraph (1)(c) has the effect that if the head company has 165-CC tagged assets that are affected by section 715-50 or 715-55 (because they are membership interests in, or accounting liabilities owed by, another group member), those sections are applied before this section.

             (2)  When it is created, the pool consists of the one or more * CGT assets referred to in paragraph (1)(b), and its **_loss denial balance_** is equal to the * final RUNL referred to in paragraph (1)(c).

Note 1:       The pool is distinct from any other loss denial pool of the head company, for example, one created at the formation time under section 715-70.

Note 2:       170-D deferred losses on 165-CC tagged assets of the head company may be added to the pool by subsection 715-355(1).

\[The next section is section 715-70.]

##### <a id="715-70"></a>715-70  Assets of subsidiary member that become those of head company

             (1)  At the time (the **_formation time_**) when an entity becomes a * subsidiary member of a * consolidated group, a **_loss denial pool_** of the * head company of the group is created if:

                     (a)  the formation time is _not_ a * changeover time for the head company; and

                     (b)  the entity is a chosen transitional entity under Division 701 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_; and

                     (c)  subsection (2) or (4) of this section is satisfied.

Note 1:       If the entity is a chosen transitional entity, section 701-15 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_ prevents:

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>section 701-10 (cost to head company of assets that entity brings into group); and

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>subsection 701-35(4) (setting value of trading stock at tax-neutral amount);

                   of this Act from applying to the entity’s assets in relation to the formation time.

Note 2:       The pool is distinct from any other loss denial pool of the head company, for example, one created under this section because another entity becomes a subsidiary member of the group at the formation time.

Joining entity has 165-CC tagged assets

             (2)  This subsection is satisfied if:

                     (a)  a * CGT asset of the entity, or each of 2 or more CGT assets of the entity:

                              (i)  is a * 165-CC tagged asset of the entity at the formation time; and

                             (ii)  was owned by the entity at the * changeover time; and

                            (iii)  is not a * membership interest in a * member of the group; and

                            (iv)  is not a right or option (including a contingent right or option), created or issued by a member of the group, to acquire such a membership interest; and

                             (v)  is not constituted by a liability owed to the entity by a member of the group at the formation time; and

                     (b)  the entity’s * final RUNL just before the formation time (as reduced by any reductions under section 715-50 or 715-55) was greater than nil; and

                     (c)  the entity does _not_ satisfy the * same business test for:

                              (i)  the period (the **_same business test period_**) consisting of the entity’s * trial year; and

                             (ii)  the time (the **_test time_**) just before the * changeover time.

Note:          Paragraph (2)(b) has the effect that if the entity has 165-CC tagged assets that are affected by section 715-50 or 715-55 (because they are membership interests in, or accounting liabilities owed by, another group member), those sections are applied before this section.

             (3)  When it is created because of subsection (2), the pool consists of the one or more * CGT assets referred to in paragraph (2)(a), and its **_loss denial balance_** is equal to the * final RUNL referred to in paragraph (2)(b).

Note:          170-D deferred losses on 165-CC tagged assets of the head company may be added to the pool by subsection 715-355(2).

Entity has loss denial pool

             (4)  This subsection is satisfied if, just before the formation time, the entity had a * loss denial pool.

             (5)  When it is created because of subsection (4), the * head company’s loss denial pool:

                     (a)  consists of the one or more * CGT assets of which the entity’s loss * denial pool consisted; and

                     (b)  has a **_loss denial balance_** equal to the * loss denial balance of the entity’s loss denial pool;

just before the formation time.

#### How Subdivision 165-CC applies to consolidated groups

##### <a id="715-75"></a>715-75  Extension of single entity rule and entry history rule

             (1)  Subsection 701-1(1) (Single entity rule) and section 701-5 (Entry history rule) also have effect for all the purposes of Subdivision 165-CC (about change of ownership or control of a company that has an unrealised net loss).

Note:          One consequence of this is that the head company is the only member of a consolidated group that can have a changeover time and be subject to consequences under Subdivision 165-CC. The head company is treated as owning all CGT assets owned by group members, and as making relevant losses.

             (2)  This section is not intended to limit the effect that subsection 701-1(1) and section 701-5 have apart from this section.

#### Effect on Subdivision 165-CC of entity leaving consolidated group

##### <a id="715-80"></a>715-80  Application of sections 715-85 to 715-110

                   Sections 715-85 to 715-110 apply if, at a particular time (the **_leaving time_**), an entity (the **_leaving entity_**) ceases to be a * subsidiary member of a * consolidated group.

Note 1:       If a changeover time happened to the head company at or after the group came into existence and before the leaving time, Subdivision 165-CC does _not_ apply to the head company at and after the leaving time, in respect of assets that leave with the leaving entity, in relation to the changeover time.

                   This is because the head company can no longer make a capital loss, or become entitled to a deduction, in respect of a CGT event happening to any of those assets.

Note 2:       If, just before the leaving time, the head company had a loss denial pool, see section 715-120.

##### <a id="715-85"></a>715-85  First changeover time for leaving company at or after leaving time

                   If the leaving entity is a company, its first * changeover time at or after the leaving time is determined:

                     (a)  on the basis that the reference time under subsection 165-115A(2A) is the one that would be used in determining whether the leaving time was a changeover time for the _head company_; and

                     (b)  making the additional assumptions in section 715-290.

Note:          If the leaving entity is a trust, it cannot have a changeover time (because Subdivision 165-CC applies only to companies), so section 715-95 applies to it instead: see subsection 715-95(2).

##### <a id="715-90"></a>715-90  How same business test applies if leaving time is changeover time for leaving company

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  the leaving entity is a company; and

                     (b)  the leaving time is a * changeover time for the leaving entity.

             (2)  The continuity period referred to in subsection 165-115B(3), as applying to the leaving time as a * changeover time for the leaving entity, is taken to have ended just _after_ that time.

Note:          This ensures that the same business test is applied to the business that the leaving entity carries on at the leaving time: see subsection 165-13(3).

##### <a id="715-95"></a>715-95  If ownership and control of leaving entity have _not_ changed since head company’s last changeover time

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  the leaving entity is a company; and

                     (b)  the leaving time is _not_ a * changeover time for the leaving entity; and

                     (c)  just before the leaving time, the * head company owned at least one * CGT asset:

                              (i)  that was a * 165-CC tagged asset just before the leaving time; and

                             (ii)  that it owned at the latest changeover time for the head company at or after the group came into existence and before the leaving time; and

                     (d)  at least one asset covered by paragraph (c) is an asset (a **_leaving asset_**) that becomes an asset of the leaving entity at the leaving time because subsection 701-1(1) (Single entity rule) ceases to apply to the entity; and

                     (e)  the head company’s * final RUNL at the leaving time is greater than nil.

             (2)  This section also applies if the leaving entity is a trust.

             (3)  If the * head company does _not_ satisfy the * same business test for:

                     (a)  the period (the **_same business test period_**) starting at the _earlier_ of:

                              (i)  the time 12 months before the leaving time; and

                             (ii)  when the head company came into existence;

                            and ending just before the leaving time; and

                     (b)  the time (the **_test time_**) just before the * changeover time;

the head company must make one of the choices for which sections 715-100, 715-105 and 715-110 provide.

For provisions about making one of these choices, 
 see sections 715-175 to 715-185.

##### <a id="715-100"></a>715-100  First choice: adjustable values of leaving assets reduced to nil

                   The first choice is to reduce the * adjustable value of each leaving asset to nil. The choice has effect accordingly, just before the leaving time. The * head company’s * final RUNL is _not_ reduced because of it.

Note:          The consequences of the choice are worked out under section 715-145.

##### <a id="715-105"></a>715-105  Second choice: head company’s final RUNL applied in reducing adjustable values of leaving assets that are loss assets

             (1)  The second choice is to reduce under this section the * adjustable value of each leaving asset (a **_loss asset_**) for which the * head company would have had a notional capital loss, or notional revenue loss, under section 165-115F at the time (the **_test time_**) just before the leaving time if the test time had been a * changeover time for the head company. The choice has effect accordingly.

Note:          The consequences of the choice are worked out under this section and section 715-145.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  2 or more entities cease to be * subsidiary members of the * consolidated group at the leaving time; and

                     (b)  2 or more of them make the second choice;

the choices have effect in whichever order the * head company determines.

             (3)  This section applies to each of the loss assets in order, according to their respective * adjustable values (apart from this section) at the test time: from largest to smallest. (If an asset has more than one such adjustable value, use the greater or greatest of them.)

             (4)  At the test time, the * adjustable value of the loss asset is reduced to the asset’s * market value at that time.

             (5)  However, if the * head company’s * final RUNL at the leaving time (as reduced by any previous reductions under this section) is _less than_ the difference between:

                     (a)  the * adjustable value of the loss asset (apart from this section) at the test time; and

                     (b)  the asset’s * market value at the test time;

the adjustable value is instead reduced at the test time by that final RUNL.

             (6)  That * final RUNL is reduced by the amount of the reduction under subsection (4) or (5). If 2 or more such reductions are made for the same asset (because it has 2 or more different characters), that final RUNL is reduced by the greater or greatest of the reductions.

##### <a id="715-110"></a>715-110  Third choice: loss denial pool of leaving entity created

             (1)  The third choice can be made only if every asset covered by paragraph 715-95(1)(c) is a leaving asset. The choice is to have a **_loss denial pool_** of the leaving entity created at the leaving time, consisting of every leaving asset. (To avoid doubt, the choice can be made even if the leaving entity is not a company.)

             (2)  A choice under this section has effect accordingly. The pool is distinct from any other loss denial pool of the leaving entity.

             (3)  When the pool is created, its **_loss denial balance_** is equal to the * head company’s * final RUNL at the leaving time.

Note:          If the head company makes this choice, the leaving entity can choose to cancel the loss denial pool by reducing reduced cost bases of assets in the pool: see section 715-185.

\[The next section is section 715-120.]

#### Effect of assets in loss denial pool of head company becoming assets of leaving entity

##### <a id="715-120"></a>715-120  What happens

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  at a particular time (the **_leaving time_**), an entity (the **_leaving entity_**) ceases to be a * subsidiary member of a * consolidated group; and

                     (b)  just before the leaving time, the * head company had a * loss denial pool; and

                     (c)  at the leaving time, at least one * CGT asset (a **_leaving asset_**) that was in the pool just before that time becomes a CGT asset of the leaving entity because subsection 701-1(1) (Single entity rule) ceases to apply to the entity;

             (2)  Each leaving asset leaves the * loss denial pool at the leaving time.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  the leaving entity is a company and the leaving time is _not_ a * changeover time for the leaving entity; or

                     (b)  the leaving entity is a trust;

the * head company must make one of the choices for which sections 715-125, 715-130 and 715-135 provide.

For provisions about making one of these choices, 
 see sections 715-175 to 715-185.

##### <a id="715-125"></a>715-125  First choice: adjustable values of leaving assets reduced to nil

                   The first choice is to reduce the * adjustable value of each leaving asset to nil. The choice has effect accordingly, just before the leaving time. The * loss denial balance of the * head company’s * loss denial pool is _not_ reduced because of it.

Note:          The consequences of the choice are worked out under section 715-145.

##### <a id="715-130"></a>715-130  Second choice: pool’s loss denial balance applied in reducing adjustable values of leaving assets that are loss assets

             (1)  The second choice is to reduce under this section the * adjustable value of each leaving asset (a **_loss asset_**) for which the * head company would have had a notional capital loss, or notional revenue loss, under section 165-115F at the time (the **_test time_**) just before the leaving time if the test time had been a * changeover time for the head company. The choice has effect accordingly.

Note:          The consequences of the choice are worked out under this section and section 715-145.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  2 or more entities cease to be * subsidiary members of the * consolidated group; and

                     (b)  2 or more of them make the second choice;

the choices have effect in the same order as the entities cease being subsidiary members. If 2 or more of the entities ceased at the same time, their choices have effect in whichever order the * head company determines.

             (3)  This section applies to each of the loss assets in order, according to their respective * adjustable values (apart from this section) at the test time: from largest to smallest. (If an asset has more than one such adjustable value, use the greater or greatest of them.)

             (4)  At the test time, the * adjustable value of the loss asset is reduced to the asset’s * market value at that time.

             (5)  However, if the * loss denial balance (as reduced by any previous reductions under this section or section 715-160) of the * head company’s * loss denial pool is _less than_ the difference between:

                     (a)  the * adjustable value of the loss asset (apart from this section) at the test time; and

                     (b)  the asset’s * market value at the test time;

the adjustable value is instead reduced at the test time by that loss denial balance.

             (6)  That * loss denial balance is reduced at the leaving time by the amount of the reduction under subsection (3) or (4). If 2 or more such reductions are made for the same asset (because it has 2 or more different characters), that loss denial balance is reduced by the greater or greatest of the reductions.

##### <a id="715-135"></a>715-135  Third choice: loss denial pool of leaving entity created

             (1)  The third choice can be made only if every asset that was in the * loss denial pool just before the leaving time is a leaving asset. The choice is to have a **_loss denial pool_** of the leaving entity created at the leaving time, consisting of every leaving asset. (To avoid doubt, the choice can be made even if the leaving entity is not a company.)

             (2)  A choice under this section has effect accordingly. The pool is distinct from any other loss denial pool of the leaving entity.

             (3)  When the leaving entity’s loss denial pool is created, its **_loss denial balance_** equals the loss denial balance of the head company’s loss denial pool (as reduced by any previous reductions under section 715-130 or 715-160).

Note:          If the head company makes this choice, the leaving entity can choose to cancel the loss denial pool by reducing reduced cost bases of assets in the pool: see section 715-185.

             (4)  The head company’s * loss denial pool ceases to exist when the leaving entity’s loss denial pool is created.

\[The next section is section 715-145.]

#### Effect of first and second choices on various kinds of assets

##### <a id="715-145"></a>715-145  Effect of choice on adjustable value of leaving asset

             (1)  This section has effect for the purposes of determining the consequences of a choice under any of sections 715-100, 715-105, 715-125, 715-130 and 715-185 (the **_choice provisions_**) for a leaving asset.

             (2)  The asset’s **_adjustable value_** at the time (the **_test time_**) just before the leaving time is worked out under this table. (If the asset is covered by 2 or more items, there are consequences for it under the choice provisions and this section in respect of each of the items.)

             (3)  If any of the choice provisions reduces at the test time the asset’s * adjustable value, the thing identified for the asset under the table in subsection (2) of this section is reduced by the same amount.

\[The next section is section 715-155.]

#### General provisions about loss denial pools

##### <a id="715-155"></a>715-155  When asset leaves pool

                   A * CGT asset leaves a * loss denial pool:

                     (a)  just after a * realisation event happens to the asset, unless the realisation event is the ending of an income year (in the case of an item of * trading stock); or

                     (b)  as mentioned in subsection 715-120(2) (when it becomes an asset of the leaving entity).

##### <a id="715-160"></a>715-160  How loss denial balance is applied to losses realised on assets in pool

             (1)  If, apart from this section, a loss would be * realised for income tax purposes by a * realisation event that happens to a * CGT asset when it is in a * loss denial pool of an entity, the loss is reduced by the lesser of:

                     (a)  the amount of the loss; and

                     (b)  the pool’s * loss denial balance (as reduced by any previous reductions under section 715-130 or this subsection);

and the loss denial balance is reduced by the same amount.

             (2)  Subsection (1) applies to * realisation events in the order in which they happen. If 2 or more happen at the same time, it applies to them in whichever order the entity determines.

             (3)  Subsection (1) reduces a * loss denial balance after section 715-130 does, unless the * realisation event happens _before_ the leaving time referred to in that section.

##### <a id="715-165"></a>715-165  When pool ceases to exist

             (1)  A * loss denial pool of a company ceases to exist when there is a * changeover time for the company.

Note:          The CGT assets in the pool then become subject to the application of Subdivision 165-CC (about change of ownership or control of a company that has an unrealised net loss).

             (2)  A * loss denial pool of any entity ceases to exist:

                     (a)  when there are no * CGT assets, and no * 170-D deferred losses, in the pool; or

                     (b)  just after the * loss denial balance becomes nil; or

                     (c)  when the entity becomes a * subsidiary member of a * consolidated group; or

                     (d)  as mentioned in subsection 715-135(4).

\[The next section is section 715-175.]

#### Choices under this Subdivision

##### <a id="715-175"></a>715-175  When choice must be made

             (1)  A choice under section 715-95 or 715-120 must be made within 6 months after the leaving time, or within a further period allowed by the Commissioner.

             (2)  After that 6 months, or that further period, the head company is taken to have made the first choice under section 715-100 or 715-125 unless it is established that the head company made a different choice within that 6 months or further period.

##### <a id="715-180"></a>715-180  Head company to notify leaving entity of choice

             (1)  Within one month after making a choice under section 715-95 or 715-120, or within a further period allowed by the Commissioner, the head company must give the leaving entity written notice of the choice.

             (2)  If the choice is to have a * loss denial pool of the leaving entity created at the leaving time, the notice must also specify the pool’s * loss denial balance at that time.

##### <a id="715-185"></a>715-185  Leaving entity may choose to cancel loss denial pool by reducing adjustable values of assets in the pool

             (1)  Within 6 months after a * loss denial pool is created under section 715-110 or 715-135, or within a further period allowed by the Commissioner, the leaving entity may choose to be treated as if the * head company had instead made:

                     (a)  the first choice under section 715-100 or 715-125; or

                     (b)  the second choice under section 715-105 or 715-130;

as specified by the leaving entity in its choice.

             (2)  If the leaving entity makes a choice under subsection (1):

                     (a)  the * loss denial pool ceases to exist just after the leaving time; and

                     (b)  at the leaving time, the * adjustable value of each * CGT asset in the pool is reduced to what it would have been at that time if the head company had instead made the choice specified by the leaving entity in its choice.

             (3)  The choice by the leaving entity does not affect how subsection 715-135(4) applies to the * head company.

Note:          This means that the head company’s loss denial pool still ceases to exist.

#### How Subdivision 165-CD applies to consolidated groups

##### <a id="715-215"></a>715-215  Extension of single entity rule and entry history rule

             (1)  Subsection 701-1(1) (Single entity rule) and section 701-5 (Entry history rule) also have effect for all the purposes of Subdivision 165-CD (about reductions after alterations in ownership or control of loss company).

Note:          One consequence of this is that the head company is the only member of a consolidated group that can have an alteration time and be subject to reductions or other consequences under Subdivision 165-CD. The head company is treated as owning all CGT assets owned by group members, and as making relevant losses.

                   Another consequence is for working out who has a relevant equity interest or relevant debt interest in a company that has an alteration time at which it is a loss company but not a member of a consolidated group. Interests in the loss company that are owned by subsidiary members of the group are treated as being owned by the head company.

             (2)  This section is not intended to limit the effect that subsection 701-1(1) and section 701-5 have apart from this section.

\[The next section is section 715-225.]

##### <a id="715-225"></a>715-225  Working out adjusted unrealised loss using individual asset method

             (1)  For the purposes of:

                     (a)  using the * individual asset method to work out whether the * head company of a * consolidated group has an adjusted unrealised loss under section 165-115U at an * alteration time; or

                     (b)  working out under section 165-115W whether the head company of a consolidated group has a trading stock decrease at an alteration time;

step 1 of the method statement in subsection 165-115U(1), or step 2 of the method statement in subsection 165-115W(1), does _not_ apply to an amount that was counted in respect of a * CGT asset at an earlier time if:

                     (c)  at the time (the **_joining time_**) when an entity became a * subsidiary member of the group, the asset became an asset of the head company because of subsection 701-1(1) (Single entity rule); and

                     (d)  the earlier time is an * alteration time that happened in respect of the entity before the joining time;

unless the entity is a chosen transitional entity under Division 701 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_.

Note:          If the joining entity is a chosen transitional entity, section 701-15 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_ prevents:

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>section 701-10 (cost to head company of assets that entity brings into group); and

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>subsection 701-35(4) (setting value of trading stock at tax-neutral amount);

                   of this Act from applying to the assets of the joining entity in relation to the joining time.

                   If the joining entity is _not_ a chosen transitional entity, it is assumed that the process of resetting the tax costs of its assets will bring their tax costs into closer alignment to their market values, and so remove the need to consider unrealised losses on those assets that existed before the joining time.

             (2)  This section has effect despite section 701-5 (Entry history rule).

##### <a id="715-230"></a>715-230  No reductions or other consequences for interests subject to loss cancellation under Subdivision 715-H

                   If section 715-610 reduces a loss that would otherwise be * realised for income tax purposes by a * realisation event that happens to an interest in, or a debt owed by, a company, sections 165-115ZA and 165-115ZB do not apply (and are taken never to have applied) to the interest or debt, in relation to an * alteration time that happened for the company during the ownership period referred to in subsection 715-610(2).

Note 1:       Section 715-610 is about cancelling a loss on a realisation event for a direct or indirect interest in a subsidiary member of a consolidated group.

Note 2:       Sections 165-115ZA and 165-115ZB are about the consequences that an alteration time for a loss company has for relevant equity interests and relevant debt interests in the company.

#### How Subdivision 165-CD applies to leaving entity that is a company

##### <a id="715-240"></a>715-240  Application of sections 715-245 to 715-260

                   Sections 715-245 to 715-260 affect how Subdivision 165-CD (about reductions after alterations in ownership or control of loss company) applies to a company (the **_leaving entity_**) at and after the time (the **_leaving time_**) when it ceases to be a * subsidiary member of a * consolidated group that came into existence at a particular time (the **_formation time_**).

Note:          If a trust ceases to be a subsidiary member of a consolidated group: see section 715-270.

##### <a id="715-245"></a>715-245  If ownership or control of leaving entity has altered since head company’s last alteration time or formation of group

             (1)  This section applies if the leaving time would be an * alteration time for the leaving entity if:

                     (a)  the reference time under subsection 165-115L(2) or 165-115M(2) were:

                              (i)  if at least one alteration time has occurred in relation to the * head company of the * consolidated group since the formation time and before the leaving time—the time just after the most recent such alteration time; or

                             (ii)  otherwise—the formation time; and

                     (b)  the additional assumptions in section 715-290 were made.

             (2)  The leaving time is an **_alteration time_** for the leaving entity.

Note:          One consequence of this is that the reference time for working out the leaving entity’s _next_ alteration time is the time just after the leaving time.

             (3)  The leaving entity is a **_loss company_** at that * alteration time if, and only if, it has an * adjusted unrealised loss at that time. If so, that adjusted unrealised loss is the leaving entity’s **_overall loss_** at that time.

Note 1:       Subsection (4) affects how the leaving entity works out its adjusted unrealised loss at the leaving time in some cases.

Note 2:       If the leaving entity is a loss company at the leaving time, section 715-255 provides for the consequences.

             (4)  If the leaving entity uses the * individual asset method of working out its * adjusted unrealised loss at that * alteration time, then for the purposes of:

                     (a)  step 1 of the method statement in subsection 165-115U(1); and

                     (b)  the method statement in subsection 165-115W(1);

the leaving entity is taken to have had no earlier alteration time.

##### <a id="715-250"></a>715-250  If head company has had an alteration time but ownership and control of leaving entity have not altered since

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  at least one * alteration time has occurred in relation to the * head company of the * consolidated group since the formation time and before the leaving time; and

                     (b)  the leaving time is _not_ an * alteration time for the leaving entity under subsection 715-245(2).

             (2)  The leaving time is an **_alteration time_** for the leaving entity.

             (3)  However, for the purposes of determining when the leaving entity’s _next_ * alteration time happens, the reference time under subsection 165-115L(2) or 165-115M(2) is the time just after the most recent alteration time for the * head company _before_ the leaving time.

             (4)  The leaving entity is a **_loss company_** at the leaving time if, and only if, the * head company would have had an * adjusted unrealised loss at the most recent * alteration time (the **_head company alteration time_**) for the head company before the leaving time if that adjusted unrealised loss (if any) were worked out on the basis that:

                     (a)  the head company chooses whether the * individual asset method or the * global method is used; and

                     (b)  a * CGT asset is taken into account only if:

                              (i)  the head company owned it at the head company alteration time; and

                             (ii)  it becomes a CGT asset of the leaving entity at the leaving time because subsection 701-1(1) (the single entity rule) ceases to apply to the entity; and

                     (c)  if the individual asset method is used, then for the purposes of:

                              (i)  step 1 of the method statement in subsection 165-115U(1); and

                             (ii)  the method statement in subsection 165-115W(1);

                            the head company had no earlier alteration time.

             (5)  If the leaving entity is a * loss company at the leaving time, its **_overall loss_** at that time is the * adjusted unrealised loss worked out under subsection (4).

##### <a id="715-255"></a>715-255  Consequences if leaving entity is a loss company at the leaving time

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  section 715-245 or 715-250 applies; and

                     (b)  the leaving entity is a * loss company at the leaving time;

the head company must choose whether subsection (2) or (3) of this section has effect for the purposes of applying, to each * membership interest in the leaving entity, in relation to the time just before the leaving time, whichever of these provisions is appropriate:

                     (c)  subsection 701-55(3) (about trading stock);

                     (d)  subsection 701-55(5), but only so far as it relates to working out the * reduced cost base of a * membership interest that was * acquired on or after 20 September 1985;

                     (e)  subsection 701-55(6) (about revenue assets).

Note:          Section 701-55 is about setting the tax cost of an asset.

             (2)  If the * head company chooses this subsection, the interest’s * tax cost setting amount (apart from this section) just before the leaving time is reduced to nil.

             (3)  If the * head company chooses this subsection, the interest’s * tax cost setting amount (apart from this section) just before the leaving time is reduced by the adjustment amount under section 165-115ZB, which is calculated on the basis that:

                     (a)  just before the leaving time, all the * membership interests in the leaving entity constituted a single relevant equity interest under section 165-115X that the head company had in the leaving entity; and

                     (b)  the adjustment amount is worked out and applied in accordance with subsection 165-115ZB(6), but disregarding the paragraphs of that subsection except paragraphs 165-115ZB(6)(a) and (d).

             (4)  The * head company’s choice must be made within 6 months after the leaving time, or within a further period allowed by the Commissioner.

             (5)  After that 6 months, or that further period, the head company is taken to have chosen subsection (2) unless it is established that the head company made a different choice within that 6 months or further period.

Rights and options to acquire membership interests

             (6)  Subsection 711-15(2) (which treats rights and options as membership interests) also applies for the purposes of this section, on the basis that the * consolidated group referred to in section 715-240 is the old group referred to in that subsection.

##### <a id="715-260"></a>715-260  If neither of sections 715-245 and 715-250 applies

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  no * alteration time has occurred in relation to the * head company of the * consolidated group since the formation time and before the leaving time; and

                     (b)  the leaving time is _not_ an * alteration time for the leaving entity under subsection 715-245(2).

             (2)  The leaving entity’s first * alteration time after the leaving time is determined:

                     (a)  on the basis that the reference time under subsection 165-115L(2) or 165-115M(2) is the time just after the formation time; and

                     (b)  making the additional assumptions in section 715-290.

             (3)  If the leaving entity uses the * individual asset method of working out its * adjusted unrealised loss at that first * alteration time, then for the purposes of:

                     (a)  step 1 of the method statement in subsection 165-115U(1); and

                     (b)  the method statement in subsection 165-115W(1);

the leaving entity is taken to have had no earlier alteration time.

\[The next section is section 715-270.]

#### How Subdivision 165-CD applies to leaving entity that is a trust

##### <a id="715-270"></a>715-270  Subdivision 165-CD applies

             (1)  At and after the time (the **_leaving time_**) when a trust ceases to be a * subsidiary member of a * consolidated group, Subdivision 165-CD (about reductions after alterations in ownership or control of loss company) applies to the trust on the basis set out in this section.

             (2)  The trust is taken to be a company.

             (3)  The leaving time is the only **_alteration time_** in respect of the trust.

             (4)  The trust is a **_loss company_** at that time if, and only if, it has an * adjusted unrealised loss at that time. If so, that adjusted unrealised loss is its **_overall loss_** at that time.

             (5)  If the trust is a * loss company at the leaving time, the * head company must choose whether subsection (6) or (7) of this section has effect for the purposes of applying, to each * membership interest in the trust, in relation to the time just before the leaving time, whichever of these provisions is appropriate:

                     (c)  subsection 701-55(3) (about trading stock);

                     (d)  subsection 701-55(5), but only so far as it relates to working out the * reduced cost base of a * membership interest that was * acquired on or after 20 September 1985;

                     (e)  subsection 701-55(6) (about revenue assets).

Note:          Section 701-55 is about setting the tax cost of an asset.

             (6)  If the * head company chooses this subsection, the interest’s * tax cost setting amount (apart from this section) just before the leaving time is reduced to nil.

             (7)  If the * head company chooses this subsection, the interest’s * tax cost setting amount (apart from this section) just before the leaving time is reduced by the adjustment amount under section 165-115ZB, which is calculated on the basis that:

                     (a)  just before the leaving time:

                              (i)  all the * membership interests in the leaving entity constituted a single relevant equity interest under section 165-115X that the * head company had in the leaving entity; and

                             (ii)  each of those interests was an equity under section 165-115X that the * head company had in the leaving entity; and

                     (b)  the adjustment amount is worked out and applied in accordance with subsection 165-115ZB(6), but disregarding the paragraphs of that subsection except paragraphs 165-115ZB(6)(a) and (d).

             (8)  The * head company’s choice must be made within 6 months after the leaving time, or within a further period allowed by the Commissioner.

             (9)  After that 6 months, or that further period, the head company is taken to have chosen subsection (6) unless it is established that the head company made a different choice within that 6 months or further period.

Rights and options to acquire membership interests

           (10)  Subsection 711-15(2) (which treats rights and options as membership interests) also applies for the purposes of this section, on the basis that the * consolidated group is the old group referred to in that subsection.

#### Subdivision 715-C—Common rules for the purposes of Subdivisions 715-A and 715-B

##### <a id="715-290"></a>715-290  Additional assumptions to be made when using reference time

                   The additional assumptions to be made are that, throughout the period starting at the reference time and ending just before the leaving time:

                     (a)  the leaving entity was in existence; and

                     (b)  the * head company held and beneficially owned all the * membership interests in the leaving entity (instead of whoever actually did); and

                     (c)  those membership interests remained the same; and

                     (d)  the head company directly controlled the voting power in the leaving entity.

**Table of sections**

Key terminology

715-310    What is a 170-D deferred loss, and when it revives

Deferred loss on 165-CC tagged asset

#### Key terminology

##### <a id="715-310"></a>715-310  What is a _170-D deferred loss_, and when it _revives_

             (1)  A * capital loss, deduction, or partner’s share of a deduction, that section 170-270 (about transactions within linked groups) requires to be disregarded is a **_170-D deferred loss_** made:

                     (a)  by the company that paragraph 170-255(1)(a) refers to as the originating company; and

                     (b)  at the time of the event that paragraph refers to as the deferral event; and

                     (c)  on the * CGT asset * acquired by the other entity referred to in that paragraph.

             (2)  The * 170-D deferred loss **_revives_** at the time when section 170-275 (as applying in relation to the deferral event) treats the originating company as having made a * capital loss, or having become entitled to a deduction, in respect of that asset.

\[The next section is section 715-355.]

#### Deferred loss on 165-CC tagged asset

##### <a id="715-355"></a>715-355  Head company’s own deferred losses at formation time

             (1)  This section applies if, at the time (the **_formation time_**) when a * consolidated group comes into existence, the * head company has (otherwise than because of section 701-5 (Entry history rule)) a * 170-D deferred loss that:

                     (a)  it made on a * CGT asset that is a * 165-CC tagged asset of the head company because of paragraph 165-115A(1A)(b) (which covers CGT assets on which it has 170-D deferred losses); and

                     (b)  has not * revived.

             (2)  If a * loss denial pool of the * head company is created under section 715-60 at the formation time, each * 170-D deferred loss of that kind that the head company has at that time is added to the loss denial pool at that time.

             (3)  Otherwise, a **_loss denial pool_** of the * head company is created at the formation time if:

                     (a)  the formation time is _not_ a * changeover time for the head company; and

                     (b)  the head company’s * final RUNL just before the formation time (as reduced by any reductions under section 715-50 or 715-55) was greater than nil; and

                     (c)  the head company does _not_ satisfy the * same business test for:

                              (i)  the period (the **_same business test period_**) consisting of the head company’s * trial year; and

                             (ii)  the time (the **_test time_**) just before the * changeover time.

Note:          Paragraph (3)(b) has the effect that if the head company has 165-CC tagged assets that are affected by section 715-50 or 715-55 (because they are membership interests in, or accounting liabilities owed by, another group member), those sections are applied before this section.

             (4)  When it is created because of subsection (3), the pool consists of each * 170-D deferred loss covered by subsection (2), and its **_loss denial balance_** is equal to the * final RUNL referred to in paragraph (3)(b).

Note:          The pool is distinct from any other loss denial pool of the head company, for example, one created at the formation time under section 715-360.

##### <a id="715-360"></a>715-360  Deferred losses brought in by subsidiary member

             (1)  This section applies if, just before the time (the **_membership time_**) when a company (the **_deferred loss company_**) becomes a * subsidiary member of a * consolidated group, it had a * 170-D deferred loss that:

                     (a)  it made on a * CGT asset that is a * 165-CC tagged asset of the company at the membership time because of paragraph 165-115A(1A)(b) (which covers CGT assets on which it has 170-D deferred losses); and

                     (b)  as at the membership time has not * revived.

             (2)  If a * loss denial pool of the * head company is created under subsection 715-70(2) because of the deferred loss company becoming a * subsidiary member of the group, each * 170-D deferred loss of that kind that the deferred loss company had just before the membership time is added to the loss denial pool at that time.

             (3)  Otherwise, a **_loss denial pool_** of the * head company is created at the membership time if:

                     (a)  the membership time is _not_ a * changeover time for the head company; and

                     (b)  the deferred loss company’s * final RUNL just before the membership time (as reduced by any reductions under section 715-50 or 715-55) was greater than nil; and

                     (c)  the deferred loss company does _not_ satisfy the * same business test for:

                              (i)  the period (the **_same business test period_**) consisting of the deferred loss company’s * trial year; and

                             (ii)  the time (the **_test time_**) just before the * changeover time.

Note 1:       The 170-D deferred losses become those of the head company at the formation time because of section 701-5 (Entry history rule).

Note 2:       Paragraph (3)(b) has the effect that if the deferred loss company has other 165-CC tagged assets affected by section 715-50 or 715-55 (because the membership time is when the group comes into existence, and the other 165-CC tagged assets are membership interests in, or accounting liabilities owed by, another group member), those sections are applied before this section.

             (4)  When it is created because of subsection (3), the pool consists of each 170-D deferred loss covered by subsection (2), and its **_loss denial balance_** is equal to the * final RUNL referred to in paragraph (3)(b).

Note:          The pool is distinct from any other loss denial pool of the head company, for example, one created under this section because another entity becomes a subsidiary member of the group at the membership time.

##### <a id="715-365"></a>715-365  How loss denial balance is applied when 170-D deferred loss revives

             (1)  If a * 170-D deferred loss on a * CGT asset is in a * loss denial pool of an entity when the loss * revives, the * capital loss or deduction that section 170-275 would, apart from this section, treat the entity as having made or become entitled to at that time in respect of the asset is reduced by the lesser of:

                     (a)  the amount of the capital loss or deduction; and

                     (b)  the pool’s * loss denial balance (as reduced by any previous reductions under section 715-130, subsection 715-160(1) or this subsection);

and the loss denial balance is reduced by the same amount.

             (2)  Subsection (1) applies to * 170-D deferred losses in the order in which they * revive. If 2 or more revive at the same time, it applies to them in whichever order the entity determines.

             (3)  Subsection (1) reduces a * loss denial balance before section 715-130 does, unless the * realisation event happens _after_ the leaving time referred to in that section.

\[The next Subdivision is Subdivision 715-G.]

#### Subdivision 715-G—How value shifting rules apply to a consolidated group

**Table of sections**

715-410    Extension of single entity rule and entry history rule

715-450    No reductions or other consequences for interests subject to loss cancellation under Subdivision 715-H

##### <a id="715-410"></a>715-410  Extension of single entity rule and entry history rule

             (1)  Subsection 701-1(1) (Single entity rule) and section 701-5 (Entry history rule) also have effect for all the purposes of Part 3-95 (Value shifting).

Note:          One consequence of this for the operation of Division 727 (about indirect value shifting affecting interests in companies and trusts, and arising from non-arm’s length dealings) is that economic benefits provided by or to a subsidiary member of a consolidated group are treated as provided by or to the head company of the group. As a result:

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>the head company is the only group member that can be a losing entity or gaining entity for an indirect value shift; and

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>economic benefits provided by one group member to another are treated as provided by the head company to itself, and so have no relevance to Division 727.

                   Another consequence is that the head company is treated as owning all interests owned by group members in a losing entity or gaining entity that is not a group member.

             (2)  This section is not intended to limit the effect that subsection 701-1(1) and section 701-5 have apart from this section.

\[The next section is section 715-450.]

##### <a id="715-450"></a>715-450  No reductions or other consequences for interests subject to loss cancellation under Subdivision 715-H

                   If section 715-610 reduces a loss that would otherwise be * realised for income tax purposes by a * realisation event that happens to an * equity or loan interest in an entity:

                     (a)  the loss is not subject to reduction under Division 723 (Direct value shifting by creating right over non-depreciating asset) or 727 (Indirect value shifting); and

                     (b)  the interest’s * adjustable value is not, and is taken never to have been, reduced under Division 725 because of a * direct value shift during the ownership period referred to in subsection 715-610(2); and

                     (c)  the interest’s * adjustable value is not, and is taken never to have been, reduced under Division 727 because of an * indirect value shift during that period.

Note:          Section 715-610 is about cancelling a loss on a realisation event for a direct or indirect interest in a subsidiary member of a consolidated group.

#### Subdivision 715-H—Cancelling loss on realisation event for direct or indirect interest in a subsidiary member of a consolidated group

**Table of sections**

715-610    Cancellation of loss

715-615    Exception for interests in entity leaving consolidated group

715-620    Exception if loss attributable to certain matters

##### <a id="715-610"></a>715-610  Cancellation of loss

             (1)  This section reduces to nil a loss that would otherwise be * realised for income tax purposes by a * realisation event that happens to an * equity or loan interest (the **_realised interest_**) in an entity (the **_first entity_**) when it is owned by another entity (the **_owner_**), if the conditions in subsections (2) and (4) are met.

             (2)  The first condition is that, at some time during the period (the **_ownership period_**) when the owner owned the realised interest:

                     (a)  the first entity was a * subsidiary member of a * consolidated group, and the owner was _not_ a * member of the group; or

                     (b)  the realised interest was an * external indirect equity or loan interest in a subsidiary member of a consolidated group; or

                     (c)  the realised interest was an * equity or loan interest in an entity that, at that time:

                              (i)  owned an equity or loan interest in a subsidiary member of a consolidated group; and

                             (ii)  was _not_ a member of the group; or

                     (d)  the realised interest was an * equity or loan interest in an entity that owned at that time an external indirect equity or loan interest in a subsidiary member of a consolidated group.

             (3)  An * equity or loan interest in an entity (the **_test entity_**) is an **_external indirect equity or loan interest_** in a * subsidiary member of a * consolidated group if, and only if, neither the owner of the interest nor the test entity is a member of the group and:

                     (a)  the test entity owns an equity or loan interest in the subsidiary member; or

                     (b)  the test entity owns an equity or loan interest that is an external indirect equity or loan interest in the subsidiary member because of one or more other applications of this subsection.

             (4)  The second condition is that, at the same or a different time during the ownership period:

                     (a)  the owner was, or * controlled (for value shifting purposes), the * head company of a * consolidated group because of which the first condition is satisfied; or

                     (b)  the owner was an * associate of an entity that, at the same or a different time during the ownership period, was, or controlled (for value shifting purposes), the head company of such a consolidated group.

##### <a id="715-615"></a>715-615  Exception for interests in entity leaving consolidated group

Membership interests in leaving entity

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  the realised interest is a * membership interest; and

                     (b)  during the ownership period the first entity ceased to be a * subsidiary member of a * consolidated group;

the first condition in section 715-610 cannot be satisfied, because of that consolidated group, at a time when the first entity was a member of the group, unless the interest needed to be disregarded under section 703-35 (about employee shares) in order for the first entity to be a member of the group at that time.

Liabilities owed by leaving entity

             (2)  If the realised interest:

                     (a)  consists of a liability owed by the first entity to the owner; and

                     (b)  became an asset of the owner because subsection 701-1(1) (the single entity rule) ceased to apply to the first entity when it ceased to be a * subsidiary member of a * consolidated group;

the first condition in section 715-610 cannot be satisfied, because of that consolidated group, at a time when the first entity was a member of the group.

##### <a id="715-620"></a>715-620  Exception if loss attributable to certain matters

             (1)  The loss is not reduced if all of it can be shown to be attributable to things other than these:

                     (a)  something that would be reflected in what would, apart from this Part, be an overall loss under section 165-115R or 165-115S, of a * member of a * consolidated group (an **_excluded group_**) because of which the first condition in section 715-610 is satisfied, at an * alteration time for that member;

                     (b)  an * indirect value shift for which, apart from this Part, a member of an excluded group would be the * losing entity or the * gaining entity.

             (2)  If only part of the loss can be shown to be attributable to things other than the ones listed in subsection (1), the loss is reduced to the amount of that part.

##### <a id="719-700"></a>719-700  Changeover times under section 165-115C or 165-115D

             (1)  This section has effect for the purposes of determining whether a time (the **_test time_**) is a * changeover time under section 165-115C (about changes in ownership) or 165-115D (about changes in control) in respect of the * head company of a * MEC group.

Modified meaning of**reference time**

             (2)  The **_reference time_** is:

                     (a)  if no * changeover time has occurred in respect of the head company since the group came into existence and before the test time—when the group came into existence; or

                     (b)  otherwise—the time just after the last such changeover time.

             (3)  Subsection (2) of this section has effect despite subsection 165-115A(2A).

Assumptions to make

             (4)  Assume that, while the * MEC group exists:

                     (a)  the * top company for the group holds and beneficially owns all the * membership interests in the * head company (instead of whoever actually does); and

                     (b)  those membership interests remain the same; and

                     (c)  the top company directly controls the voting power in the head company.

##### <a id="719-705"></a>719-705  Additional changeover times for head company of MEC group

             (1)  The time when a * potential MEC group ceases to exist is a **_changeover time_** in respect of the * head company of a * MEC group if, just before that time, the potential MEC group’s membership was the same as the membership of the MEC group.

Note:          The changeover times in subsections (1), (2) and (3) are based on the events described in subsections 719-280(2), (3) and (4), each of which causes the test company referred to in section 719-280 to be assumed to fail the continuity of ownership test in section 165-12.

             (2)  If something:

                     (a)  happens at a time in relation to * membership interests in one or more of these entities:

                              (i)  a company that was just before that time a * member of a * MEC group and an * eligible tier-1 company of the * top company for the MEC group;

                             (ii)  an entity interposed between a company described in subparagraph (i) and the company that was the top company for the group just before that time; and

                     (b)  does not cause the * potential MEC group whose membership is the same as the membership of the MEC group to cease to exist, but does cause a change in the identity of the top company for the potential MEC group;

that time is a **_changeover time_** in respect of the * head company of the * MEC group.

             (3)  The time when a * MEC group ceases to exist because there ceases to be a * provisional head company of the group is a **_changeover time_** in respect of the * head company of the * MEC group.

#### How Subdivision 165-CD applies to MEC groups

##### <a id="719-720"></a>719-720  Alteration times under section 165-115L or 165-115M

             (1)  This section has effect for the purposes of determining whether a time (the **_test time_**) is an * alteration time under section 165-115L (about alterations in ownership) or 165-115M (about alterations in control) in respect of the * head company of a * MEC group.

Modified meaning of**reference time**

             (2)  The **_reference time_** is:

                     (a)  if no * alteration time has occurred in respect of the head company since the group came into existence and before the test time—when the group came into existence; or

                     (b)  otherwise—the time just after the last such alteration time.

             (3)  In applying subsection (2), disregard an * alteration time arising under subsection 719-725(4).

             (4)  Subsection (2) of this section has effect despite subsections 165-115L(2) and 165-115M(2).

Assumptions to make

             (5)  Assume that, while the * MEC group exists:

                     (a)  the * top company for the group holds and beneficially owns all the * membership interests in the * head company (instead of whoever actually does); and

                     (b)  those membership interests remain the same; and

                     (c)  the top company directly controls the voting power in the head company.

##### <a id="719-725"></a>719-725  Additional alteration times for head company of MEC group

Additional alteration times based on section 719-280

             (1)  The time when a * potential MEC group ceases to exist is an **_alteration time_** in respect of the * head company of a * MEC group if, just before that time, the potential MEC group’s membership was the same as the membership of the MEC group.

Note:          The alteration times in subsections (1), (2) and (3) are based on the events described in subsections 719-280(2), (3) and (4), each of which causes the test company referred to in section 719-280 to be assumed to fail the continuity of ownership test in section 165-12.

             (2)  If something:

                     (a)  happens at a time in relation to * membership interests in one or more of these entities:

                              (i)  a company that was just before that time a * member of a * MEC group and an * eligible tier-1 company of the * top company for the MEC group;

                             (ii)  an entity interposed between a company described in subparagraph (i) and the company that was the top company for the group just before that time; and

                     (b)  does not cause the * potential MEC group whose membership is the same as the membership of the MEC group to cease to exist, but does cause a change in the identity of the top company for the potential MEC group;

that time is an **_alteration time_** in respect of the * head company of the * MEC group.

             (3)  The time when a * MEC group ceases to exist because there ceases to be a * provisional head company of the group is an **_alteration time_** in respect of the * head company of the * MEC group.

Additional alteration times based on Subdivision 719-K

             (4)  If Subdivision 719-K (MEC group cost setting rules: pooling cases) applies, the time just before the trigger time referred to in paragraph 719-555(1)(a) is an **_alteration time_** in respect of the * head company of the * MEC group.

##### <a id="719-730"></a>719-730  Some alteration times only affect interests in top company

             (1)  This section applies if an * alteration time (except one arising under subsection 719-725(4)) happens for the * head company of a * MEC group.

             (2)  Sections 165-115ZA and 165-115ZB apply, in relation to the alteration time, to an interest or debt that is, or is part of, a relevant equity interest or relevant debt interest that an entity has in the * head company just before the * alteration time, _only if_ the interest or debt is:

                     (a)  an * equity or loan interest in the * top company for the MEC group; or

                     (b)  an * indirect equity or loan interest in the top company.

Note:          Sections 165-115ZA and 165-115ZB are about the consequences that an alteration time for a loss company has for relevant equity interests and relevant debt interests in the company.

             (3)  In determining what is a relevant equity interest or relevant debt interest that an entity has in the * head company just before the * alteration time, make the assumptions in subsection 719-720(5).

##### <a id="719-735"></a>719-735  Some alteration times affect only pooled interests

             (1)  Sections 165-115ZA and 165-115ZB do not apply in relation to an * alteration time that happens for the * head company of a * MEC group because of subsection 719-725(4) (trigger time for MEC group cost setting rules: pooling cases).

             (2)  Instead, Subdivision 719-K applies to the * MEC group, in relation to the trigger time, on the basis that:

                     (a)  what would, apart from this section, be the pooled cost amount for the purposes of the formulas in subsections 719-570(1) and (2) is reduced by the amount of the * head company’s overall loss under section 165-115R or 165-115S at that alteration time; but

                     (b)  paragraph (a) of this subsection _only_ affects the application of those formulas because of subsection 719-570(3) (to work out the * reduced cost base of a * membership interest).

\[The next section is section 719-755.]

#### How indirect value shifting rules apply to a MEC group

##### <a id="719-755"></a>719-755  Effect on MEC group cost setting rules if head company is losing entity or gaining entity for indirect value shift

             (1)  This section has effect for the purposes of working out the consequences (if any) of an * indirect value shift if the * losing entity or * gaining entity is the * head company of a * MEC group. (Subsection (3) has effect in addition to section 727-455.)

             (2)  An * equity or loan interest can be an * affected interest in the * head company only if it is:

                     (a)  an * equity or loan interest in the * top company for the MEC group; or

                     (b)  an * indirect equity or loan interest in the top company.

             (3)  Subdivision 719-K (MEC group cost setting rules: pooling cases) applies to the * MEC group, in relation to the first time referred to in that Subdivision as a trigger time that happens at or after the * IVS time, on the basis that:

                     (a)  what would, apart from this section, be the pooled cost amount for the purposes of the formulas in subsections 719-570(1) and (2) is:

                              (i)  if the * head company is the * losing entity—reduced; or

                             (ii)  if the head company is the gaining entity—increased;

                            by the amount of the indirect value shift; and

                     (b)  paragraph (a) of this subsection also affects the application of those formulas because of subsection 719-570(3) (to work out the * reduced cost base of a * membership interest).

\[The next section is section 719-775.]

#### Cancelling loss on realisation event for direct or indirect interest in a subsidiary member of a MEC group

##### <a id="719-775"></a>719-775  Cancellation of loss

             (1)  This section reduces to nil a loss that would otherwise be * realised for income tax purposes by a * realisation event that happens to an * equity or loan interest (the **_realised interest_**) in an entity (the **_first entity_**) when it is owned by another entity (the **_owner_**), if the conditions in subsections (2) and (4) are met.

             (2)  The first condition is that, at some time during the period (the **_ownership period_**) when the owner owned the realised interest:

                     (a)  the first entity was a * subsidiary member of a * MEC group (except an * eligible tier-1 company), and the owner was _not_ a * member of the group; or

                     (b)  the realised interest was an * external indirect equity or loan interest in a subsidiary member of a MEC group (except an eligible tier-1 company); or

                     (c)  the realised interest was an * equity or loan interest in an entity that, at that time:

                              (i)  owned an equity or loan interest in a subsidiary member of a MEC group (except an eligible tier-1 company); and

                             (ii)  was _not_ a member of the group; or

                     (d)  the realised interest was an equity or loan interest in an entity that owned at that time an external indirect equity or loan interest in a subsidiary member of a MEC group (except an eligible tier-1 company); or

                     (e)  the realised interest was an equity or loan interest, or an * indirect equity or loan interest, in an eligible tier-1 company that was a member of a MEC group at that time.

             (3)  An * equity or loan interest in an entity (the **_test entity_**) is an **_external indirect equity or loan interest_** in a * subsidiary member of a * MEC group if, and only if, neither the owner of the interest nor the test entity is a member of the group and:

                     (a)  the test entity owns an equity or loan interest in the subsidiary member; or

                     (b)  the test entity owns an equity or loan interest that is an external indirect equity or loan interest in the subsidiary member because of one or more other applications of this subsection.

             (4)  The second condition is that, at the same or a different time during the ownership period:

                     (a)  the owner was, or * controlled (for value shifting purposes), the * head company of a * MEC group because of which the first condition is satisfied; or

                     (b)  the owner was an * associate of an entity that, at the same or a different time during the ownership period, was, or controlled (for value shifting purposes), the head company of such a MEC group.

##### <a id="719-780"></a>719-780  Exception for pooled interests in eligible tier-1 companies

                   The first condition in section 719-775 cannot be satisfied, because of a * MEC group, at a time when the realised interest was a * pooled interest in an * eligible tier-1 company that is a member of the group.

##### <a id="719-785"></a>719-785  Exception for interests in top company

                   The first condition in section 719-775 cannot be satisfied, because of a * MEC group, at a time when:

                     (a)  the first entity was the * top company for the MEC group; or

                     (b)  the realised interest was an * indirect equity or loan interest in the top company for the MEC group.

##### <a id="719-790"></a>719-790  Exception for interests in entity leaving MEC group

Membership interests in leaving entity

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  the realised interest is a * membership interest; and

                     (b)  during the ownership period the first entity ceased to be a * subsidiary member of a * MEC group;

the first condition in section 719-775 cannot be satisfied, because of that MEC group, at a time when the first entity was a member of the group, unless the interest needed to be disregarded under section 719-30 (about employee shares) in order for the first entity to be a member of the group at that time.

Liabilities owed by leaving entity

             (2)  If the realised interest:

                     (a)  consists of a liability owed by the first entity to the owner; and

                     (b)  became an asset of the owner because subsection 701-1(1) (the single entity rule) ceased to apply to the first entity when it ceased to be a * subsidiary member of a * MEC group;

the first condition in section 719-775 cannot be satisfied, because of that MEC group, at a time when the first entity was a member of the group.

##### <a id="719-795"></a>719-795  Exception if loss attributable to certain matters

             (1)  The loss is not reduced if all of it can be shown to be attributable to things other than these:

                     (a)  something that would be reflected in what would, apart from this Part, be an overall loss under section 165-115R or 165-115S, of a * member of a * MEC group (an **_excluded group_**) because of which the first condition in section 719-775 is satisfied, at an * alteration time for that member;

                     (b)  an * indirect value shift for which, apart from this Part, a member of an excluded group would be the * losing entity or the * gaining entity.

             (2)  If only part of the loss can be shown to be attributable to things other than the ones listed in subsection (1), the loss is reduced to the amount of that part.

#### Object

##### <a id="717-505"></a>717-505  Object of this Subdivision

             (1)  The object of this Subdivision is to affect the operation of Subdivision B of Division 11A of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ so that each * consolidated group operates a single * foreign dividend account, by ensuring that:

                     (a)  an * FDA credit and an * FDA debit arise so that:

                              (i)  the balance of the foreign dividend account of the * head company of the group reflects the balance of the foreign dividend account of a company that becomes a * subsidiary member of the group; and

                             (ii)  the balance of the foreign dividend account of the subsidiary member of the group is nil; and

                     (b)  the head company is the only * member of the group that can have an * FDA surplus; and

                     (c)  the head company can make an * FDA declaration relating to a dividend (within the meaning of that Subdivision) or * non-share dividend paid by any member of the group.

             (2)  In this Act:

                    <a name="fda-crite"></a>**_FDA credit_** has the same meaning as in Subdivision B of Division 11A of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

                    <a name="fda-debit"></a>**_FDA debit_** has the same meaning as in Subdivision B of Division 11A of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

                    <a name="fda-declar"></a>**_FDA declaration_** has the same meaning as in Subdivision B of Division 11A of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

                    <a name="fda-surplu"></a>**_FDA surplus_** has the same meaning as in Subdivision B of Division 11A of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

                    <a name="foreign-dividend-account"></a>**_foreign dividend account_** has the same meaning as in Subdivision B of Division 11A of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

#### Treatment of foreign dividend accounts around joining time

##### <a id="717-510"></a>717-510  No FDA surplus for joining company

             (1)  This section operates for the purposes of Subdivision B of Division 11A of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ if a company (the **_joining company_**) becomes a * subsidiary member of a * consolidated group at a time (the **_joining time_**) just after another time (the **_balance time_**).

             (2)  If the joining company has an * FDA surplus at the balance time:

                     (a)  an * FDA debit equal to the FDA surplus arises for the joining company at the balance time; and

                     (b)  an * FDA credit equal to the FDA surplus arises for the * head company of the group at the joining time.

             (3)  If the joining company’s total * FDA debits arising before the balance time exceed its total * FDA credits arising before the balance time:

                     (a)  an FDA credit equal to the excess arises for the joining company at the balance time; and

                     (b)  an FDA debit equal to the excess arises for the * head company of the group at the joining time.

             (4)  For the purposes of subsections (2) and (3) of this section, work out whether, when, and how much (if any) of, an * FDA debit arises for the joining company under paragraph 128TB(1)(d) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ in relation to the income year that actually includes the balance time as if that income year:

                     (a)  started at:

                              (i)  the start of that income year; or

                             (ii)  if the joining company ceased to be a * subsidiary member of a * consolidated group after the start of that income year but before the balance time—the time the joining company last ceased to be a subsidiary member of a consolidated group before the balance time; and

                     (b)  ended just before the balance time.

Note:          This ensures that the FDA debit (if any) for the joining company under paragraph 128TB(1)(d) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ arises just before the balance time, so that it is taken into account for the purposes of subsections (2) and (3) of this section.

#### Single entity rule for foreign dividend accounts

##### <a id="717-515"></a>717-515  Single entity rule for FDA credits and FDA debits

                   If a company is a * subsidiary member of a * consolidated group for any period, it and any other subsidiary member of the group are taken for the purposes of sections 128TA and 128TB of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ to be parts of the * head company of the group, rather than separate entities, during that period.

Note 1:       This has the effect that:

(a)           FDA credits and FDA debits arise under sections 128TA and 128TB (respectively) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ for the head company of a consolidated group but not for a subsidiary member of the group; and

(b)           the shareholdings of all members of a consolidated group are aggregated to work out whether dividends paid to a member are non-portfolio dividends for the purposes of those sections.

Note 2:       Section 717-10 may also affect FDA credits and FDA debits for the head company of a consolidated group. It treats the head company as having paid and been personally liable for foreign tax on foreign income included in its assessable income if a subsidiary member of the group actually paid and was personally liable for the tax.

#### FDA declaration for dividend paid by subsidiary member

##### <a id="717-520"></a>717-520  Head company may make FDA declaration

             (1)  This section operates if:

                     (a)  on a day, a company that is a * subsidiary member of a * consolidated group pays dividends (within the meaning of Subdivision B of Division 11A of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) to shareholders (within the meaning of that Act) in respect of * shares in the company; and

                     (b)  on the day, there is an * FDA surplus for the * head company of the consolidated group.

             (2)  The * head company may make an * FDA declaration specifying an * FDA declaration percentage under subsection 128TC(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ as if the head company were paying the dividends.

Note:          If the head company makes an FDA declaration:

(a)           an FDA debit equal to the sum of the FDA declaration amounts worked out for the dividends by reference to the FDA declaration percentage will arise for the head company just after the start of the day under section 128TB of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; and

(b)           foreign resident shareholders in the subsidiary member will be relieved from withholding tax on amounts of the dividends not exceeding the FDA declaration amounts.

             (3)  In this Act:

                    <a name="fda-declar-percentag"></a>**_FDA declaration percentage_** has the same meaning as in Subdivision B of Division 11A of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

             (4)  However, subsection 128TC(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ operates in relation to the * FDA declaration percentage on the basis that:

                     (a)  the company mentioned in that subsection is the * subsidiary member; and

                     (b)  the dividends were paid to shareholders in respect of * shares in the subsidiary member.

             (5)  To avoid doubt, subsection 128TC(5) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ operates in relation to the * head company’s * FDA declaration by reference to amounts worked out on the basis described in subsection (4) of this section.

             (6)  To avoid doubt, sections 128TD and 128TE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ apply to the * head company in relation to an * FDA declaration made because of subsection (2) of this section, even though the shareholders and dividends mentioned in those sections applying in relation to the declaration are shareholders in, and dividends paid by, the * subsidiary member.

##### <a id="717-525"></a>717-525  Multiple FDA declarations for dividends paid on same day

             (1)  This section operates if the * head company of a * consolidated group makes 2 or more * FDA declarations relating to dividends (within the meaning of Subdivision B of Division 11A of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) paid by * members of the group on a single day.

Note:          It does not matter whether all those FDA declarations are made under section 128TC of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ as affected by section 717-520 of this Act or whether one of the declarations relates to dividends actually paid by the head company.

FDA declaration percentage in each FDA declaration

             (2)  The * FDA declaration percentage for each * FDA declaration must be such that the sum of the amounts worked out under subsection 128TC(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ in relation to the FDA declarations is not greater than the * head company’s * FDA surplus at the beginning of the day.

             (3)  If (apart from this subsection) that sum _is_ greater than the * head company’s * FDA surplus at the beginning of the day, each of the * FDA declarations is valid but is taken always to have effect as if the * FDA declaration percentage specified in the declaration were the percentage worked out using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00604/Html/NewBusTaxSysConsOtherMeas2003_image013.gif)

             (4)  Subsection 128TC(5) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ does not operate in relation to any of the * FDA declarations.

Penalty for statement reflecting wrong percentage

             (5)  Subsection 128TE(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ operates as if it referred to subsection (3) of this section instead of subsection 128TC(5) of that Act.

             (6)  To avoid doubt, subsection (3) of this section does not prevent subsection 128TE(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ from making the * head company liable to pay additional tax by way of penalty.

##### <a id="717-530"></a>717-530  Extended operation of sections 717-520 and 717-525

                   Section 128AAA (the **_applied section_**) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ applies to sections 717-520 and 717-525 of this Act in the same way as the applied section applies to Division 11A of Part III of that Act.

Note:          Section 128AAA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ applies Division 11A of Part III of that Act to non-share dividends in the same way as that Division applies to dividends.

Repeal the section, substitute:

##### <a id="719-155"></a>719-155  Object of this Subdivision

                   The object of this Subdivision is to modify the tax cost setting rules in Divisions 701 and 705 so that they take account of the special characteristics of * MEC groups.

## 2  Before subsection 719-160(1)

Insert:

          (1A)  This section applies if an entity (the **_MEC joining entity_**) becomes a * subsidiary member of a * MEC group at a time (the **_MEC joining time_**).

## 3  Section 719-165

Repeal the section, substitute:

##### <a id="719-165"></a>719-165  Trading stock value not set for assets of eligible tier-1 companies

             (1)  This section applies if an entity (the **_MEC joining entity_**) becomes a * subsidiary member of a * MEC group at a time (the **_MEC joining time_**).

             (2)  Subsection 701-35(4) (setting value of trading stock at tax-neutral amount) does not apply to the assets of the MEC joining entity if it is an * eligible tier-1 company at the MEC joining time.

## 4  At the end of Subdivision 719-C

Add:

##### <a id="719-170"></a>719-170  Modified effect of subsections 705-175(1) and 705-185(1)

             (1)  This section applies if all of the * members of a * MEC group (the **_acquired group_**) become members of another MEC group, or of a * consolidated group, at a particular time (the **_acquisition time_**) as a result of the * acquisition of * membership interests in:

                     (a)  the * head company of the acquired group; and

                     (b)  other entities that were * eligible tier-1 companies of the acquired group just before the acquisition time.

             (2)  Subsections 705-175(1) and 705-185(1) have effect as if a * membership interest in an entity mentioned in paragraph (1)(b) of this section were a membership interest in the * head company of the acquired group.

Note 1:       If the _acquiring_ group is a MEC group, and the head company of the acquired group becomes an eligible tier-1 company of the _acquiring_ group, the assets of the members of the acquired group do _not_ have their tax cost reset at the acquisition time. This is because:

(a)           section 719-160 treats an entity becoming an eligible tier-1 company of the _acquiring_ group as if it were a part of the head company of that group; and

(b)           section 705-185 treats the subsidiary members of the acquired group as part of the head company of the acquired group.

Note 2:       If:

(a)           the _acquiring_ group is a MEC group, but the head company of the acquired group does _not_ become an eligible tier-1 company of the _acquiring_ group; or

(b)           the _acquiring_ group is a consolidated group and the acquired group is a MEC group;

                   the assets of the members of the acquired group have their tax cost reset at the acquisition time (section 719-160 does not preclude tax cost resetting in these cases). For the purposes of resetting the tax cost of those assets, section 705-185 treats the subsidiary members of the acquired group as part of the head company of the acquired group.

\[This is the end of the Guide.]

#### Maintaining the same ownership to be able to utilise loss

##### <a id="719-255"></a>719-255  Special rules

             (1)  This section and section 719-260 have effect for the purposes of working out whether a loss can be * utilised for an income year (the **_claim year_**) by a company (the **_focal company_**) that made the loss if:

                     (a)  section 165-12 is relevant to the question whether the focal company can utilise the loss; and

                     (b)  the focal company is the * head company of a * MEC group at any time in its * ownership test period for the loss (as affected by section 707-205, if relevant).

Note:          If the focal company made the loss because of a transfer under Subdivision 707-A, section 707-205 has the effect that the ownership test period starts for the focal company at the time of the transfer.

Section 707-210 does not have effect

             (2)  Section 707-210 does not have effect for the purposes of working out whether the focal company can * utilise the loss for the claim year.

Note:          Section 707-210 is about whether a company can utilise a loss it made because the loss was transferred to it under Subdivision 707-A because the transferor met the conditions in section 165-12.

##### <a id="719-260"></a>719-260  Special test for utilising a loss because a company maintains the same owners

Meeting the conditions in section 165-12

             (1)  The focal company is taken to meet the conditions in section 165-12 for the claim year and the loss if and only if the company (the **_test company_**) identified in relation to the focal company in accordance with section 719-265 would have met those conditions for that year on the relevant assumptions in:

                     (a)  section 719-270 (which is about assuming the test company made the loss for a particular income year); and

                     (b)  section 719-275 (which is about assuming that nothing happened in relation to certain things that would affect whether the test company would meet those conditions); and

                     (c)  section 719-280 (which is about assuming that the test company would have failed to meet those conditions in certain circumstances).

Focal company’s failure to meet conditions in section 165-12

             (2)  The focal company is taken to fail to meet a condition in section 165-12 only at:

                     (a)  the first time the test company would have failed to meet the condition on the relevant assumptions mentioned in subsection (1); or

                     (b)  the * test time described in subsection 166-5(5) for the test company, if:

                              (i)  Division 166 is relevant to working out whether the test company could have * utilised the loss for the claim year on the relevant assumptions mentioned in paragraphs (1)(a) and (b); and

                             (ii)  the test company is not assumed under section 719-280 to fail to meet the condition before the test time.

Note:          If the focal company is taken to fail to meet a condition in section 165-12, the focal company will not be able to utilise the loss for the claim year unless the focal company meets the conditions in section 165-13 by satisfying the same business test. That test applies to the focal company (and not the test company).

Same business test for focal company under Division 166

             (3)  If subsection 166-5(4) affects whether the focal company can * utilise the loss for the claim year because the focal company is a * listed public company or a * 100% subsidiary of one for the year, subsection 166-5(5) operates as if it required the * same business test to be applied to the * business the focal company carried on just before the time described in subsection (2) of this section.

Same business test for focal company to transfer loss

             (4)  If subsection 707-125(4) is relevant to working out whether the focal company can transfer the loss to a company under Subdivision 707-A, that subsection:

                     (a)  has effect as if subsection 707-125(5) described the focal company’s income year containing the time at which the focal company is taken under subsection (2) of this section to fail to meet a condition in section 165-12; and

                     (b)  has effect despite subsection (3) of this section.

Note:          For working out whether certain losses can be transferred under Subdivision 707-A, subsection 707-125(4) modifies the operation of subsection 166-5(5) by extending the same business test period to include the income year described in subsection 707-125(5).

##### <a id="719-265"></a>719-265  What is the test company?

             (1)  To identify for the purposes of section 719-260 the company that is the test company for the focal company for the loss:

                     (a)  first, identify the test company for the focal company by applying whichever one of subsections (2), (3), (4) and (6) is relevant; and

                     (b)  then, if the condition in column 1 of an item of the table is met, apply this section again to identify the test company as if the company described in column 2 of the item were the focal company, taking account only of things that happened before the event described in column 3 of the item.

Relationship between subsections (2), (3) and (4)

             (5)  Subsection (2) or (3), and _not_ subsection (4), is relevant for identifying the test company for the focal company if the focal company made the loss apart from a transfer under Subdivision 707-A, and later transferred the loss to itself under that Subdivision.

Change of head company

             (6)  If, under section 719-90, the focal company is taken to have made the loss because:

                     (a)  a company (the **_first head company_**) other than the focal company made the loss apart from that section and either:

                              (i)  was the * head company of a * MEC group at any time during the income year for which it made the loss; or

                             (ii)  became the head company of a MEC group after that income year (without having been a * subsidiary member of the group before becoming the head company); and

                     (b)  the focal company was later the head company of the MEC group;

the test company for the focal company is the company that is the test company for the first head company.

Note:          Section 719-90 applies if there is a change in the head company of a MEC group, treating the later head company as if what had happened to the earlier head company had happened to the later head company.

             (7)  Subsections (2), (3) and (4) and section 719-90 have effect subject to subsection (6) of this section.

##### <a id="719-270"></a>719-270  Assumptions about the test company having made the loss for an income year

If test company was top company for focal company’s MEC group

             (1)  If the test company was the * top company for a * MEC group and the focal company is or was the * head company of that MEC group, assume that the test company made the loss for an income year starting at the relevant time shown in the table.

Note:          Subsection (1) applies even if the test company is still the top company for the MEC group at the end of the claim year.

If test company is focal company or first head company

             (2)  If the test company is:

                     (a)  the focal company; or

                     (b)  the first head company identified in subsection 719-265(6) by reference to the focal company;

assume that the test company made the loss for an income year starting at the relevant time shown in the table.

             (3)  If the test company is the first head company, disregard section 719-90 for the purposes of working out the relevant time using the table in subsection (2) of this section.

Note:          This ensures that section 719-90 does not make the items in the table inapplicable by treating the test company as if another company had made the loss instead of the test company.

If subsections (1) and (2) do not apply

Note:          Subsection (4) applies if the focal company made the loss because of a COT transfer of the loss to the focal company from another company.

             (5)  Disregard section 719-90 for the purposes of items 1 and 2 of the table in subsection (4) of this section if the test company was identified using subsection 719-265(6).

Note:          This ensures that section 719-90 does not make those items inapplicable by treating the test company as if another company had made the loss instead of the test company.

Other events do not override assumption

             (6)  If the test company transferred the loss to itself or another company under Subdivision 707-A, assume that the transfer did not affect, for income years ending after the transfer:

                     (a)  the fact that the test company made the loss; or

                     (b)  the income year for which the test company is assumed (under subsection (1), (2) or (4)) to have made the loss.

##### <a id="719-275"></a>719-275  Assumptions about nothing happening to affect direct and indirect ownership of the test company

             (1)  This section sets out an assumption that must be made whenever an event described in subsection (2) occurs:

                     (a)  after the time assumed under section 719-270 to be the start of the income year for which the test company made the loss; and

                     (b)  before the end of the claim year;

(whether or not the test company or the focal company is one of the companies mentioned in the description of the event).

             (2)  Assume that, after an event described in an item of the table, nothing happens in relation to * membership interests or voting power in an entity described in the item that would affect whether the test company would meet the conditions in section 165-12 for the claim year and the loss.

             (3)  For the purposes of this section, a company is taken to make a loss:

                     (a)  at the _start_ of the income year for which the company makes the loss, if it makes the loss apart from a transfer under Subdivision 707-A (even if the company later transfers the loss to itself under that Subdivision); or

                     (b)  at the time the loss is transferred to the company under that Subdivision, if the company makes the loss because of that transfer.

             (4)  Disregard section 719-90 for the purposes of making an assumption on the basis of item 1 of the table in subsection (2) of this section if (apart from that section):

                     (a)  the * COT transfer mentioned in that item was from the * head company of the * MEC group to itself; and

                     (b)  for an income year starting after the transfer, another company was the head company of the group.

##### <a id="719-280"></a>719-280  Assumptions about the test company failing to meet the conditions in section 165-12

             (1)  Assume that the test company fails to meet the conditions in section 165-12 at the time an event described in subsection (2), (3) or (4) happens after the start of the * ownership test period for the focal company in relation to:

                     (a)  the * MEC group whose * head company was the focal company; or

                     (b)  the * potential MEC group whose membership was the same as the membership of that MEC group.

Note:          If the test company is assumed to fail to meet the conditions in section 165-12 for the claim year and the loss, the focal company is taken (under section 719-260) to have failed to meet those conditions.

             (2)  One event is the * potential MEC group ceasing to exist.

             (3)  Another event is something happening that meets these conditions:

                     (a)  the thing happens at a time in relation to * membership interests in one or more of these entities:

                              (i)  a company that was just before that time a * member of the * MEC group and an * eligible tier-1 company of the * top company for the MEC group;

                             (ii)  an entity interposed between a company described in subparagraph (i) and the company that was the top company for the group just before that time;

                     (b)  the thing does not cause the * potential MEC group to cease to exist but does cause a change in the identity of the top company for the potential MEC group.

             (4)  Another event is the * MEC group ceasing to exist because there ceases to be a * provisional head company of the group.

Other causes of failure to meet conditions in section 165-12

             (5)  To avoid doubt, this section does not limit the circumstances in which the test company would have failed to meet the conditions in section 165-12 on the relevant assumptions set out in sections 719-270 and 719-275.

#### Same business test and change of head company

##### <a id="719-285"></a>719-285  Same business test and change of head company

                   In working out whether the * same business test is satisfied by a company that, after the * test time, became the * head company of a * MEC group that existed before that time, disregard what happened in relation to the company before it became a * member of the group. Section 719-90 has effect subject to this section.

Note 1:       The same business test is to be applied on the basis that the company’s business at the test time was the business that section 719-90 treats the company as having carried on at that time, except to the extent that section 719-90 attributes to the company its actual history before it became a member of the MEC group.

Note 2:       Section 719-90 applies if there is a change in the head company of a MEC group, treating the later head company as if what had happened to the earlier head company had happened to the later head company.

                     (b)  the Commissioner gives a particular contributing member written notice under subsection 721-15(5) of the group liability; and

                     (c)  general interest charge arises for a subsequent day in relation to the primary liability; and

                     (d)  the general interest charge for the subsequent day has not been paid or otherwise discharged in full by the time it became due and payable.

             (2)  The Commissioner is taken to have given the contributing member written notice under subsection 721-15(5) of the * general interest charge for the subsequent day. The notice is taken to have been given on that day.

Insert:

##### <a id="721-40"></a>721-40  TSA liability and group liability are linked

             (1)  The liability of a TSA contributing member under subsection 721-30(2) (the **_TSA liability_**) is separate and distinct for all purposes from the group liability to which it relates (the **_linked group liability_**). For example, the Commissioner may take proceedings to recover the unpaid amount of the TSA liability, proceedings to recover the unpaid amount of the linked group liability, or both.

Note:          The TSA contributing member will not be jointly and severally liable for the linked group liability under section 721-15 (see subsection 721-15(3)). However, the head company of the group remains liable for the linked group liability.

Payment or discharge of TSA liability

             (2)  If an amount is paid or applied at a particular time towards discharging the TSA liability, the linked group liability is discharged at that time to the extent of the same amount.

Payment or discharge of linked group liability

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  an amount is paid or applied at a particular time towards discharging the linked group liability; and

                     (b)  as a result, the amount unpaid on the TSA liability at that time (apart from this section) exceeds the amount unpaid on the linked group liability at that time;

the TSA liability is discharged at that time to the extent of the excess.

             (4)  Subsections (2) and (3) operate in relation to a liability under a judgment (the **_judgment liability_**):

                     (a)  if the judgment liability is for the entire amount unpaid on the TSA liability—as if the judgment liability were the TSA liability; and

                     (b)  if the judgment liability is for the entire amount unpaid on the linked group liability—as if the judgment liability were the linked group liability.

             (5)  This section does not discharge a liability to a greater extent than the amount of the liability.

Additional requirement for consolidated groups at formation

             (7)  If the group is a consolidated group and the test time is the time at which the group comes into existence as a consolidated group, the test time must be before 1 July 2004.

Additional requirement for consolidated groups after formation

             (8)  If:

                     (a)  the group is a consolidated group; and

                     (b)  the test time is after the group comes into existence; and

                     (c)  at the test time, one or more of the membership interests in the test entity are held by:

                     (e)  at the time the group came into existence as a consolidated group, one or more of the membership interests in the test entity must have been held by an entity of a kind mentioned in subparagraph (c)(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv).

##### <a id="701C-15"></a>701C-15  Additional membership rules where entities are interposed between the head company and a subsidiary member—case where an interposed entity is a non-resident and the subsidiary member is a trust or partnership

             (1)  This section describes, for the purposes of item 2, column 4 of the table in subsection 703-15(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, a set of requirements that must be met for an entity (the **_test entity_**) to be a subsidiary member of a consolidated group or a consolidatable group at a particular time (the **_test time_**).

Test entity must be a trust or partnership

             (2)  At the test time, the test entity must be a trust or partnership.

At least one interposed entity must be a company that is a subsidiary member because of section 701C-10

Test entity must be a subsidiary member on assumption that head company beneficially owned all membership interests beneficially owned by subsection (3) companies

             (4)  At the test time, it must be the case that the test entity would be a subsidiary member of the group if the head company beneficially owned all the membership interests beneficially owned by each company described in subsection (3).

##### <a id="701C-20"></a>701C-20  Transitional foreign-held subsidiaries and transitional foreign-held indirect subsidiaries

                   If:

                     (a)  an entity is a subsidiary member of a consolidated group in a case where the set of requirements described in section 701C-10 are met; and

                     (b)  one or more of the membership interests in the entity are held by:

                              (i)  a non-resident company; or

                            (iv)  a partnership, each of the partners in which is a non-resident company or a non-resident trust;

then:

                     (c)  the entity is a **_transitional foreign-held subsidiary_** of the group; and

                     (d)  if:

                              (i)  the transitional foreign-held subsidiary; or

                            holds one or more membership interests in another entity that:

                            (iii)  is a subsidiary member of the group; and

                            (iv)  is not a transitional foreign-held subsidiary of the group;

                            that other member is a **_transitional foreign-held indirect subsidiary_** of the group.

Note:       In order to be a subsidiary member of the group as required by subparagraph (d)(iii), the transitional foreign-held indirect subsidiary would need to have satisfied the set of requirements in either section 701C-10 or 701C-15

#### Subdivision 701C-C—Modifications of tax cost setting rules

**Table of sections**

Application and object

701C-25    Application and object of this Subdivision

Basic modification

701C-30    Transitional foreign-held subsidiary to be treated as part of head company

Other modifications

701C-35    Trading stock value not set for assets of transitional foreign-held subsidiaries

701C-40    Cost setting rules for exit cases—modification of core rules

701C-50    Cost setting rules for exit cases—reference to modification of core rule

#### Application and object

##### <a id="701C-25"></a>701C-25  Application and object of this Subdivision

Application

             (1)  This Subdivision applies if an entity (the **_transitional foreign-held joining entity_**) that is a transitional foreign-held subsidiary or a transitional foreign-held indirect subsidiary becomes a subsidiary member of a consolidated group at the time (the **_formation time_**) the group comes into existence.

Object

             (2)  The object of this Subdivision is to ensure that, on becoming a subsidiary member at the formation time, the tax cost of the assets of any transitional foreign-held subsidiary is not set and that the tax cost setting amount for assets of any transitional foreign-held indirect subsidiary that becomes a subsidiary member at that time takes account of this.

#### Basic modification

##### <a id="701C-30"></a>701C-30  Transitional foreign-held subsidiary to be treated as part of head company

                   The following provisions:

                     (a)  section 701-10 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_(about setting the tax cost of assets that an entity brings into the group);

                     (b)  Subdivision 705-A of that Act, in its application in accordance with Subdivision 705-B of that Act;

apply, for the purposes of setting the tax cost of an asset of the transitional foreign-held entity at the formation time, as if each subsidiary member of the group that is a transitional foreign-held subsidiary at the formation time were a part of the head company of the group, rather than a separate entity.

Note 1:       This section means that references in those provisions to matters internal to the group operate as if transitional foreign-held subsidiaries in the group were parts of the head company of the group. For example:

(a)           provisions operating if the head company holds (whether directly or indirectly) membership interests in another entity operate even if a transitional foreign-held subsidiary actually holds those interests; and

(b)           provisions operating if the head company owns or controls another entity operate even if one or more transitional foreign-held subsidiaries actually own or control that other entity; and

(c)           provisions operating if an entity is interposed between the head company and another entity operate even if the first entity is actually interposed between a transitional foreign-held subsidiary and the other entity.

Note 2:       If the transitional foreign-held entity is a transitional foreign-held subsidiary, this section means the assets of the entity do not have their tax cost reset at the formation time. This is because Subdivision 705-A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, in its application in accordance with Subdivision 705-B of that Act, resets the tax cost of assets of _subsidiary_ members of a group, but not assets of the head company.

#### Other modifications

##### <a id="701C-35"></a>701C-35  Trading stock value not set for assets of transitional foreign-held subsidiaries

                   Subsection 701-35(4) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_(setting value of trading stock at tax-neutral amount) does not apply to the assets of the transitional foreign-held entity if it is a transitional foreign-held subsidiary.

##### <a id="701C-40"></a>701C-40  Cost setting rules for exit cases—modification of core rules

                   Section 701-15 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies as if the following subsection were added at the end of the section:

Application to transitional foreign-held subsidiaries

             (4)  If an entity that ceases to be a subsidiary member is a transitional foreign-held subsidiary when it does so:

                     (a)  this section applies to each membership interest in the transitional foreign-held subsidiary that is held by an entity (an **_eligible non-resident_**) of a kind mentioned in subparagraph 701C-20(b)(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_ in the same way as it applies to a membership interest in the transitional foreign-held subsidiary that is held by the head company; and

                     (b)  for that purpose, the definition of **_head company core purposes_** in subsection 701-1(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies to the eligible non-resident in the same way as it applies to the head company.

##### <a id="701C-50"></a>701C-50  Cost setting rules for exit cases—reference to modification of core rule

                   Section 711-5 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies as if the following note were added at the end of the section:

Note:          If the leaving entity is a transitional foreign-held subsidiary (within the meaning of section 701C-20 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997)_, this Division will, in accordance with subsection 701-15(4) of this Act (see section 701C-40 of the first-mentioned Act), apply to membership interests that an eligible non-resident mentioned in that subsection holds in the entity in the same way as it applies to membership interests that the head company holds in the entity.

                     (c)  when the transitional group came into existence, the test entity was a subsidiary member of the group, other than as:

                              (i)  a transitional foreign-held subsidiary of the group (see section 701C-20); or

                             (ii)  an eligible tier-1 company of the group.

## 1  At the end of Schedule 10

Add:

## 11  Transitional provision for section 160AF

(1)        This item applies if:

                     (a)  because of item 5, 6 or 7, old section 160AFE applies to a taxpayer as if a period were an income year (the **_notional income year_**); and

                     (b)  the taxpayer has an initial excess credit (within the meaning of old section 160AFE) in relation to the notional income year; and

                     (c)  the taxpayer transfers all or part (the extent of the transfer being the **_transfer amount_**) of that initial excess credit under old section 160AFE for utilisation by another company in the notional income year.

(2)        Section 160AF of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ applies to the taxpayer for the year of income in which the notional income year ends as if the amount of foreign tax paid by the taxpayer mentioned in paragraph 160AF(1)(b) of that Act were reduced by the transfer amount.

(3)        This item operates separately in relation to each class of foreign income identified in subsection 160AF(7) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, as if the taxpayer’s foreign income of that class for a year of income were the whole of the taxpayer’s foreign income for that year.

as if the time just after the end of the period were the end of the income year and the entity carried on at that time the same business that it carried on just before that time. Paragraph (3)(a) has effect subject to this subsection.

Note:          This means that things that happen in relation to the entity at the time it becomes a subsidiary member of the group are taken into account in determining whether the entity can utilise such a loss to affect its taxable income for the non-membership period.

## 2  At the end of section 701-30

Utilisation and transfer of non-membership period loss

             (8)  However, the provisions of this Act relating to transfer or * utilisation of a loss of any * sort have effect in relation to a non-membership period loss of that sort for any non-membership period as if the non-membership period loss were the entity’s loss for an income year that:

                     (a)  started at the start of the period; and

                     (b)  ended at the end of the period.

             (9)  Subsection (8) has effect not only for the entity core purposes, but also (despite subsection (2)) for other purposes.

##### <a id="707-326"></a>707-326  Events involving only value donor and real loss-maker not covered by rule against inflation of modified market value

             (1)  This section affects the calculation of the modified market value of the real loss-maker mentioned in subsection 707-315(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ for a bundle of losses. This section affects the calculation:

                     (a)  only if section 707-325 of this Act applies for the purposes of working out the available fraction for the bundle; and

                     (b)  only for the purposes of working out the available fraction for the bundle to affect the utilisation of tax losses, film losses and net capital losses in the bundle (and not any overall foreign losses, as defined in section 160AFD of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, in the bundle).

Note:          This section does not affect the calculation of the real loss-maker’s modified market value for other purposes (such as the real loss-maker being a value donor for the purposes of another application of section 707-325 of this Act).

             (2)  Disregard for the purposes of subsection 707-325(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ an event:

                     (a)  that is described in subsection 707-325(4) of that Act; and

                     (b)  that meets the condition in subsection (3) or (4) of this section.

             (3)  One condition is that the event was an injection of capital directly into the real loss-maker by the value donor mentioned in section 707-325 of this Act.

             (4)  The other condition is that the event was a transaction:

                     (a)  that did not take place at arm’s length; and

                     (b)  that involved only the real loss-maker and the value donor mentioned in section 707-325 of this Act; and

                     (c)  that would have caused subsection 707-325(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ to operate in working out the real loss-maker’s modified market value (even if no other events described in subsection 707-325(4) of that Act had occurred), apart from this section.

             (5)  Subsection (2) of this section does not apply if subsection 707-325(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_:

                     (a)  operates for the purposes of working out the value donor’s modified market value because of an event that involved an entity other than the value donor and the real loss-maker (whether or not the event also involved either the value donor or the real loss-maker); or

                     (b)  would operate for those purposes because of such an event apart from another application of this section.

## 5  After section 707-328

Insert:

##### <a id="707-328A"></a>707-328A  Some events involving only group members not covered by rule against inflation of modified market value

Overview

             (1)  Subsection (3) of this section affects the calculation, under section 707-325 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ and section 707-325 of this Act, of the modified market value of the real loss-maker mentioned in subsection 707-315(1) of that Act for a bundle of losses, but only if:

                     (a)  the requirement in subsection (2) of this section is met in relation to each other company that became a member of the group mentioned in subsection 707-315(1) of that Act in connection with the bundle at the time (the **_formation time_**) the group became a consolidated group; and

                     (b)  the provisions described in subsection 707-327(4) of this Act operate (because of that subsection) in relation to each loss of such a company that is covered by paragraphs 707-327(1)(b) and (c) of this Act as if the bundle included the loss; and

                     (c)  all members of the group at the formation time were companies; and

                     (d)  subsection 707-325(2) of that Act does not operate, for the purposes of working out the modified market value of an entity that became a member of the group at the formation time, because of an event that involved an entity that did not become a member of the group then; and

                     (e)  the transferee mentioned in subsection 707-325(1) of this Act chooses that this section apply in relation to the real loss-maker.

             (2)  Section 707-325 of this Act must apply in relation to the other company (as value donor) so that the available fraction for the bundle is to be worked out as if there were added to the real loss-maker’s modified market value an amount worked out by reference to the other company’s modified market value at the initial transfer time.

Disregarding events for purposes of anti-inflation rule

             (3)  Disregard for the purposes of subsection 707-325(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ an event that is described in subsection 707-325(4) of that Act and was either:

                     (a)  an injection of capital into an entity that became a member of the group at the formation time by another such entity; or

                     (b)  a transaction that involved only entities that became members of the group at the formation time.

Note:          Disregarding such an event could have a direct or indirect effect on the real loss-maker’s modified market value for the purposes of working out the available fraction for the bundle in one of these ways:

(a)           it could directly affect the real loss-maker’s modified market value calculated under section 707-325 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, if the real loss-maker was involved in the event;

(b)           it could have an indirect effect by affecting the value donor’s modified market value calculated under that section and used under section 707-325 of this Act to add an amount to the real loss-maker’s modified market value for those purposes.

Choice

             (4)  A choice for the purposes of paragraph (1)(e):

                     (a)  may be made only by the day on which the transferee lodges its income tax return for the first income year for which it utilises (except in accordance with section 707-350) losses transferred to it under Subdivision 707-A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

                     (b)  cannot be amended or revoked.

Scope of this section

             (5)  This section affects the modified market value of an entity that became a member of the group at the formation time only for the purposes of calculating the real loss-maker’s modified market value for the purposes of working out the available fraction for the bundle.

             (6)  This section has effect for working out the available fraction of the bundle only so far as it affects the utilisation of a tax loss, film loss or net capital loss. It does not affect the utilisation of an overall foreign loss (as defined in section 160AFD of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) that:

                     (a)  is included in the bundle; or

                     (b)  was transferred under Subdivision 707-A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ from an entity other than the real loss-maker.

Note:          If the bundle includes an overall foreign loss and a loss of another sort:

(a)           utilisation of the overall foreign loss is limited by the available fraction for the bundle worked out apart from this section; and

(b)           utilisation of the loss of the other sort is limited by the available fraction for the bundle as affected by this section, if applicable.

             (7)  This section can operate in relation to only one bundle of losses transferred to the transferee under Subdivision 707-A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997._

Add:

(10)      To avoid doubt, section 701-30 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ does not prevent a company from transferring under Subdivision 170-A or 170-B of that Act (applying as described in subitem (9)) a non-membership period loss described in that section for the non-membership period mentioned in that subitem.

## 7  Item 34 of Schedule 5

Omit “166-86”, substitute “166-85”.

###### Schedule 20—Consolidation: transfers of losses involving financial corporations

## 1  Subsection 20(1A)

After “provisions in”, insert “Part 1 of”.

## 2  At the end of subsection 20(1A)

Add “and the provisions in Part 2 of that Schedule were added at the end of Subdivision 170-B of that Act”.

## 3  At the end of section 26C

Add:

             (2)  Subsection (1) operates on the basis described in subsection (3) if:

                     (a)  the head company of a consolidated group or MEC group incurred a tax loss because of Subdivision 707-A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

                     (b)  the company (the **_real loss-maker_**) that incurred the tax loss apart from that Subdivision is a member of the group in the deduction year; and

                     (c)  disregarding section 701-1 (the single entity rule) of that Act, this Act applies to one or more transfers by the real loss-maker to the receiving corporation.

Note:          In certain cases, Subdivision 707-A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ treats the head company of a consolidated group or MEC as incurring a tax loss actually incurred by an entity that becomes a member of the group.

             (3)  Subsection (1) operates as if:

                     (a)  the head company were the transferring corporation in relation to each transfer described in paragraph (1)(a) and this Act applied to each of those transfers; and

                     (b)  the head company incurred the tax loss for the income year for which the real loss-maker incurred it (apart from Subdivision 707-A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_); and

                     (c)  each reference in that subsection to Subdivision 165-A of that Act were a reference to that Subdivision as its operation is affected by Subdivision 707-B of that Act, and by Subdivision 719-F of that Act (if relevant).

Note 1:       Subdivision 707-B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ affects the operation of Subdivision 165-A of that Act in relation to the deduction of a tax loss incurred by the head company of a consolidated group or MEC group because of Subdivision 707-A of that Act.

Note 2:       Subdivision 719-F of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ affects the operation of Subdivision 165-A of that Act in relation to the deduction of a tax loss incurred by the head company of a MEC group because of Subdivision 707-A of that Act.

             (4)  An expression used in this section and in the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ has the same meaning in this section as it has in that Act. This subsection does not apply to the expressions **_deduction year_**, **_loss year_**, **_this Act_** and **_transfer_**.

## 4  At the end of section 170-5 in Schedule 1

Add:

             (5)  Special rules extend the scope of this Subdivision to let the head company of a consolidated group or MEC group transfer in some cases a tax loss the company incurred because of Subdivision 707-A. The rules do this by modifying the basis on which other provisions of this Subdivision operate.

## 5  At the end of Subdivision 170-A in Schedule 1

Add:

#### Special rules for transfer from head company of consolidated group or MEC group

##### <a id="170-75"></a>170-75  Transfer of a tax loss incurred by the head company because of Subdivision 707-A

             (1)  The other sections of this Subdivision operate in relation to the actual or proposed transfer of a * tax loss on the basis described in this section if:

                     (a)  the * head company of a * consolidated group or * MEC group incurred the tax loss because of Subdivision 707-A; and

                     (b)  the company (the **_real loss-maker_**) that incurred the tax loss apart from Subdivision 707-A is a * member of the group at the end of the income year for which it is proposed to transfer the loss under this Subdivision.

             (2)  The other sections of this Subdivision, except section 170-28, operate as if:

                     (a)  the * head company were a transferring corporation within the meaning of the _Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993_; and

                     (b)  the head company had incurred the * tax loss for the income year for which the real loss-maker incurred the tax loss (apart from Subdivision 707-A).

Note:          This has the effect that (because of subsection 170-10(1)) those sections operate as if the head company were the loss company and the loss year were the income year for which the real loss-maker incurred the loss.

             (3)  Section 170-28 operates as if:

                     (a)  the real loss-maker were the * loss company; and

                     (b)  section 701-1 (the single entity rule) could not affect whether the _Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993_ would have applied to the transfer described in section 170-28.

Insert:

## Part 1—Replacement of sections 170-110 to 170-145

## 7  At the end of Schedule 2

Add:

## Part 2—Addition of provisions at the end of Subdivision 170-B

#### Special rules for transfer from head company of consolidated group or MEC group

##### <a id="170-175"></a>170-175  Transfer of a net capital loss made by the head company because of Subdivision 707-A

             (1)  The other sections of this Subdivision operate in relation to the actual or proposed transfer of a * net capital loss on the basis described in this section if:

                     (a)  the * head company of a * consolidated group or * MEC group made the net capital loss because of Subdivision 707-A; and

                     (b)  the company (the **_real loss-maker_**) that made the net capital loss apart from Subdivision 707-A is a * member of the group at the end of the income year for which it is proposed to transfer the loss under this Subdivision.

             (2)  The other sections of this Subdivision, except section 170-128, operate as if:

                     (a)  the * head company were a transferring corporation within the meaning of the _Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993_; and

                     (b)  the head company had made the * net capital loss for the income year for which the real loss-maker made the net capital loss (apart from Subdivision 707-A).

Note:          This has the effect that (because of subsection 170-110(1)) those sections operate as if the head company were the loss company and the capital loss year were the income year for which the real loss-maker made the loss.

             (3)  Section 170-128 operates as if:

                     (a)  the real loss-maker were the * loss company; and

                     (b)  section 701-1 (the single entity rule) could not affect whether the _Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993_ would have applied to the transfer described in section 170-28.

             (4)  Subsection 170-135(2) operates as if the reference in it to Subdivision 165-CA were a reference to that Subdivision as it operates given the effect of Subdivision 707-B, and Subdivision 719-F if relevant, on the operation of Subdivision 165-A.

Note:          Subdivision 165-CA determines whether a net capital loss can be applied by reference to whether Subdivision 165-A would permit the deduction of a tax loss for the same income year as the net capital loss. Subdivisions 707-B and 719-F affect the operation of Subdivision 165-A in relation to losses made by a company because of Subdivision 707-A.

## 8  Application

(1)        The amendments of the _Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993_ made by this Schedule apply to assessments for the income year including 1 July 2002 and later income years.

(2)        In this item:

**_income year_** has the same meaning as in the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

##### <a id="73BAG"></a>73BAG  Balancing adjustments for certain assets of consolidated groups

             (1)  Subsections 73(23) and (24B) do not apply to an asset held by the head company of a consolidated group or MEC group where the tax cost of the asset is set under Division 701 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_. Instead, any balancing adjustment for the asset is worked out under section 73BF of this Act or section 40-292 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

             (2)  In working out the amount of a balancing adjustment under section 73BF of this Act or section 40-292 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ for the asset, the asset’s adjustable value (see section 40-85 of that Act) is reduced by so much of a reduction amount (see section 73BAF of this Act) for the asset that has not been applied in reducing a notional Division 40 deduction for the head company.

Period during which Subdivision applies to head company

             (1)  Subject to sections 45-880 and 45-885, this Subdivision applies to a company as the * head company of a * consolidated group during the period:

                     (a)  starting at the start of the * instalment quarter of the company determined under subsection (2), (3) or (4); and

                     (b)  ending:

                             (ii)  just before the instalment quarter of the company determined under paragraph (5)(c) or (d).

When the period begins—initial head company instalment rate

             (2)  This Subdivision starts to apply to a company as the * head company of a * consolidated group at the start of an * instalment quarter under this subsection if, during that quarter, the Commissioner gives the company (as that head company) the * initial head company instalment rate.

Note:          The operation of this subsection may be affected by section 45-885.

When the period begins—group created from MEC group

             (3)  This Subdivision starts to apply to a company as the * head company of a * consolidated group at the start of an * instalment quarter (the **_starting quarter_**) under this subsection if all of the following conditions are satisfied:

                     (a)  the consolidated group is * created from a * MEC group during the starting quarter;

                             (ii)  the Commissioner gives the * initial head company instalment rate to the provisional head company of the MEC group during the starting quarter.

Note:          For the application of this Subdivision to a provisional head company of a MEC group: see section 45-915.

When the period begins—new head company

             (4)  This Subdivision starts to apply to a company as the * head company of a * consolidated group at the start of an * instalment quarter (the **_starting quarter_**) under this subsection if all of the following conditions are satisfied:

                     (a)  the company is an interposed company mentioned in subsection 124-380(5) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_;

                     (b)  the company chooses under that subsection that the consolidated group is to continue in existence at and after the completion time mentioned in that subsection;

                     (c)  the completion time occurs during the starting quarter;

                     (d)  one of the following subparagraphs applies:

                              (i)  this Subdivision applied to the original company mentioned in that subsection (as the head company of the consolidated group) at the end of the previous instalment quarter;

                             (ii)  the Commissioner gives the * initial head company instalment rate to the original company mentioned in that subsection (as the head company of the consolidated group) during the starting quarter;

                            (iii)  the consolidated group is * created from a * MEC group during the starting quarter and this Subdivision applied to the * provisional head company of the MEC group at the end of the previous instalment quarter;

                            (iv)  the consolidated group is created from a MEC group during the starting quarter and the Commissioner gives the initial head company instalment rate to the provisional head company of the MEC group during the starting quarter.

When the period ends

             (5)  This Subdivision stops applying to a company as the * head company of a * consolidated group at the earliest of the following times after the company becomes the head company:

                     (a)  the end of the * instalment quarter during which the consolidated group ceases to exist (other than because a * MEC group is * created from the consolidated group);

                     (b)  the end of the instalment quarter during which the Commissioner is notified of the creation of a MEC group from the consolidated group if the MEC group is created during that instalment quarter;

                     (c)  just before the instalment quarter during which the Commissioner is notified of the creation of a MEC group from the consolidated group if the MEC group was created before that instalment quarter;

                     (d)  just before the instalment quarter that includes the completion time mentioned in subsection 124-380(5) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ where an interposed company mentioned in that subsection chooses under that subsection that the consolidated group is to continue in existence.

Note:          The operation of this subsection because of paragraph (a) may be affected by section 45-880.

             (6)  For the purposes of subsection (5), the Commissioner is notified of the creation of a * MEC group from a * consolidated group when the Commissioner receives a notice of the consolidation of the MEC group under subsection 719-40(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

             (7)  If this Subdivision stops applying to a company as the * head company of a * consolidated group just before an * instalment quarter under paragraph (5)(c), then, for the purposes of this Part, this Act has effect for the company and other * members of the group as if:

                     (a)  the consolidated group had continued to exist until just before the start of that quarter; and

                     (b)  the company were the head company of the group until just before the start of that quarter.

             (8)  To avoid doubt, this Subdivision does not apply to a company as the * head company of a * consolidated group for any time at all if:

                     (a)  subsection (2), (3) or (4), and subsection (5), would, apart from this subsection, apply to the company; but

                     (b)  the time at which this Subdivision would stop applying to the company under subsection (5) is before the time at which this Subdivision would start to apply to the company under subsection (2), (3) or (4).

             (9)  To avoid doubt, and apart from the operation of subsection (7), this Subdivision may apply to a company as the * head company of a * consolidated group at a time when the company is not in fact the head company of the group.

Note:          An example of this is when an interposed company becomes the new head company of a consolidated group. Under this section and section 45-740, this Subdivision may start applying to the company as if it had already become the head company when it is not yet such a company.

## 6  Section 45-720 in Schedule 1 (link note)

Repeal the link note, substitute:

Note:          You stop being an annual payer when this Subdivision starts applying to you as the head company of a consolidated group: see section 45-160.

## 7  Before section 45-755 in Schedule 1

Insert (after the group heading):

##### <a id="45-740"></a>45-740  Change of head company

Object

             (1)  The object of this section (except subsection (8)) is to ensure that, for the purposes of this Part, when a company becomes the new * head company of a * consolidated group:

                     (a)  the company inherits the history of the former head company of the group; and

                     (b)  the history of the new head company is effectively ignored.

             (2)  This section applies to a * head company of a * consolidated group if:

                     (a)  the company is an interposed company mentioned in subsection 45-705(4) (an interposed company that chooses under subsection 124-380(5) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ that the consolidated group is to continue in existence at and after the completion time mentioned in that subsection); and

                     (b)  the conditions in subsection 45-705(4) are satisfied in relation to the interposed company (whether or not this Subdivision applies to the company as the head company of the group for any period of time).

             (3)  Everything that happened before the completion time in relation to the company (the **_original company_**) that was the * head company of the * consolidated group immediately before the completion time:

                     (a)  is taken to have happened in relation to the interposed company instead of in relation to the original company; and

                     (b)  is taken to have happened in relation to the interposed company instead of what would (apart from this section) be taken to have happened in relation to the interposed company before the completion time;

just as if, at all times before the completion time:

                     (c)  the interposed company had been the original company; and

                     (d)  the original company had been the interposed company.

             (4)  To avoid doubt, subsection (3) also covers everything that, immediately before the completion time, was taken to have happened in relation to the original company because of:

                     (a)  section 701-1 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_(single entity rule); or

                     (b)  section 701-5 of that Act (entry history rule); or

                     (c)  section 703-75 of that Act (effects of an interposed company becoming the * head company of a * consolidated group); or

                     (d)  section 719-90 of that Act (effects of a change of head company of a * MEC group); or

                     (e)  section 45-710 in this Schedule (single entity rule for the purposes of this Part), including an application of that section under Subdivision 45-S in this Schedule; or

                      (f)  this section; or

                     (g)  section 45-920 in this Schedule (effects of a change of * provisional head company of a MEC group for the purposes of this Part); or

                     (h)  one or more previous applications of any of the provisions covered by paragraphs (a) to (g).

             (5)  In addition, and without affecting subsection (3):

                     (a)  an assessment of the original company for an income year that ends before the income year that includes the completion time; or

                     (b)  an amendment of the assessment;

is taken to be something that had happened to the interposed company, whether or not the assessment or amendment is made before the completion time.

             (6)  This section has effect for the purposes of applying this Part to * members of the * consolidated group in relation to an * instalment quarter of the interposed company that ends after the completion time.

Note:          An assessment mentioned in subsection (5) may therefore be taken to be the base assessment of the interposed company for the purposes of this Part.

             (7)  Subsections (1) to (6) are to be disregarded in applying section 45-705 (about the application of this Subdivision to a company as the * head company of a * consolidated group).

Note:          For example, if the Commissioner has given an initial head company instalment rate to the original company during an earlier instalment quarter, the rate is not, despite this section, treated as if it had been given to the interposed company for the purposes of section 45-705\. Subject to the other provisions in that section, this Subdivision therefore starts applying to the interposed company under subsection 45-705(4).

Special rule for the original company

             (8)  A provision of this Part that applies on an entity becoming a * subsidiary member of a * consolidated group does not apply to the original company when it is taken to have become such a member at the completion time as a result of section 703-70 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

Note:          Section 45-755 (the entry rule) therefore does not apply to the original company on the company becoming a subsidiary member of the consolidated group.

## 8  Subsection 45-760(1) in Schedule 1

Repeal the subsection, substitute:

             (1)  This section applies to an entity if all of the following conditions are satisfied:

                     (a)  the entity ceases to be a * subsidiary member of a * consolidated group during an * instalment quarter of the * head company of the group;

                     (b)  this Subdivision applies to the head company of the group during that instalment quarter;

                     (c)  the entity does not, at the time it ceases to be a subsidiary member of the group, become:

                              (i)  a subsidiary member of another consolidated group the head company of which is one to which this Subdivision applies at that time; or

                             (ii)  a member (other than the * provisional head company) of a * MEC group the provisional head company of which is one to which this Subdivision applies, in accordance with Subdivision 45-S, at that time;

                     (d)  this Part applies to the entity under section 45-10.

## 9  At the end of section 45-775 in Schedule 1

Add:

Additional applications of subsection (2)

             (4)  If, after exercising the power in relation to the membership change under subsection (2) for the first time, and on the basis of an assessment (including an amendment) of the * head company for the income year in which the change occurs, or for an earlier year, the Commissioner has worked out:

                     (a)  another instalment rate under section 45-320 for the company (whether or not the Commissioner has given that rate to the company); or

                     (b)  another amount of * GDP-adjusted notional tax under section 45-405 for the company (whether or not the Commissioner has notified the company an amount of instalment based on that other amount);

the Commissioner may again exercise the power under subsection (2) in relation to the membership change, as if:

                     (c)  the rate mentioned in paragraph (a) were the most recent instalment rate mentioned in paragraph (2)(a); and

                     (d)  the amount of GDP-adjusted notional tax mentioned in paragraph (b) were the amount of GDP-adjusted notional tax worked out for the purposes of the most recent amount of instalment that is mentioned in paragraph (2)(b).

             (5)  To avoid doubt, in relation to the membership change, the Commissioner:

                     (a)  may exercise the power under subsection (2) by applying subsection (4) more than once; but

                     (b)  must not exercise that power more than once in relation to a particular instalment rate mentioned in paragraph (4)(a) or a particular amount of * GDP-adjusted notional tax mentioned in paragraph (4)(b).

Add:

##### <a id="45-880"></a>45-880  Continued application of Subdivision 45-Q to the head company of an acquired group

             (1)  This section applies to a company for which all of the following conditions are satisfied in relation to a particular time (the **_takeover time_**):

                     (e)  at the takeover time, Subdivision 45-Q (including that Subdivision as applied under Subdivision 45-S) does not apply to the head company or the * provisional head company of that other group.

             (2)  For the purposes of this Part only, this Act has effect in relation to the company and the other * members of the * consolidated group mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) (the **_preserved group_**) as if, during the period covered by subsection (5):

                     (a)  the preserved group had continued to exist as a consolidated group; and

                     (b)  the company were still the * head company of the preserved group; and

                     (c)  Subdivision 45-Q had continued to apply to the company as the head company of the preserved group; and

                     (d)  an entity, while being a * subsidiary member of the preserved group, were not treated as a member of the group mentioned in paragraph (1)(b) (the **_new group_**).

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not stop the company from being a member of the new group for the purposes of this Part during the period covered by subsection (5).

Note:          This means, for example, sections 45-855 and 45-860 apply to the head company as a member of the new group.

             (4)  However, for the purposes of applying section 45-855 to the company, a reference in that section to an application of section 701-1 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ to the company in relation to the period mentioned in section 45-855 is taken to be:

                     (a)  a reference only to an application of section 701-1 of that Act to the company as a member of the new group during that period; and

                     (b)  not a reference to an application (because of subsection (2) of this section) of section 701-1 of that Act to the company as the * head company of the preserved group during that period.

             (5)  This subsection covers the period that starts from the start of the * instalment quarter of the company that includes the takeover time and ends at the earlier of the following times:

                     (a)  the end of the instalment quarter of the company during which the company ceases to be a member of the new group;

                     (b)  just before the instalment quarter of the company during which the Commissioner gives the * initial head company instalment rate to the * head company, or the * provisional head company, of the new group.

             (6)  The Commissioner may, on the application of the company made not later than 28 days after the takeover time, allow such extension of time for the purposes of paragraph (1)(d) as he or she considers appropriate.

             (7)  To avoid doubt, nothing in this section prevents the operation of section 45-755 or 45-760 to * members of the preserved group while it continues to exist under subsection (2).

##### <a id="45-885"></a>45-885  Early application of Subdivision 45-Q to the head company of a new group

             (1)  This section applies to a company for which all of the following conditions are satisfied in relation to a particular time (the **_starting time_**):

                     (a)  just before the starting time, the company was a * subsidiary member of a * consolidated group, or a member of a * MEC group;

                     (b)  just before the starting time, the consolidated group or MEC group was a mature group (see subsection (4));

                     (c)  at the starting time, either of the following applies:

                              (i)  the company ceases to be a subsidiary member of the consolidated group, or a member of the MEC group;

                             (ii)  the group ceases to exist (otherwise than because a MEC group or consolidated group is * created from the group, or because its * head company or * provisional head company becomes a * wholly-owned subsidiary of a member of another mature group);

                     (d)  at the starting time, the company is the head company of another consolidated group;

                     (e)  within 28 days after the starting time, or within such further period (if any) as the Commissioner allows, the Commissioner receives the choice to consolidate, at and after the starting time, that other consolidated group under section 703-50 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

             (2)  For the purposes of this Part:

                     (a)  the instalment rate that the Commissioner is taken to have given to the company under paragraph 45-760(2)(a) has effect as if it were the * initial head company instalment rate for the company as the * head company of the * consolidated group mentioned in paragraph (1)(d); and

                     (b)  an instalment rate that would otherwise be the initial head company instalment rate for the company as the head company of that consolidated group is not to be treated as that initial head company instalment rate.

Note:          This means, subject to the provisions in section 45-705, Subdivision 45-Q starts applying to the company as the head company of the consolidated group at the start of the instalment quarter that includes the starting time: see subsection (2) of that section and paragraph 45-760(2)(a).

             (3)  The Commissioner may, on the application of the company made within 28 days after the starting time, allow such extension of time for the purposes of paragraph (1)(e) as he or she considers appropriate.

Mature group

             (4)  For the purposes of this section, a * consolidated group or a * MEC group is a **_mature group_** at a particular time if:

                     (a)  for a consolidated group—Subdivision 45-Q applies to its * head company at that time; or

                     (b)  for a MEC group—Subdivision 45-Q, as applied under Subdivision 45-S, applies to its * provisional head company at that time.

#### Preliminary

##### <a id="45-905"></a>45-905  Objects of Subdivision

                   The objects of this Subdivision are to:

                     (a)  extend the operation of this Part (except sections 45-705 and 45-740 and this Subdivision) so that it can apply in relation to * MEC groups and their members; and

                     (b)  modify the rules in this Part for that extended operation so that they take account of the special characteristics of MEC groups.

#### General modification rules

##### <a id="45-910"></a>45-910  Extended operation of Part to cover MEC groups

             (1)  This Part (except sections 45-705 and 45-740 and this Subdivision) has effect in relation to members of a * MEC group in the same way in which it has effect in relation to * members of a * consolidated group.

#### Extended operation of Subdivision 45-Q

##### <a id="45-913"></a>45-913  Sections 45-705 and 45-740 do not apply to members of MEC groups

                   In applying Subdivision 45-Q to members of a * MEC group, the Subdivision has effect as if:

                     (a)  section 45-705 had no effect and section 45-915 had effect instead; and

                     (b)  section 45-740 had no effect and section 45-920 had effect instead.

##### <a id="45-915"></a>45-915  Application of Subdivision 45-Q to provisional head company

Period during which Subdivision applies to provisional head company

             (1)  Subject to sections 45-880 and 45-885 (as applied under this Subdivision), Subdivision 45-Q applies to a company as the * provisional head company of a * MEC group during the period:

                     (a)  starting at the start of the * instalment quarter of the company determined under subsection (2), (3) or (4); and

                     (b)  ending:

                              (i)  at the end of the instalment quarter of the company determined under paragraph (6)(a) or (b); or

                             (ii)  just before the instalment quarter of the company determined under paragraph (6)(c).

Note:          The application of Subdivision 45-Q to the provisional head company is subject to the modifications set out in this section and elsewhere in this Subdivision.

When the period begins—initial head company instalment rate

             (2)  Subdivision 45-Q starts to apply to a company as the * provisional head company of a * MEC group at the start of an * instalment quarter under this subsection if, during that quarter, the Commissioner gives the company (as that provisional head company) the * initial head company instalment rate.

Note:          The operation of this subsection may be affected by section 45-885 (as applied under this Subdivision).

When the period begins—group created from consolidated group

             (3)  Subdivision 45-Q starts to apply to a company as the * provisional head company of a * MEC group at the start of an * instalment quarter (the **_starting quarter_**) under this subsection if all of the following conditions are satisfied:

                     (a)  during the starting quarter, the Commissioner is notified of the creation of the MEC group from a * consolidated group (see subsection (5));

                     (b)  the company is the provisional head company of the MEC group when the Commissioner is so notified;

                     (c)  either of the following applies:

                              (i)  Subdivision 45-Q applied to the * head company of the consolidated group at the end of the previous instalment quarter;

                             (ii)  the Commissioner gives the * initial head company instalment rate to the head company of the consolidated group during the starting quarter.

Note:          For the application of Subdivision 45-Q to a head company of a consolidated group: see section 45-705.

When the period begins—new provisional head company

             (4)  Subdivision 45-Q starts to apply to a company as the * provisional head company of a * MEC group at the start of an * instalment quarter (the **_starting quarter_**) under this subsection if both of the following conditions are satisfied:

                     (a)  the company is appointed as the provisional head company of the MEC group under subsection 719-60(3) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ during the starting quarter;

                     (b)  one of the following applies:

                              (i)  Subdivision 45-Q applied to the former provisional head company of the MEC group at the end of the previous instalment quarter;

                             (ii)  the Commissioner gives the * initial head company instalment rate to the former provisional head company of the MEC group during the starting quarter;

                            (iii)  the Commissioner is notified during the starting quarter of the creation of the MEC group from a * consolidated group and Subdivision 45-Q applied to the * head company of the consolidated group at the end of the previous instalment quarter;

                            (iv)  the Commissioner is notified during the starting quarter of the creation of the MEC group from a consolidated group and the Commissioner gives the initial head company instalment rate to the head company of the consolidated group during the starting quarter.

Notification of creation of MEC group from consolidated group

             (5)  For the purposes of subsections (3) and (4), the Commissioner is notified of the creation of a * MEC group from a * consolidated group when the Commissioner receives a notice of the consolidation of the MEC group under subsection 719-40(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

When the period ends

             (6)  Subdivision 45-Q stops applying to a company as the * provisional head company of a * MEC group at the earliest of the following times after the company becomes the provisional head company:

                     (a)  the end of the * instalment quarter during which the MEC group ceases to exist (other than because a * consolidated group is * created from the MEC group);

                     (b)  the end of the instalment quarter during which a consolidated group is created from the MEC group;

                     (c)  just before the instalment quarter during which another company is appointed as the provisional head company of the MEC group under subsection 719-60(3) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

Note:          The operation of this subsection because of paragraph (a) may be affected by section 45-880 (as applied under this Subdivision).

             (7)  To avoid doubt, Subdivision 45-Q does not apply to a company as the * provisional head company of a * MEC group for any time at all if:

                     (a)  subsection (2), (3) or (4), and subsection (6), would, apart from this subsection, apply to the company; but

                     (b)  the time at which Subdivision 45-Q would stop applying to the company under subsection (6) is before the time at which that Subdivision would start to apply to the company under subsection (2), (3) or (4).

             (8)  To avoid doubt, Subdivision 45-Q may apply to a company as the * provisional head company of a * MEC group at a time when the company is not in fact the provisional head company of the group.

Note:          An example of this is when a company replaces another company as the provisional head company of a MEC group. Under this section and section 45-920, Subdivision 45-Q may start applying to the company as if it had already become the provisional head company when it is not yet such a company.

##### <a id="45-917"></a>45-917  Assumption for applying section 45-710 (single entity rule)

                   In applying section 45-710 to members of a * MEC group at a particular time, the company that is the * provisional head company of the group at that time must be assumed to be the * head company of the group at all times during the period:

                     (a)  throughout which the group is in existence; and

                     (b)  that is all or a part of the income year of the company that includes that particular time.

##### <a id="45-920"></a>45-920  Change of provisional head company

Object

             (1)  The object of this section (except subsection (9)) is to ensure that, for the purposes of this Part, when a company becomes the new * provisional head company of a * MEC group:

                     (a)  the company inherits the history of the former provisional head company; and

                     (b)  the history of the new provisional head company is effectively ignored.

             (2)  This section applies to a * provisional head company of a * MEC group (the **_new provisional head company_**) that is appointed under subsection 719-60(3) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ if one of the following conditions is satisfied:

                     (a)  the conditions in subsection 45-915(4) are satisfied in relation to the new provisional head company (whether or not Subdivision 45-Q applies to the company as the provisional head company of the group for any period of time);

                     (b)  the new provisional head company is so appointed during the * instalment quarter of the company in which the MEC group is * created from a * consolidated group and either:

                              (i)  the Commissioner gives the * initial head company instalment rate to the * head company of the consolidated group during that instalment quarter; or

                             (ii)  Subdivision 45-Q applied to the head company of the consolidated group at the end of the previous instalment quarter.

             (3)  Everything that happened before the starting time in relation to the company (the **_former company_**) that was the * provisional head company of the * MEC group immediately before the starting time:

                     (a)  is taken to have happened in relation to the new provisional head company instead of in relation to the former company; and

                     (b)  is taken to have happened in relation to the new provisional head company instead of what would (apart from this section) be taken to have happened in relation to the new provisional head company before the starting time;

just as if, at all times before the starting time:

                     (c)  the new provisional head company had been the former company; and

                     (d)  the former company had been the new provisional head company.

             (4)  For the purposes of this section, the **_starting time_** is the time at which the * cessation event happened to the former company (the event that results in the appointment of the new provisional head company).

             (5)  To avoid doubt, subsection (3) also covers everything that, immediately before the starting time, was taken to have happened in relation to the former company because of:

                     (a)  section 701-1 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_(single entity rule); or

                     (b)  section 701-5 of that Act (entry history rule); or

                     (c)  section 703-75 of that Act (effects of an interposed company becoming the * head company of a * consolidated group); or

                     (d)  section 719-90 of that Act (effects of a change of head company of a * MEC group); or

                     (e)  section 45-710 in this Schedule (single entity rule for the purposes of this Part), including an application of that section under this Subdivision; or

                      (f)  section 45-740 in this Schedule (effects of an interposed company becoming the head company of a consolidated group for the purposes of this Part); or

                     (g)  this section; or

                     (h)  one or more previous applications of any of the provisions covered by paragraphs (a) to (g).

             (6)  In addition, and without affecting subsection (3):

                     (a)  an assessment of the former company for an income year that ends before the income year that includes the starting time; or

                     (b)  an amendment of the assessment;

is taken to be something that had happened to the new provisional head company, whether or not the assessment or amendment is made before the starting time.

             (7)  This section has effect for the purposes of applying this Part to members of the * MEC group in relation to an * instalment quarter of the new provisional head company that ends after the starting time.

Note:          An assessment mentioned in subsection (6) may therefore be taken to be the base assessment of the new provisional head company for the purposes of this Part.

             (8)  Subsections (1) to (7) are to be disregarded in applying section 45-915 (about the application of Subdivision 45-Q to a company as the * provisional head company of a * MEC group).

Note:          For example, if the Commissioner has given an initial head company instalment rate to the former company during an earlier instalment quarter, the rate is not, despite this section, treated as if it had been given to the new provisional head company for the purposes of section 45-915\. Subject to the other provisions in that section, Subdivision 45-Q therefore starts applying to the new provisional head company under subsection 45-915(4).

Special rule for the former company

             (9)  A provision of this Part that applies on an entity becoming a member (other than the * provisional head company) of a * MEC group does not apply to the former company when it becomes such a member at the starting time.

Note:          Section 45-755 (the entry rule, as applied under this Subdivision) therefore does not apply to the former company on the company becoming such a member of the MEC group.

##### <a id="45-922"></a>45-922  Life insurance company

                   In applying Subdivision 45-Q to members of a * MEC group for an * instalment quarter of the * provisional head company of the group in an income year of the provisional head company, the company is taken to be a * life insurance company for that quarter if:

                     (a)  one or more life insurance companies are members of the group at any time during that quarter; or

                     (b)  one or more life insurance companies were members of the group at any time during a previous instalment quarter of the company in that year.

#### Extended operation of Subdivision 45-R

##### <a id="45-925"></a>45-925  Additional modifications of sections 45-855 and 45-860

                   In applying sections 45-855 and 45-860 to members of a * MEC group, those sections have effect as if, in addition to the modifications set out in the table in section 45-910:

                     (a)  a reference in those sections to subsection 45-705(2) were a reference to subsection 45-915(2); and

                     (b)  a reference in those sections to subparagraph 45-705(3)(c)(ii), (4)(d)(ii) or (iv) were a reference to subparagraph 45-915(3)(c)(ii), (4)(b)(ii) or (iv).

##### <a id="45-930"></a>45-930  Modifications of sections 45-865 and 45-870 and a related provision

             (1)  In applying sections 45-865 and 45-870, and subsection 45-30(4) (which is related to section 45-865), to members of a * MEC group, those provisions have effect as if:

                     (a)  a reference in those provisions to a * consolidated group were a reference to a * MEC group; and

                     (b)  a reference in those provisions to a MEC group were a reference to a consolidated group.

Note:          This means a reference in those provisions to the head company of a consolidated group has effect as if it were a reference to the head company of a MEC group. Similarly, a reference in those provisions to a subsidiary member of a consolidated group has effect as if it were a reference to a subsidiary member of a MEC group.

             (2)  However, the modifications in subsection (1) do not apply to subsection 45-865(4) and the note at the end of section 45-865.

Note:          This means subsection 45-865(4) and the note apply to members of a MEC group without any modifications.

##### <a id="45-935"></a>45-935  Additional modifications of section 45-885

                   In applying section 45-885 to members of a * MEC group, that section has effect as if, in addition to the modifications set out in the table in section 45-910, it had been modified as set out in the following table:

210-20      Limits on venture capital franking

##### <a id="210-1"></a>210-1  Purpose of venture capital franking

                   The purpose of these rules is to encourage venture capital investment by superannuation funds and other entities that deal with superannuation.

##### <a id="210-5"></a>210-5  How is this achieved?

                   This is done by giving tax benefits to those entities when they invest in PDFs, which are the vehicles for venture capital investment. If the PDF makes a distribution franked with a venture capital credit, the relevant venture capital investor receives a certain part of a distribution from the PDF as exempt income and, in addition, is entitled to a tax offset equal to the venture capital credit.

##### <a id="210-10"></a>210-10  What is a venture capital credit?

             (1)  There is a venture capital franking sub-account in the franking account of each PDF.

             (2)  Venture capital credits arise in the sub-account if the PDF pays income tax that is reasonably attributable to capital gains from venture capital investments.

##### <a id="210-15"></a>210-15  What does the PDF have to do to distribute the credits?

                   Only a participating PDF can distribute venture capital credits. A PDF elects to participate by keeping a record of its venture capital sub-account.

##### <a id="210-20"></a>210-20  Limits on venture capital franking

             (1)  The venture capital credit on a distribution cannot exceed the franking credit on the distribution. It is, in this sense, a species of franking credit.

             (2)  A PDF can only distribute venture capital credits if it does it so that all members of the PDF receive venture capital credits in proportion to their holdings.

             (3)  If a PDF has a venture capital surplus when it makes a distribution, it must frank the distribution with venture capital credits.

             (4)  There are measures to ensure that a PDF does not maintain a venture capital deficit over a prolonged period.

             (1)  If a * participating PDF would otherwise have a * venture capital surplus at the time a * distribution that is * frankable with a venture capital credit is made, the PDF must either:

                     (a)  allocate a * venture capital credit to the distribution that is equal to the * franking credit on the distribution; or

                     (b)  allocate a venture capital credit to the distribution that either alone or when added to venture capital credits allocated to other distributions made under the resolution of the PDF under which the distribution in question is made, reduces the surplus to nil, or creates a * venture capital deficit.

             (2)  A * venture capital debit arises for a * participating PDF when a * distribution is made if the PDF does not allocate a * venture capital credit in accordance with subsection (1). The amount of the debit is:

##### <a id="210-90"></a>210-90  The venture capital sub-account

             (1)  Each PDF has a venture capital sub-account in its franking account. The sub-account exists even if the PDF does not elect to become a participating PDF by keeping a record of it.

             (2)  To the extent that income tax is reasonably attributable to capital gains from venture capital investments, it generates a venture capital credit in the sub-account. There are other circumstances in which a venture capital credit arises.

             (3)  If a PDF receives a refund of that tax, a venture capital debit will arise for the PDF. There are other circumstances in which a venture capital debit will arise, such as on the payment of a distribution franked with a venture capital credit.

##### <a id="210-95"></a>210-95  Venture capital deficit tax

             (1)  Venture capital deficit tax is payable if a PDF’s venture capital sub-account is in deficit at the end of the PDF’s income year, or immediately before it ceases to be a PDF.

             (2)  A PDF’s venture capital sub-account may be in deficit, even if its franking account is not. This can happen because only income tax on income of a particular kind (capital gains on venture capital investments) gives rise to venture capital credits. This means that when a PDF anticipates a venture capital credit, it is not only anticipating that income tax will be paid, but that income tax on income of that kind will be paid. Although income tax may, in fact, later be paid, it will not necessarily be income of the kind that would give rise to a venture capital credit. This results in franking credits arising even while the venture capital sub-account remains in deficit.

             (3)  The discrepancy between the franking account balance and the venture capital sub-account balance can also arise because venture capital credits do not necessarily arise at the same time as the relevant franking credits and debits (see item 1 of the table in section 210-105 and item 2 of the table in section 210-120).

Tax paid by the PDF on its SME income component

             (4)  The **_tax paid by the PDF on its SME income component_** for the income year is the tax paid by the * PDF on its * SME income component after allowing * tax offsets referred to in section 4-10 _._

##### <a id="210-130"></a>210-130  Venture capital surplus and deficit

             (1)  A * PDF’s * venture capital sub-account is in **_surplus_** at a particular time if, at that time, the sum of the * venture capital credits in the account exceeds the sum of the * venture capital debits in the account. The amount of the **_venture capital surplus_** is the amount of the excess.

             (2)  A * PDF’s * venture capital sub-account is in **_deficit_** at a particular time if, at that time, the sum of the * venture capital debits in the account exceeds the sum of the * venture capital credits in the account. The amount of the **_venture capital deficit_** is the amount of the excess.

             (3)  A * PDF’s * venture capital sub-account may be in * deficit even though its * franking account as a whole is in * surplus. Similarly, a PDF’s venture capital sub-account may be in surplus even though its franking account as a whole is in deficit.

##### <a id="210-135"></a>210-135  Venture capital deficit tax

             (1)  While recognising that an entity may anticipate * venture capital credits when * franking * distributions, the object of this section is to prevent those credits from being anticipated indefinitely by requiring the entity to reconcile its * venture capital sub-account at certain times and levying tax if the account is in * deficit.

             (2)  An entity is liable to pay * venture capital deficit tax imposed by the _New Business Tax System (Venture Capital Deficit Tax) Act 2003_ if its * venture capital sub-account is in * deficit at the end of an income year.

             (3)  An entity is liable to pay * venture capital deficit tax imposed by the _New Business Tax System (Venture Capital Deficit Tax) Act 2003_ if:

                     (a)  it ceases to be a * PDF; and

                     (b)  immediately before it ceases to be a PDF, its * venture capital sub-account is in * deficit.

##### <a id="210-140"></a>210-140  Effect of a liability to pay venture capital deficit tax on franking deficit tax

             (1)  If an entity is liable to pay * venture capital deficit tax under subsection 210-135(2) because its * venture capital sub-account is in * deficit at the end of an income year, the amount (if any) of * franking deficit tax that the entity would otherwise be liable to pay under subsection 205-45(2) because its * franking account is in * deficit at that time is reduced by the amount of the liability for venture capital deficit tax.

             (2)  If an entity is liable to pay * venture capital deficit tax under subsection 210-135(3) because it ceases to be a * PDF during an income year, the amount (if any) of * franking deficit tax that the entity would otherwise be liable to pay under subsection 205-45(3) because it ceases to be a * franking entity at that time is reduced by the amount of the liability for * venture capital deficit tax.

##### <a id="210-145"></a>210-145  Effect of a liability to pay venture capital deficit tax on the franking account

             (1)  If an entity incurs a liability to pay * venture capital deficit tax, a * franking credit arises for the entity immediately after the liability arises (the **_relevant day_**).

             (2)  The amount of the * franking credit is equal to:

                     (a)  if no liability to pay * franking deficit tax arises on the relevant day—the amount of the * venture capital deficit tax; or

                     (b)  if a liability to pay franking deficit tax also arises on the relevant day—the amount of the venture capital deficit tax reduced by the amount of the franking deficit tax.

##### <a id="210-150"></a>210-150  Deferring venture capital deficit

             (1)  The object of this section is to ensure that an entity does not avoid * venture capital deficit tax by deferring the time at which a * venture capital debit occurs.

             (2)  A * refund of income tax for an income year is taken to have been paid to an entity immediately before the end of that year for the purposes of subsection 210-135(2), if:

                     (a)  the refund is paid within 3 months after the end of that year; and

                     (b)  the entity’s * venture capital sub-account would have been in * deficit, or in deficit to a greater extent, at the end of the previous income year if the refund had been received in the previous income year.

             (3)  If an entity ceases to be a * PDF during an income year, a * refund of income tax is taken to have been paid to it immediately before it ceased to be a PDF, for the purposes of subsection 210-135(3), if:

                     (a)  the refund is attributable to a period in the year during which the entity was a PDF; and

                     (b)  the refund is paid within 3 months after the entity ceases to be a PDF; and

                     (c)  the * venture capital sub-account of the entity would have been in * deficit, or in deficit to a greater extent, immediately before it ceased to be a PDF if the refund had been received before it ceased to be a PDF.

##### <a id="210-160"></a>210-160  The significance of a venture capital credit

             (1)  The venture capital credit on a distribution is only significant in the hands of a relevant venture capital investor (basically a superannuation fund or other entity that deals with superannuation).

             (2)  That investor  receives a tax offset. In most cases, this will be equal to the venture capital credit.

             (3)  Under section 124ZM of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, that part of the distribution that is franked with a venture capital credit is also treated as exempt income in the hands of the entity.

##### <a id="210-165"></a>210-165  Recipients for whom the venture capital credit is not significant

             (1)  For other entities, the fact that all or part of the franking credit on a distribution is also a venture capital credit can be ignored.

             (2)  The franking credit will either generate a gross-up of the entity’s assessable income and a corresponding tax offset under Division 207 or, if the right to make an election under section 124ZM of the _Income Tax Assessment 1936_ is exercised, the franked part of the distribution will be treated as exempt income.

             (3)  The unfranked part of the distribution is treated as exempt income under section 124ZM of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

#### Operative provisions

##### <a id="210-170"></a>210-170  Tax offset for certain recipients of distributions franked with venture capital credits

             (1)  The recipient of a * distribution * franked with a venture capital credit is entitled to a * tax offset for the income year in which the distribution is made if:

                     (a)  the recipient is a relevant venture capital investor; and

                     (b)  the recipient is not:

                              (i)  a * partnership; or

                             (ii)  a trustee (other than the trustee of an eligible entity within the meaning of Part IX of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_); and

                     (c)  the recipient satisfies the * residency requirement for an entity receiving a distribution; and

                     (d)  the distribution is not * exempt income of the recipient (ignoring section 124ZM of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_); and

                     (e)  the recipient is not a qualified person in relation to the distribution for the purposes of Division 1A of Part IIIAA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; and

                      (f)  the distribution is not part of a * dividend stripping operation; and

                     (g)  the Commissioner has not made a determination under paragraph 204-30(3)(c) that no * imputation benefit is to arise for the receiving entity in respect of the distribution; and

                     (h)  the Commissioner has not made a determination under paragraph 177EA(5)(b) that no imputation benefit is to arise in respect of the distribution to the recipient.

Relevant venture capital investors

             (2)  The following entities are **_relevant venture capital investors_**:

                     (a)  the trustee of a fund that is a * complying superannuation fund in relation to the income year in which the * distribution is made and is not a self managed superannuation fund (within the meaning of the _Superannuation Industry Supervision Act 1993_);

                     (b)  the trustee of a fund that is a * complying approved deposit fund in relation to the income year in which the distribution is made and is not a self managed superannuation fund (within the meaning of the _Superannuation Industry Supervision Act 1993_);

                     (c)  the trustee of a unit trust that is a * pooled superannuation trust in relation to the income year in which the distribution is made;

                     (d) a * life insurance company.

##### <a id="210-175"></a>210-175  Amount of the tax offset

Where the recipient is not a life insurance company

             (1)  If the entity receiving the * distribution is not a * life insurance company, the * tax offset is equal to the * venture capital credit on the distribution.

Where the recipient is a life insurance company

             (2)  If the entity receiving the * distribution is a * life insurance company, the * tax offset is worked out using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00604/Html/NewBusTaxSysConsOtherMeas2003_image018.gif)

where:

                    <a name="compli-superannu-class-taxabl-incom"></a>**_complying superannuation class of taxable income_** means the * complying superannuation class of taxable income of the company for the income year in which the * distribution is made.

                    <a name="tax-offset-entiti-otherwis-entitled"></a>**_tax offset to which the entity would otherwise be entitled_** is the * tax offset that the company would be entitled to under subsection (1) if the entity were not a life insurance company.

                    <a name="total-incom"></a>**_total income_** is the company’s assessable income for the income year.

##### <a id="210-180"></a>210-180  Application of Division 207 where the recipient is entitled to a tax offset under section 210-170

                   If the recipient of a * distribution * franked with a venture capital credit is entitled to a * tax offset under section 210-170, Division 207 does not apply to that * part of the distribution that is venture capital franked.

                   The venture capital sub-account of a PDF under Part IIIAA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_(the **_old sub-account_**_)_ is closed off at the end of 30 June 2002 and an opening balance is created in the PDF’s venture capital sub-account under section 210-100 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ as follows:

                     (a)  any estimated venture capital debits in the old sub-account at the end of 30 June 2002 are washed out of the account under section 210-5; and

                     (b)  then:

                              (i)  in the case of a PDF whose 2001-02 franking year ends on 30 June 2002 under Part IIIAA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_—the PDF’s venture capital sub-account balance is converted under section 210-10 to a tax paid basis; and

                             (ii)  in the case of a PDF whose 2001-02 franking year ends before 30 June 2002 under Part IIIAA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_—the PDF’s venture capital sub-account balance is converted under section 210-15 to a tax paid basis.

##### <a id="210-5"></a>210-5  Washing estimated venture capital debits out of the old sub-account before conversion

                   If, under Part IIIAA of the _Income Tax Assessment act 1936_, the termination time in relation to an estimated venture capital debit of a PDF would, but for this section, occur after the end of 30 June 2002, it is taken to have occurred at the end of 30 June 2002.

##### <a id="210-10"></a>210-10  Converting the venture capital sub-account balance to a tax paid basis—PDFs whose 2001-02 franking year ends on 30 June 2002

             (1)  This section applies to PDFs whose 2001-02 franking year ends on 30 June 2002 under Part IIIAA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_(the **_1936 Act_**).

             (2)  If the PDF has a venture capital surplus under Part IIIAA of the 1936 Act at the end of 30 June 2002:

                     (a)  no venture capital credit arises under section 160ASEE of that Act because of the surplus; and

                     (b)  a venture capital credit arises on 1 July 2002 in the venture capital sub-account established under section 210-100 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ for the PDF.

             (3)  The amount of the venture capital credit is worked out using the following formula:

             (2)  If, but for this subsection, the PDF would have a venture capital surplus under Part IIIAA of the 1936 Act at the end of 30 June 2002 (the **_original surplus_**):

                     (a)  a venture capital debit equal to the original surplus is taken to arise for the PDF under Part IIIAA of the 1936 Act at the end of 30 June 2002; and

                     (b)  a venture capital credit arises on 1 July 2002 in the venture capital sub-account established under section 210-100 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_(the **_1997 Act_**) for the PDF.

             (3)  The amount of the venture capital credit is worked out using the formula:

###### Schedule 28—Machinery provisions for simplified imputation system

<h9 class="ActHead9">Income Tax Assessment Act 1997</h9>

## 1  Subsections 202-75(2) and (3)

Repeal the subsections, substitute:

             (2)  The statement must be given on or before the day on which the * distribution is made, unless the entity is allowed to give the statement at a later time under subsection (3).

             (3)  If the entity is a * private company for the income year in which the * distribution is made, the statement must be given:

                     (a)  before the end of 4 months after the end of the income year in which the distribution is made; or

                     (b)  before the time determined by the Commissioner under subsection (5);

whichever is later.

             (4)  However, the entity is not allowed to give the statement at a later time under subsection (3) if the statement indicates that a * franking credit has been allocated to the * distribution and the franking credit would, either alone or when added to other franking credits allocated to other distributions made by the entity during the income year, result in the entity having a liability for * franking deficit tax, or an increased liability for franking deficit tax, at the end of the income year.

Note:          The combined effect of subsections (3) and (4) is that a private company can retrospectively frank a distribution, but not so as to create or increase a liability for franking deficit tax.

             (5)  The Commissioner may determine in writing that a * private company may give the statement before a time specified in the determination.

## 2  At the end of subsection 204-75(4)

Add:

and must be given to the Commissioner:

                     (a)  if the entity is required to give the Commissioner a * franking return for the income year in which the current franking period occurs—with that return; or

                     (b)  otherwise—within one month after the end of the income year in which the current franking period occurs.

##### <a id="214-1"></a>214-1  Purpose of the system

                   These provisions:

                     (a)  allow the Commissioner to gather sufficient information to determine whether tax is payable by a corporate tax entity under the imputation system; and

                     (b)  provide for the Commissioner to assess the amount of tax that is payable; and

                     (c)  specify when the tax is payable; and

                     (d)  establish systems to support the assessment and collection of the tax.

##### <a id="214-5"></a>214-5  Key features

             (1)  Initial information about a corporate tax entity’s franking activities is provided by means of a return, called a franking return, given by the entity to the Commissioner.

             (2)  The Commissioner is able to require corporate tax entities to give a franking return for an income year by publishing a notice in the _Gazette_.

             (3)  The Commissioner is also able to require a particular corporate tax entity to give a franking return for one or more income years. The Commissioner might do this, for example, if the Commissioner wishes to audit the corporate tax entity’s franking activities over a number of years.

             (4)  The Commissioner may assess whether tax is payable under the imputation system and the amount of that tax.

             (5)  In most cases, this is done by treating the first return of a corporate tax entity for an income year as an assessment by the Commissioner. To this extent, there is self-assessment.

             (6)  An assessment by the Commissioner is conclusive evidence of a corporate tax entity’s tax liabilities under the imputation system, except for the purposes of objection, review and appeal processes under Part IVC of the _Tax Administration Act 1953_(see section 177 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ and sections 214-50 and 214-85 of this Act).

### Division 214—Administering the imputation system

##### <a id="214-1"></a>214-1  Application

                   This Division  applies to a corporate tax entity if a liability to pay franking deficit tax arises for the entity under section 205-25 of this Act because of events that occur within a period of 12 months ending on 30 June in any year (the **_balancing period_**).

##### <a id="214-5"></a>214-5  Entity must give a franking return

             (1)  The entity must give the Commissioner a franking return for the balancing period setting out the following information before the end of the month immediately following the end of the period:

                     (a)  if the entity is a franking entity at the end of the balancing period—its franking account balance at the end of the period; and

                     (b)  if the entity ceases to be a franking entity during the balancing period—its franking account balance immediately before it ceased to be a franking entity; and

                     (c)  the amount (if any) of franking deficit tax that the entity is liable to pay under section 205-25 of this Act because of events that have occurred, or are taken to have occurred, during the balancing period.

             (2)  The return must be in writing in the approved form.

##### <a id="214-10"></a>214-10  Notice to a specific corporate tax entity

             (1)  The Commissioner may give the entity a written notice requiring the entity to give the Commissioner a franking return for the balancing period.

             (2)  The entity must comply with the requirement within the time specified in the notice, or within any further time allowed by the Commissioner.

             (3)  The entity must comply with the requirement regardless of whether the entity has given, or has been required to give, the Commissioner a return under section 214-5.

##### <a id="214-15"></a>214-15  Effect of a refund on franking returns

If no franking return is outstanding

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  the entity receives a refund of income tax; and

                     (b)  the receipt of the refund gives rise to a liability, or an increased liability, to pay franking deficit tax because of the operation of subsection 205-30(2) or (3) of this Act; and

                     (c)  when the refund is received, the entity does not have a franking return that is outstanding for the balancing period in which the liability arose;

the entity must give the Commissioner a franking return for the period within 14 days after the refund is received.

Refund received within 14 days before an outstanding franking return is due

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  the entity receives a refund of income tax; and

                     (b)  the receipt of the refund gives rise to a liability, or an increased liability, to pay franking deficit tax because of the operation of subsection 205-30(2) or (3) of this Act; and

                     (c)  when the refund is received, the entity does not have a franking return that is outstanding for the balancing period in which the liability arose; and

                     (d)  the entity receives the refund within the period of 14 days ending on the day by which the outstanding return must be given to the Commissioner;

the entity may, instead of accounting for the liability, or increased liability, in the outstanding return, account for it in a further return given to the Commissioner within 14 days after the refund is received.

Meaning of **outstanding**

             (3)  A franking return for a balancing period is **_outstanding_** at a particular time if each of the following is true at that time:

                     (b)  the time within which the franking return must be given has not yet passed;

##### <a id="214-20"></a>214-20  Franking returns for the income year

             (2)  However, if an entity is required to give a franking return for a balancing period, it is not required to include in its franking return for the income year in which that period ends anything that should have been included in the franking return for the balancing period.

##### <a id="214-25"></a>214-25  Commissioner may make a franking assessment

             (1)  The Commissioner may make an assessment of:

                     (b)  if the entity ceases to be a franking entity during the balancing period—its franking account balance immediately before it ceased to be a franking entity; and

                     (c)  the amount (if any) of franking deficit tax that the entity is liable to pay under section 205-25 of this Act because of events that have occurred, or are taken to have occurred, during the balancing period.

This is a **_franking assessment_** for the entity for the balancing period.

             (2)  The Commissioner must give the entity notice of the assessment as soon as practicable after making the assessment.

             (3)  The notice may be included in a notice of any other assessment under this Act.

##### <a id="214-30"></a>214-30  Commissioner taken to have made a franking assessment on first return

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  the entity gives the Commissioner a franking return under section 214-5 or 214-10 of this Act on a particular day (the **_return day_**); and

                     (c)  the Commissioner has not already made a franking assessment for the entity for that period;

the Commissioner is taken to have made a franking assessment for the entity for the period on the return day, and to have assessed:

                     (e)  the amount (if any) of franking deficit tax payable by the entity because of events that have occurred, or are taken to have occurred, during the period as those stated in the return.

             (2)  The return is taken to be notice of the assessment signed by the Commissioner and given to the entity on the return day.

##### <a id="214-35"></a>214-35  Amendments within 3 years of the original assessment

             (1)  The Commissioner may amend a franking assessment for the entity for the balancing period at any time during the period of 3 years after the original assessment day for the entity for the period.

             (2)  The **_original assessment day_** for the entity for the balancing period is the day on which the first franking assessment for the entity for the period is made.

##### <a id="214-40"></a>214-40  Amended assessments are treated as franking assessments

                   Once an amended franking assessment for the entity for the balancing period is made, it is taken to be a **_franking assessment_** for the entity for the period.

##### <a id="214-45"></a>214-45  Further return as a result of a refund affecting a franking deficit tax liability

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a franking assessment for the entity for the balancing period has been made; and

                     (b)  on a particular day (the **_further return day_**) the entity gives the Commissioner a further return for the balancing period under subsection 214-15(1) of this Act (because the entity has received a refund of income tax that affects its liability to pay franking deficit tax);

the Commissioner is taken to have amended the entity’s franking assessment on the further return day, and to have assessed:

                     (c)  the entity’s franking account balance at a particular time as that stated in the further return as the balance at that time; and

                     (d)  the amount of franking deficit tax payable by the entity because of events that have occurred, or are taken to have occurred, during the period as those stated in the further return.

             (2)  The further return is taken to be notice of the amended assessment signed by the Commissioner and given to the entity on the further return day.

##### <a id="214-50"></a>214-50  Later amendments—on request

                   The Commissioner may amend a franking assessment for the entity for the balancing period after the end of a period of 3 years after the original franking assessment day if, within that 3 year period:

                     (a)  the entity applies for the amendment; and

                     (b)  the entity gives the Commissioner all the information necessary for making the amendment.

##### <a id="214-55"></a>214-55  Later amendments—failure to make proper disclosure

                   If:

                     (b)  in making the assessment, the Commissioner makes an under-assessment; and

                     (c)  the Commissioner is not of the opinion that the under-assessment is due to fraud or evasion;

                     (c)  the Commissioner is of the opinion that the under-assessment is due to fraud or evasion;

the Commissioner may amend the assessment at any time.

##### <a id="214-65"></a>214-65  Further amendment of an amended particular

                   If:

                     (a)  a franking assessment for the entity for the balancing period has been amended (the **_first amendment_**) in any particular; and

                     (b)  the Commissioner is of the opinion that it would be just to further amend the assessment in that particular so as to reduce the assessment;

the Commissioner may do so within a period of 3 years after the first amendment.

##### <a id="214-70"></a>214-70  Other later amendments

                   In a case not covered by sections 214-50, 214-55, 214-60 or 214-65, the Commissioner may amend the franking assessment for the entity for the balancing period after the period of 3 years after the original assessment day has expired, but not so as to reduce the assessment.

##### <a id="214-75"></a>214-75  Amendment on review etc.

                   Nothing in this Division prevents the amendment of a franking assessment for the entity for the balancing period:

##### <a id="214-85"></a>214-85  Validity of assessment

                   If a corporate tax entity is dissatisfied with a franking assessment made in relation to the entity under this Division, the entity may object against the assessment in the manner set out in Part IVC of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

##### <a id="214-95"></a>214-95  Evidence

The notice is taken to have been served on the day on which the publication takes place.

Evidence of determination

                     (a)  a notice of a determination; or

                     (b)  a document signed by the Commissioner, a Second Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner purporting to be a copy of a determination;

                              (i)  the Commissioner considers reasonable in the circumstances; and

                             (ii)  does not exceed the amount of the franking debit or exempting debit of the entity arising under item 1 of the table in section 205-30 of the _Income Tax Assessment 1997_ or item 2 of the table in section 208-120 of that Act in respect of the distribution.

                     (b)  whether the relevant taxpayer would, in the year of income in which the distribution is made, or if the distribution flows indirectly to the relevant taxpayer, in the year in which the distribution flows indirectly to the relevant taxpayer, derive a greater benefit from franking credits than other entities who hold membership interests, or have interests in membership interests, in the corporate tax entity;

                     (c)  whether, apart from the scheme, the corporate tax entity would have retained the franking credits or exempting credits or would have used the franking credits or exempting credits to pay a franked distribution to another entity referred to in paragraph (b);

                     (e)  if the scheme involves the issue of a non-share equity interest to which section 215-10 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies—whether the corporate tax entity has issued, or is likely to issue, equity interests in the corporate tax entity:

                              (i)  that are similar, from a commercial point of view, to the non-share equity interest; and

                             (ii)  distributions in respect of which are frankable;

                     (h)  whether a distribution that is made or that flows indirectly under the scheme to the relevant taxpayer is equivalent to the receipt by the relevant taxpayer of interest or of an amount in the nature of, or similar to, interest;

                      (i)  the period for which the relevant taxpayer held membership interests, or had an interest in membership interests, in the corporate tax entity;

                      (j)  any of the matters referred to in subparagraphs 177D(b)(i) to (viii).

Meaning of **greater benefit from franking credits**

           (18)  The following subsection lists some of the cases in which a taxpayer to whom a distribution flows indirectly receives a **_greater benefit from franking credits_** than an entity referred to in paragraph (17)(b). It is not an exhaustive list.

           (19)  A taxpayer to whom a distribution flows indirectly receives a **_greater benefit from franking credits_** than an entity referred to in paragraph (17)(b) if any of the following circumstances exist in relation to that entity in the income year in which the distribution giving rise to the benefit is made, and not in relation to the taxpayer if:

                     (a)  the entity is not an Australian resident; or

                     (b)  the entity  would not be entitled to any tax offset under Division 207 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ because of the distribution; or

                     (c)  the amount of income tax that would be payable by the entity because of the distribution is less than the tax offset to which the entity would be entitled; or

                     (d)  the entity  is a corporate tax entity at the time the distribution is made, but no franking credit arises for the entity as a result of the distribution; or

                     (e)  the entity  is a corporate tax entity at the time the distribution is made, but cannot use franking credits received on the distribution to frank distributions to its own members because:

                              (i)  it is not a franking entity; or

                             (ii)  it is unable to make frankable distributions.

Note:          Where the distribution is made directly to the taxpayer, see subsections 204-30(7), (8), (9) and (10) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ for a list of circumstances in which the taxpayer will be treated as deriving a greater benefit from franking credits than another entity.
