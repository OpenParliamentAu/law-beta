##### <a id="3"></a>3  Object

                   The object of this Act is to introduce a single national reporting framework for the reporting and dissemination of information related to greenhouse gas emissions, greenhouse gas projects, energy consumption and energy production of corporations to:

                     (a)  underpin the introduction of an emissions trading scheme in the future; and

                     (b)  inform government policy formulation and the Australian public; and

                     (c)  meet Australia’s international reporting obligations; and

                     (d)  assist Commonwealth, State and Territory government programs and activities; and

                     (e)  avoid the duplication of similar reporting requirements in the States and Territories.

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Constitutional basis for Act

                   This Act relies on:

                     (a)  the Commonwealth’s legislative powers under paragraphs 51(xi), (xx), (xxix) and (xxxix) of the Constitution; and

                     (b)  any implied legislative powers of the Commonwealth.

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Act excludes some State and Territory laws

                   This Act is intended to apply to the exclusion of a law of a State or Territory, or a part of such a law:

                     (a)  that provides for the reporting or disclosure of information related to:

                              (i)  greenhouse gas emissions; or

                             (ii)  greenhouse gas projects; or

                            (iii)  energy consumption; or

                            (iv)  energy production; and

                     (b)  that the regulations provide is a law, or part of a law, to which this section applies;

so far as the law, or part of the law, would otherwise apply in relation to a constitutional corporation.

Determining amount of pecuniary penalty

             (4)  In determining the pecuniary penalty, the Court must have regard to all relevant matters, including:

Conduct contravening more than one civil penalty provision

             (5)  If conduct constitutes a contravention of 2 or more civil penalty provisions, proceedings may be instituted under this Act against a person in relation to the contravention of any one or more of those provisions.

#### Subdivision B—Civil penalty proceedings and criminal proceedings

##### <a id="35"></a>35  Civil proceedings after criminal proceedings

                   A Court must not make a pecuniary penalty order against a person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision if the person has been convicted of an offence constituted by conduct that is substantially the same as the conduct constituting the contravention.

##### <a id="36"></a>36  Criminal proceedings during civil proceedings

##### <a id="38"></a>38  Evidence given in proceedings for penalty not admissible in criminal proceedings

                   Evidence of information given or evidence of production of documents by an individual is not admissible in criminal proceedings against the individual if:

                     (a)  the individual previously gave the evidence or produced the documents in proceedings for a pecuniary penalty order against the individual for a contravention of a civil penalty provision (whether or not the order was made); and

                     (b)  the conduct alleged to constitute the offence is substantially the same as the conduct that was claimed to constitute the contravention.

However, this does not apply to criminal proceedings in respect of the falsity of the evidence given by the individual in the proceedings for the pecuniary penalty order.
