##### <a id="3"></a>3  Object

                   The object of this Act is to introduce a single national reporting framework for the reporting and dissemination of information related to greenhouse gas emissions, greenhouse gas projects, energy consumption and energy production of corporations to:

                     (a)  underpin the introduction of an emissions trading scheme in the future; and

                     (b)  inform government policy formulation and the Australian public; and

                     (c)  meet Australia’s international reporting obligations; and

                     (d)  assist Commonwealth, State and Territory government programs and activities; and

                     (e)  avoid the duplication of similar reporting requirements in the States and Territories.

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Constitutional basis for Act

                   This Act relies on:

                     (a)  the Commonwealth’s legislative powers under paragraphs 51(xi), (xx), (xxix) and (xxxix) of the Constitution; and

                     (b)  any implied legislative powers of the Commonwealth.

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Act excludes some State and Territory laws

                   This Act is intended to apply to the exclusion of a law of a State or Territory, or a part of such a law:

                     (a)  that provides for the reporting or disclosure of information related to:

                              (i)  greenhouse gas emissions; or

                             (ii)  greenhouse gas projects; or

## Part 2—Registration

### Division 1—Applying for registration

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Applying to register in relation to meeting a threshold

             (1)  A controlling corporation must apply, in accordance with this section, to be registered under Division 3 if the corporation’s group meets one or more of the thresholds under section 13 for a financial year (the **_trigger year_**) ending on or after 30 June 2009.

                    Civil penalty:            2,000 penalty units.

Note:          Under section 30 a controlling corporation may be liable for an additional civil penalty for each day that it fails to apply in accordance with subsection (1) of this section.

             (2)  However, a controlling corporation is not required to make an application under subsection (1) in relation to a financial year if:

                     (a)  the corporation has previously made an application under subsection (1) or (3); and

                     (b)  the corporation was registered under Division 3 because of that application; and

## Part 5—Enforcement

### Division 1—Civil penalties

#### Subdivision A—Civil penalty orders

##### <a id="29"></a>29  Civil penalty provisions

                   The following are **_civil penalty provisions_** for the purposes of this Act:

                     (a)  a subsection of this Act (or a section of this Act that is not divided into subsections) if the words “civil penalty” and one or more amounts in penalty units are set out at the foot of the subsection (or section);

                     (b)  a subsection of this Act if another provision of this Act specifies that the subsection is a civil penalty provision.

##### <a id="30"></a>30  Continuing contraventions

             (1)  If an act or thing is required, under a civil penalty provision of this Act, to be done within a particular period, or before a particular time, then the obligation to do that act or thing continues (even if the period has expired or the time has passed) until the act or thing is done.

             (2)  If, under section 12, 19, 20 or 73, an act or thing is required to be done within a particular period, or before a particular time, and a person fails to comply with that requirement, the person is liable for a civil penalty for each day that the person fails to comply.

                    Civil penalty:

                     (a)  for failure to meet a requirement under section 12, 19 or 20—100 penalty units per day; or

                     (b)  for failure to meet a requirement under section 73—10 penalty units per day.

             (3)  To avoid doubt, a person’s failure to comply with such a requirement on a particular day is taken, for the purposes of this Act, not to be the same conduct as the person’s failure to comply with that requirement on a different day.

##### <a id="31"></a>31  Court may order person to pay pecuniary penalty for contravening civil penalty provision

Application for order

             (1)  Within 6 years of a person contravening a civil penalty provision, the Greenhouse and Energy Data Officer may apply, on behalf of the Commonwealth, to a Court for an order that the person pay the Commonwealth a pecuniary penalty.

Court may order person to pay pecuniary penalty

             (2)  If the Court is satisfied that the person has contravened a civil penalty provision, the Court may order the person to pay to the Commonwealth for each contravention the pecuniary penalty that the Court determines is appropriate.

Maximum pecuniary penalty

             (3)  The pecuniary penalty must not exceed the sum of:

                     (a)  the relevant amount specified for the civil penalty provision; and

                     (b)  the amount (if any) for which the person is liable under section 30 at the time the Court makes the order.

Determining amount of pecuniary penalty

             (4)  In determining the pecuniary penalty, the Court must have regard to all relevant matters, including:

                     (a)  the nature and extent of the contravention; and

                     (b)  the nature and extent of any loss or damage suffered as a result of the contravention; and

                     (c)  the circumstances in which the contravention took place; and

                     (d)  whether the person has previously been found by the Court in proceedings under this Act to have engaged in any similar conduct.

Conduct contravening more than one civil penalty provision

             (5)  If conduct constitutes a contravention of 2 or more civil penalty provisions, proceedings may be instituted under this Act against a person in relation to the contravention of any one or more of those provisions. However, the person is not liable to more than one pecuniary penalty under this section in respect of the same conduct.

##### <a id="32"></a>32  Contravening a civil penalty provision is not an offence

                   A contravention of a civil penalty provision is not an offence.

##### <a id="33"></a>33  Persons involved in contravening civil penalty provision

             (1)  A person must not:

                     (a)  aid, abet, counsel or procure a contravention of a civil penalty provision; or

                     (b)  induce (by threats, promises or otherwise) a contravention of a civil penalty provision; or

                     (c)  be in any way directly or indirectly knowingly concerned in, or party to, a contravention of a civil penalty provision; or

                     (d)  conspire to contravene a civil penalty provision.

             (2)  This Division applies to a person who contravenes subsection (1) in relation to a civil penalty provision as if the person had contravened the provision.

##### <a id="34"></a>34  Recovery of a pecuniary penalty

                   If a Court orders a person to pay a pecuniary penalty:

                     (a)  the penalty is payable to the Commonwealth; and

                     (b)  the Commonwealth may enforce the order as if it were a judgment of the Court.

#### Subdivision B—Civil penalty proceedings and criminal proceedings

##### <a id="35"></a>35  Civil proceedings after criminal proceedings

                   A Court must not make a pecuniary penalty order against a person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision if the person has been convicted of an offence constituted by conduct that is substantially the same as the conduct constituting the contravention.

##### <a id="36"></a>36  Criminal proceedings during civil proceedings

             (1)  Proceedings for a pecuniary penalty order against a person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision are stayed if:

                     (a)  criminal proceedings are started or have already been started against the person for an offence; and

                     (b)  the offence is constituted by conduct that is substantially the same as the conduct alleged to constitute the contravention.

             (2)  The proceedings for the order may be resumed if the person is not convicted of the offence. Otherwise, the proceedings for the order are dismissed.

##### <a id="37"></a>37  Criminal proceedings after civil proceedings

                   Criminal proceedings may be started against a person for conduct that is substantially the same as conduct constituting a contravention of a civil penalty provision regardless of whether a pecuniary penalty order has been made against the person.

##### <a id="38"></a>38  Evidence given in proceedings for penalty not admissible in criminal proceedings

                   Evidence of information given or evidence of production of documents by an individual is not admissible in criminal proceedings against the individual if:

                     (a)  the individual previously gave the evidence or produced the documents in proceedings for a pecuniary penalty order against the individual for a contravention of a civil penalty provision (whether or not the order was made); and

                     (b)  the conduct alleged to constitute the offence is substantially the same as the conduct that was claimed to constitute the contravention.

However, this does not apply to criminal proceedings in respect of the falsity of the evidence given by the individual in the proceedings for the pecuniary penalty order.

### Division 2—Infringement notices

##### <a id="39"></a>39  When an infringement notice can be given

             (1)  If the Greenhouse and Energy Data Officer has reasonable grounds to believe that a person has contravened a civil penalty provision, the Greenhouse and Energy Data Officer may give to the person an infringement notice relating to the alleged contravention.

##### <a id="44"></a>44  Effect of this Division on civil proceedings

                   This Division does not:
