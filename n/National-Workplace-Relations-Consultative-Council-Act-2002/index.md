##### <a id="5"></a>5  Purpose of Council

             (1)  The purpose of the Council is to provide, in the public interest, a regular and organized means by which representatives of the Government of the Commonwealth, of employers and of employees, and, when the Minister considers it appropriate, representatives of other persons, bodies and organisations may consult together on workplace relations matters of national concern.

             (2)  It is the intention of this Act that:

                     (a)  meetings of the Council shall be conducted on a non‑political basis;

                     (b)  the Council will not interfere with the proper performance of the functions of industrial tribunals; and

                     (c)  subject to the rights of persons participating in meetings of the Council to report to the persons, bodies and organisations by which they are nominated and to the right of the Council to make announcements that those persons agree are in the public interest, the views expressed at those meetings will be kept confidential.

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Membership of Council

             (1)  The Council is to consist of these 15 members:

                     (a)  the Minister, who is to be the Chairperson of the Council;

                     (b)  7 members nominated by the Australian Council of Trade Unions;

                     (c)  3 members nominated by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry;

                      (f)  one member nominated by the National Farmers’ Federation;

                     (g)  one member nominated by Master Builders Australia.

          (1A)  If the Minister is satisfied that an organisation referred to in a paragraph of subsection (1) (including a paragraph as previously amended under this subsection or subsection (1B)):

                     (a)  has changed its name; or

                     (b)  has merged with another organisation; or

                     (c)  has been succeeded by another organisation;

the Governor‑General may make regulations amending that paragraph of subsection (1) so that the paragraph refers to the organisation under its new name, to the merged organisation, or to the successor organisation, as the case requires.

          (1B)  If the Minister is satisfied that:

                     (a)  an organisation referred to in a paragraph of subsection (1) (including a paragraph as previously amended under this subsection or subsection (1A)) has ceased to exist and has not merged with, or been succeeded by, another organisation; and

                     (b)  there is another organisation that performs a broadly similar role;

the Governor‑General may make regulations amending that paragraph of subsection (1) so that the paragraph refers to that other organisation.

          (1C)  Before deciding that he or she is satisfied for the purposes of subsection (1B), the Minister must consult the members of the Council.

Note:          This subsection is not intended to limit by implication the matters the Minister may take into account for the purposes of subsection (1A) or (1B).

             (2)  The Minister appoints the other members of the Council.

             (3)  Subject to this Act, a member (except the Minister) holds office for such period, not exceeding 2 years, as is specified in the instrument of appointment, but is eligible for re‑appointment.

                   An appointed member may resign by writing signed by him or her and delivered to the Minister.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Termination of appointment of members

             (1)  If an organization which has nominated a member under subsection 6(1) requests the termination of the appointment of a member nominated by it, the Minister shall terminate the appointment of that member.

             (2)  If the Minister is satisfied that an organisation which has nominated a member under subsection 6(1) has ceased to exist and has not merged with, or been succeeded by, another organisation, the Minister must terminate the appointment of that member.
