\[This is the end of the Guide.]

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>A <sup>*</sup>capital gain you make may be reduced or disregarded under

this Division if the following basic conditions are satisfied for the gain:

</dd> 
<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>a <sup>*</sup>CGT event happens in relation to a <sup>*</sup>CGT asset of

yours in an income year;</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>the event would (apart from this Division) have resulted in the gain;</dd>

<dt>(c)</dt><dd>you satisfy the maximum net asset value test (see section 152-15);</dd>

<dt>(d)</dt><dd>the CGT asset satisfies the active asset test (see section 152-35).

</dd>

</dl></dl>
<dt>(2)</dt><dd>If the <sup>*</sup>CGT asset is a <sup>*</sup>share in a company or an

interest in a trust, there are 2 additional basic conditions:

</dd> 
<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>the company or trust satisfies the controlling individual test (see

section 152-50);</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>you are a <sup>*</sup>CGT concession stakeholder in the company or trust.

</dd>

</dl></dl>
<dl compact="">

Example:	Ann and her spouse Brett carry on a business through a

company in which Ann owns 40% of the shares and Brett 60%. Ann sells her shares

and wants to claim the small business concessions. The condition in paragraph

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>is satisfied because Brett's 60% makes him a controlling individual of the

company. The condition in paragraph (b) is satisfied because Ann is a CGT

concession stakeholder in the company, in that Ann owned some shares just

before the CGT event and was the spouse of a controlling individual (Brett) at

that time.

<dt>(3)</dt><dd>In addition to the basic conditions in this section, some of the

concessions in this Division have extra conditions that must be satisfied for

the concession to be available. These extra conditions are set out in the

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>you had acquired the new asset when you acquired the old asset; and</dd>

<dt>(c)</dt><dd>the new asset had not been your active asset at all times when the

original asset was not your active asset.

</dd>

</dl></dl>
<dl compact="">

Note 1:	Subdivision 124-B allows you to choose a roll-over if

your CGT asset is compulsorily acquired, lost or destroyed. Note 2:	If this subsection applies to a CGT asset, then section 152-115 (which is about continuing time periods) will apply for the 15-year exemption.  </dl>
Marriage breakdowns
<dt>(2)</dt><dd>If you were the transferee of a <sup>*</sup>CGT asset for which there has

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>you had acquired the asset when the transferor acquired the asset; and</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>the asset had been an <sup>*</sup>active asset of yours at all times when

<dt>(c)</dt><dd>the asset had not been an active asset of yours at all times when the

asset was not an active asset of the transferor.

</dd>

</dl></dl>
<dl compact="">

Note 1:	Section 103-25 tells you when the choice must be made. Note 2:	There is a roll-over under Subdivision 126-A if CGT assets are transferred because of a marriage breakdown. Note 3:	If you don't make the choice, the time of acquisition is simply the time of the transfer. Note 4:	Making the choice here has certain consequences for the 15-year exemption: see section 152-115\.  </dl>

Subdivision 152-B&#151;Small business 15-year exemption
 Guide to Subdivision 152-B
 152-100  What this Subdivision is about

A small business entity can disregard a capital gain arising from a CGT asset that it has owned for at least 15 years if certain conditions are met. Capital losses are not affected.
 Also, any amount of income a company or trust derives from a CGT event covered by this Subdivision is neither assessable income nor exempt income. If the company or trust makes payments to its CGT concession stakeholders that are attributable to the exempt amount, the payments will not be taken into account in determining the taxable income of the company, trust or recipient.
 The main conditions are that:
 *	the basic conditions for relief in Subdivision 152-A are satisfied;
 *	the entity continuously owned the asset for the 15-year period leading up to the CGT event;
 *	if the entity is an individual, the individual retires or is permanently incapacitated;
 *	if the entity is a company or trust, the entity had a controlling individual throughout the period of ownership and the individual who was the controlling individual just before the CGT event retires or is permanently incapacitated.
 The Subdivision also allows time periods to continue to run if there has been a roll-over because of marriage breakdown or compulsory acquisition.

Subdivision 152-C&#151;Applying the small business concessions
 Guide to Subdivision 152-C
 152-200  What this Subdivision is about

This Subdivision tells you how to apply the small business CGT concessions mentioned in step 4 of the method statement in subsection 102-5(1).
 A capital gain is reduced by 50% if the basic conditions in Subdivision 152-A are satisfied.
 If the capital gain has already been reduced by the discount percentage, the 50% reduction under this Subdivision applies to that reduced gain.
 The capital gain may be further reduced by the small business retirement exemption or a small business rollover, or both.
 None of these rules apply if the 15-year exemption already applies to the capital gain, since such a gain is disregarded anyway.

Table of sections

152-205	You get the small business 50% reduction
 152-210	You may also get the small business retirement exemption and small business roll-over relief
 152-215	15-year rule has priority

_\[This is the end of the Guide.]_

152-205  You get the small business 50% reduction

<dl compact="">

		The amount of a <sup>*</sup>capital gain remaining after applying step 3 of

the method statement in subsection 102-5(1) is reduced by 50%, if the basic

conditions in Subdivision 152-A are satisfied for the gain.

 </dl>

<center>Back to Top</center>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Example:	For an individual (other than one who opts to claim

indexation instead of the discount), the discount percentage that applies under

step 3 of the method statement is 50%. Therefore, the combined effect of the

discount percentage and this section would be to reduce the original capital

gain by a total of 75%. 	For an individual who opts to claim indexation, or a company, there is no discount percentage, so the individual or company would simply get the 50% reduction under this section.  </dl></dl>

152-210  You may also get the small business retirement exemption and small business roll-over relief

or both.

Subdivision 152-D&#151;Small business retirement exemption
 Guide to Subdivision 152-D
 152-300  What this Subdivision is about

You can choose to disregard a capital gain from a CGT event happening to a CGT asset of your small business if the capital proceeds from the event are used in connection with your retirement.
 There is a lifetime limit of $500,000 for all choices that can be made in respect of an individual under this Subdivision.
 The concession in section 152-205 (small business 50% reduction) applies before this one. For an additional concession, see also Subdivision 152-E (small business roll-over).

Subdivision 152-E&#151;Small business roll-over
 Guide to Subdivision 152-E
 152-400  What this Subdivision is about

A small business roll-over allows you to defer the making of a capital gain from a CGT event happening in relation to one or more small business assets if you acquire replacement assets.
 The concession in section 152-205 (small business 50% reduction) applies before this one. For an additional exemption, see also Subdivision 152-D (small business retirement exemption).

<dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>You can choose to obtain a roll-over if the basic conditions in

Subdivision 152-A are satisfied for the capital gain.</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>You must acquire a replacement asset within the period from one year before to 2 years after the happening of the last CGT event in the income year for which you obtain the small business roll-over.</dd> <dt>(3)</dt><dd>The form of the roll-over is that the capital gain is disregarded to the extent that it does not exceed the cost base of the replacement asset.</dd> <dt>(4)</dt><dd>You will make a separate capital gain if a CGT event subsequently happens to the replacement asset or if its status changes in particular ways. </dd> </dl>

_\[This is the end of the Guide.]_

152-410  When you can obtain the roll-over

<dl compact="">

		You can choose to obtain a roll-over under this Subdivision for a

<sup>*</sup>capital gain if:

 </dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>the basic conditions in Subdivision 152-A are satisfied for the gain;

and</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>within the period starting one year before, and ending 2 years after, the

last <sup>*</sup>CGT event during the year for which you choose a small

business roll-over, you choose one or more <sup>*</sup>CGT assets as

replacements (the _replacement asset_); and</dd>

<dt>(c)</dt><dd>the replacement asset satisfies the conditions set out in section 152-420.

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note:	Paragraph (b) is an exception to the general rule about

choices in section 103-25.

 </dl></dl>

152-415  What the roll-over consists of

<dl compact="">

		If you choose the roll-over, so much of the <sup>*</sup>capital gain that

would have remained apart from the roll-over as does not exceed the total of

the first and second elements of the <sup>*</sup>cost base of the replacement

asset is disregarded.

 </dl>

<center>Back to Top</center>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note:	If there is an amount of the capital gain that cannot be so

disregarded, you make a capital gain equal to that amount. Example:	The original capital gain was $100\. You have reduced it to $25 under other concessions (apart from the roll-over). If the total of the first and second elements of the cost base of the replacement asset is $20, you can disregard $20 under this section, leaving a final capital gain of $5\.  </dl></dl>

152-420  Replacement asset conditions

<dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>For an asset to be eligible to be a replacement asset, you must

<sup>*</sup>acquire it during the period starting one year before, and ending 2

years after, the happening of the last <sup>*</sup>CGT event in the income year

for which you obtain the small business roll-over.

</dd> </dl>

_Extension of time if all reasonable steps taken_

<dl compact="">

<dt>(2)</dt><dd>This time limit does not apply to the extent that your <sup>*</sup>capital

proceeds for the <sup>*</sup>CGT event are increased under subsection 116-45(2)

after that time is up. Instead, you have until 12 months after you receive

those additional proceeds to <sup>*</sup>acquire a replacement asset the first

and second elements of the <sup>*</sup>cost base of which are at least equal to

the value of those additional proceeds.

</dd> </dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note 1:	If you do not acquire a replacement asset with a

sufficiently large cost base within the new time limit, your roll-over will be

reduced accordingly under section 152-415\. Note 2:	Section 116-45 applies if you do not receive your capital proceeds despite having taken all reasonable steps to get them.  </dl></dl>

<dl compact="">

<dt>(3)</dt><dd>The Commissioner may extend the time limits under subsections (1) and (2).

</dd> </dl>

_Type of replacement asset allowed_

<dl compact="">

<dt>(4)</dt><dd>A replacement asset must be an <sup>*</sup>active asset when it is

<sup>*</sup>acquired or an active asset by the end of 2 years after the last

<sup>*</sup>CGT event during the year for which you choose a small business

roll-over.

</dd> </dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note:	If a replacement asset is an active asset and its status

subsequently changes, you may make a capital gain: see section 104-185 (CGT

event J2). Special rules apply if you die: see section 152-425.

 </dl></dl>

<dl compact="">

<dt>(5)</dt><dd>If a replacement asset is a <sup>*</sup>share in a company or an interest

in a trust, you, or an entity <sup>*</sup>connected with you, must be a

<sup>*</sup>controlling individual of the company or trust just after you

<sup>*</sup>acquire the share or interest.

</dd> </dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Example:	Joseph owns 50% of the shares in Company A and Company

B. He is therefore a controlling individual of the companies (see section

152-55). The companies are connected with Joseph (see section 152-30) because

he controls both of them. 	Company A owns land which it leases to Joseph for use in a business. It sells the land at a profit and buys shares in Company B. 	The replacement asset test is satisfied because Joseph is _connected with_ Company A and is a _controlling individual_ of Company B. Note:	If a replacement asset is a share in a company and the status of the company changes, or you or an entity connected with you ceases to be its controlling individual, you may make a capital gain: see section 104-190 (CGT event J3). Special rules apply if you die: see section 152-425\.  </dl></dl>

152-425  Rules where an individual who has obtained a roll-over dies

_Working out your net capital gain_

_Step 1._	Reduce the <sup>*</sup>capital gains you made during the income year by the <sup>*</sup>capital losses (if any) you made during the income year.

	Note 1:	You choose the order in which you reduce your capital gains. You have a net capital loss for the income year if your capital losses exceed your capital gains: see section 102-10.
 	Note 2:	Some provisions of this Act (such as Divisions 104 and 118) permit or require you to disregard certain capital gains or losses when working out your net capital gain. Subdivision 152-B permits you, in some circumstances, to disregard a capital gain on an asset you held for at least 15 years.

_Step 2._	Apply any previously unapplied <sup>*</sup>net capital losses from earlier income years to reduce the amounts (if any) remaining after the reduction of <sup>*</sup>capital gains under step 1 (including any capital gains not reduced under that step because the <sup>*</sup>capital losses were less than the total of your capital gains).

	Note 1:	Section 102-15 explains how to apply net capital losses.
 	Note 2:	You choose the order in which you reduce the amounts.

_Step 3._	Reduce by the <sup>*</sup>discount percentage each amount of a <sup>*</sup>discount capital gain remaining after step 2 (if any).

	Note:	Only some entities can have discount capital gains, and only if they have capital gains from CGT assets acquired at least a year before making the

 gains. See Division 115.

_Step 4._	If any of your <sup>*</sup>capital gains (whether or not they are <sup>*</sup>discount capital gains) qualify for any of the small business concessions in Subdivisions 152-C, 152-D and 152-E, apply those concessions to each capital gain as provided for in those Subdivisions.

	Note 1:	The basic conditions for getting these concessions are in Subdivision 152-A.
 	Note 2:	The small business concessions (other than small business roll-overs) are not available for CGT events J2 and J3.

_Step 5._	Add up the amounts of <sup>*</sup>capital gains (if any) remaining after step 4\. The sum is your _net capital gain_ for the income year.

Subdivision 115-C&#151;Rules about trusts with net capital gains
 Guide to Subdivision 115-C
 115-200  What this Division is about

This Subdivision sets out rules for dealing with the net income of a trust that has a net capital gain. The rules treat parts of the net income attributable to the trust's net capital gain as capital gains made by the beneficiary entitled to those parts. This lets the beneficiary reduce those parts by any capital losses and unapplied net capital losses it has.
 If the trust's capital gain was reduced by either the general 50% discount in step 3 of the method statement in subsection 102-5(1) or by the small business 50% reduction in Subdivision 152-C (but not both), then the gain is doubled. The beneficiary can then apply its capital losses to the gain before applying the appropriate discount percentage (if any) or the small business 50% 
<center>Back to Top</center>
 reduction.
 If the trust's capital gain was reduced by both the general 50% discount and the small business 50% reduction, then the gain is multiplied by 4\. The beneficiary can then apply its capital losses to the gain before applying the appropriate discount percentage (if any) and the small business 50% reduction.
 The rules also give the beneficiary a deduction if necessary to prevent it from being taxed twice on the same parts of the trust's net income.

 115-210  When this Subdivision applies

<dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>This Subdivision applies if a trust estate has a <sup>*</sup>net capital

115-215  Assessing presently entitled beneficiaries

_Purpose_

<dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>The purpose of this section is to ensure that appropriate amounts of the

Part 3&#151;Application and transitional
 61  Application of amendments

	The amendments made by this Schedule apply to assessments for the income year including 21 September 1999 and all later income years, but only for CGT events that happen after 11.45 am, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 21 September 1999.

Note:	The 15-year exemption in Subdivision 152-B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, as inserted by this Division, will effectively only apply to CGT events that happen on or after 20 September 2000, since the 15-year exemption is only relevant to CGT assets acquired on or after 20 September 1985.

62  Transitional&#151;old CGT retirement exemption limit carries over

If an individual's CGT retirement exemption limit was reduced by one or more amounts under:

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>section 118-435 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; or</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>section 160ZZPZN of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_;

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

or both, then the individual's CGT retirement exemption limit under Subdivision 152-D of that Act (as inserted by this Schedule) is taken to have been reduced by the total of all those amounts at 11.45 am, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 21 September 1999.

Note:	This could result in the individual's new limit being reduced to nil at that time, if he or she has already used it up under those old provisions.

</dl></dl></dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note:	If you receive something else, you can obtain only a

partial roll-over: see section 124-790.

 </dl></dl>

_Rolling-over options, rights etc._

<dl compact="">

<dt>(3)</dt><dd>Subsections (1) and (2) also allow you to choose to obtain a roll-over if

you exchange an option, right or similar interest issued by the original entity

that enables you to <sup>*</sup>acquire another interest in that entity for the

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Example:	You can get a roll-over if you exchange your shares in

one entity for shares in another entity or if you exchange options in one

_Other requirements in certain cases_

<dl compact="">

<dt>(4)</dt><dd>The conditions specified in subsection (5) must exist if you and the

Note:	There are some cases where a company or trust will not be

124-785  What is the roll-over?

<dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>A <sup>*</sup>capital gain you make from your original interest is

disregarded.</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>You work out the first element of the <sup>*</sup>cost base of each <sup>*</sup>CGT asset you received as a result of the exchange by reasonably attributing to it the cost base (or the part of it) of your original interest for which it was exchanged and for which you obtained the roll-over.</dd> <dt>(3)</dt><dd>In applying subsection (2), you reduce the <sup>*</sup>cost base of your original interest (just before you stop owning it) by so much of that cost base as is attributable to an ineligible part (see section 124-790).</dd> <dt>(4)</dt><dd>The first element of the <sup>*</sup>reduced cost base is worked out similarly. </dd> </dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Example 1:	Lyn exchanges 1 share with a cost base of $10 for

another share. The cost base of the new share is $10\. Example 2:	Glenn exchanges 2 shares with cost bases of $10 and $11 respectively for one new share. The cost base of the new share is $21\. Example 3:	Wayne exchanges 1 share with a cost base of $9 for share A with a market value of $5 and share B with a market value of $10\. The cost base of share A is $3 and the cost base of share B is $6\.  </dl></dl>

124-790  Partial roll-over

<dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>You can obtain only a partial roll-over if you receive something other

than your replacement interest (the _ineligible proceeds_). There

is no roll-over for that part (the _ineligible part_) of your

original interest for which you received ineligible proceeds.</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>The <sup>*</sup>cost base of the ineligible part is that part of the cost base of your original interest as is reasonably attributable to it. </dd> </dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Example:	Ken owns 100 shares in Aim Ltd. Those shares have a cost

base of $2\. 	Ken accepts an offer from LBZ Ltd to acquire those shares. The offer is 1 share in LBZ (market value $4) plus $1 for each Aim share. 	Ken chooses the roll-over to the extent that he can. 	The cost base of the ineligible part is \[$100 &#215; $200] &#247; $500 = $40\. 	Ken makes a capital gain of $100 - $40 = $60\.  </dl></dl>

124-800  Cost base of interest received for pre-CGT interest

<dl compact="">

		If, as part of the exchange for which you obtain the roll-over, an interest

market value just after you acquired it.

 </dl>

124-805  Meaning of trust voting interest

<dl compact="">

		A _trust voting interest_ in a trust is an interest in the trust

that confers rights of the same or similar kind as the rights conferred by a
