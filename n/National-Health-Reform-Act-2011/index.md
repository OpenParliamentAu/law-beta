                     (b)  the appointment took effect at the commencement of this item;

then, for the purposes of the application of subsection 20(3) of the _National Health Reform Act 2011_ to that appointment, the expressions **_private hospital_** and **_public hospital_** have, and are taken to have had, their ordinary meanings.

(2)       Subitem (1) has effect despite section 5 of the _National Health Reform Act 2011_.

(1)       The Minister may, before the end of the 6‑month period beginning at the commencement of this item, appoint a person to act as the Performance Authority CEO during a vacancy in the office of the Performance Authority CEO, so long as no appointment has previously been made to the office.

(2)       An appointment under subitem (1) is to be made by written instrument.

(3)       Anything done by or in relation to a person purporting to act under an appointment under subitem (1) is not invalid merely because:

                     (a)  the occasion for the appointment had not arisen; or

                     (b)  there was a defect or irregularity in connection with the appointment; or

                     (c)  the appointment had ceased to have effect; or
