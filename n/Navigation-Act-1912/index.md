             (3)  It is a defence to a prosecution for an offence against subsection (1) if the person charged proves that the failure to pay to the seaman the amount of his or her wages in accordance with that subsection was due to the seaman’s act or default, to a reasonable dispute as to liability for those wages or to any other cause not attributable to the wrongful act or default of the person charged or of any person acting on his or her behalf.

Note:          In relation to paragraph (1)(f), see also subsection 6(8).

             (2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), where a seaman suffers from a venereal disease, that disease shall not be deemed to be due to a wilful act or default, or to misbehaviour, on the part of the seaman.

##### <a id="128"></a>128  Recovery of expenses from owner

             (1)  If:

those expenses shall be repaid to the authority by the master of the ship.

                     (a)  from the master or owner of the ship for the time being; or

                     (b)  where the ship has been lost—from the person who was the owner of the ship immediately prior to the time of its loss or abandonment; or

                     (c)  where the ship has been transferred to some person not being a British subject or a citizen of a prescribed country—either from the owner for the time being or from the person who was the owner at the time of transfer;

          (2A)  A charge that arises under subsection (2) and that relates to expenses that are being recovered in the same court and manner as wages due to seamen has priority over a PPSA security interest in the ship.

          (2B)  Subsection 73(2) of the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_ applies to a charge covered by subsection (2A).

Note 1:       The effect of subsection (2B) is that the priority between a charge covered by subsection (2A) and a PPSA security interest is to be determined in accordance with this Act rather than the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_.

Note 2:       Subsection 73(2) of the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_ applies to charges that are covered by subsection (2A) that arise after the commencement of subsection (2B) of this section (which commences at the registration commencement time within the meaning of the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_).

             (3)  In any proceeding for such recovery, a certificate of the facts, signed by the said authority, together with such vouchers (if any) as the case requires, shall be sufficient proof that the expenses were duly paid by that authority.

                     (a)  he or she refuses or fails, without the approval of a proper authority to accept an offer of employment on a ship which is proceeding to that port, being employment under the terms of which:

                              (i)  he or she would have been paid wages at a rate not less than the rate fixed by the agreement under which he or she served on the ship from which he or she was left on shore; and

                             (ii)  he or she would have had the right to be discharged on arrival at that port; or

                     (b)  the seaman refuses or fails, without reasonable excuse, to rejoin the ship from which he or she was left on shore or to accept conveyance back to that port by or at the cost of the owner of that ship;

the seaman is not entitled to receive wages in respect of any period after that refusal or failure.

             (4)  A seaman who, before his or her recovery, is fit to travel is not entitled to wages under subsection (2) in respect of a day on which the seaman’s conveyance to the seaman’s proper return port by or at the cost of the owner of the ship from which he or she was left on shore is delayed by an act, default or neglect on the part of the seaman.

          (4A)  Where a seaman becomes entitled to receive wages under this section but dies before he or she ceases to be so entitled, the period in respect of which the seaman is entitled so to receive wages is the period commencing on the day on which he or she was left on shore and ending on the day of his or her death.

             (5)  If:

                     (a)  a seaman who is left on shore from a ship is not paid wages to which the seaman is entitled under subsection (1) or (2); or

                     (b)  a seaman who is left on shore at a port other than that port, being a seaman who is entitled to be paid wages under subsection (2), is brought or taken back to that port at the direction of the owner or agent of the ship at a time before his or her recovery when the seaman is not fit to travel;

the owner and agent of the ship are each guilty of an offence punishable on conviction by a fine not exceeding $2,000.

          (5A)  An offence under subsection (5) is an offence of strict liability.

Note:          For **_strict liability_**, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

             (6)  A seaman is entitled to wages under this section by reason of an illness, hurt or injury, or a need for essential dental care, only if the illness, hurt or injury, or need for essential dental care,:

                     (b)  has failed to make a claim for compensation under section 63 of that Act.

          (6C)  If:

                     (a)  a seaman is left on shore by reason of illness, hurt or injury, or a need for essential dental care; and

                     (b)  the owner:

                              (i)  considers the seaman is entitled to compensation under the _Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1992_; and

                             (ii)  because of the operation of subsection (6A), intends not to pay wages in respect of any period during which the seaman is left on shore;

                     (b)  having regard to the report of a surveyor furnished to it for the purposes of the certificate;

it is satisfied that, on a date specified in the certificate, the gross tonnage of the ship or the deadweight tonneage of the ship, as the case may be, was such number of tons or tonnes, as the case requires, as is specified in the certificate, and, in proceedings for an offence against subsection (1) in respect of the ship, the certificate is evidence that the gross tonnage of the ship or the deadweight tonneage of the ship, as the case may be, was, on the date so specified, the number of tons or tonnes, as the case requires, so specified.

             (3)  It is a defence in proceedings for an offence against subsection (1) in respect of a ship if it is proved that the circumstances giving rise to the offence were due only to a deviation or delay of the ship caused solely by stress of weather or other circumstances which neither the master nor owner of the ship could have prevented or forestalled.

the ship may be detained until the surveyor is satisfied that the line is in that position.

##### <a id="227D"></a>227D  Offences with respect to marks

             (1)  If a ship, not being a non‑Australian Load Line Convention ship, has been marked in accordance with the regulations or orders with deck lines and load lines and it is not kept so marked, the owner and master of the ship are, in respect of each day during which the ship is not so marked (including the day of a conviction under this subsection or any subsequent day), each guilty of an offence punishable on conviction by a fine not exceeding $1,000.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply if the owner or master has reasonable cause.

Note:          A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in subsection (2) (see subsection 13.3(3) of the _Criminal Code_).

             (3)  An offence under subsection (1) is an offence of strict liability.

Note:          For **_strict liability_**, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

                     (a)  whether the ship is overloaded;

                     (b)  whether the positions of the load lines on the ship correspond with the positions specified in the certificate;

                     (c)  whether any material alteration that would require the assignment of increased freeboard to the ship has, since the certificate was issued, taken place in the hull or superstructures of the ship;

                     (d)  whether the fittings and appliances for the protection of openings, guard rails, freeing ports and means of access to the crew’s quarters have been maintained on the ship in an effective condition; and

                     (e)  whether the ship complies with the conditions specified in any valid Load Line Convention exemption certificate in force in respect of the ship.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  on inspection by a surveyor of a non‑Australian Load Line Convention ship in respect of which a valid Load Line Convention certificate is produced, it is found that:

             (1)  A pecuniary penalty is a debt payable to the Commonwealth.

             (2)  The Commonwealth may enforce a civil penalty order as if it were an order made in civil proceedings against the person to recover a debt due by the person. The debt arising from the order is taken to be a judgement debt.

                     (a)  the civil proceedings are dismissed; and

##### <a id="399L"></a>399L  Criminal proceedings after civil proceedings

##### <a id="399M"></a>399M  Evidence given in civil proceedings not admissible in criminal proceedings

             (1)  Evidence of information given, or evidence of production of documents by an individual, is not admissible in criminal proceedings against the individual if:
