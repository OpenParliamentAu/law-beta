Note:          The definition of **_construction_** in section 4  covers some kinds of work on an existing road, railway or inter-modal transfer facility (hence the references above to the construction of an existing road, railway or inter-modal transfer facility).

##### <a id="11"></a>11  Is it appropriate to approve a project?

                   The matters to which the Minister may have regard in deciding whether it is appropriate to approve a project as an AusLink National Project include, but are not limited to, the following matters:

                     (b)  before the named recipient receives the full amount (the **_named recipient’s amount_**) specified for the named recipient in the List, one or more other persons or bodies takes over responsibility for all or part of that area;

the Minister may, in writing, vary the List to redirect some or all of the remainder of the named recipient’s amount to the other person or body, or to one or more of the other persons or bodies.

          (2A)  If:

             (4)  The Minister cannot vary an AusLink Roads to Recovery List except as permitted by subsection (1), (2), (2A) or (3).

             (5)  An instrument varying an AusLink Roads to Recovery List is a legislative instrument, but section 42 (disallowance) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ does not apply to the instrument.

             (6)  The Minister cannot revoke an AusLink Roads to Recovery List.

##### <a id="89"></a>89  Payments to persons and bodies specified in AusLink Roads to Recovery List

             (1)  Subject to this section and to section 92, each amount specified in an AusLink Roads to Recovery List for an AusLink Roads to Recovery funding period is payable to the person or body (if any) specified in the List for that amount.

             (4)  Payments under this Part are to be made out of money appropriated by the Parliament.

             (5)  An instrument determining the amount or timing of an instalment of funding is not a legislative instrument for the purposes of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_.

##### <a id="90"></a>90  Conditions that apply to payments

             (1)  The Minister must, in writing, determine the conditions that apply to payments under this Part.

                     (b)  a condition that requires the expenditure to be properly accounted for; and

                     (c)  for any payment that is made to a local government authority—a condition that requires the authority to maintain the level of its expenditure on roads, so far as that expenditure comes from sources other than Commonwealth, State or Territory funding; and

                     (d)  a condition that requires signs to be displayed in relation to projects (other than maintenance programs) that are funded under this Part.

             (3)  The conditions may also include conditions requiring the funding recipient to repay amounts to the Commonwealth in the event of a breach of any of the conditions.

             (4)  Subsections (2) and (3) do not limit the matters that may be dealt with in the conditions.

             (5)  The Minister may, in writing, vary or revoke any of the conditions.

             (6)  An instrument determining, varying or revoking conditions is a legislative instrument for the purposes of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_, but neither section 42 nor Part 6 of that Act applies to the instrument.

##### <a id="91"></a>91  Minister’s power to waive conditions etc.

             (1)  The Minister may, by notice in writing to a person or body:

                     (a)  exempt the person or body from a condition determined under section 90; and

             (4)  A notice under subsection (1), or an instrument revoking an exemption or varying or revoking a replacement condition, is not a legislative instrument for the purposes of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_.
