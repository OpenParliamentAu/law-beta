##### <a id="40-10"></a>40-10  Plant

             (1)  This section applies to you if:

                     (a)  you have deducted or can deduct amounts for plant under Division 42 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (the **_former Act_**) as in force just before it was amended by the _New Business Tax System (Capital Allowances) Act 2001_, or you could have deducted amounts under that Division for the plant if you had used it, or had it installed ready for use, for the purpose of producing assessable income before that day; and

                     (b)  either:

                              (i)  you hold the plant at 1 July 2001; or

                             (ii)  subparagraph (i) does not apply and you were the owner or quasi-owner of the plant at the end of 30 June 2001.

             (2)  Division 40 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ as amended by the _New Business Tax System (Capital Allowances) Act 2001_ (the **_new Act_**) applies to the plant on this basis:

                     (a)  the amount that was your undeducted cost at the end of 30 June 2001 becomes the plant’s opening adjustable value; and

                     (b)  you use the same cost, effective life and method that you were using under Division 42 of the former Act; and

                     (c)  if you excluded an amount from your assessable income under section 42-290 of the former Act for a balancing adjustment event that occurred on or before 11.45 am, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 21 September 1999—the cost of the plant, and its opening adjustable value, are reduced by that amount; and

                     (d)  if subparagraph (1)(b)(ii) applies to you—you are treated as the holder of the plant while you are its holder or while the circumstances under which you would have been the owner or quasi-owner of the plant under the former Act continue.

Note:          There are special rules for entities that have substituted accounting periods: see section 40-65.

             (3)  If you were using a rate for the plant under subsection 42-160(1) or 42-165(1) of the former Act just before 1 July 2001, or would have been using such a rate if you had used it, or had it installed ready for use, for the purpose of producing assessable income before that day, Division 40 of the new Act applies to the plant on this basis:

                     (a)  for the diminishing value method—replace the component in the formula in subsection 40-70(1) of the new Act that includes the plant’s effective life with the rate you were using; and

                     (b)  for the prime cost method:

                              (i)  replace the component in the formula in subsection 40-75(1) of the new Act that includes the plant’s effective life with the rate you were using; and

                             (ii)  increase the plant’s cost under Division 42 of the former Act by any amounts included in the second element of the plant’s cost after 30 June 2001.

Note 1:       Recalculating effective life will have no practical effect for an entity to whom subsection (3) applies because the component in the relevant formula that relies on effective life has been replaced.

Note 2:       STS taxpayers work out the decline in value of their depreciating assets under Division 328.

##### <a id="40-12"></a>40-12  Plant acquired after 30 June 2001

             (1)  This section applies to you if:

                     (a)  you entered into a contract to acquire an item of plant before 1 July 2001 and you acquired it after 30 June 2001; or

                     (b)  you started to construct an item of plant before 1 July 2001 and you complete its construction after 30 June 2001.

             (2)  Division 40 of the new Act applies to the plant.

             (3)  If you entered into the contract, or started to construct the plant, at or before 11.45 am, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 21 September 1999, you replace the component in the formula in subsection 40-70(1) or 40-75(1) of the new Act that includes the plant’s effective life with the rate you would have been using if you had acquired it, or completed its construction, before 1 July 2001 and had used it, or had it installed ready for use, for the purpose of producing assessable income before that day.

##### <a id="40-15"></a>40-15  Recalculating effective life

                   You cannot recalculate the effective life of a depreciating asset for which:

                     (a)  you were using, just before 1 July 2001, a rate under subsection 42-160(1) or 42-165(1) of the former Act; or

                     (b)  you would have been using such a rate if you had used the asset, or had it installed ready for use, for the purpose of producing assessable income before that day.

##### <a id="40-20"></a>40-20  IRUs

             (1)  This section applies to you if:

                     (a)  you have deducted or can deduct an amount for an IRU under Division 44 of the former Act; and

                     (b)  you hold the IRU at 1 July 2001.

             (2)  Division 40 of the new Act applies to the IRU on this basis:

                     (a)  you use the cost, effective life and method you were using under Division 44 of the former Act; and

                     (b)  the amount that was your undeducted cost of the IRU at the end of 30 June 2001 becomes the IRU’s opening adjustable value.

Note:          There are special rules for entities that have substituted accounting periods: see section 40-65.

##### <a id="40-25"></a>40-25  Software

             (1)  Despite its repeal by this Act, Division 46 of the former Act continues to apply to expenditure on software that you incurred and that was in a software pool under that Division at the end of 30 June 2001.

             (2)  For a unit of software for which you were deducting amounts under Subdivision 46-B of the former Act, Subdivision 40-B of the new Act applies to the unit on this basis:

                     (a)  its cost is the amount of expenditure you incurred on the unit; and

                     (b)  you must use the prime cost method; and

                     (c)  its opening adjustable value at 1 July 2001 is its undeducted cost at the end of 30 June 2001; and

                     (d)  you must use the same effective life you were using under Subdivision 46-B of the former Act.

             (4)  Sections 40-95 and 40-110 of the new Act do not apply to the unrecouped expenditure.

             (5)  If either:

                     (a)  both of these subparagraphs apply:

                              (i)  any of the unrecouped expenditure referred to in subsection (1) relates to a depreciating asset (the **_real asset_**);

                             (ii)  in an income year (the **_cessation year_**) you stop holding the real asset, or stop using it for a taxable purpose; or

                     (b)  both of these subparagraphs apply:

                              (i)  any of the unrecouped expenditure referred to in subsection (1) relates to property that is not a depreciating asset (the **_other property_**);

                             (ii)  in the cessation year, the other property is disposed of, lost or destroyed, or you stop using it for a taxable purpose;

there is an additional decline in value of the notional asset for the cessation year equal to so much of the notional asset’s adjustable value as relates to the real asset or the other property and has not been taken into account in working out the amount of a balancing adjustment in relation to the real asset.

             (6)  If the other property is disposed of, lost or destroyed, or you stop using it for a taxable purpose, you must include in your assessable income:

                     (a)  if the other property is sold for a price specific to that property—that price, less the expenses of the sale (to the extent the expenses are reasonably attributable to selling that particular property); or

                     (b)  if the other property is sold with additional property without a specific price being allocated to it—the part of the total sale price, less the reasonably attributable expenses of the sale, that is reasonably attributable to selling the other property; or

                     (c)  if the other property is lost or destroyed—the amount or value received or receivable under an insurance policy or otherwise for the loss or destruction; or

                     (d)  if you own the other property and you stop using it for a taxable purpose—its market value at that time; or

                     (e)  if you do not own the property and you stop using it for a taxable purpose—a reasonable amount.

there is an additional decline in value of the notional asset for the cessation year equal to so much of the notional asset’s adjustable value as relates to the real asset or the other property and has not been taken into account in working out the amount of a balancing adjustment in relation to the real asset.

             (5)  If the other property is disposed of, lost or destroyed, or you stop using it for a taxable purpose, you must include in your assessable income:

                     (e)  if you do not own the property and you stop using it for a taxable purpose—a reasonable amount.

However, the amount included is reduced to the extent (if any) that it is also included under subsection 40-830(6) of the new Act.

             (1)  Units of plant that you had allocated to a pool under Subdivision 42-L of the former Act and that were allocated to the pool by 30 June 2001 are treated as a single depreciating asset for the purposes of Division 40 of the new Act.

             (2)  Division 40 of the new Act applies to the single depreciating asset on this basis:

                     (a)  its cost and opening adjustable value at 1 July 2001 is the closing balance of the pool for your income year in which 30 June 2001 occurred; and

                     (b)  you must use the diminishing value method; and

                     (c)  in applying the formula in section 40-70 of the new Act for your income year in which 1 July 2001 occurs—it has a base value equal to that opening adjustable value; and

                     (d)  you replace the component in the formula in subsection 40-70(1) of the new Act that includes an asset’s effective life with the pool percentage you were using for the pool; and

                     (e)  if an item of plant is removed from the pool because a balancing adjustment event occurs for the item or because of subsection (3) of this section, section 40-115 of the new Act applies so that you are treated as having split the single depreciating asset into the removed asset and the remaining assets in the pool; and

                      (f)  if an amount is included in the second element of the cost of a depreciating asset in the pool, Division 40 of the new Act applies as if that amount had been included in the second element of the cost of the single asset.

Note:          There are special rules for entities that have substituted accounting periods: see section 40-65.

             (3)  An item of plant in the pool is automatically removed from the pool if you stop using it wholly for taxable purposes (except because a balancing adjustment event occurs for the item).

Note 1:       You work out the decline in value of an item removed under this subsection under Subdivision 40-B of the new Act, using the cost for it worked out under section 40-205 of the new Act.

Note 2:       There are special rules for entities that have substituted accounting periods: see section 40-65.

##### <a id="40-65"></a>40-65  Substituted accounting periods

             (1)  This section sets out special rules for the application of Division 40 of the new Act to an entity that:

                     (a)  has a substituted accounting period; and

                     (b)  because of a provision of this Subdivision, uses Division 40 of the new Act to work out the decline in value of an asset, or of something that is treated as an asset.

             (2)  The entity works out its deductions for its income year that includes 1 July 2001 (the **_calculation year_**) in this way:

                     (a)  the entity works out its deductions for that asset under the former Act as from the start of its calculation year up to the end of 30 June 2001 as if that period were an income year; and

                     (b)  the entity works out the decline in value of the asset under Division 40 of the new Act from 1 July 2001 until the end of its calculation year as if that period were an income year in accordance with the following provisions of this section.

             (3)  The asset’s opening adjustable value for the purposes of Division 40 of the new Act is:

                     (a)  for a unit of plant (including IRUs and expenditure on software that is not pooled)—its undeducted cost at the end of 30 June 2001; or

                     (b)  for expenditure on eligible mining or quarrying operations, an item of intellectual property or a spectrum licence—the amount of unrecouped expenditure for the expenditure, item or licence under the former Act at the end of 30 June 2001 reduced, in the case of eligible mining or quarrying operations, by an amount you have deducted or can deduct for the calculation year under the former Act and not yet taken into account in calculating unrecouped expenditure; or

                     (c)  for transport capital expenditure—the entity’s amount of transport capital expenditure under the former Act at the end of 30 June 2001 less any amounts the entity has deducted or can deduct for it under the former Act up to that time; or

                     (d)  for expenditure on a forestry road, a timber mill building, a horticultural plant or a grapevine—the amount of that expenditure less any amounts the entity has deducted or can deduct for it under the former Act up to 30 June 2001; or

                     (e)  for expenditure on evaluating the impact on the environment of a project—the amount of that expenditure less any amounts the entity has deducted or can deduct for it under the former Act up to 30 June 2001; or

                      (f)  for assets that were pooled under Subdivision 42-M or 42-L of the former Act—the closing balance of the pool at the end of 30 June 2001.

             (4)  The asset’s base value for applying the formula in section 40-70 of the new Act for the diminishing value method is that opening adjustable value.

             (5)  The decline in value for the assets referred to in this subsection is worked out using the prime cost method without the adjustments in subsection 40-75(3) of the new Act, and the opening adjustable value specified in subsection (3) of this section, in this way:

                     (a)  for an item of plant for which you were using the prime cost method—using the rules in section 40-10 of this Act; and

                     (b)  for an IRU for which you were using the prime cost method—using the rules in section 40-20 of this Act; and

                     (c)  for a unit of software for which the entity was deducting amounts under Subdivision 46-B of the former Act—using the rules in subsection 40-25(2) of this Act; and

                     (d)  for a spectrum licence—using the rules in section 40-30 of this Act; and

                     (e)  for an item of intellectual property—using the rules in section 40-45 of this Act; and

                      (f)  for an amount of expenditure on evaluating the impact on the environment of a project—using the rules in section 40-55 of this Act.

             (6)  The decline in value for the assets referred to in this subsection is worked out using the prime cost method using the adjustments in subsection 40-75(3) of the new Act, and the opening adjustable value specified in subsection (3) of this section, in this way:

                     (a)  for an amount of unrecouped expenditure under Division 330 of the former Act—using the rules in section 40-35 of this Act; and

                     (b)  for an amount of transport capital expenditure under Division 330 of the former Act—using the rules in section 40-40 of this Act; and

                     (c)  for a forestry road or timber mill building—using the rules in section 40-50 of this Act.

             (7)  The entity must work out the decline in value of each of the assets for later income years under Division 40 of the new Act.

             (8)  The entity must, in working out its deductions under this section for the calculation year for:

                     (a)  allowable capital expenditure for which the entity had deducted or can deduct an amount under Subdivision 330-C of the former Act; or

                     (b)  transport capital expenditure for which the entity had deducted or can deduct an amount under Subdivision 330-H of the former Act; or

                     (c)  a water facility for which the entity had deducted or can deduct an amount under Subdivision 387-B of the former Act; or

                     (d)  expenditure on connecting power to land or upgrading the connection for which the entity had deducted or can deduct an amount under Subdivision 387-E of the former Act; or

                     (e)  expenditure on a telephone line on or extending to land for which the entity had deducted or can deduct an amount under Subdivision 387-E of the former Act;

reduce its deductions for each of the periods referred to in paragraphs (2)(a) and (b) by multiplying the deduction for that period by the number of days in that period and dividing the result by 365.

             (9)  The entity cannot deduct anything for an asset referred to in this section under the former Act for any part of its calculation year after 30 June 2001.

           (10)  You are entitled to a further deduction for a depreciating asset for which you are using the diminishing value method if the sum of the deductions worked out under paragraphs (2)(a) and (b) (the **_sum amount_**) is less than the deduction to which you would have been entitled for the asset if the former Act had continued to apply to the whole of the calculation year (the **_former Act amount_**).

           (11)  You increase the amount worked out under paragraph (2)(b) by the difference between the former Act amount and the sum amount.

##### <a id="40-70"></a>40-70  References to amounts deducted and reductions in deductions

             (1)  A reference in the new Act to an amount that you have deducted or can deduct for a depreciating asset under Division 40 of the new Act includes a reference to an amount that you have deducted or can deduct for a capital allowance relating to the asset under the former Act or the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

             (2)  An amount you have deducted or can deduct for a water facility under Subdivision 387-B of the former Act or section 75B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ is taken to have been deducted under Subdivision 40-F of the new Act.

             (3)  A reference in the new Act to a reduction in your deduction for a depreciating asset includes a reference to amounts by which your deductions for the asset were reduced under the former Act or the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

##### <a id="40-75"></a>40-75  Mining expenditure incurred after 1 July 2001 on an asset

             (1)  This section applies to you if:

                     (b)  you hold a depreciating asset (except a mining, quarrying or prospecting right that you started to hold before 1 July 2001) that you:

                              (i)  started to hold under a contract entered into before 1 July 2001; or

                             (ii)  constructed where the construction started before that day; or

                            (iii)  started to hold in some other way before that day; and

                     (c)  your expenditure on the asset, whenever incurred, would have been allowable capital expenditure, transport capital expenditure or expenditure on exploration or prospecting within the meaning of Division 330 of the former Act if it had been incurred before 1 July 2001.

             (2)  If you incur expenditure on the asset after 30 June 2001 that forms part of the cost of the asset, you can deduct the expenditure for the income year in which you incur it if it would have been expenditure on exploration or prospecting within the meaning of Division 330 of the former Act.

             (3)  Otherwise, Subdivision 40-B of the new Act applies to the asset on the basis that it has a cost, and an adjustable value, of zero at the start of 1 July 2001, and an effective life on that day or at its start time, whichever is the later, worked out under subsection (4) of this section.

             (4)  The effective life of the depreciating asset is the shorter of its effective life worked out under Division 40 and:

##### <a id="40-77"></a>40-77  Mining, quarrying or prospecting rights or information held before 1 July 2001

             (1)  Division 40 of the new Act does not apply to a mining, quarrying or prospecting right that you started to hold before 1 July 2001.

Note:          If you incur expenditure relating to assets of that kind, you cannot deduct it under Division 40\. However, the expenditure may be taken into account in calculating a capital gain or capital loss under Part 3-1 or 3-3 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

             (2)  If, after 30 June 2001:

                     (a)  you dispose of a mining, quarrying or prospecting right that you started to hold before 1 July 2001 to an associate of yours; or

                     (b)  you enter into an arrangement in relation to such a right under which you maintain, in essence, the economic ownership of the right but not its legal ownership;

the cost of the right to the purchaser is limited, for the purposes of Division 40 of the new Act, to a maximum of the costs that would have been deductible for the right under Division 330 of the former Act.

             (3)  An amount that would be included in your assessable income under section 15-40 or subsection 40-285(1) of the new Act in respect of mining, quarrying or prospecting information you started to hold before 1 July 2001 is reduced (but not below zero) by so much of the capital cost of acquiring the information that you incurred before that day and that:

                     (a)  you have not deducted and cannot deduct (either immediately or over time) under the former Act; and

                     (b)  did not form part of allowable capital expenditure under the former Act; and

                     (c)  did not entitle you to a deduction under section 330-235 of the former Act;

but only to the extent that you have not already applied the amount under this section.

##### <a id="40-80"></a>40-80  Other expenditure incurred after 1 July 2001 on a depreciating asset

             (1)  This section applies to you if:

                     (a)  you incur expenditure after 30 June 2001 that forms part of the cost of a depreciating asset; and

                     (b)  the depreciating asset is one that you:

                              (i)  started to hold under a contract entered into before 1 July 2001; or

                             (ii)  constructed where the construction started before that day; or

                            (iii)  started to hold in some other way before that day; and

                     (c)  if you had incurred the expenditure before 1 July 2001, and had satisfied any relevant requirement for deductibility, you would have been able to deduct an amount for it under Division 44, 373 or 380, or Subdivision 46-B or 387-G, of the former Act.

             (2)  Subdivision 40-B of the new Act applies to the asset on the basis that it has a cost, and an adjustable value, of zero at the start of 1 July 2001.

##### <a id="40-85"></a>40-85  Excess deductions

                   You can deduct any amount of new EPE (see sections 330-30 and 330-35 of this Act) you have at the end of your 2000-01 income year, reduced by the total of the relevant amounts (see subsections 330-30(4) and 330-35(4) of this Act) for an earlier applicable year (see subsections 330-30(3) and 330-35(3) of this Act).

                     (a)  the car depreciation limit under Division 42 of the former Act; and

                     (b)  the motor vehicle depreciation limit under section 57AF of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

             (2)  If you:

                     (a)  have a substituted accounting period; and

                     (b)  start to hold a car in your 2001-02 income year but before 1 July 2001;

you must use as the car limit the car depreciation limit under section 42-80 of the former Act for the 2000-01 financial year.

##### <a id="40-285"></a>40-285  Balancing adjustments

             (1)  Paragraphs 40-285(1)(a) and (2)(a) of the new Act have effect in relation to a depreciating asset that you held at 1 July 2001 as if amounts you have deducted or can deduct for the asset under the former Act or the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ were part of the asset’s decline in value under Division 40.

             (2)  You are entitled to a further deduction under subsection (3) if:

                     (a)  you are entitled to a deduction under subsection 40-285(2) of the new Act for a balancing adjustment event happening to a depreciating asset:

                              (i)  to which Division 58 of the former Act applied; or

                             (ii)  to which section 61A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ applied, or for which the transition time under Division 57 of Schedule 2D to that Act occurred before 1 July 2001; and

                     (b)  you would have been entitled to a further deduction under section 42-197 of the former Act.

             (3)  The amount of the further deduction is the amount worked out under section 42-197 of the former Act.

             (4)  Division 40 of the new Act applies to a balancing adjustment event that occurs on or after 1 July 2001 for a depreciating asset you hold if you held the asset on that day.

             (5)  The amount included in your assessable income under subsection 40-285(1) or section 40-370 of the new Act for a balancing adjustment event happening to a depreciating asset is reduced if:

                     (a)  the asset is either:

                              (i)  a depreciating asset that is not plant and that you started to hold under a contract entered into before 1 July 2001, you constructed where the construction started before that day or you started to hold in some other way before that day; or

                             (ii)  plant that you acquired at or before 11.45 am, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 21 September 1999; and

                     (b)  any capital gain or capital loss would be disregarded (if Part 3-1 of the new Act applied):

                              (i)  because of section 118-5 (about cars, motor cycles and valour decorations); or

                             (ii)  because of section 118-10 (about collectables); or

                            (iii)  because of section 118-12 (about plant used to produce exempt income); or

                            (iv)  because the asset was a pre-CGT asset at the time of the balancing adjustment event.

             (6)  The reduction is:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004C01190/Html/NewBusTaxSystCapAllowTranConseq2001_WD02_image002.gif)

where:

                    <a name="sum-ruction"></a>**_sum of reductions_** is the sum of the reductions in your deductions for the asset because you did not use it for a particular purpose.

                    <a name="total-declin"></a>**_total decline_** is the decline in value of the depreciating asset since you started to hold it.

             (7)  Section 118-24 of the new Act applies to CGT event A1 (disposal of a CGT asset) happening to a depreciating asset if the event happens:

                     (a)  if the depreciating asset is plant—at or before 11.45 am, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 21 September 1999; or

                     (b)  if the depreciating asset is not plant—before 1 July 2001;

where:

                     (c)  the time of the event is when you entered into the contract for the disposal of the asset; and

                     (d)  the change in ownership constituting the disposal occurred after the applicable time mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b).

##### <a id="40-290"></a>40-290  Reduction of deductions under former Act etc.

                   Subsection 40-290(2) of the new Act has effect in relation to a depreciating asset that you held at 1 July 2001 as if:

                     (a)  any amount by which your deductions for the asset were reduced under the former Act or the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ because you did not use it for a particular purpose were an amount by which your deductions for the asset were reduced under section 40-25 of the new Act; and

                     (b)  the **_total decline_** element of the formula in that subsection included all amounts you have deducted or can deduct for the asset under the former Act or the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

##### <a id="40-295"></a>40-295  Later year relief

             (1)  You may exclude an amount that has been included in your assessable income for plant as a result of a balancing adjustment event that occurred in your 1999-2000 or 2000-01 income year to the extent that you choose under section 42-290 of the former Act to treat that amount as an amount you have deducted for the decline in value of replacement plant.

             (2)  You can only make this choice for the replacement plant if:

                     (a)  you acquire it:

                              (i)  within 2 income years after the end of the income year in which the balancing adjustment event occurred; and

                             (ii)  in your 2001-02 or 2002-2003 income year; and

                     (b)  at the end of the income year in which you acquired it, you used it, or had it installed ready for use, wholly for the purpose of producing assessable income; and

                     (c)  you can deduct an amount for its decline in value; and

                     (d)  you had not made a choice under section 42-285 or 42-293 of the former Act for the balancing adjustment event.

             (3)  The adjustable value of the replacement plant is reduced by the amount covered by the choice as at the first day of the income year in which you acquired it.

##### <a id="40-340"></a>40-340  Roll-overs

             (1)  This section applies to an entity (the **_transferee_**) if:

                     (b)  the transferor referred to in that section was working out the decline in value of the plant under subsection 40-10(3) of this Act.

Plant acquired before 21 September 1999

             (2)  The transferee works out the decline in value of the plant under subsection 40-10(3) or 40-12(3) of this Act using the same method as the transferor if:

                     (a)  the transferor started to hold the plant under a contract entered into at or before 11.45 am, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 21 September 1999; or

                     (b)  the transferor constructed it and the construction started at or before that time; or

                     (c)  the transferor acquired it in some other way at or before that time; or

                     (d)  the transferor acquired it from an entity that was working out the decline in value of the plant under subsection 40-10(3) of this Act and paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this subsection applied to that entity or to the earliest successive transferor.

Small business taxpayers

             (3)  The transferee also works out the decline in value of the plant under subsection 40-10(3) of this Act using the same method as the transferor if:

                     (a)  the plant was not acquired as mentioned in subsection (2); and

                     (b)  the transferor, or an earlier successive transferor, was using a rate for the plant under subsection 42-160(1) or 42-165(1) of the former Act; and

             (4)  For the purposes of item 2 in the table in subsection (3), an entity is treated as if it is not carrying on a business in relation to the activities of a partnership in which the entity is a partner unless the entity is connected with the partnership.

             (5)  A lease of plant referred to in item 3 of the table in subsection (3) is an agreement (including a renewal of an agreement) under which the holder of the plant grants a right to use the plant to another entity, but not a hire purchase agreement or a short-term hire agreement.

             (6)  The transferee works out the decline in value of the plant by:

                     (a)  for the diminishing value method—replacing the component in the formula in subsection 40-70(1) of the new Act that includes the plant’s effective life with the rate the transferor, or the earliest successive transferor, was using; or

                     (b)  for the prime cost method:

                              (i)  replacing the component in the formula in subsection 40-75(1) of the new Act that includes the plant’s effective life with the rate the transferor, or the earliest successive transferor, was using; and

                             (ii)  increasing the plant’s cost under Division 42 of the former Act by any amounts included in the second element of the plant’s cost after 30 June 2001.

                     (a)  plant that you acquired at or before 11.45 am, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 21 September 1999; or

                     (b)  a depreciating asset that is not plant and that you acquired before 1 July 2001;

is reduced (but not below nil) if:

                     (c)  for a paragraph (a) case—there would have been a reduction under subsection 42-192(2) of the former Act as a result of that event; or

                     (d)  for a paragraph (b) case—there would have been a reduction under subsection 42-192(2) of the former Act as a result of that event if the asset were plant.

             (2)  The amount of the reduction is the amount worked out under subsection 42-192(2) of the former Act.

             (3)  There is no reduction under subsection (1) to an amount included in your assessable income under subsection 104-240(1) if the balancing adjustment event results in a discount capital gain under Division 115.

             (4)  However, you can choose not to make a reduction under subsection (1) and instead take advantage of the discount capital gain.

             (5)  Subsection (6) applies to an entity (the **_transferee_**) if there is roll-over relief under section 40-340 of the new Act as a result of a balancing adjustment event happening to a depreciating asset held by the transferee.

                             (ii)  the transferor constructed it and the construction started at or before that time; or

                            (iii)  the transferor acquired it in some other way at or before that time; or

                     (b)  for a depreciating asset that is not plant:

                              (i)  the transferor started to hold the asset under a contract entered into before 1 July 2001; or

                             (ii)  the transferor constructed it and the construction started at or before that day; or

## 201  Subsection 20-40(2) (example)

Repeal the example, substitute:

Example:    At the start of the 2002-03 income year, a company incurs $100,000 to start to hold a depreciating asset. The company uses the prime cost method, and the effective life is 10 years. $10,000 is deductible for the 2002-03 income year and for each of the following 9 income years under section 40-25.

                   In the 2002-03 income year, the company receives $20,000 as recoupment. How much is assessable for the 2002-03 income year?

                   Applying the method statement:

                   After step 1: the total assessable recoupment is $20,000.

                   After step 2: the recoupment already assessed is nil.

                   After step 3: the unassessed recoupment is: 
 total assessable recoupment minus recoupment already assessed,
 i.e. $20,000 minus 0 = $20,000.

                   After step 4: the total deductions for the loss or outgoing are $10,000.

                   After step 5: the outstanding deductions are: 
 total deductions for the loss or outgoing minus recoupment already assessed, i.e. $10,000 minus 0 = $10,000.

                   After step 6: the unassessed recoupment (step 3) is greater than outstanding deductions (step 5), so the amount of the outstanding deductions is included in assessable income, i.e. $10,000.

                   Applying the method statement to the 2003-04 income year: a further $10,000 is included in the company’s assessable income.

## 202  Subsection 20-45(1) (note)

Omit “section 40-25”, substitute “Subdivision 40-D”.

## 203  Subsection 20-45(3) (example)

Repeal the example, substitute:

Example:Continuing the example in subsection 20-40(2): at the start of the 2005-06 income year, the company:

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">          </span>receives a further $10,000 as recoupment; and

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">          </span>sells the depreciating asset for $75,000.

                   As a result of the sale, a balancing adjustment of $5,000 is included under section 40-285 in the company’s assessable income for that income year.

                   How much of the recoupment amount received in the 2005-06 income year is assessable for that income year?

                   Applying the method statement in subsection 20-40(2):

                   After step 1: the total assessable recoupment is $30,000 (received during 2002-03 and 2005-06).

                   After step 2: the recoupment already assessed is $20,000 (for 2002-03 and 2003-04).

                   After step 3: the unassessed recoupment is:
 total assessable recoupment minus recoupment already assessed, 
 i.e. $30,000 minus $20,000 = $10,000.

                   After step 4: the total deductions for the loss or outgoing are $30,000 ($10,000 for each of 2002-03, 2004-04 and 2004-05), reduced by $5,000 (the amount included in assessable income for the balancing adjustment), i.e. $25,000.

                   After step 5: the outstanding deductions are: 
 total deductions for the loss or outgoing minus recoupment already assessed, i.e. $25,000 minus $20,000 = $5,000.

                   After step 6: the unassessed recoupment (step 3) is greater than outstanding deductions (step 5), so the amount of the outstanding deductions is included in assessable income, i.e. $5,000.

Note:          For an increasing adjustment that arises under Division 129 or 132 of the GST Act, see section 27-92.

             (9)  An amount equal to the amount of that * increasing adjustment is added to:

                     (a)  for a low-value pool:

                              (i)  if the adjustment year is later than the first income year for which * depreciating assets were allocated to the pool—the * closing pool balance of the pool for the income year before the adjustment year; or

                             (ii)  if the adjustment year is the first income year for which * depreciating assets were allocated to the pool—the * closing pool balance of the pool for the adjustment year; or

                     (c)  for * in-house software—the amount of expenditure allocated to the software development pool for the adjustment year; or

                     (d)  for a project pool—the * pool value for the adjustment year.

Decreasing adjustments

           (10)  There is a decrease under subsection (11) if the entity has a * decreasing adjustment (except one that arises under Division 129 or 132 of the * GST Act) in an income year (also the **_adjustment year_**) that relates directly or indirectly to a * creditable acquisition or * creditable importation to which the pooled expenditure relates.

Note:          For a decreasing adjustment that arises under Division 129 or 132 of the GST Act, see section 27-87.

           (11)  An amount equal to the amount of the * decreasing adjustment is applied in reduction of:

                     (a)  for a low-value pool:

                              (i)  if the adjustment year is later than the first income year for which * depreciating assets were allocated to the pool—the * closing pool balance of the pool for the income year before the adjustment year; or

                             (ii)  if the adjustment year is the first income year for which * depreciating assets were allocated to the pool—the * closing pool balance of the pool for the adjustment year; or

                     (d)  for a project pool—the * pool value for the adjustment year.

           (12)  If the amount available for reduction under subsection (11) is more than the amount referred to in paragraph (11)(a), (b), (c) or (d) (whichever is applicable), the excess is included in the entity’s assessable income unless the entity is an * exempt entity.

##### <a id="27-105"></a>27-105  Other Division 40 expenditure

             (1)  This section applies to expenditure for which an entity can deduct amounts under Division 40 (but not under Subdivision 40-B or 40-E, or Subdivision 40-I to the extent that that Subdivision relates to project pools).

             (2)  The amount of the expenditure is reduced if the entity is or becomes entitled to an * input tax credit for a * creditable acquisition or * creditable importation to which the expenditure directly or indirectly relates. The reduction is the amount of the input tax credit that relates to that expenditure.

             (3)  If the entity has a * decreasing adjustment in an income year that relates directly or indirectly to the expenditure, an amount equal to the decreasing adjustment is included in the entity’s assessable income for that income year.

             (4)  If the entity has an * increasing adjustment in an income year that relates directly or indirectly to the expenditure, the entity can deduct an amount equal to the increasing adjustment for that income year.

             (5)  If the entity is a partnership and section 40-570 or 40-665 applies, an amount equal to the * input tax credit, the * decreasing adjustment or the * increasing adjustment is apportioned to each of the partners as appropriate.

             (6)  However, this section does not apply to an * exempt entity.

##### <a id="27-110"></a>27-110  Input tax credit etc. relating to 2 or more things

                   This Subdivision applies to an * input tax credit, or an * increasing adjustment or * decreasing adjustment, that relates directly or indirectly to 2 or more things of which at least one is a * depreciating asset as if a reasonable proportion of the input tax credit or adjustment related directly or indirectly to each of those depreciating assets and each of those other things.

58-5          Application of Division

58-10        When an asset is acquired in connection with the acquisition of a business

##### <a id="58-5"></a>58-5  Application of Division

             (1)  This Division applies in 2 situations.

Entity sale

             (2)  The first (an **_entity sale situation_**) is where:

                     (a)  at a particular time on or after 1 July 2001, an entity is an exempt entity; and

                     (b)  just after that time, the entity’s * ordinary income or * statutory income becomes to any extent assessable income.

             (3)  In an entity sale situation:

                     (a)  the entity is a **_transition entity_**; and

                     (b)  the time when the entity’s * ordinary income or * statutory income becomes to that extent assessable is the **_transition time_**; and

                     (c)  the income year in which the * transition time occurs is the **_transition year_** for the entity; and

                     (d)  the * depreciating assets the * transition entity * held just before the transition time are **_privatised assets_**.

Asset sale

             (4)  The second (an **_asset sale situation_**) is where:

                     (a)  at a particular time on or after 1 July 2001, an entity (the **_purchaser_**) whose * ordinary income or statutory income is to any extent assessable acquires a * depreciating asset from an * exempt entity; and

                     (b)  the asset is acquired in connection with the acquisition of a * business from the exempt entity.

             (5)  In an asset sale situation:

                     (a)  the * exempt entity is the **_tax exempt vendor_**; and

                     (b)  the time when the * depreciating asset is acquired is the **_acquisition time_**; and

                     (c)  the income year in which the * acquisition time occurs is the **_acquisition year_**; and

                     (d)  each * depreciating asset the purchaser acquires from the * tax exempt vendor at the acquisition time is a **_privatised asset_**.

##### <a id="58-10"></a>58-10  When an asset is acquired in connection with the acquisition of a business

             (1)  A * depreciating asset is taken to be acquired in connection with the acquisition of a * business from the * exempt entity if and only if:

                     (a)  the asset was used by the exempt entity in carrying on a business and the purchaser or another person uses the asset in carrying on the business; or

                     (b)  subsection (2) applies.

             (2)  This subsection applies if:

                     (a)  the asset was used by the * exempt entity in performing functions, or engaging in activities, that did not constitute the carrying on of a * business by the exempt entity and the asset is used by the purchaser or another person in performing those functions or engaging in those activities as part of carrying on a business; or

                     (b)  all of these subparagraphs apply:

                              (i)  the acquisition by the purchaser of the asset was connected with the acquisition of another asset by the purchaser or another person from the exempt entity or from an * associate of the exempt entity;

                             (ii)  ownership of the other asset gives the purchaser or other person a right, or imposes on the purchaser or other person an obligation, to perform functions or engage in activities as part of the carrying on of a business or confers on the purchaser or other person a commercial advantage or opportunity in connection with performing functions or engaging in activities as part of the carrying on of a business;

                            (iii)  the asset is used by the purchaser or other person in performing those functions or engaging in those activities under the right or obligation or in taking the benefit of the advantage or opportunity; or

                     (c)  the asset was acquired by the purchaser under an * arrangement under which the purchaser or another person acquired another asset from the exempt entity or from an associate of the exempt entity and:

                              (i)  the other asset is taken by paragraph (1)(a), or by paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection; or

                             (ii)  where the other asset is not a depreciating asset, it would, if it were a depreciating asset, be taken by paragraph (1)(a), or by paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection;

                            to be acquired in connection with the acquisition of a business from the exempt entity.

             (3)  Paragraphs (2)(a), (b) and (c) do not apply if the asset is used by the purchaser solely to derive assessable income from the provision of office or residential accommodation.

##### <a id="58-60"></a>58-60  Purpose of rules in this Subdivision

                   This Subdivision sets out rules that affect the way in which the * transition entity or the purchaser work out the decline in value of, and balancing adjustments for, * privatised assets under Division 40 after the * transition time or the * acquisition time.

##### <a id="58-65"></a>58-65  Choice of method to work out cost of privatised asset

             (1)  The * transition entity or the purchaser has a choice to work out the first element of the * cost of each * privatised asset.

             (2)  The choice is to use either:

                     (a)  the * notional written down value of the asset; or

                     (b)  the * undeducted pre-existing audited book value (if any) of the asset.

             (3)  The choice must be made:

                     (a)  for the * transition entity—by the day on which the transition entity lodges its income tax return for the * transition year; or

                     (b)  for the purchaser—by the day on which the purchaser lodges the purchaser’s income tax return for the * acquisition year;

or within a further period allowed by the Commissioner.

             (4)  The choice, once made, cannot be changed.

##### <a id="58-70"></a>58-70  Application of Division 40

Application of Division 40

             (1)  The * transition entity and the purchaser work out the decline in value of, and the effect of a * balancing adjustment event occurring for, each * privatised asset using Division 40 (Capital allowances) as if the asset had been acquired under a contract entered into on or after 1 July 2001.

Entity sale situation

             (2)  Division 40 applies to a * privatised asset * held by the * transition entity as if the asset had not been used, or * installed ready for use, for any purpose before the * transition time.

             (3)  The first element of the * cost to the * transition entity at the * transition time is the * notional written down value of the asset or the * undeducted pre-existing audited book value of the asset (depending on the choice made for the asset).

             (4)  No amount incurred before the * transition time is included in the second element of the * cost of a * privatised asset.

Asset sale situation

             (5)  The first element of the * cost of a * privatised asset to the purchaser at the * acquisition time is the sum of:

                     (a)  the * notional written down value of the asset or the * undeducted pre-existing audited book value of the asset (depending on the choice made for the asset); and

                     (b)  the amount of any incidental costs to the purchaser in acquiring the asset.

##### <a id="58-75"></a>58-75  Meaning of _notional written down value_

             (1)  The **_notional written down value_** of a * privatised asset is its * adjustable value in the hands of:

                     (a)  the * transition entity just before the * transition time; or

                     (b)  the * tax exempt vendor just before the * acquisition time;

worked out using the assumptions in this section.

Application of Division 40

             (2)  Assume that Division 40 had always applied to work out the decline in value of the * privatised asset.

Use for taxable purposes

             (3)  Assume that, in applying Division 40 to the * privatised asset, it had always been used by the * transition entity or the * tax exempt vendor wholly for * taxable purposes.

Cost and acquisition time: exempt Australian government agency

             (4)  If the * transition entity or the * tax exempt vendor was an * exempt Australian government agency just before the * transition time and had acquired the * privatised asset from another exempt Australian government agency:

                     (a)  assume that the transition entity or tax exempt vendor acquired it at the time when it was acquired or constructed by the other exempt Australian government agency and that the first element of its * cost to the transition entity or tax exempt vendor is the amount that was its cost to the other exempt Australian government agency; or

                     (b)  if it had, before its acquisition by the transition entity or tax exempt vendor, been successively * held by 2 or more exempt Australian government agencies—assume that:

                              (i)  the transition entity or tax exempt vendor acquired it at the time when it was acquired or constructed by the first of those exempt Australian government agencies that owned it; and

                             (ii)  the first element of its cost to the transition entity or tax exempt vendor is the sum of the amount that was the first element of its cost to the first of those exempt Australian government agencies that owned it and any amount included in the second element of its cost for that first agency or a later successive agency.

Effective life

             (5)  Assume that:

                     (a)  the * transition entity or the * tax exempt vendor had chosen to use an * effective life determined by the Commissioner for the * privatised asset as in force at the * transition time or the * acquisition time; and

                     (b)  subsection 40-95(2) did not apply.

             (6)  Assume also that section 40-110 (about recalculating effective life) did not apply.

##### <a id="58-80"></a>58-80  Meaning of _undeducted pre-existing audited book value_

             (1)  The **_undeducted pre-existing audited book value_** of a * privatised asset is its * adjustable value in the hands of:

                     (a)  the * transition entity just before the * transition time; or

                     (b)  the * tax exempt vendor just before the * acquisition time;

worked out using the assumptions in this section.

Application of Division 40

             (2)  Assume that Division 40 had always applied to work out the decline in value of the * privatised asset.

Use for taxable purposes

             (3)  Assume that, in applying Division 40 to the * privatised asset, it had always been used by the * transition entity or the * tax exempt vendor wholly for * taxable purposes.

Cost

             (4)  Assume that:

                     (a)  the first element of the * privatised asset’s * cost to the * transition entity or the * tax exempt vendor is its * pre-existing audited book value as at the latest time (the **_test time_**) at which it had a pre-existing audited book value; and

                     (b)  no amount was included in the second element of the asset’s cost before the test time; and

                     (c)  any amount included in the second element of the asset’s cost after the test time had been incurred by the transition entity or the tax exempt vendor.

Acquisition time

             (5)  Assume that the * transition entity or the * tax exempt vendor had acquired the * privatised asset at the test time.

Effective life

             (6)  Assume that:

                     (a)  the * transition entity or the * tax exempt vendor had chosen to use an * effective life determined by the Commissioner for the * privatised asset as in force at the * transition time or the * acquisition time; and

##### <a id="58-85"></a>58-85  Pre-existing audited book value of depreciating asset

             (1)  A * privatised asset has a **_pre-existing audited book value_** if:

                     (a)  a balance sheet, as at the end of an annual accounting period (the **_balance date_**), that was prepared as part of an * exempt entity’s final accounts for that period showed the asset as an asset of the exempt entity and specified a value for it; and

                     (b)  a qualified independent auditor who was engaged, or was required by law, to undertake an audit of those accounts had prepared and signed, before 4 August 1997, a final audit report on those accounts; and

                     (c)  the report did not state that the auditor was not satisfied that the specified value fairly represented the value of the asset.

The asset is taken to have had a **_pre-existing audited book value_** at the balance date of an amount equal to the specified value.

             (2)  If a balance sheet did not specify a value for the asset but specified a total value for 2 or more assets including the asset, the balance sheet is taken to have specified as the value of the asset so much of that total value as is reasonably attributable to the asset.

##### <a id="58-90"></a>58-90  Method for transition entity

                   The * transition entity must, in working out the decline in value of a * privatised asset, use the * diminishing value method or the * prime cost method for the asset that it used to work out the * notional written down value, or the * undeducted pre-existing audited book value, of the asset.

                   Gayle sells the print to Anna for $700 on 2 January 2002.

                   How much can Gayle deduct for the 2001-02 income year?

                   The cost of the print is $450\. Gayle chooses to use the prime cost method to calculate its decline in value.

                   The print’s decline in value is:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004C01190/Html/NewBusTaxSystCapAllowTranConseq2001_WD02_image013.gif)

                   Due to the balancing adjustment event that occurred on 2 January 2002, $54 is included in Gayle’s assessable income for the 2001-02 income year under section 40-285\. The amount is reduced for non-taxable use by section 40-290.

                   A capital gain of $202 is disregarded under this section because the asset is a collectable acquired for less than $500.

Example:    In 1999 Simon bought a small factory. In 2000 a fire destroys part of it. He receives $100,000 under an insurance policy.

                   The capital gain is worked out under section 112-30.

                   Suppose the factory’s cost base at the time of the fire is $75,000 and the market value of the part that is not destroyed is $150,000\. The cost base of the part that is destroyed is:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004C01190/Html/NewBusTaxSystCapAllowTranConseq2001_WD02_image014.gif)

                   The capital gain is:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004C01190/Html/NewBusTaxSystCapAllowTranConseq2001_WD02_image015.gif)

                   Case 1

                   Suppose Simon spent $80,000 on repairing the factory. The money he received under the insurance policy exceeds the repair cost by $20,000\. The gain exceeds that by $50,000.

                   The result is that the gain is reduced to $20,000 and the $80,000 he spent on repairs is reduced to $30,000.

                   Case 2

                   Suppose Simon spent $15,000 on repairs instead. The money he received under the policy exceeds that amount by $85,000\. This is more than the gain he made.

                   The gain is relevant to working out Simon’s net capital gain or loss for the income year and the $15,000 he spent on repairs forms part of the factory’s cost base.

                   Case 3

                   Suppose Simon spent $120,000 on repairs instead. The gain is disregarded and the $120,000 is reduced to $50,000.

                     (e)  there is no roll-over for you under Subdivision 124-J (about Crown leases) or Subdivision 124-L (about prospecting and mining entitlements).

Note 1:       The roll-over consequences are set out in Subdivision 124-A.

Note 2:       This section provides a roll-over for a depreciating asset in the limited circumstances where Subdivision 124-J cannot because a quasi-ownership right over land covers situations that a Crown lease does not (for example, an easement over land).
