#### Operative provisions

##### <a id="768-505"></a>768-505  Reducing a capital gain or loss from certain CGT events in relation to non-portfolio interests

             (1)  The * capital gain or * capital loss a company (the **_holding company_**) makes from a * CGT event that happened at a particular time (the **_time of the CGT event_**) to a * share in a company (the **_foreign disposal company_**) that is a foreign resident is reduced if:

                     (a)  the holding company held a * direct voting percentage of 10% or more in the foreign disposal company throughout a 12 month period that:

                              (i)  began no earlier than 24 months before the time of the CGT event; and

                             (ii)  ended no later than that time; and

                     (b)  the share is _not_:

                              (i)  an eligible finance share (within the meaning of Part X of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_); or

                             (ii)  a widely distributed finance share (within the meaning of that Part); and

                     (c)  the CGT event is CGT event A1, B1, C2, E1, E2, G3, J1, K4, K6, K10 or K11.

             (2)  The gain or loss is reduced by the * active foreign business asset percentage (see sections 768-510, 768-530 and 768-535) of the foreign disposal company in relation to the holding company at the time of the CGT event.

#### Active foreign business asset percentage

##### <a id="768-510"></a>768-510  Active foreign business asset percentage

             (1)  The **_active foreign business asset percentage_** of a company (the **_foreign company_**) that is a foreign resident, in relation to the holding company mentioned in section 768-505, at the time of the CGT event mentioned in that section, is worked out in accordance with this section.

Market value method

             (2)  Work out that percentage under section 768-520 if:

                     (a)  the holding company has made a choice under subsection 768-515(1) in relation to the foreign company for that time; and

                     (b)  there is sufficient evidence of the * market value at that time of:

                              (i)  all * assets included in the total assets of the foreign company at that time; and

                             (ii)  all * active foreign business assets of the foreign company at that time.

Book value method

             (3)  Work out that percentage under section 768-525 if:

                     (a)  the holding company has made a choice under subsection 768-515(2) in relation to the foreign company for that time; and

                     (b)  there are * recognised company accounts of the foreign company for a period that ends no later than that time, but no more than 12 months before that time; and

                     (c)  if the foreign company was in existence before the start of the period mentioned in paragraph (b)—there are recognised company accounts of the foreign company for a period that ends at least 6 months, but no more than 18 months, before the end of the period mentioned in paragraph (b).

Default method

             (4)  Otherwise, that percentage is:

                     (a)  100% (if this section is being applied for the purposes of section 768-505 to reduce a * capital loss of the holding company); or

                     (b)  zero (in any other case).

##### <a id="768-515"></a>768-515  Choices to apply market value method or book value method

Choice for market value method

             (1)  The holding company may choose to work out the * active foreign business asset percentage of the foreign company for the time of the CGT event under section 768-520.

Choice for book value method

             (2)  The holding company may choose to work out the * active foreign business asset percentage of the foreign company for the time of the CGT event under section 768-525.

Method of making choice

             (3)  The way an entity making a choice under subsection (1) or (2) prepares its * income tax return is sufficient evidence of the making of the choice.

Note:          If an entity does not make a choice under subsection (1) or (2), it will work out the active foreign business asset percentage of the foreign company in accordance with the default method in subsection 768-510(4).

##### <a id="768-520"></a>768-520  Market value method—choice made under subsection 768-515(1)

             (1)  The **_active foreign business asset percentage_** of the foreign company in relation to the holding company,at the time of the CGT event, is worked out under this section in this way.

<div style="BORDER-RIGHT: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-RIGHT: 5pt; BORDER-TOP: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-LEFT: 5pt; PADDING-BOTTOM: 5pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 2cm; BORDER-LEFT: windowtext 1pt solid; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0cm; PADDING-TOP: 5pt; BORDER-BOTTOM: windowtext 1pt solid">

_Method statement_

_Step 1._   Work out the * market value at that time of all * assets included in the total assets of the foreign company at that time.

_Step 2._   Work out the * market value (see subsection (2)) at that time of all * active foreign business assets of the foreign company at that time.

_Step 3._   Divide the result of step 2 by the result of step 1.

_Step 4_.   Express the result of step 3 as a percentage, and round that percentage to the nearest whole percentage point (rounding a number ending in .5 upwards).

_Step 5_.   The **_active foreign business asset percentage_** is:

               (a)     if the result of step 4 is less than 10%—zero; or

               (b)     if the result of step 4 is 10% or more, but less than 90%—that result; or

               (c)     if the result of step 4 is 90% or more—100%.</div>

Note 1:       If the foreign company is a foreign life insurance company or a foreign general insurance company, the result of step 2 is modified under section 768-530.

Note 2:       If the foreign company is a member of a wholly-owned group, section 768-535 may modify the way in which this section operates.

             (2)  If,at the time of the CGT event:

                     (a)  an * active foreign business asset of the foreign company is a * share in another company (the **_subsidiary company_**); and

                     (b)  the subsidiary company is a foreign resident;

then, in working out the * market value of all * active foreign business assets of the foreign company at that time for the purposes of step 2 of the method statement in subsection (1), treat the * market value of the share at that time according to the following table.

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  the asset is a * CGT asset at that time; and

                     (b)  the foreign company owns the asset at that time; and

                     (c)  if at that time the foreign company is _not_ an AFI subsidiary (within the meaning of Part X of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) whose sole or principal business is financial intermediary business (within the meaning of that Part)—the asset is _not_ a foreign company derivative asset covered by subsection (2).

             (2)  An asset is a foreign company derivative asset covered by this subsection if:

                     (a)  the asset is an * arrangement covered by subsection (3), unless the regulations declare the asset _not_ to be a foreign company derivative asset covered by this subsection; or

                     (b)  the regulations declare the asset to be a foreign company derivative asset covered by this subsection.

             (3)  An * arrangement is covered by this subsection if:

                     (c)  the amount of the consideration, or the value of the arrangement, is ultimately determined, derived from or varies by reference to (wholly or in part) the value or amount of something else (of any nature whatsoever and whether or not deliverable), including, for example, one or more of the following:

                              (i)  an asset;

                     (b)  otherwise—zero.

             (2)  In applying section 160AFB of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ for the purposes of subsection (1) of this section, assume that:

                     (b)  to include in the assessable income of a resident company that part of its income and capital gains derived through a branch in a foreign country that is comparable to the amounts that would be included in an attributable taxpayer’s assessable income for income and capital gains derived by a CFC resident in the same foreign country; and

                     (c)  to get the same outcomes where one or more partnerships or trusts are interposed between a resident company and a foreign branch.

Foreign branch income not assessable

             (2)  Subject to this section, foreign income derived by a company, at a time when the company is a resident in carrying on a business, at or through a PE of the company in a listed country or unlisted country is not assessable income, and is not exempt income, of the company.

Foreign capital gains and losses disregarded

             (3)  Subject to this section, a capital gain from a CGT event happening to a CGT asset is disregarded for the purposes of Part 3-1 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ if:

                     (c)  the asset does not have the necessary connection with Australia.

             (4)  Subject to this section, a capital loss from a CGT event happening to a CGT asset is disregarded for the purposes of Part 3-1 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ if:

                     (a)  the loss is made by a company that is a resident; and
