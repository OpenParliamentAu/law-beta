820-1  What this Division is about

 This Division applies to foreign controlled Australian entities, Australian entities that operate internationally and foreign entities that operate in Australia.
 Financing expenses that an entity can otherwise deduct from its assessable income may be disallowed under this Division in the following circumstances:

*	for an entity that is not an authorised deposit-taking institution for the purposes of the _Banking Act 1959_ (an _ADI_)&#151;the entity's debt exceeds the prescribed level (and the entity is therefore "thinly capitalised");

*	for an entity that is an ADI&#151;the entity's capital is less than the prescribed level (and the entity is therefore "thinly capitalised").

 Guide to Subdivision&#160;820-B </division>

820-65  What this Subdivision is about

 This Subdivision sets out the thin capitalisation rules that apply to an Australian entity that has certain types of overseas investments and is not an authorised deposit-taking institution (an _ADI_). These rules deal with the following matters:

*	how to work out the entity's maximum allowable debt for an income year;

*	how all or a part of the debt deductions claimed by the entity may be disallowed if the maximum allowable debt is exceeded;

*	how to apply these rules to a period that is less than an income year.

_Adjusted average debt_

result of applying the method statement in this subsection. In applying the

method statement, disregard any amount that is attributable to the entity's

</dd> </dl></dl>

_Method statement_

_Step 1._	Work out the average value, for that year (the _relevant year_), of all the <sup>*</sup>debt capital of the entity that gives rise to <sup>*</sup>debt deductions of the entity for that or any other income year.
 _Step 2._ Reduce the result of step 1 by the average value, for the relevant year, of all the <sup>*</sup>associate entity debt of the entity (other than any <sup>*</sup>controlled foreign entity debt of the entity).
 _Step 3._ Reduce the result of step 2 by the average value, for the relevant year, of all the <sup>*</sup>controlled foreign entity debt of the entity.
 _Step 4._ If the entity is a <sup>*</sup>financial entity throughout the relevant year, add to the result of step 3 the average value, for that year, of the entity's <sup>*</sup>zero-capital amount, to the extent that:

	(a)	the zero-capital amount is attributable to the securities loan arrangements mentioned in step 1 of the method statement in subsection 820-942(1); and
 	(b)	the securities loan arrangements are not <sup>*</sup>debt interests.

_Step 5_.	Add to the result of step 4 the average value, for the relevant year, of any <sup>*</sup>debt capital of the entity that does not give rise to any <sup>*</sup>debt deductions of the entity for that or any other income year, if:

	(a)	the debt capital is comprised of <sup>*</sup>debt interests issued to another entity that remain <sup>*</sup>on issue; and
 	(b)	that other entity is an <sup>*</sup>outward investing entity (non-ADI) or <sup>*</sup>inward investing entity (non-ADI) for a period that is, or includes, all or a part of the relevant year; and
 	(c)	for the purposes of the application of this Division to the entities, and in relation to only that part of the period that falls within the relevant year, the entities do not use the same <sup>*</sup>valuation days and the same number of valuation days to calculate the average value of their respective debt capital.

	The result of this step is the _adjusted average debt_.

establishments.

 </dl></dl>

_Method statement_

_Step 1._	Work out the average value, for the income year, of all the assets of the entity.
 _Step 2._ Reduce the result of step 1 by the average value, for that year, of all the <sup>*</sup>associate entity debt of the entity, other than associate entity debt that is <sup>*</sup>controlled foreign entity debt of the entity.
 _Step 3._ Reduce the result of step 2 by the average value, for that year, of all the <sup>*</sup>associate entity equity of the entity, other than associate entity equity that is <sup>*</sup>controlled foreign entity equity of the entity.
 _Step 4_.	Reduce the result of step 3 by the average value, for that year, of all the <sup>*</sup>controlled foreign entity debt of the entity.
 _Step 5._ Reduce the result of step 4 by the average value, for that year, of all the <sup>*</sup>controlled foreign entity equity of the entity.
 _Step 6._	Reduce the result of step 5 by the average value, for that year, of all the <sup>*</sup>non-debt liabilities of the entity. If the result of this step is a negative amount, it is taken to be nil.
 _Step 7._	Multiply the result of step 6 by <sup>3</sup>/4.
 _Step 8._	Add to the result of step 7 the average value, for that year, of the entity's <sup>*</sup>associate entity excess amount. The result of this step is the _safe harbour debt amount_.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Example:	AK Pty Ltd, a company that is an Australian entity, has

an average value of assets (other than assets attributable to its overseas

permanent establishments) of $100 million. 	The average values of its relevant associate entity debt, associate entity equity, controlled foreign entity debt, controlled foreign entity equity and non-debt liabilities are $10 million, $8 million, $5 million, $2 million and $5 million respectively. Deducting these amounts from the result of step 1 (through the application of steps 2 to 6) leaves $70 million. Multiplying $70 million by <sup>3</sup>/4 results in $52.5 million. As the average value of the company's associate entity excess amount is $4.5 million, the safe harbour debt amount is therefore $57 million.  </dl></dl>

The average values of its relevant associate entity debt, associate entity equity, controlled foreign entity debt, controlled foreign entity equity, non-debt liabilities and zero capital amount are $5 million, $5 million, $9 million, $6 million, $5 million and $4 million respectively. Deducting these amounts from the result of step 1 (through applying steps 2 to 7) leaves $126 million. Multiplying $126 million by <sup>20</sup>/21 results in $120 million. Adding the average zero capital amount of $4 million results in $124 million.

 _Step 6._	Reduce the result of step 5 by the amount (the _average on-lent amount_) which is the average value, for that year, of the entity's <sup>*</sup>on-lent amount (other than <sup>*</sup>controlled foreign entity debt of the entity). If the result of this step is a negative amount, it is taken to be nil.
 _Step 7._	Multiply the result of step 6 by <sup>3</sup>/4.

 _Step 9._ Reduce the result of step 8 by the average value, for that year, of all the <sup>*</sup>associate entity debt of the entity, other than associate entity debt that is <sup>*</sup>controlled foreign entity debt of the entity.
 _Step 10._	Add to the result of step 9 the average value, for that year, of the entity's <sup>*</sup>associate entity excess amount. The result of this step is the _adjusted on-lent amount_.

_Method statement_

_Step 1._	Divide the average value of all the entity's <sup>*</sup>worldwide debt for the income year by the average value of all the entity's <sup>*</sup>worldwide equity for that year.

 _Step 6._	Add to the result of step 5 the average value, for that year, of the entity's <sup>*</sup>associate entity excess amount. The result of this step is the _worldwide gearing debt amount_.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Example:	AK Pty Ltd, a company that is an Australian entity, has

investing entities (non-ADI)

 Guide to Subdivision&#160;820-C </division>

820-180  What this Subdivision is about

 This Subdivision sets out the thin capitalisation rules that apply to a foreign entity or a foreign controlled Australian entity that is not an authorised deposit-taking institution (an _ADI_). These rules deal with the following matters:

*	how to work out the entity's maximum allowable debt for an income year;

*	how all or a part of the debt deductions claimed by the entity may be disallowed if the maximum allowable debt is exceeded;

*	how to apply these rules to a period that is less than an income year.

_Adjusted average debt_

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(3)</dt><dd>The entity's _adjusted average debt_ for an income year is the

result of applying the method statement in this subsection.

</dd> </dl></dl>

_Method statement_

_Step 1._	Work out the average value, for that year (the _relevant year_), of all the <sup>*</sup>debt capital of the entity that gives rise to <sup>*</sup>debt deductions of the entity for that or any other income year.
 _Step 2._ Reduce the result of step 1 by the average value, for the relevant year, of:

	(a)	if the entity is an <sup>*</sup>inward investment vehicle (general) or an <sup>*</sup>inward investment vehicle (financial) for that year&#151;all the <sup>*</sup>associate entity debt of the entity; or
 	(b)	if the entity is an <sup>*</sup>inward investor (general) or an <sup>*</sup>inward investor (financial) for that year&#151;all the associate entity debt of the entity, to the extent that it is attributable to the entity's <sup>*</sup>Australian permanent establishments.

_Step 3._ If the entity is a <sup>*</sup>financial entity throughout the relevant year, add to the result of step 2 the average value, for that year, of the entity's <sup>*</sup>zero-capital amount, to the extent that:

	(a)	the zero-capital amount is attributable to the securities loan arrangements mentioned in step 1 of the method statement in subsection 820-942(1); and
 	(b)	the securities loan arrangements are not <sup>*</sup>debt interests.

_Step 4._	Add to the result of step 3 the average value, for the relevant year, of any <sup>*</sup>debt capital of the entity that does not give rise to any <sup>*</sup>debt deductions of the entity for that or any other income year, if:

	(a)	the debt capital is comprised of <sup>*</sup>debt interests issued to another entity that remain <sup>*</sup>on issue; and
 	(b)	that other entity is an <sup>*</sup>outward investing entity (non-ADI) or <sup>*</sup>inward investing entity (non-ADI) for a period that is, or includes, all or a part of the relevant year; and
 	(c)	for the purposes of the application of this Division to the entities, and in relation to only that part of the relevant year that falls within that period, the entities do not use the same <sup>*</sup>valuation days and the same number of valuation days to calculate the average value of their respective debt capital.

	The result of this step is the _adjusted average debt_.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note:	To calculate an average value for the purposes of this

Division, see Subdivision&#160;820-G.

 </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(4)</dt><dd>The entity's <sup>*</sup>adjusted average debt does not exceed its

<sup>*</sup>maximum allowable debt if the adjusted average debt is nil or a

negative amount.

</dd> </dl></dl>

820-190  Maximum allowable debt

 <dl compact=""><dl compact="">

		The entity's _maximum allowable debt_ for an income year is the

greater of the following amounts:

 </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>the <sup>*</sup>safe harbour debt amount;</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>the <sup>*</sup>arm's length debt amount.

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note:	The safe harbour debt amount differs depending on whether

the entity is an inward investment vehicle (general), inward investment vehicle

(financial), inward investor (general) or inward investor (financial), see

sections&#160;820-195 to 820-215.

 </dl></dl>

820-195  Safe harbour debt amount&#151;inward investment vehicle (general)

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

		If the entity is an <sup>*</sup>inward investment vehicle (general) for the

income year, the _safe harbour debt amount_ is the result of

applying the method statement in this section.

 </dl></dl>

<center>Back to Top</center>

_Method statement_

_Step 1._	Work out the average value, for the income year, of all the assets of the entity.
 _Step 2._ Reduce the result of step 1 by the average value, for that year, of all the <sup>*</sup>associate entity debt of the entity.
 _Step 3._ Reduce the result of step 2 by the average value, for that year, of all the <sup>*</sup>associate entity equity of the entity.
 _Step 4._	Reduce the result of step 3 by the average value, for that year, of all the <sup>*</sup>non-debt liabilities of the entity. If the result of this step is a negative amount, it is taken to be nil.
 _Step 5._	Multiply the result of step 4 by <sup>3</sup>/4.
 _Step 6._	Add to the result of step 5 the average value, for that year, of the entity's <sup>*</sup>associate entity excess amount. The result of this step is the _safe harbour debt amount_.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Example:	ALWZ Ltd, a company that is an Australian entity, has an

average value of assets of $100 million. 	The average values of its associate entity debt, associate entity equity and non-debt liabilities are $10 million, $5 million and $5 million respectively. Deducting these amounts from the result of step 1 (through applying steps 2 to 4) leaves $80 million. Multiplying $80 million by <sup>3</sup>/4 results in $60 million. As the average value of the company's associate entity excess amount is $2 million, the safe harbour debt amount is therefore $62 million.  </dl></dl>

820-200  Safe harbour debt amount&#151;inward investment vehicle (financial)

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>If the entity is an <sup>*</sup>inward investment vehicle (financial) for

the income year, the _safe harbour debt amount_ is the lesser of

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>the <sup>*</sup>total debt amount (worked out under

_Total debt amount_

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(2)</dt><dd>The _total debt amount_ is the result of the method statement

in this subsection.

</dd> </dl></dl>

_Method statement_

_Step 1._	Work out the average value, for the income year, of all the assets of the entity.
 _Step 2._ Reduce the result of step 1 by the average value, for that year, of all the <sup>*</sup>associate entity debt of the entity.
 _Step 3_.	Reduce the result of step 2 by the average value, for that year, of all the <sup>*</sup>associate entity equity of the entity.
 _Step 4._	Reduce the result of step 3 by the average value, for that year, of all the <sup>*</sup>non-debt liabilities of the entity.
 _Step 5._ Reduce the result of step 4 by the average value, for that year, of the entity's <sup>*</sup>zero-capital amount. If the result of this step is a negative amount, it is taken to be nil.
 _Step 6._	Multiply the result of step 5 by <sup>20</sup>/21.
 _Step 7._ Add to the result of step 6 the average value, for that year, of the entity's <sup>*</sup>zero-capital amount.
 _Step 8._	Add to the result of step 7 the average value, for that year, of the entity's <sup>*</sup>associate entity excess amount. The result of this step is the _total debt amount_.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Example:	KJW Finance Pty Ltd, a company that is an Australian

entity, has an average value of assets of $120 million. 	The average values of its associate entity debt, associate entity equity, its non-debt liabilities and its zero-capital amount are $5 million, $3 million, $2 million and $5 million respectively. Deducting these amounts from the result of step 1 (through applying steps 2 to 5) leaves $105 million. Multiplying $105 million by <sup>20</sup>/21 results in $100 million. Adding the zero-capital amount of $5 million to $100 million results in $105 million. As the company does not have any associate entity excess amount, the total debt amount is therefore $105 million.  </dl></dl>

 _Step 6._ Add to the result of step 5 the average on-lent amount.
 _Step 7._ Reduce the result of step 6 by the average value, for that year, of all the <sup>*</sup>associate entity debt of the entity.
 _Step 8._	Add to the result of step 7 the average value, for that year, of the entity's <sup>*</sup>associate entity excess amount. The result of this step is the _adjusted on-lent amount_.

Deducting these amounts from the result of step 1 (through applying steps 2 to 4) leaves $80 million. Multiplying $80 million by <sup>3</sup>/4 results in $60 million. Adding the average on-lent amount of $35 million results in $95 million. Reducing $95 million by the associate entity debt amount of $5 million results in $90 million. As the company does not have any associate entity excess amount, the adjusted on-lent amount is therefore $90 million.  </dl></dl>

820-205  Safe harbour debt amount&#151;inward investor (general)

 <dl compact=""><dl compact="">

		If the entity is an <sup>*</sup>inward investor (general) for the income

year, the _safe harbour debt amount_ is the result of applying the

_Method statement_

_Step 1._	Work out the average value, for the income year, of all of the following assets of the entity (the _Australian investments_):

	(a)	assets that are attributable to the entity's <sup>*</sup>Australian permanent establishments;
 	(b)	other assets that are held for the purposes of producing the entity's assessable income.

_Step 2._ Reduce the result of step 1 by the average value, for that year, of all the <sup>*</sup>associate entity debt of the entity that has arisen because of the Australian investments.
 _Step 3._ Reduce the result of step 2 by the average value, for that year, of all the <sup>*</sup>associate entity equity of the entity that has arisen because of the Australian investments.
 _Step 4._	Reduce the result of step 3 by the average value, for that year, of all the <sup>*</sup>non-debt liabilities of the entity that have arisen because of the Australian investments. If the result of this step is a negative amount, it is taken to be nil.
 _Step 5._	Multiply the result of step 4 by <sup>3</sup>/4.
 _Step 6._	Add to the result of step 5 the average value, for that year, of the entity's <sup>*</sup>associate entity excess amount. The result of this step is the _safe harbour debt amount_.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

_Method statement_

_Step 1._	Work out the average value, for that period, of all the <sup>*</sup>debt capital of the entity that gives rise to <sup>*</sup>debt deductions of the entity for that or any other income year.
 _Step 2._ Reduce the result of step 1 by the average value, for that period, of:

	(a)	if the entity is an <sup>*</sup>inward investment vehicle (general) or an <sup>*</sup>inward investment vehicle (financial) for that period&#151;all the <sup>*</sup>associate entity debt of the entity; or
 	(b)	if the entity is an <sup>*</sup>inward investor (general) or an <sup>*</sup>inward investor (financial) for that period&#151;all the associate entity debt of the entity, to the extent that it is attributable to the entity's <sup>*</sup>Australian permanent establishments.

_Step 3._ If the entity is a <sup>*</sup>financial entity throughout that period, add to the result of step 2 the average value, for that period, of the entity's <sup>*</sup>zero-capital amount, to the extent that:

	(a)	the zero-capital amount is attributable to the securities loan arrangements mentioned in step 1 of the method statement in subsection 820-942(1); and
 	(b)	the securities loan arrangements are not <sup>*</sup>debt interests.

_Step 4._	Add to the result of step 3 the average value, for that period (the _relevant period_), of any <sup>*</sup>debt capital of the entity that does not give rise to any <sup>*</sup>debt deductions of the entity for that or any other income year, if:

	(a)	the debt capital is comprised of <sup>*</sup>debt interests issued to 
<center>Back to Top</center>
 another entity that remain <sup>*</sup>on issue; and
 	(b)	that other entity is an <sup>*</sup>outward investing entity (non-ADI) or <sup>*</sup>inward investing entity (non-ADI) for a period that is, or includes, all or a part of the relevant period; and
 	(c)	for the purposes of the application of this Division to the entities, and in relation to only that part of the period that falls within the relevant period, the entities do not use the same <sup>*</sup>valuation days and the same number of valuation days to calculate the average value of their respective debt capital.

	The result of this step is the _adjusted average debt_.

investing entities (ADI)

 Guide to Subdivision&#160;820-D </division>

820-295  What this Subdivision is about

<center>Back to Top</center>

 This Subdivision sets out the thin capitalisation rules that apply to an entity that is both an authorised deposit-taking institution (an _ADI_) and an Australian entity that has certain types of overseas investments. These rules deal with the following matters:

*	how to work out the entity's minimum capital amount for an income year;

*	how all or a part of the debt deductions claimed by the entity may be disallowed if the minimum capital amount is not reached;

*	how to apply these rules to a period that is less than an income year.

 </dl></dl>

820-310  Safe harbour capital amount

 <dl compact=""><dl compact="">

		The _safe harbour capital amount_ is the result of applying the

method statement in this section. 

 </dl></dl>

_Method statement_

_Step 1._	Work out the average value, for the income year, of all the <sup>*</sup>risk-weighted assets of the entity, other than risk-weighted assets attributable to any of the following:

	(a)	the entity's <sup>*</sup>overseas permanent establishments;
 	(b)	assets comprised by the <sup>*</sup>controlled foreign entity equity of the entity (other than controlled foreign entity equity attributable to the entity's overseas permanent establishments);
 	(c)	assets for which <sup>*</sup>prudential capital deductions must be made by the entity (other than prudential capital deductions attributable to the entity's overseas permanent establishments).

_Step 2._	Multiply the result of step 1 by 4%.
 _Step 3._ Add to the result of step 2 the average value, for that year, of all the <sup>*</sup>tier 1 prudential capital deductions for the entity (to the extent that they are not attributable to any of the entity's <sup>*</sup>overseas permanent establishments or any <sup>*</sup>Australian controlled foreign entities of which the entity is an <sup>*</sup>Australian controller). The result of this step is the _safe harbour capital amount__._

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Example:	The Southern Cross Bank is an Australian bank that

carries on its banking business through its overseas permanent establishments

and through foreign entities that it controls. For the income year, its average

value of risk-weighted assets is $150 million (having discounted those

risk-weighted assets that are excluded by step 1) and the average value of its

relevant tier 1 prudential capital deductions is $2 million. Multiplying $150

million by 4% equals $6 million, which is the result of step 2\. Adding $2

million to $6 million equals $8 million, which is the safe harbour capital

amount.

820-320  Worldwide capital amount

 <dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>This section only applies if the entity is not also a <sup>*</sup>foreign

controlled Australian entity throughout the income year.</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>The _worldwide capital amount_ is the result of applying the method statement in this subsection. </dd> </dl></dl>

_Method statement_

_Step 1._	Work out the average value, for the income year, of all the <sup>*</sup>risk-weighted assets of the entity, other than risk-weighted assets attributable to any of the following:

	(a)	the entity's <sup>*</sup>overseas permanent establishments;
 	(b)	assets comprised by the <sup>*</sup>controlled foreign entity equity of the entity;
 	(c)	assets for which <sup>*</sup>prudential capital deductions must be made by the entity.

_Step 2._	Multiply the entity's worldwide group capital ratio for that year (see subsection&#160;(3)) by <sup>8</sup>/10.
 _Step 3._ Multiply the result of step 1 by the result of step 2.
 _Step 4._ Add to the result of step 3 the average value, for that year, of all the <sup>*</sup>tier 1 prudential capital deductions for the entity (to the extent that they are not attributable to any of the entity's <sup>*</sup>overseas permanent establishments or to any <sup>*</sup>Australian controlled foreign entities of which the entity is an <sup>*</sup>Australian controller). The result of this step is the _worldwide capital amount__._

<center>Back to Top</center>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Example:	Southern Cross Bank has an average value of

risk-weighted assets of $150 million (having discounted those risk-weighted

assets that are excluded by step 1) and the average value of its relevant tier

1 prudential capital deductions is $2 million. The entity's worldwide group

capital ratio is 0.0875\. Multiplying that ratio by <sup>8</sup>/10 equals 0.07,

which is the result of step 2\. Multiplying $150 million by 0.07 equals $10.5

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(3)</dt><dd>The entity's _worldwide group capital ratio_ for the income

</dd> </dl></dl>

_Method statement_

_Step 1._	Work out the average value, for the income year, of the tier 1 capital (within the meaning of the <sup>*</sup>prudential standards) of the consolidated group of which the entity is a member (within the meaning of those standards) in accordance with those standards.
 _Step 2._	Divide the result of step 1 by the average value, for that year, of the <sup>*</sup>risk-weighted assets of that group in accordance with the <sup>*</sup>prudential standards. The result is the _worldwide group capital ratio_.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Example:	For the Southern Cross Bank, the average value of the

tier 1 capital for the relevant consolidated group is $14 million. Dividing $14

million by the group's risk weighted assets of $160 million equals 0.0875,

which is the worldwide group capital ratio.

820-400  Minimum capital amount

 <dl compact=""><dl compact="">

lesser of the following amounts:

 </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>the <sup>*</sup>safe harbour capital amount;</dd>

820-405  Safe harbour capital amount

 <dl compact=""><dl compact="">

		The entity's _safe harbour capital amount_ for the income year is

the result of applying the method statement in this section.

 </dl></dl>

_Method statement_

_Step 1._	Work out the average value, for the income year, of that part of the <sup>*</sup>risk-weighted assets of the entity that:

	(a)	is attributable to the <sup>*</sup>Australian permanent establishments at or through which it carries on its banking business in Australia; but
 	(b)	is not attributable to the <sup>*</sup>OB activities of the Australian permanent establishments.

_Step 2._	Multiply the result of step 1 by 4%. The result of this step is the _safe harbour capital amount__._

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Example:	The Global Bank is a foreign bank that carries on its

banking business in Australia through a permanent establishment. The average

value of its relevant risk-weighted assets is $140 million. Multiplying that

amount by 4% results in $5.6 million, which is the safe harbour capital amount.

 </dl></dl>

820-410  Arm's length capital amount

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>the relevant factors mentioned in subsection&#160;(3);

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

 _Methods of calculation for entities that are not ADIs_

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>An entity to which Subdivision&#160;820-B or 820-C applies for a period

that is all or a part of an income year must use one of the following methods

to calculate the average value of a matter mentioned in that Subdivision for

the purposes of that application:

</dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>the method set out in section&#160;820-635 (the

<dt>(c)</dt><dd>the method set out in section&#160;820-645 (the _frequent measurement method_).

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note 1:	This subsection therefore applies only to an outward

investing entity (non-ADI) or an inward investing entity (non-ADI). Note 2:	An entity cannot apply the 3 measurement days method if it is unable to meet the requirements in subsection 820-640(1). An entity's ability to apply that method may therefore be limited.  </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(2)</dt><dd>The entity must use the same method to calculate all such average values

_Commissioner&apos;s power_

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(3)</dt><dd>If the entity fails to comply with subsection&#160;(2), the Commissioner

may, irrespective of the methods used by the entity, recalculate all the

average values for the entity and that period by using the opening and closing

balances method.

</dd> </dl></dl>

_Method of calculation for ADIs_

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(4)</dt><dd>An entity to which Subdivision&#160;820-D or 820-E applies for a period

that is all or a part of an income year must use the frequent measurement

method to calculate the average value of a matter mentioned in that Subdivision

for the purposes of that application.

</dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note:	This subsection therefore applies only to an outward

investing entity (ADI) or an inward investing entity (ADI).

 </dl></dl>

820-635  The opening and closing balances method

 <dl compact=""><dl compact="">

		An entity that uses the opening and closing balances method for a period must

apply the following method statement to calculate the average value of a matter

for that period.

 </dl></dl>

_Method statement_
 _Step 1._	Work out the value of the particular matter as at the first day of that period _._
 _Step 2._	Work out the value of the particular matter as at the last day of that period.
 _Step 3._	Add the results of steps 1 and 2.
 _Step 4._ Divide the result of step 3 by 2\. The result of this step is the average value.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Example:	ALWZ Corporation, a company that is an Australian

entity, held assets valued at $95 million on the first day of an income year.

It held assets valued at $105 million at the end of that year. Adding those

amounts and dividing the result by 2 gives the average value of its assets for

that year, which is $100 million.

 _Application_

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(2)</dt><dd>An entity that uses the 3 measurement days method for a period must apply

the following method statement to calculate the average value of a matter for

that period.

</dd> </dl></dl>

_Method statement_

_Step 1._	Work out the value of the particular matter as at the first measurement day (see subsection&#160;(3)).
 _Step 2._	Work out the value of the particular matter as at the second measurement day (see subsection&#160;(3)).
 _Step 3._	Work out the value of the particular matter as at the third measurement day (see subsection&#160;(3)).
 _Step 4._ Add the results of steps 1, 2 and 3.
 _Step 5._ Divide the result of step 4 by 3\. The result of this step is the average value.

first day of an income year. It held assets valued at $105 million on the last

day of the first half of that year, and $80 million on the last day of that

820-645  The frequent measurement method

 <dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>An entity that uses the frequent measurement method for a period (the

</dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

periods); or</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>the method statement in subsection&#160;(4) (generally based on regular

intervals).

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

This section does not prevent the entity from applying the method statement in subsection&#160;(2) for one matter and the method statement in subsection&#160;(4) for another matter in relation to that period.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(2)</dt><dd>This is the method statement for the purposes of paragraph&#160;(1)(a).

</dd> </dl></dl>

_Method statement_

_Step 1._	Work out the value of the particular matter as at each of the following measurement days:

	(a)	the first day of the measurement period;
 	(b)	the last day of each quarterly period of that income year (see subsection&#160;(3)) that occurs during the measurement period (if any);
 	(c)	the last day of the measurement period if it is not a day covered by paragraph&#160;(b).

_Step 2._	Add up those values.
 _Step 3._	Divide the result of step 2 by the number of measurement days. The result of this step is the average value.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Example:	KJW Finance Corporation, a company that is an Australian

entity, held assets valued at $130 million on the first day of an income year.

On the last day of each quarterly period for that year it held assets valued at

$140 million, $120 million, $110 million and $100 million respectively. Adding

these amounts and dividing the result by 5 gives the average value of its

assets for that year, which is $120 million.

 	(c)	the last day of the measurement period if it is not a day mentioned in paragraph&#160;(b).

_Step 2._	Add up those values.
 _Step 3._	Divide the result of step 2 by the number of measurement days. The result of this step is the average value.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Example:	TW Corporation, a company that is an Australian entity,

adopts a weekly interval for the purposes of this subsection. The measurement

period is a period of 12 weeks. On the first day of that period it had $70

million of debt capital. Its debt capital was $80 million on the last day of

each of the first 7 weeks, and $95 million on the last day of the remaining 5

weeks. Adding these amounts and dividing the result by 13 (the number of

measurement days) gives the average value of its debt capital for that period,

which is $85 million.

_Method statement_

_Step 1_.	Apply step 2 to each <sup>*</sup>associate entity of the relevant entity that is the kind of entity mentioned in paragraph&#160;(1)(a) at that particular time. The result of that step is the _associate entity debt amount_ for that associate entity.
 _Step 2._	Work out the value, as at that time, of all the <sup>*</sup>debt interests that have been issued to the relevant entity by the <sup>*</sup>associate entity, if:

	(a)	the debt interests remain <sup>*</sup>on issue at that time; and
 	(b)	the costs in relation to the debt interest (to the extent that they are not amounts mentioned in paragraph&#160;(2)(c) of the definition of _debt deduction_ that are ordinarily payable to an entity other than the relevant entity) are assessable income of the relevant entity for an income year; and
 	(c)	the terms and conditions for the debt interests are those that would apply if the relevant entity and the associate entity were dealing at arm's length with each other.

_Step 3._ Apply steps 2 and 4 to each <sup>*</sup>associate entity of the relevant entity that is the kind of entity mentioned in paragraph&#160;(1)(b) at that time. The lesser of the results of those steps is the _associate entity debt amount_ for that associate entity.
 _Step 4_.	Work out the value, as at that time, of the <sup>*</sup>debt capital of the <sup>*</sup>associate entity, to the extent that it is attributable to the <sup>*</sup>Australian permanent establishments of that associate entity.
 _Step 5._	Add the associate entity debt amounts for all the <sup>*</sup>associate entities. The result of this step is the _associate entity debt_.

_Method statement_

_Step 1._ Work out the premium excess amount (see subsection&#160;(3)), as at that particular time, for an <sup>*</sup>associate entity of the entity (the _relevant entity_) that is an <sup>*</sup>outward investing entity (non-ADI) or an <sup>*</sup>inward investing entity (non-ADI) at that time.
 _Step 2._ Add to the result of step 1 the attributable safe harbour excess amount (see subsection&#160;(4)) for that <sup>*</sup>associate entity as at that time.
 _Step 3._ Apply steps 1 and 2 to all such <sup>*</sup>associate entities of the relevant entity and add all the results that are positive amounts. The result of this step is the _associate entity excess amount_.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

establishments if it is an <sup>*</sup>outward investing entity (non-ADI) at

that time.

</dd> </dl></dl>

_Method statement_

_Step 1._ Work out the value, as at that particular time, of all the <sup>*</sup>associate entity equity of the relevant entity that is attributable to the <sup>*</sup>associate entity (other than the relevant entity's <sup>*</sup>controlled foreign entity equity if the relevant entity is an outward investing entity (non-ADI) at that time).
 _Step 2._ Reduce the result of step 1 by the value, as at that time, of the <sup>*</sup>equity capital of the <sup>*</sup>associate entity that is attributable to the relevant entity.
 _Step 3._ Multiply the result of step 2 by:

 	(b)	<sup>3</sup>/4 if the associate entity excess amount is applied for the purpose of working out the <sup>*</sup>adjusted on-lent amount of the relevant entity for that period under subsection 820-100(3), 820-200(3) or 820-210(3); or
 	(c)	<sup>3</sup>/4 if the associate entity excess amount is applied for the purpose of working out the <sup>*</sup>safe harbour debt amount of the relevant entity for that period under section&#160;820-95, 820-195 or 820-205; or
 	(d)	the result of step 4 of the method statement in subsection&#160;(1) or (2) of section&#160;820-110 (as appropriate) if the associate entity excess amount is applied for the purpose of working out the <sup>*</sup>worldwide gearing debt amount of the relevant entity for that period.

</dd> </dl></dl>

_Method statement_

_Step 1._	Work out the <sup>*</sup>safe harbour debt amount of the <sup>*</sup>associate entity for the day during which that particular time occurs, as if:

	(a)	the associate entity were an <sup>*</sup>outward investing entity (non-ADI) or <sup>*</sup>inward investing entity (non-ADI), as appropriate, for the period consisting only of that day; and
 	(b)	if the associate entity would otherwise be treated as an <sup>*</sup>outward investor (financial) for that day and the relevant entity is not a <sup>*</sup>financial entity throughout that day&#151;the associate entity were an <sup>*</sup>outward investor (general) for that day; and
 	(c)	if the associate entity would otherwise be treated as an <sup>*</sup>inward investment vehicle (financial) for that day and the relevant entity is not a financial entity throughout that day&#151;the associate entity were an <sup>*</sup>inward investment vehicle (general) for that day.

_Step 2._	Reduce the result of step 1 by the value of the <sup>*</sup>adjusted average debt of the <sup>*</sup>associate entity for that day as if it had been the kind of entity that it is taken to be under step 1 for that day. If the result of this step is a negative amount, it is taken to be nil.
 _Step 3._ Multiply the result of step 2 by the sum of:

	(a)	the value, as at that time, of all the <sup>*</sup>equity capital of the <sup>*</sup>associate entity that is attributable to the relevant entity at that time; and
 	(b)	the value, as at that time, of all the <sup>*</sup>debt interests issued to the relevant entity by the associate entity that do not give rise to <sup>*</sup>debt deductions of the associate entity for that or any other income year and remain <sup>*</sup>on issue at that time.

_Step 4._ Divide the result of step 3 by the sum of:

	(a)	the value, as at that time, of all the <sup>*</sup>equity capital of the <sup>*</sup>associate entity; and
 	(b)	the value, as at that time, of all the <sup>*</sup>debt interests issued by the associate entity that do not give rise to <sup>*</sup>debt deductions of the associate entity for that or any other income year and remain <sup>*</sup>on issue at that time.

	The result of this step is the _attributable safe harbour excess amount_.

 <dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>An entity's _zero-capital amount_ at a particular time is the

result of the method statement in this subsection.

</dd> </dl></dl>

_Method statement_

_Step 1._ Work out the total amounts, as at that particular time, that have been received by the entity for the sale of securities (other than any fees associated with the sale) under the following <sup>*</sup>arrangements if the entity has not repurchased the securities under the arrangements at that time:

	(a)	reciprocal purchase agreements (otherwise known as repurchase agreements);
 	(b)	sell-buyback arrangements;
 	(c)	securities loan arrangements.

_Step 2._ Add to the result of step 1 the total value, as at that time, of all the <sup>*</sup>debt interests issued to the entity to which the following paragraphs apply at that time:

	(a)	the debt interests remain <sup>*</sup>on issue;
 	(b)	each of the debt interests is a loan of money for which no fees, charges or other consideration for the purpose of enhancing the credit rating of the issuer of the interest has been paid or is payable to the entity, any of the entity's <sup>*</sup>associates or another entity that is a <sup>*</sup>foreign entity;
 	(c)	each of the entities issuing the interests has the required credit rating for the interests concerned in accordance with subsections&#160;(4) and (5).

_Step 3._ Add to the result of step 2 the total value, as at that time, of all the <sup>*</sup>debt interests that are assets of the entity (whether they are debt interests issued to the entity or not) and to which the following paragraphs apply at that time:

	(a)	the risk weight of each of the debt interests is either 0% or 20% under the <sup>*</sup>prudential standards;
 	(b)	the debt interests do not satisfy all of the paragraphs in step 2.

_Step 4._ Add to the result of step 3 the total value, as at that time, of all the <sup>*</sup>securitised assets that the entity has at that time if the entity is a <sup>*</sup>securitisation vehicle at that time (see subsections&#160;(2) and (3)). The result is the _zero-capital amount_.
