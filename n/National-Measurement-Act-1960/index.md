**Overview of Division**

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(1)   If an article that has been

packed in advance ready for sale is not marked with an AQS mark, the existence

of a shortfall is determined using a nationally recognised system of sampling

and testing groups of packages.</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(2)   If the group of packages is

too small to allow meaningful testing in this way national single article test

procedures are used.</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(3)   This Division contains a

series of shortfall offences based on these procedures for determining whether

there is a shortfall.</li>

                             (ii)  can be used with or is associated with the equipment.

             (4)  If the trade measurement inspector, after operating the equipment, finds that the equipment, or a disk, tape or other storage device, contains the information mentioned in subsection (3), he or she may:

                     (a)  seize the equipment or the disk, tape or other storage device; or

                     (b)  if the information can, by using facilities at the premises, or in or on the vehicle, be put in documentary form—operate the facilities to put the information in that form and seize the documents so produced; or

                     (c)  if the information can be transferred to a disk, tape or other storage device that:

                              (i)  is brought to the premises or the vehicle; or

the inspector may seize that other thing.

                     (d)  in the case of a public weighbridge licensee—continuously, for a period prescribed by the regulations, neither:

                              (i)  the licensee; nor

                             (ii)  an employee of the licensee; nor

             (2)  A licensee on whom such a notice is served may, within the period allowed by the notice, make a written submission to the Secretary on the matters concerned.

##### <a id="18QC"></a>18QC  Taking disciplinary action

             (1)  If, after consideration of any submissions made by the licensee within the period allowed, the Secretary is satisfied that grounds for disciplinary action against a licensee have been established, the Secretary may:

                     (b)  impose a condition on the licence; or

(6)        The new licence continues in effect until:

                             (ii)  stating that the person may make written representations to the administering authority within a period stating why the person considers the public weighbridge licence for the public weighbridge should not be cancelled; and

                     (b)  immediately before the transition day the period mentioned in subparagraph (a)(ii) has not expired;

then:

                     (c)  the notice is taken to be a notice given under 18PP of the new law in relation to the public weighbridge; and

                     (d)  the person may make written submissions to the Secretary within the period of 14 days beginning at the start of the transition day stating why the person considers the public weighbridge licence that the person is taken to hold under item 12 of this Schedule for the public weighbridge should not be cancelled; and

                     (e)  after considering any submissions made to the Secretary within that period, the Secretary may make a decision in accordance with section 18PP of the new law.

## 14  Orders preventing employment of certain persons

(1)        If, immediately before the transition day, an order under an employment prevention order provision is in force (the **_old order_**), then on and after the transition day, the old order is taken to be an order under:

                              (i)  not to employ a specified person to certify any measuring instrument;

                             (ii)  not to employ a specified person to certify a specified class or classes of measuring instruments;

                            (iii)  to employ a specified person to do either of the things mentioned in subparagraph (i) or (ii) only in compliance with specified conditions.

(2)        If the old order is one that, under paragraph (1)(a), is taken to have been made under section 18NN and a copy of the old order has not been served on a person to whom such an order is, under subsection 18NN(3), required to be served, a copy of the old order must be served on that person. However, nothing in this subitem or in subsection 18NN(3) affects the validity of the old order that continues to exist by force of subitem (1).

(3)        If the old order is one that, under paragraph (1)(b), is taken to have been made under section 18PQ and a copy of the old order has not been served on a person to whom such an order is, under subsection 18PQ(3), required to be served, a copy of the old order must be served on that person. However, nothing in this subitem or in subsection 18PQ(3) affects the validity of the old order that continues to exist by force of subitem (1).

(4)        For the purposes of this item, each of the following is an **_employment prevention order provision_**:

                     (a)  section 55 of the _Trade Measurement Act 1989_ of New South Wales;

                     (h)  section 55 of the _Trade Measurement Act_ of the Northern Territory.

## 15  Proceedings under new law if disciplinary action not yet commenced

If:

                     (a)  the Secretary reasonably suspects that there existed, before the transition day, grounds for disciplinary action under an earlier corresponding law in relation to a servicing licence or public weighbridge licence held by a person under that law immediately before that day (an **_old licence_**); and

                     (b)  no written notice has been served in accordance with the earlier corresponding law in relation to the grounds before the transition day;

then:

                     (c)  on and after the transition day, the grounds for disciplinary action in relation to the old licence are taken to be grounds for disciplinary action in relation to the licence that the person is taken to hold under item 12 of this Schedule (the **_new licence_**); and
