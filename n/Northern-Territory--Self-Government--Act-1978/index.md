                     (a)  in the case of a proposed law making provision only for or in relation to a matter specified under section 35:

                              (i)  that he or she assents to the proposed law; or

             (3)  The Administrator may return the proposed law to the Legislative Assembly with amendments that he or she recommends.

             (4)  The Legislative Assembly shall consider the amendments recommended by the Administrator and the proposed law, with those or any other amendments or without amendments, may be again presented to the Administrator for assent, and subsection (2) applies accordingly.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Signification of pleasure on proposed law reserved

             (1)  Where the Administrator reserves a proposed law for the Governor-General’s pleasure, the Governor-General shall, subject to this section, declare:

             (5)  The assent of the Governor-General to a proposed law or part of a proposed law is of no effect until notification of the Governor-General’s declaration in respect of the proposed law is published in the _Government Gazette_ of the Territory.

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Disallowance of enactments

             (4)  Upon publication of notice of the disallowance of a law, or part of a law, in the _Government Gazette_ of the Territory, the disallowance has, subject to subsection (5), the same effect as a repeal of the law or part of the law.

             (5)  If a provision of a disallowed law, or a provision of a disallowed part of a law, amended or repealed a law in force immediately before the commencement of that provision, the disallowance revives the previous law from the date of publication of the notice of disallowance as if the disallowed provision had not been made.
