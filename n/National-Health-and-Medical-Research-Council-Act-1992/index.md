## 132  Operation of laws

Things done by old NHMRC taken to be done by CEO

(1)       If, before the commencement time, a thing was done by, or in relation to, the old NHMRC, then, for the purposes of the operation of any law of the Commonwealth after the commencement time, the thing is taken to have been done by, or in relation to, the CEO.

(2)       For the purposes of subitem (1), a thing done before the commencement time under a provision that is amended by this Schedule has effect from that time as if it were done under that provision as amended. However, this is not taken to change the time at which the thing was actually done.

Minister and regulations may provide otherwise

(3)       The Minister may, by writing, determine that subitem (1):

                     (a)  does not apply in relation to a specified thing done by, or in relation to, the old NHMRC; or

                     (b)  applies as if the reference in that subitem to the CEO were a reference to the Commonwealth, the Council or a Principal Committee.

A determination under this subitem has effect accordingly.

However, this is not taken to change the time at which the thing was actually done.

Meaning of **doing**

(6)       To avoid doubt, for the purposes of this item, **_doing_** a thing includes making an instrument.

Determinations are not legislative instruments
