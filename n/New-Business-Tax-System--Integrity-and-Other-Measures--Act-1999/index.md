Guide to Division 45
45‑1  What this Division is about
This Division is designed to prevent tax being avoided through:
	(a)	the disposal of leased plant, or an interest in leased plant; or
	(b)	the disposal of a partnership interest in a partnership that leased plant; or
	(c)	the disposal of shares in a 100% subsidiary that leased plant;
where amounts have been deducted for depreciation of the plant.
It includes amounts in assessable income. Any benefit received, and any reduction in a liability, is taken into account in calculating the amounts included.
Where the disposal of shares in a 100% subsidiary is involved, the companies in the former wholly‑owned group may be made jointly and severally liable for tax that the former subsidiary does not pay.

Operative provisions
45‑5  Disposal of leased plant or lease
	(1)	An amount is included in your assessable income if:
	(a)	you have deducted or can deduct an amount for depreciation of *plant; and
	(b)	for most of the time when you owned or were the *quasi‑owner of the plant, you leased it to another entity; and
	(c)	all or part of the lease period occurred on or after 22 February 1999; and
	(d)	on or after that day, you dispose of the plant or an interest in the plant, and that disposal constitutes a *balancing adjustment event; and
	(e)	the sum of the following amounts is more than the plant’s *written down value or of that part of it that is attributable to that interest:
	(i)	the money you receive or are entitled to receive for the disposal;
	(ii)	the amount of any reduction in a liability of yours as a result of the disposal;
	(iii)	the market value of any other benefit you receive or are entitled to receive as a result of the disposal.
	(2)	The amount included is the excess referred to in paragraph (1)(e). It is included for the income year in which the disposal occurred.
Example:	Sean owns a leased asset. The asset has a written down value of $20,000. He has an outstanding loan for the asset of $60,000.
	Sean sells a 50% interest in the asset to Leprechaun Pty Ltd for $40,000. Leprechaun agrees to take over 50% of Sean’s obligation to make debt service payments.
	The excess referred to in paragraph 45‑5(1)(e) is:

	That amount is included in Sean’s assessable income.
	This amount would be reduced if part of it is included in Sean’s assessable income under another provision (see subsection 45‑5(5)).
Note 1:	There is a reduction of the amount included for certain plant acquired before 21 September 1999: see section 45‑30.
Note 2:	There is a limit on the amount included for plant for which there is a CGT exemption: see section 45‑35.
	(3)	An amount is also included in your assessable income if:
	(a)	you have deducted or can deduct an amount for depreciation of *plant; and
	(b)	for most of the time when you owned or were the *quasi‑owner of the plant, you leased it to another entity; and
	(c)	all or part of the lease period occurred on or after 22 February 1999; and
	(d)	on or after that day, you dispose of:
	(i)	your interest in the plant, or part of it; or
	(ii)	a right under, or an interest in, the lease;
		and that disposal does not constitute a *balancing adjustment event.
	(4)	The amount included is the sum of the following amounts:
	(a)	the money you receive or are entitled to receive for the disposal;
	(b)	the amount of any reduction in a liability of yours as a result of the disposal;
	(c)	the market value of any other benefit you receive or are entitled to receive as a result of the disposal;
It is included for the income year in which the disposal occurred.
	(5)	However, an amount is not included in your assessable income under this section to the extent that:
	(a)	it is included in that assessable income under a provision of this Act outside this Division; or
	(b)	you apply it under section 42‑285, 42‑290 or 42‑293 (about offsetting balancing charges); or
	(c)	roll‑over relief is available for the disposal under section 41‑20.
Note:	There are special rules for disposals between 22 February 1999 and 21 September 1999: see Division 45 of the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997.
45‑10  Disposal of interest in partnership
	(1)	An amount is included in your assessable income if:
	(a)	a partnership of which you are (or were) a member has deducted or can deduct an amount for depreciation of *plant; and
	(b)	the deductions have been or would be reflected in your interest in the partnership net income or partnership loss; and
	(c)	for most of the time when the partnership owned or was the *quasi‑owner of the plant, it leased it to another entity; and
	(d)	all or part of the lease period occurred on or after 22 February 1999; and
	(e)	on or after that day, you dispose of your interest in the plant, or part of it, and that disposal constitutes a *balancing adjustment event; and
	(f)	the sum of the following amounts is more than that part of the plant’s *written down value that is attributable to that interest:
	(i)	the money you receive or are entitled to receive for the disposal;
	(ii)	the amount of any reduction in a liability of yours as a result of the disposal;
	(iii)	the market value of any other benefit you receive or are entitled to receive as a result of the disposal.
	(2)	The amount included is the excess referred to in paragraph (1)(f). It is included for the income year in which the disposal occurred.
Example:	Chris has a 50% share in a partnership formed to lease an asset. The asset has a written down value of $124,000 (of which Chris’ share is $62,000).
	Chris assigns his partnership share to another entity for $34,000 plus the other entity agreeing to take over Chris’ obligations to service his share of the partnership debt (which is $165,000). The total consideration is:

	The amount assessable under section 45‑10 is the excess referred to in paragraph 45‑10(1)(f), which is:

	This amount would be reduced if part of it is included in Chris’ assessable income under another provision (see subsection 45‑10(5)).
Note 1:	There is a reduction of the amount included for certain plant acquired before 21 September 1999: see section 45‑30.
Note 2:	There is a limit on the amount included for plant for which there is a CGT exemption: see section 45‑35.
	(3)	An amount is also included in your assessable income if:
	(a)	a partnership of which you are (or were) a member has deducted or can deduct an amount for depreciation of *plant; and
	(b)	the deductions have been or would be reflected in your interest in the partnership net income or partnership loss; and
	(c)	for most of the time when the partnership owned or was the *quasi‑owner of the plant, it leased it to another entity; and
	(d)	all or part of the lease period occurred on or after 22 February 1999; and
	(e)	on or after that day, you dispose of:
	(i)	your interest in the plant, or part of it; or
	(ii)	a right under, or an interest in, the lease;
		and that disposal does not constitute a *balancing adjustment event.
	(4)	The amount included is the sum of the following amounts:
	(a)	the money you receive or are entitled to receive for the disposal;
	(b)	the amount of any reduction in a liability of yours as a result of the disposal;
	(c)	the market value of any other benefit you receive or are entitled to receive as a result of the disposal.
It is included for the income year in which the disposal occurred.
	(5)	However, an amount is not included in your assessable income under this section to the extent that:
	(a)	it is included in that assessable income under a provision of this Act outside this Division; or
	(b)	you apply it under section 42‑285, 42‑290 or 42‑293 (about offsetting balancing charges).
Note:	There are special rules for disposals between 22 February 1999 and 21 September 1999: see Division 45 of the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997.
45‑15  Disposal of shares in 100% subsidiary that leases plant
	(1)	A company (the former subsidiary) is treated as if it had disposed of *plant, received its market value for that disposal and immediately reacquired it for the same amount if:
	(a)	the former subsidiary has deducted or can deduct an amount for depreciation of the plant; and
	(b)	the former subsidiary was a *100% subsidiary of another company in a *wholly‑owned group at a time when it owned or was the *quasi‑owner of the plant; and
	(c)	for most of the time when the former subsidiary owned or was the quasi‑owner of the plant, the plant was leased to another entity; and
	(d)	the main *business of the former subsidiary was to lease assets; and
	(e)	all or part of the lease period occurred on or after 22 February 1999; and
	(f)	on or after that day, the direct or indirect beneficial ownership of more than 50% of the *shares in the former subsidiary is acquired by an entity or entities none of which is a member of the wholly‑owned group; and
	(g)	the plant’s *written down value at the time of that acquisition is less than its market value at that time.
	(2)	However, the former subsidiary is not treated as if it had disposed of *plant and reacquired it if the main business of each of the entities that acquired the direct or indirect beneficial ownership of *shares in the former subsidiary is the same as the main business of the *wholly‑owned group of which the former subsidiary was a member.
	(3)	The disposal and reacquisition of the *plant:
	(a)	is taken to have occurred when that direct or indirect beneficial ownership was acquired; and
	(b)	is taken not to have affected any lease of the plant.
	(4)	Despite sections 42‑285 and 42‑290, offsetting is not available under those sections for the disposal referred to in this section.
45‑20  Disposal of shares in 100% subsidiary that leases plant in partnership
	(1)	A company (also the former subsidiary) is treated as if it had disposed of its interest in *plant, received its market value for that disposal and immediately reacquired it for the same amount if:
	(a)	a partnership of which the former subsidiary is (or was) a member has deducted or can deduct an amount for depreciation of the plant; and
	(b)	the former subsidiary was a *100% subsidiary of another company in a *wholly‑owned group at a time when:
	(i)	it was a member of that partnership; and
	(ii)	the partnership owned or was the *quasi‑owner of the plant; and
	(c)	for most of the time when the partnership owned or was the quasi‑owner of the plant, the plant was leased to another entity; and
	(d)	the main *business of the partnership was to lease assets; and
	(e)	all or part of the lease period occurred on or after 22 February 1999; and
	(f)	on or after that day, the direct or indirect beneficial ownership of more than 50% of the *shares in the former subsidiary is acquired by an entity or entities none of which is a member of the wholly‑owned group; and
	(g)	the plant’s *written down value at the time of that acquisition is less than its market value at that time.
	(2)	However, the former subsidiary is not treated as if it had disposed of the interest and reacquired it if the main business of each of the entities that acquired the direct or indirect beneficial ownership of *shares in the former subsidiary is the same as the main business of the *wholly‑owned group of which the former subsidiary was a member.
	(3)	The disposal and reacquisition of the interest:
	(a)	is taken to have occurred when that direct or indirect beneficial ownership was acquired; and
	(b)	is taken not to have affected any lease of the plant.
	(4)	Despite sections 42‑285 and 42‑290, offsetting is not available under those sections for the disposal referred to in this section.
45‑25  Group members liable to pay outstanding tax
	(1)	The consequences specified in subsection (2) apply if:
	(a)	an amount is included in the former subsidiary’s assessable income for an income year because of section 45‑15 or 45‑20; and
	(b)	the former subsidiary is liable to pay an amount of income tax for that income year; and
	(c)	the former subsidiary does not pay all of that income tax within 6 months after it became payable.
	(2)	The consequences are that:
	(a)	the former subsidiary remains liable to pay the outstanding amount of income tax (reduced by any payments of tax imposed by the New Business Tax System (Former Subsidiary Tax Imposition) Act 1999); and
	(b)	each company that was, just before the time when the direct or indirect beneficial ownership referred to in paragraph 45‑15(1)(f) or 45‑20(1)(f) was acquired, a member of the former subsidiary’s former *wholly‑owned group, is jointly and severally liable to pay tax imposed by the New Business Tax System (Former Subsidiary Tax Imposition) Act 1999.
45‑30  Reduction for certain plant acquired before 21.9.99
	(1)	The amount included in your assessable income under subsection 45‑5(2) or 45‑10(2) is reduced if:
	(a)	you acquired the *plant at or before 11.45 am, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 21 September 1999 and you disposed of the plant or an interest in it after that time; and
	(b)	the sum of the amounts (your proceeds) referred to in paragraph 45‑5(1)(e) or 45‑10(1)(f) is more than the plant’s *cost, or that part of it that is attributable to the interest you disposed of.
	(2)	The amount included is reduced by the lesser of:
	(a)	the amount (if any) by which the *plant’s *cost base exceeds its *cost, or that part of the excess that is attributable to the interest you disposed of; and
	(b)	the difference between your proceeds and the plant’s cost, or that part of its cost that is attributable to the interest you disposed of.
	(3)	However, the amount is not reduced under this section if:
	(a)	the *plant was a *pre‑CGT asset at the time of the *balancing adjustment event; or
	(b)	a *capital gain or *capital loss from the plant or interest would be disregarded because of a provision listed in the table in this subsection if:
	(i)	you had made the gain or loss from *CGT event A1; and
	(ii)	that CGT event had happened at the time of the balancing adjustment event.

[This is the end of the Guide.]
Operative provisions
139‑10  When this Division may affect you
	(1)	You may have to make an adjustment under this Division if:
	(a)	a company (the debtor company) has an obligation to pay a debt to another company (the creditor company); and
	(b)	you have a *share in, a loan to or an indirect interest in the creditor company or a share in or an indirect interest in a share in the debtor company; and
	(c)	the conditions in subsection (3) or (4) are satisfied.
Exception
	(2)	No adjustment is required if the debtor company is a *100% subsidiary of the creditor company.
Conditions
	(3)	The conditions are that:
	(a)	*CGT event C2 (the trigger event) happens to the debt or part of it (the surrendered amount) at a time (the forgiveness time) on or after 22 February 1999; and
	(b)	the creditor company and debtor company are *under common ownership at the forgiveness time; and
	(c)	there is a shift in value from the creditor company to the debtor company as a result of the trigger event because the *capital proceeds the creditor company receives or is entitled to receive from the trigger event are less than the market value of the surrendered amount (at the forgiveness time).
	(4)	The conditions are that:
	(a)	there is a substantial and permanent reduction in the value of the debt because of something done (also the trigger event) by the creditor company or by both companies at a time (also the forgiveness time) on or after 22 February 1999; and
	(b)	the creditor company and debtor company are *under common ownership at the forgiveness time; and
	(c)	there is a shift in value from the creditor company to the debtor company as a result of the trigger event because the money, and market value of other property (if any), that the creditor company receives or is entitled to receive for that reduction is less than the amount of the reduction.
139‑15  Timing of adjustments
	(1)	All reductions to *cost bases and *reduced cost bases of direct interests in the creditor company are to be made as at the forgiveness time.
	(2)	The adjustments to *cost bases and *reduced cost bases of indirect interests in the creditor company, and direct and indirect interests in the debtor company, are to be made as at the time of the *CGT event referred to in section 139‑45 or 139‑50.
139‑20  Market value substitution rule not to apply
		In working out the *capital proceeds from a *CGT event (for this Division), disregard section 116‑30 (the market value substitution rule).
139‑25  Reduction in cost base of shares
	(1)	If you owned a *share in the creditor company at the forgiveness time, and you *acquired it on or after 20 September 1985, you must reduce its *cost base and *reduced cost base in accordance with this section.
Note:	A different calculation may apply in some circumstances: see section 139‑30.
	(2)	You must work out the factor (the share reduction factor) obtained by dividing the market value of the *share just before the forgiveness time by the sum of the market values of all the shares in the creditor company (that were acquired on or after 20 September 1985) just before that time.
	(3)	Reduce the *cost base and *reduced cost base of the *share in this way:
Method statement
Step 1.	Reduce the market value of the surrendered amount (just before the forgiveness time) or the amount of the substantial and permanent reduction in the value of the debt by:
	(a)	the *capital proceeds the creditor company receives or is entitled to receive from the trigger event; or
	(b)	the money, and market value of other property (if any), that the creditor company receives or is entitled to receive for the substantial and permanent reduction.
Step 2.	Multiply the result by the share reduction factor.
Step 3.	The result is the maximum reduction amount.
Step 4.	Reduce the *cost base and *reduced cost base of the *share to the extent possible by the maximum reduction amount.
139‑30  Different calculation in some circumstances
	(1)	However, you do not make a reduction for a *share under section 139‑25 if:
	(a)	at the forgiveness time:
	(i)	there were 2 or more classes of shares owned in the creditor company; or
	(ii)	you or another entity owned a share in the creditor company that you or the other entity *acquired before 20 September 1985; and
	(b)	it would be unreasonable to reduce the *cost base and *reduced cost base of the share by as much as would be the case under that section.
	(2)	Instead, you reduce the *cost base and *reduced cost base of the *share by a reasonable amount having regard to:
	(a)	the circumstances in which you *acquired the share; and
	(b)	the extent by which its market value was reduced by the trigger event.
139‑35  Reduction in cost base of loans
	(1)	If you owned a loan to the creditor company at the forgiveness time, and:
	(a)	you *acquired it on or after 20 September 1985; and
	(b)	either:
	(i)	the value of the loan was reduced by the trigger event; or
	(ii)	you did not deal at arm’s length with the creditor company in connection with the loan;
you must work out any reduction in its *cost base and *reduced cost base in accordance with this section if:
	(c)	the cost base or reduced cost base of one or more *shares in the creditor company is reduced to nil under section 139‑25; or
	(d)	no shares in the creditor company were acquired on or after 20 September 1985 and before the forgiveness time; or
	(e)	the market value of all shares in the creditor company that were acquired on or after that day is nil just before the forgiveness time.
Note:	A different calculation may apply in some circumstances: see section 139‑40.
	(2)	You must work out the factor (the loan reduction factor) obtained by dividing the market value of the loan just before the forgiveness time by the sum of the market values of all the loans to the creditor company (that were acquired on or after 20 September 1985) just before that time.
	(3)	If:
	(a)	there were no *shares in the creditor company on which section 139‑25 could operate; or
	(b)	the market value of all shares in the creditor company that were acquired on or after 20 September 1985 is nil just before the forgiveness time;
you reduce the *cost base and *reduced cost base of the loan in the same way as for section 139‑25, except that you use the loan reduction factor rather than the share reduction factor.
	(4)	If section 139‑25 has operated to reduce the *cost base of one or more *shares in the creditor company to nil, and the maximum reduction amount exceeded the cost base, multiply the excess by the loan reduction factor. This is done for each share whose cost base is reduced to nil.
	(5)	The sum of the amounts is the reduction in the *cost base of the loan.
	(6)	If section 139‑25 has operated to reduce the *reduced cost base of one or more *shares in the creditor company to nil, and the maximum reduction amount exceeded the reduced cost base, multiply the excess by the loan reduction factor. This is done for each share whose reduced cost base is reduced to nil.
	(7)	The sum of the amounts is the reduction in the *reduced cost base of the loan.
139‑40  Different calculation in some circumstances
	(1)	However, you do not reduce the *cost base or *reduced cost base of a loan under section 139‑35 if:
	(a)	at the forgiveness time:
	(i)	you or another entity owned a *share in the creditor company that you or the entity *acquired before 20 September 1985; or
	(ii)	you owned another loan to the creditor company; or
	(iii)	another loan to the creditor company was owned by a company that was a member of the same *wholly‑owned group at that time or by an individual referred to in paragraph 138‑15(2)(b) (about the ultimate owners); and
	(b)	it would be unreasonable to reduce it by as much as would be the case under that section.
	(2)	Instead, you reduce it by a reasonable amount having regard to:
	(a)	the circumstances in which you *acquired the loan; and
	(b)	the extent by which its market value was reduced by the trigger event.
139‑45  Reduction of cost base of indirect interests in creditor company
	(1)	You reduce the *cost base and *reduced cost base of a *CGT asset you own if:
	(a)	because of owning the asset, you have an indirect interest (through one or more interposed companies or trusts) in a *share in or a loan to the creditor company; and
	(b)	you owned the asset at the forgiveness time; and
	(c)	a *CGT event happens in relation to the asset; and
	(d)	you *acquired the CGT asset on or after 20 September 1985; and
	(e)	an earlier provision of this Division has operated to reduce the cost base or reduced cost base of one or more shares in, or loans to, the creditor company.
	(2)	The amount of the reduction is such amount as is reasonable having regard to:
	(a)	the reduction in the value of the *CGT asset as a result of the trigger event; and
	(b)	for the *cost base—inflation measured by reference to the All Groups Consumer Price Index Number (up to the end of 30 September 1999).
139‑50  Compensatory increases in interests in debtor company
	(1)	You increase the *cost base and *reduced cost base of a *CGT asset under this section if:
	(a)	the asset is a *share in the debtor company or an asset that gives you an indirect interest in a share in that company (through one or more interposed companies or trusts); and
	(b)	you owned the asset at the forgiveness time; and
	(c)	an earlier provision of this Division has operated to reduce the cost base or reduced cost base of one or more shares in, or loans to, the creditor company; and
	(d)	a *CGT event happens in relation to the asset; and
	(e)	you *acquired the CGT asset on or after 20 September 1985.
	(2)	The amount of the increase is such amount as is reasonable having regard to:
	(a)	the increase in the value of the *CGT asset as a result of the trigger event; and
	(b)	the amount of any relevant reductions made under this Division; and
	(c)	for the *cost base—inflation measured by reference to the All Groups Consumer Price Index Number (up to the end of 30 September 1999).

Guide to Subdivision 170‑D
170‑250  What this Subdivision is about
This Subdivision provides that there is a deferral of a *capital loss or deduction if a company (the originating company) that is a member of a *linked group disposes of a *CGT asset to, or creates a CGT asset in, another entity that:
	(a)	is a company that is also a member of the linked group; or
	(b)	is a connected entity of the originating company or an *associate of such a connected entity;
and the disposal or creation of the asset would have resulted in the originating company making a capital loss or becoming entitled to a deduction.

Operative provisions
170‑255  Application of Subdivision

	(a)	an event (the deferral event) happens involving a company (the originating company) and another entity; and
	(b)	one or more of the following apply:
	(i)	the deferral event is a *CGT event that would have resulted in the originating company making a *capital loss (except a capital loss that would be disregarded under a provision of this Act other than this Subdivision);
	(ii)	the deferral event would have resulted in the originating company becoming entitled to a deduction in respect of the disposal of a CGT asset;
	(iii)	if the originating company is a partner in a partnership—the deferral event would have resulted in the partnership becoming entitled to a deduction in respect of the disposal of a CGT asset; and
	(c)	if subparagraph (b)(i) applies—the CGT event is one of the following:
	(i)	CGT events A1 and B1 (a disposal case);

	(i)	the ability to exercise, or control the exercise of, any of the voting power in a company; or
	(ii)	the right to receive dividends that a company may pay; or
	(iii)	the right to receive a distribution of capital of a company;

	(b)	the interest is both direct and indirect;
only the direct interest is to be counted.
170‑265  Connected entity
	(1)	An entity is a connected entity of the originating company at a particular time if, at that time:
	(a)	the entity is a trustee of a trust and either:
	(i)	if the trust is a *fixed trust—one or more companies that are members of the *linked group of which the originating company is a member, or one or more of those companies and their *associates, between them have the right to receive for their own benefit (either directly, or indirectly through one or more interposed entities) more than 50% of any distribution to beneficiaries of the trust of income or corpus of the trust; or
	(ii)	if the trust is not a fixed trust—any company that is a member of the linked group of which the originating company is a member or any associate of such a company benefits or is capable of benefiting under the trust; or
	(b)	the entity is an individual who has a controlling stake in the company.
	(2)	For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), an individual has a controlling stake in a company at a particular time if the individual, or the individual and his or her *associates between them:
	(a)	are able at that time to exercise, or control the exercise of, more than 50% of the voting power in the company (either directly, or indirectly through one or more interposed entities); or

	(3)	If:
	(a)	apart from this subsection, an interest that gives an entity:
	(i)	the ability to exercise, or control the exercise of, any of the voting power in a company; or
	(ii)	the right to receive dividends that a company may pay; or
	(iii)	the right to receive a distribution of capital of a company;
		would, in the application of paragraph (2)(a), (b) or (c), be counted more than once; and
	(b)	the interest is both direct and indirect;
only the direct interest is to be counted.
170‑270  Immediate consequences for originating company
		If, apart from this Subdivision:
	(a)	the originating company would have made a *capital loss (except a capital loss that would be disregarded under a provision of this Act other than this Subdivision) as a result of the deferral event; or
	(b)	the originating company would have become entitled to a deduction in respect of the deferral event; or
	(c)	where the originating company is a partner in a partnership—the partnership would have become entitled to a deduction in respect of the deferral event;
the capital loss, the deduction or the partner’s share of the deduction, as the case may be, is disregarded.
170‑275  Subsequent consequences for originating company
	(1)	If, at a time after the deferral event, any one or more of the following events (the new events) happens:
	(a)	the *CGT asset involved ceases to exist;
	(b)	the CGT asset or a greater than 50% interest in it is *acquired by an entity that is none of the following:
	(i)	a member of the *linked group of which the originating company is a member;
	(ii)	a connected entity of the originating company;
	(iii)	an associate of such a connected entity;

	(d)	the originating company ceases to be a member of that linked group;
	(e)	if the CGT asset is owned by an entity that is a connected entity of the originating company or an associate of such a connected entity—the entity that owns the asset ceases to be such a connected entity or ceases to be an associate of the connected entity, as the case may be;
the originating company is taken, immediately before the time of the happening of the new event or the earliest of the new events, as the case may be, to have made a *capital loss equal to the amount of the capital loss referred to in section 170‑270 or to have become entitled to a deduction equal to the deduction, or the share of the deduction, referred to in that section, as the case may be.
	(2)	If the *capital loss referred to in section 170‑270 would have been made from a *personal use asset or from a *collectable, any corresponding capital loss that the originating company is taken by subsection (1) of this section to have made is taken to have been made from a personal use asset or from a collectable, as the case may be.
170‑280  What happens if the asset is acquired by an entity of a particular kind within 4 years
	(1)	This section applies if:
	(a)	as a result of the occurrence of a new event in respect of a *CGT asset, the originating company is taken by subsection 170‑275(1) to have made a *capital loss or to be entitled to a deduction; and
	(b)	within 4 years after the occurrence of the new event, the asset or a greater than 50% interest in it is *acquired by the originating company or by an entity that, at the time of the acquisition, is:

	(a)	the *CGT asset involved ceases to exist;
	(b)	the CGT asset or a greater than 50% interest in it is *acquired by an entity that is none of the following:
	(i)	a member of the *linked group of which the originating company is a member;
	(ii)	a connected entity of the originating company;
	(iii)	an associate of such a connected entity;
	(c)	if the asset is owned by a company that is a member of that linked group—that company ceases to be a member of the linked group;
	(d)	the originating company ceases to be a member of that linked group;
	(e)	if the CGT asset is owned by an entity that is a connected entity of the originating company or an associate of such a connected entity—the entity that owns the asset ceases to be such a connected entity or ceases to be an associate of the connected entity, as the case may be;
the originating company is taken, immediately before the time of the happening of the realisation event or the earliest of the realisation events, as the case may be , to have made a *capital loss equal to the amount of the capital loss referred to in subsection (2) or to have become entitled to a deduction equal to the deduction referred to in that subsection, as the case may be.
	(4)	If the *capital loss referred to in subsection (2) would have been made from a *personal use asset or from a *collectable, any corresponding capital loss that the originating company is taken by subsection (3) to have made is taken to have been made from a personal use asset or from a collectable, as the case may be.

[This is the end of the Guide]
Operative provisions
170‑205  Object of Subdivision
Interests in the loss company
	(1)	The main object of this Subdivision is to ensure that, if an amount of a *tax loss or *net capital loss is transferred by a company to another company in the same *wholly‑owned group, the loss transferred is not duplicated by a member of the group.
	(2)	Duplication could occur by the making of a *capital loss, or the reduction of a *capital gain, from a *CGT event that happens in relation to an equity interest held (directly or indirectly) in the loss company or by the making of a capital loss in relation to a debt interest held (directly or indirectly) in the loss company.
Interests in the income company or gain company
	(3)	This Subdivision may also require an adjustment to the cost base and reduced cost base of an equity or debt interest held (directly or indirectly) by a group company in the income company or gain company.
	(4)	This adjustment is to reflect an increase in the market value of the interest because of the transfer of the loss if the increase is still reflected in the market value of the interest when a *CGT event happens in relation to the interest.
170‑210  Transfer of tax loss: direct and indirect interests in the loss company
	(1)	If:
	(a)	an amount of a *tax loss is transferred by a company to another company; and
	(b)	Subdivision 170‑A applies in respect of the transfer; and
	(c)	a company (the group company) holds a *share in the loss company or is owed a debt by the loss company in respect of a loan; and
	(d)	the group company *acquired the share or debt on or after 20 September 1985; and
	(e)	throughout the deduction year, the group company is a member of the same *wholly‑owned group as the loss company (disregarding a period when either was not *in existence); and
	(f)	a *CGT event happens in relation to the share or debt on or after the commencement of this section; and
	(g)	the relevant agreement referred to in section 170‑50 is made on or after that commencement;
the *cost base and *reduced cost base of the share or the reduced cost base of the debt is reduced in accordance with subsection (3).
	(2)	If:
	(a)	an amount of a *tax loss is transferred by a company to another company; and
	(b)	Subdivision 170‑A applies in respect of the transfer; and
	(c)	a company (the group company) holds a *share in another company or is owed a debt by another company in respect of a loan; and
	(d)	the group company *acquired the share or debt on or after 20 September 1985; and
	(e)	the money that the group company paid for the share, or the borrowed money, has been applied (directly, or indirectly through one or more interposed entities):
	(i)	in the other company or a third company acquiring shares in the loss company; or
	(ii)	in a *borrowing by the loss company from the other company or from a third company; and
	(f)	throughout the deduction year, the group company, the other company and the third company (if any) are all members of the same *wholly‑owned group as the loss company (disregarding, for a particular company, a period when it was not *in existence); and
	(g)	a *CGT event happens in relation to the share or debt on or after the commencement of this section; and
	(h)	the relevant agreement referred to in section 170‑50 is made on or after that commencement;
the *cost base and *reduced cost base of the share or the reduced cost base of the debt is reduced in accordance with subsection (3).
	(3)	The *cost base and *reduced cost base of the share or the reduced cost base of the debt is reduced by an amount that is appropriate having regard to:
	(a)	the group company’s direct or indirect interest in the loss company; and
	(b)	the amount of the loss transferred; and
	(c)	the extent to which the loss reduced the market value of the share or debt; and
	(d)	any consideration received by the loss company for the loss transferred; and
	(e)	whether, because of a dividend or dividends paid by the loss company, the consideration is no longer reflected (wholly or partly) in the market value of the share or debt when a *CGT event happens in relation to it.
	(4)	Any reduction is to be made immediately before a *CGT event happens in relation to the share or debt and is to have effect from that time or the end of the deduction year, whichever is the earlier.
Note:	This subsection is relevant for indexing elements of a cost base (see sections 114‑1 and 114‑15).
170‑215  Transfer of tax loss: direct and indirect interests in the income company
	(1)	If:
	(a)	an amount of a *tax loss is transferred by a company to another company; and
	(b)	Subdivision 170‑A applies in respect of the transfer; and
	(c)	a company (the group company) holds a *share in the income company or is owed a debt by the income company in respect of a loan; and
	(d)	the group company *acquired the share or debt on or after 20 September 1985; and
	(e)	throughout the deduction year, the group company is a member of the same *wholly‑owned group as the income company (disregarding a period when either was not *in existence); and
	(f)	a *CGT event happens in relation to the share or debt on or after the commencement of this section; and
	(g)	the relevant agreement referred to in section 170‑50 is made on or after that commencement;
the *cost base and *reduced cost base of the share or debt are increased in accordance with subsection (3).
	(2)	If:
	(a)	an amount of a *tax loss is transferred by a company to another company; and
	(b)	Subdivision 170‑A applies in respect of the transfer; and
	(c)	a company (the group company) holds a *share in another company or is owed a debt by another company in respect of a loan; and
	(d)	the group company *acquired the share or debt on or after 20 September 1985; and
	(e)	the money that the group company paid for the share, or the borrowed money, has been applied (directly, or indirectly through one or more interposed entities):
	(i)	in the other company or a third company acquiring shares in the income company; or
	(ii)	in a *borrowing by the income company from the other company or from a third company; and
	(f)	throughout the deduction year, the group company, the other company and the third company (if any) are all members of the same *wholly‑owned group as the income company (disregarding, for a particular company, a period when it was not *in existence); and
	(g)	a *CGT event happens in relation to the share or debt on or after the commencement of this section; and
	(h)	the relevant agreement referred to in section 170‑50 is made on or after that commencement;
the *cost base and *reduced cost base of the share or debt are increased in accordance with subsection (3).
	(3)	The *cost base and *reduced cost base are increased by an amount that is appropriate having regard to:
	(a)	the group company’s direct or indirect interest in the income company; and
	(b)	the amount of the loss transferred; and
	(c)	any consideration given by the income company for the loss transferred.
Note:	This is because the consideration may be less than the commercial value of the loss transferred.
	(4)	However, the increase cannot exceed the increase in the market value of the *share or debt that results from the transfer of the loss. (If no increase in that market value results, for example because the consideration paid for the transfer of the loss equals the commercial value of the loss transferred, then there is no increase in the *cost base and *reduced cost base.)
	(5)	Any increase is to be made immediately before a *CGT event happens in relation to the share or debt and is to have effect from that time or the end of the deduction year, whichever is the earlier.
Note:	This subsection is relevant for indexing elements of a cost base (see sections 114‑1 and 114‑15).
	(6)	No increase is to be made to the *cost base and *reduced cost base of a share or debt to the extent to which, because of a dividend or dividends paid by the income company, the increase in the market value of the share or debt that resulted from the transfer of the loss is no longer in existence at the time when a *CGT event happens in relation to the share or debt.
170‑220  Transfer of net capital loss: direct and indirect interests in the loss company

	(d)	the group company *acquired the share or debt on or after 20 September 1985; and
	(e)	throughout the application year, the group company is a member of the same *wholly‑owned group as the loss company (disregarding a period when either was not *in existence); and

	(f)	throughout the application year, the group company, the other company and the third company (if any) are all members of the same *wholly‑owned group as the loss company (disregarding, for a particular company, a period when it was not *in existence); and
	(g)	the relevant agreement referred to in section 170‑150 is made on or after the commencement of this section;
the *cost base and *reduced cost base of the share or debt are reduced in accordance with subsection (3).
	(3)	The *cost base and *reduced cost base are reduced by an amount that is appropriate having regard to:
	(a)	the group company’s direct or indirect interest in the loss company; and
	(b)	the amount of the loss transferred; and
	(c)	the extent to which the loss reduced the market value of the share or debt; and
	(d)	any consideration received by the loss company for the loss transferred; and
	(e)	whether, because of a dividend or dividends paid by the loss company, the consideration is no longer reflected (wholly or partly) in the market value of the share or debt when a *CGT event happens in relation to it.
	(4)	Any reduction is to be made immediately before a *CGT event happens in relation to the share or debt and is to have effect from that time or the end of the application year, whichever is the earlier.
Note 1:	Subsection (4) is relevant for indexing elements of a cost base (see sections 114‑1 and 114‑15).

170‑225  Transfer of net capital loss: direct and indirect interests in the gain company
	(1)	If:
	(a)	an amount of a *net capital loss is transferred by a company to another company; and
	(b)	Subdivision 170‑B applies in respect of the transfer; and
	(c)	a company (the group company) holds a *share in the gain company or is owed a debt by the gain company in respect of a loan; and
	(d)	the group company *acquired the share or debt on or after 20 September 1985; and
	(e)	throughout the application year, the group company is a member of the same *wholly‑owned group as the gain company (disregarding a period when either was not *in existence); and
	(f)	the relevant agreement referred to in section 170‑150 is made on or after the commencement of this section;
the *cost base and *reduced cost base of the share or debt are increased in accordance with subsection (3).
	(2)	If:
	(a)	an amount of a *net capital loss is transferred by a company to another company; and
	(b)	Subdivision 170‑B applies in respect of the transfer; and
	(c)	a company (the group company) holds a *share in another company or is owed a debt by another company in respect of a loan; and
	(d)	the group company *acquired the share or debt on or after 20 September 1985; and
	(e)	the money that the group company paid for the share, or the borrowed money, has been applied (directly, or indirectly through one or more interposed entities):
	(i)	in the other company or a third company acquiring shares in the gain company; or
	(ii)	in a *borrowing by the gain company from the other company or from a third company; and
	(f)	throughout the application year, the group company, the other company and the third company (if any) are all members of the same *wholly‑owned group as the gain company (disregarding, for a particular company, a period when it was not *in existence); and
	(g)	the relevant agreement referred to in section 170‑150 is made on or after the commencement of this section;
the *cost base and *reduced cost base of the share or debt are increased in accordance with subsection (3).
	(3)	The *cost base and *reduced cost base are increased by an amount that is appropriate having regard to:
	(a)	the group company’s direct or indirect interest in the gain company; and
	(b)	the amount of the loss transferred; and
	(c)	any consideration given by the gain company for the loss transferred.
Note:	This is because the consideration may be less than the commercial value of the loss transferred.
	(4)	However, the increase cannot exceed the increase in the market value of the *share or debt that results from the transfer of the loss. (If no increase in that market value results, for example because the consideration paid for the transfer of the loss equals the commercial value of the loss transferred, then there is no increase in the *cost base and *reduced cost base.)
	(5)	Any increase is to be made immediately before a *CGT event happens in relation to the share or debt and is to have effect from that time or the end of the application year, whichever is the earlier.
Note:	This subsection is relevant for indexing elements of a cost base (see sections 114‑1 and 114‑15).
	(6)	No increase is to be made to the *cost base and *reduced cost base of a share or debt to the extent to which, because of a dividend or dividends paid by the gain company, the increase in the market value of the share or debt that resulted from the transfer of the loss is no longer in existence at the time when a *CGT event happens in relation to the share or debt.
Note:	Increases under subsections 160ZP(14) and (15) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 are also relevant: see section 170‑225 of the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997.

Operative provisions
165‑115A  Application of Subdivision
Application
	(1)	This Subdivision applies to a company if:
	(a)	a changeover time has occurred or occurs in relation to the company after the commencement time; and
	(b)	at the changeover time the company had an unrealised net loss (see section 165‑115E); and
	(c)	the company makes a *capital loss, or apart from this section would be entitled to a deduction, in respect of a *CGT event that happens to a *CGT asset that the company owned at the changeover time.
Commencement time
	(2)	For the purposes of this Subdivision, the commencement time of a company is:
	(a)	if the company was in existence at 11.45 am (by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory) on 21 September 1999—that time; or
	(b)	if the company came into existence after that time—the time when it came into existence.
Asset owned at more than one changeover time
	(3)	If:
	(a)	2 or more changeover times have occurred or occur in relation to a company; and
	(b)	the company owned a particular asset at more than one of those changeover times;
this Subdivision applies to the company in respect of that asset only in relation to the later or latest of those changeover times.
Note:	For changeover time see sections 165‑115C and 165‑115D.
165‑115B  What happens when the company makes a capital loss or becomes entitled to a deduction in respect of a CGT asset owned at a changeover time
Where capital loss or deduction is equal to or less than residual unrealised net loss
	(1)	If the *capital loss or deduction referred to in paragraph 165‑115A(1)(c) is equal to or less than the company’s residual unrealised net loss at the time of the occurrence of the event that resulted in the capital loss or entitled the company to the deduction:
	(a)	the capital loss is taken to have been a *net capital loss; or
	(b)	the deduction is taken to have been a *tax loss;
of the company for the income year immediately before the income year in which the changeover time occurred.
Where capital loss or deduction is greater than residual unrealised net loss
	(2)	If the *capital loss or deduction referred to in paragraph 165‑115A(1)(c) is greater than the company’s residual unrealised net loss at the time of the occurrence of the event that resulted in the capital loss or entitled the company to the deduction:
	(a)	the part of the capital loss that is equal to that unrealised net loss is taken to have been a *net capital loss; or
	(b)	the part of the deduction that is equal to that unrealised net loss is taken to have been a *tax loss;
of the company for the income year immediately before the income year in which the changeover time occurred.
Company does not meet certain conditions in relation to net capital loss or tax loss
	(3)	The company is taken not to have met, at the changeover time, the conditions in subsections 165‑12(2), (3) and (4) in relation to the *net capital loss or the *tax loss. For the purposes of the application of section 165‑13 in relation to the company, the continuity period is taken to have ended at the changeover time.
Need to meet same business test
	(4)	The effect of subsection (3) is that the company cannot apply the *net capital loss (see section 165‑10 as it applies because of section 165‑96), or deduct the *tax loss (see section 165‑10), unless it meets the conditions in section 165‑13 (the same business test).
Consequences for net capital loss
	(5)	The *net capital loss cannot be applied against *capital gains made in an income year before the income year in which the company made the capital loss referred to in paragraph 165‑115A(1)(c).
Consequences for tax loss
	(6)	The *tax loss cannot be deducted from assessable income derived in an income year before the income year in which the company would have been entitled to the deduction referred to in paragraph 165‑115A(1)(c).
Order in which assets to be applied
	(7)	In applying subsection (2) in respect of assets that the company owned at the changeover time:
	(a)	the company’s *capital losses are taken to have been made, and the company is taken to have become entitled to deductions, in the order in which the events that resulted in the capital losses or deductions occurred; and
	(b)	if 2 or more such events occurred at the same time, they are taken to have occurred in such order as the company determines.
Residual unrealised net loss
	(8)	The company’s residual unrealised net loss, at the time of an event (the relevant event) that resulted in the company making a *capital loss, or resulted in the company becoming entitled to a deduction, in respect of an asset, is the amount worked out using the following formula:

where:
previous capital losses or deductions means capital losses that the company made, or deductions to which the company became entitled, as a result of events earlier than the relevant event in respect of other assets that the company owned at the changeover time.
unrealised net loss means the company’s unrealised net loss at the last changeover time that occurred before the relevant event.
Note:	For changeover time see sections 165‑115C and 165‑115D.
165‑115C  Change in ownership of company
	(1)	A change takes place in the ownership of a company at a particular time (a changeover time) if:
	(a)	persons who had *more than 50% of the voting power in the company at the reference time do not have more than 50% of that voting power immediately after the changeover time; or
	(b)	persons who had rights to *more than 50% of the company’s dividends at the reference time do not have rights to more than 50% of those dividends immediately after the changeover time; or
	(c)	persons who had rights to *more than 50% of the company’s capital distributions at the reference time do not have rights to more than 50% of those distributions immediately after the changeover time.
Note 1:	See section 165‑150 to work out who had more than 50% of the voting power in the company.
Note 2:	See section 165‑155 to work out who had rights to more than 50% of the company’s dividends.
Note 3:	See section 165‑160 to work out who had rights to more than 50% of the company’s capital distributions.
	(2)	To work out whether paragraph (1)(a), (b) or (c) applied at a particular time, apply the primary test unless subsection (3) requires the alternative test to be applied.
Note:	For the primary test see subsections 165‑150(1), 165‑155(1) and 165‑160(1).
	(3)	Apply the alternative test if one or more other companies beneficially owned *shares or interests in shares in the company at the reference time.
Note:	For the alternative test see subsections 165‑150(2), 165‑155(2) and 165‑160(2).
	(4)	For the purposes of the application of this section to a company at a changeover time, the reference time is:
	(a)	if no changeover time has previously occurred—the commencement time; or
	(b)	otherwise—the time immediately after the last preceding changeover time.
165‑115D  Change in control of company
	(1)	A change takes place in the control of a company at a particular time (a changeover time) if, at that time:
	(a)	a person who did not control, or was not able to control, the voting power in the company:
	(i)	if no changeover time has previously occurred—at the commencement time; or
	(ii)	otherwise—immediately after the last changeover time;
		began to control, or became able to control, that voting power; and
	(b)	that person so began, or became able, to control that voting power for the purpose of:
	(i)	getting some benefit or advantage in relation to how this Act applies; or
	(ii)	getting such a benefit or advantage for someone else;
		or for purposes including that purpose.
	(2)	In this section:
control of the voting power in a company means control of that voting power either directly, or indirectly through one or more interposed entities.
165‑115E  What is an unrealised net loss
		The question whether a company has an unrealised net loss at a particular time (the relevant time) is worked out in this way.
Method statement
Step 1.	Work out under section 165‑115F in respect of each *CGT asset that the company owned at the relevant time any notional capital gain or notional revenue gain or any notional capital loss or notional revenue loss that the company has at that time in respect of the asset.
	The sum of the notional capital gains is the company’s unrealised capital gain at the relevant time.
	The sum of the notional capital losses is the company’s unrealised capital loss at the relevant time.
	The sum of the notional revenue gains is the company’s unrealised revenue gain at the relevant time.
	The sum of the notional revenue losses is the company’s unrealised revenue loss at the relevant time.
Step 2.	Add up the unrealised capital gain and the unrealised revenue gain at the relevant time. The total is the unrealised gross gain at that time.
Step 3.	Add up the unrealised capital loss and the unrealised revenue loss at the relevant time. The total is the unrealised gross loss at that time.
Step 4.	If the unrealised gross loss at the relevant time exceeds the unrealised gross gain at that time, the excess is the company’s unrealised net loss at that time.
165‑115F  Notional gains and losses
	(1)	This section applies for the purpose of calculating whether a company has at a particular time (the relevant time) a notional capital gain, a notional capital loss, a notional revenue gain or a notional revenue loss in respect of a *CGT asset that it owned at that time.
	(2)	The calculation is to be made on the assumption that the company disposed of the asset at its market value at the relevant time.
	(3)	In relation to an asset other than an item of trading stock:
	(a)	if the company would make a *capital gain in respect of the disposal of the asset—the company has at the relevant time in respect of the asset a notional capital gain equal to the amount of the capital gain; or
	(b)	if an amount (other than a capital gain) would be included in the company’s assessable income in respect of the disposal of the asset—the company has at the relevant time in respect of the asset a notional revenue gain equal to the amount so included; or
	(c)	if the company would make a *capital loss in respect of the disposal of the asset—the company has at the relevant time in respect of the asset a notional capital loss equal to the amount of the capital loss; or
	(d)	if the company would be entitled to a deduction in respect of the disposal of the asset—the company has at the relevant time in respect of the asset a notional revenue loss equal to the amount of the deduction.
	(4)	In relation to an asset that is an item of trading stock:
	(a)	if the item’s market value at the relevant time exceeds:
	(i)	in respect of an item that has been valued under Division 70—the item’s latest valuation under that Division; or
	(ii)	otherwise—the *cost of the item at the relevant time;
		the company has at the relevant time in respect of the article a notional revenue gain equal to the excess; or
	(b)	if the item’s market value at the relevant time is less than:
	(i)	in respect of an item that has been valued under Division 70—the item’s latest valuation under that Division; or
	(ii)	otherwise—the *cost of the item at the relevant time;
		the company has at the relevant time in respect of the article a notional revenue loss equal to the difference.

82KZMA  Application of sections 82KZMB, 82KZMC and 82KZMD
Overview
	(1)	Sections 82KZMB, 82KZMC and 82KZMD set the amount and timing of deductions for expenditure that a taxpayer incurs in an income year (the expenditure year), if:
	(a)	apart from those sections, the taxpayer could deduct the expenditure under section 8‑1 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 for the expenditure year; and
	(b)	the requirements in subsections (2), (3), (4) and (5) are met.
Note:	Sections 82KZMB and 82KZMC deal with expenditure with an eligible service period ending up to 13 months after the expenditure was incurred. Section 82KZMD deals with expenditure with a longer eligible service period. Subsection 82KZL(1) explains what the eligible service period for expenditure is.
Requirements for taxpayer
	(2)	The taxpayer:
	(a)	must carry on a business; and
	(b)	must not be a small business taxpayer.
Requirements for expenditure
	(3)	The expenditure must be incurred:
	(a)	in carrying on the business; and
	(b)	under an agreement (see subsection 82KZL(1)); and
	(c)	in return for the doing of a thing under the agreement that is not to be wholly done within the expenditure year.
Requirement for expenditure not to be excluded expenditure
	(4)	The expenditure must not be excluded expenditure (see subsection 82KZL(1)).
Requirement for expenditure not to meet pre‑RBT obligation
	(5)	The expenditure must not meet a pre‑RBT obligation (see subsection 82KZL(1)).
Relationship with other provisions
	(6)	Sections 82KZMB, 82KZMC and 82KZMD have effect:
	(a)	despite section 8‑1 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997; and
	(b)	subject to Division 245 of Schedule 2C to this Act.
82KZMB  Expenditure with eligible service period ending up to 13 months later
Application
	(1)	This section and section 82KZMC apply to expenditure whose eligible service period ends not more than 13 months after the taxpayer incurs the expenditure.
Note:	Subsection 82KZL(1) explains what the eligible service period for expenditure is.
Deduction for expenditure year
	(2)	The taxpayer may deduct for the expenditure year the sum of:
	(a)	the amount (if any) worked out using the formula in subsection (3); and
	(b)	the amount worked out using the table in subsection (5).
Formula for deduction for expenditure year
	(3)	The formula is:


Deduction for year of income after expenditure year
	(4)	The taxpayer may deduct for the year of income straight after the expenditure year the amount worked out using the table in subsection (5).
Table of deductions
	(5)	The table is:

Amounts included in deductions for expenditure year and next year of income
Item
Expenditure year
Amount included in deduction for the expenditure year
Amount of deduction for the year of income straight after the expenditure year
1
Year of income including 21 September 1999
80% of the later year amount
20% of the later year amount
2
Year of income including 21 September 2000
60% of the later year amount
40% of the later year amount
3
Year of income including 21 September 2001
40% of the later year amount
60% of the later year amount
4
Year of income including 21 September 2002
20% of the later year amount
80% of the later year amount
What is the later year amount?
	(6)	The taxpayer’s later year amount for expenditure is the difference between:
	(a)	the expenditure; and
	(b)	the amount worked out using the formula in subsection (3).
This subsection is subject to section 82KZMC.
Nil later year amount if this section did not apply in initial year
	(7)	To avoid doubt, the later year amount for expenditure incurred in the year of income including 21 September 1999 is nil if this section does not allow the taxpayer a deduction for the expenditure for that year of income.
Note 1:	This will be the case if the requirements of section 82KZMA are not met in relation to the expenditure in that year.
Note 2:	In this case, the later year amount for expenditure incurred in later years of income will also be nil under section 82KZMC, so subsection 82KZMC(4) will set the amount of deductions for years of income after the expenditure year for that expenditure.
82KZMC  Limiting the totals of later year amounts
Application
	(1)	This section applies if (apart from this section) the sum of the taxpayer’s later year amounts for all expenditures incurred in a year of income (the subsequent year) mentioned in item 2, 3 or 4 of the table in subsection 82KZMB(5) would be more than the sum of the later year amounts for all the taxpayer’s expenditures in the year of income (the initial year) mentioned in item 1 of that table.
Note:	For the purposes of this section, ignore any expenditure with an eligible service period ending more than 13 months after the expenditure was incurred. See subsection 82KZMB(1).
What is the later year amount?
	(2)	The taxpayer’s later year amount for expenditure incurred in the subsequent year is an amount (which may be a nil amount) that:
	(a)	the taxpayer chooses under subsection (3); and
	(b)	is not more than the amount worked out for the expenditure under subsection 82KZMB(6).
Choice of later year amounts
	(3)	The taxpayer must choose later year amounts for expenditures incurred in the subsequent year so that the total of those amounts equals the sum of the later year amounts for all the taxpayer’s expenditures in the initial year.
Note:	This means that the taxpayer must choose nil amounts for all expenditures incurred in the subsequent year if the later year amount for expenditure incurred in the initial year is nil.
Other deduction for years of income after expenditure year
	(4)	If the amount worked out under subsection 82KZMB(6) for the expenditure exceeds the later year amount for the expenditure chosen under this section, the taxpayer may deduct for the expenditure the amount worked out using the formula in subsection (5), for each year of income that:
	(a)	contains all or part of the eligible service period for the expenditure; and
	(b)	occurs after the expenditure year.
Formula for other deductions
	(5)	The formula is:


where:
excess is the difference between:
	(a)	the amount worked out under subsection 82KZMB(6) for the expenditure; and
	(b)	the later year amount for the expenditure chosen under this section.
Deduction is additional to deduction under section 82KZMB
	(6)	A deduction under this section for the expenditure is in addition to any deduction for the expenditure under section 82KZMB.
82KZMD  Expenditure with eligible service period ending more than 13 months later
	(1)	This section applies to expenditure whose eligible service period ends more than 13 months after the taxpayer incurs the expenditure.
Note:	Subsection 82KZL(1) explains what the eligible service period for expenditure is.
	(2)	For each year of income containing all or part of the eligible service period for the expenditure, the taxpayer may deduct the amount worked out using the formula:

Repeal the section, substitute:
100‑50  How to work out your net capital gain or loss
	1.	Reduce your capital gains for the income year, in the order you choose, by your capital losses for the income year. (If the capital losses for the income year exceed the capital gains, the difference is your net capital loss. You cannot deduct a net capital loss from your assessable income.)
	2.	Reduce any remaining capital gains, in the order you choose, by any unapplied net capital losses for previous income years.
	3.	Reduce any remaining discount capital gains by the discount percentage.
To find out what is a discount capital gain and the discount percentage: see Division 115.
	4.	Add up:
	(a)	any remaining capital gains that are not discount capital gains; and
	(b)	any remaining discount capital gains.
The total is your net capital gain.
	For the rules on working out your net capital gain or loss: see Division 102.
2  After section 102‑1
Insert:
102‑3  Concessions in working out your net capital gain
	(1)	Concessional rules apply to working out the net capital gain of some entities (see subsection (2)) if:
	(a)	they have a capital gain (a discount capital gain) from a CGT asset acquired at least 12 months before the CGT event that caused the capital gain; and
	(b)	they have not chosen to include indexation in the cost base of the asset for working out the capital gain (if relevant).
Note 1:	Division 115 explains what is a discount capital gain.
Note 2:	Under Division 110, the entity can choose to include indexation in the cost base of a CGT asset acquired at or before 11.45 am on 21 September 1999.
	(2)	Only these entities get the concession:
	(a)	individuals;
	(b)	complying superannuation entities;
	(c)	trusts.
	(3)	The concession is that the net capital gain includes only part of the amount of the discount capital gain left after applying capital losses and net capital losses from earlier income years.
See subsection 102‑5(1).
3  Subsection 102‑5(1)
Repeal the subsection, substitute:
	(1)	Your assessable income includes your net capital gain (if any) for the income year. You work out your net capital gain in this way:
Working out your net capital gain
Step 1.	Reduce the *capital gains you made during the income year by the *capital losses (if any) you made during the income year.
	Note 1:	You choose the order in which you reduce your capital gains. You have a net capital loss for the income year if your capital losses exceed your capital gains: see section 102‑10.
	Note 2:	Some provisions of this Act (such as Divisions 104 and 118) permit or require you to disregard certain capital gains or losses when working out your net capital gain.
Step 2.	Apply any previously unapplied *net capital losses from earlier income years to reduce the amounts (if any) remaining after the reduction of *capital gains under step 1 (including any *capital gains not reduced under that step because the *capital losses were less than the total of your capital gains).
	Note 1:	Section 102‑15 explains how to apply net capital losses.
	Note 2:	You choose the order in which you reduce the amounts.
Step 3.	Add up the amounts of *capital gains (if any) remaining after step 2, except amounts of *discount capital gains. The sum is the non‑discounted capital gain.
	Note 1:	Only some entities can have discount capital gains, and only if they have capital gains from CGT assets acquired at least a year before making the gains. See Division 115.
	Note 2:	If you do not have any amounts of discount capital gains remaining after step 2, your non‑discounted capital gain is your net capital gain (so you can go straight to step 6). This will be so if you had no discount capital gains or all you had were reduced to nil in step 1 or 2.
Step 4.	Reduce by the *discount percentage each amount of a *discount capital gain remaining after step 2 (if any).
Step 5.	Add up each amount of a *discount capital gain remaining after step 4. The sum is the discounted capital gain.
Step 6.	Add up the non‑discounted capital gain and the discounted capital gain. The sum is your net capital gain for the income year.
Note:	For exceptions and modifications to these rules: see section 102‑30.

the amount attributable to the exclusion of an amount of a *discount capital gain from the trust’s *net capital gain because of step 4 of the method statement in subsection 102‑5(1)
2	*Complying superannuation entity
1/3 of the amount attributable to the exclusion of an amount of a *discount capital gain from the trust’s *net capital gain because of step 4 of the method statement in subsection 102‑5(1)
3	Entity that has applied a *capital loss or *net capital loss to reduce its *capital gain described in subparagraph 115‑215(3)(a)(ii)
1/2 of the amount of the capital loss or net capital loss applied to reduce the capital gain
Note 1:	Step 4 of the method statement in subsection 102‑5(1) reduces by 50% the trust’s discount capital gains remaining after application of capital losses and earlier net capital losses. That 50% is excluded from the trust’s net capital gain.
Note 2:	Subparagraph 115‑215(3)(a)(ii) treats a beneficiary as having a capital gain equal to double the part (if any) of the amount of the trust’s net income that is included in the beneficiary’s assessable income and is attributable to the trust estate’s discounted capital gain mentioned in subsection 102‑5(1) (as it applies to the trust estate).

Add:
Including indexation in cost base
	(7)	The cost base of a *CGT asset *acquired at or before 11.45 am (by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory) on 21 September 1999 also includes indexation of the elements of the cost base (except the third element) if the requirements of Division 114 are met.
	(8)	However, for the purposes of working out the *capital gain of an entity mentioned in an item of the table from a *CGT event happening after 11.45 am (by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory) on 21 September 1999, the cost base includes indexation only if the entity mentioned in the item chooses that the cost base includes indexation:

Choice of indexation
Item
For the purposes of working out the capital gain of this entity:
The cost base includes indexation only if this entity chooses so:
1
An individual
The individual
2
A *complying superannuation entity
The trustee of the complying superannuation entity
3
A trust
The trustee of the trust
Note 1:	Section 103‑25 specifies when you must make the choice and provides that the way you prepare your income tax return is evidence of your choice.
Note 2:	For each CGT asset whose cost base you need to work out, you may either choose to index the expenditure included in the asset’s cost base or not make that choice. If you do not choose to index the expenditure, your net capital gain includes only part of your capital gain on the CGT asset as worked out on the basis of the cost base not including indexation and reduced by your capital losses.
12  At the end of section 114‑5
Add:
Indexation for some entities only if indexation chosen
	(2)	Indexation is not relevant to the *capital gain of an entity mentioned in an item of the table from a *CGT event happening after 11.45 am (by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory) on 21 September 1999, unless the relevant entity mentioned in that item has chosen that the *cost base include indexation for the purposes of section 110‑25:

A discount capital gain remaining after the application of any capital losses and net capital losses from previous income years is reduced by the discount percentage when working out your net capital gain.
A capital gain from a CGT asset is a discount capital gain only if the entity making the gain acquired the asset at least a year before the CGT event causing the gain and no choice has been made to include indexation in the cost base of the asset.
Special rules apply to the net income of trusts with net capital gains, to ensure that the appropriate discount percentage is applied and to let beneficiaries apply their capital losses against their share of the trust’s capital gains.

What is a discount capital gain?
115‑5  What is a discount capital gain?
		A discount capital gain is a *capital gain that meets the requirements of sections 115‑10, 115‑15, 115‑20 and 115‑25.
Note:	Sections 115‑40 and 115‑45 identify capital gains that are not discount capital gains, despite this section.
115‑10  Who can make a discount capital gain?
		To be a *discount capital gain, the *capital gain must be made by:
	(a)	an individual; or
	(b)	a *complying superannuation entity; or
	(c)	a trust.
115‑15  Discount capital gain must be made after 21 September 1999
		To be a *discount capital gain, the *capital gain must result from a *CGT event happening after 11.45 am (by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory) on 21 September 1999.
115‑20  Discount capital gain must not have indexed cost base
		To be a *discount capital gain, the *capital gain must have been worked out by reference to a *cost base whose elements have not been indexed.
Note:	The elements of the cost base will not be indexed unless you choose that they should be: see section 110‑25.
115‑25  Discount capital gain must be on asset acquired at least 12 months before
	(1)	To be a *discount capital gain, the *capital gain must result from a *CGT event happening to a *CGT asset that was *acquired by the entity making the capital gain at least 12 months before the CGT event.
Note:	Even if the capital gain results from a CGT event happening at least a year after the CGT asset was acquired, the gain may not be a discount capital gain, depending on the cause of the CGT event (see section 115‑40) and the nature of the asset (see sections 115‑45 and 115‑50).
	(2)	To avoid doubt, subsection (1) applies to the *CGT asset shown in the table for a *CGT event listed in the table.

CGT assets to which subsection (1) applies
Item
CGT event
CGT asset to which subsection (1) applies

E8
the interest or part interest in the trust capital

K6
the *share or interest *acquired before 20 September 1985
	(3)	A *capital gain from one of these *CGT events is not a discount capital gain (despite section 115‑5):
	(a)	*CGT event D1;
	(b)	*CGT event D2;
	(c)	*CGT event D3;
	(d)	*CGT event E9;
	(e)	*CGT event F1;
	(f)	*CGT event F2;
	(g)	*CGT event F5;
	(h)	*CGT event H2;
	(i)	*CGT event K1.
Note:	Capital gains from the CGT events mentioned in paragraphs (3)(a) to (f) are not discount capital gains because the CGT asset involved in the CGT event comes into existence at the time of the event, so it is impossible to meet the requirement in this section that the asset have been acquired at least 12 months before the event.
115‑30  Special rules about time of acquisition
You are treated as acquiring some CGT assets early
	(1)	Sections 115‑25 and 115‑40 apply as if you had *acquired a *CGT asset described in an item of the table at the time mentioned in that item:

Special application of sections 115‑25 and 115‑40
Item
Sections 115‑25 and 115‑40 apply as if you had acquired this CGT asset:
At this time:

A *CGT asset you *acquired in circumstances giving rise to a *same‑asset roll‑over
When the entity that owned the CGT asset before the roll‑over *acquired it or, if it has been involved in an unbroken series of roll‑overs, when the entity that owned it before the first roll‑over in the series *acquired it

A *CGT asset that you *acquired as a replacement asset for a *replacement‑asset roll‑over
When you acquired the original asset involved in the roll‑over or, if you acquired the replacement asset for a roll‑over that was the last in an unbroken series of replacement‑asset roll‑overs, when you acquired the asset that was the original asset involved in the first roll‑over in the series

A *CGT asset you *acquired as the *legal personal representative of a deceased individual, except one that was a *pre‑CGT asset of the deceased immediately before his or her death
When the deceased *acquired the asset

A *CGT asset that *passed to you as the beneficiary of a deceased individual’s estate, except one that was a *pre‑CGT asset of the deceased immediately before his or her death
When the deceased *acquired the asset

A *CGT asset that:
(a) you *acquired as the *legal personal representative of a deceased individual; and
(b) was a *pre‑CGT asset of the deceased immediately before his or her death
When the deceased died

A *CGT asset that:
(a) *passed to you as the beneficiary of a deceased individual’s estate; and
(b) was a *pre‑CGT asset of the deceased immediately before his or her death
When the deceased died

The interest (or share of an interest) you are taken under section 128‑50 to have *acquired in another *CGT asset that you and another individual held as joint tenants immediately before he or she died
When the deceased *acquired his or her interest in the other CGT asset
Note:	Under section 128‑50, you are taken to acquire the interest of a deceased individual in a CGT asset you and the deceased held as joint tenants immediately before his or her death (or an equal share of that interest if there are other surviving joint tenants).
CGT event E8
	(2)	For the purposes of applying sections 115‑25 and 115‑40 in relation to *CGT event E8 and the *CGT asset consisting of a beneficiary’s interest in trust capital, it does not matter how long the trustee owned any of the assets of the trust.
Note:	Section 115‑45 limits the effect of this subsection in some cases.
Relationship with Subdivision 109‑A and Division 128
	(3)	This section has effect despite Subdivision 109‑A and Division 128 (which contain rules about the time when you *acquire a *CGT asset).
[The next section is section 115‑40.]
What are not discount capital gains?
115‑40  Capital gain resulting from agreement made within a year of acquisition
		Your *capital gain on a *CGT asset from a *CGT event is not a discount capital gain (despite section 115‑5) if the CGT event occurred under an agreement you made within 12 months of *acquiring the CGT asset.
Note:	Section 115‑30 may affect the time when you are treated as having acquired the CGT asset.
115‑45  Capital gain from equity in an entity with newly acquired assets
		Your *capital gain from a *CGT event is not a discount capital gain (despite section 115‑5 and subsection 115‑30(3)) if:
	(a)	the CGT event happened to a *CGT asset that is:
	(i)	a *share in a company; or
	(ii)	an interest in a trust; and
	(b)	the total of the *cost bases of *CGT assets *acquired by the company or trust (as appropriate) less than 12 months before the time of the CGT event is more than half of the total of the *cost bases of the *CGT assets of the company or trust at that time.
115‑50  Discount capital gain from equity in certain entities
Capital gain from share in company with 300 members
	(1)	Section 115‑45 does not prevent a *capital gain from a *CGT event happening to a *share in a company with at least 300 *members from being a *discount capital gain, unless subsection (3) or (6) applies in relation to the company.
Capital gain from interest in fixed trust with 300 beneficiaries
	(2)	Section 115‑45 does not prevent a *capital gain from a *CGT event happening to an interest in a trust from being a *discount capital gain if:
	(a)	entities have fixed entitlements to all of the income and capital of the trust; and
	(b)	the trust has at least 300 beneficiaries; and
	(c)	neither subsection (4) nor subsection (6) applies in relation to the trust.
No discount capital gain if ownership is concentrated
	(3)	Section 115‑45 may prevent a *capital gain from a *share in a company from being a *discount capital gain if an individual owns, or up to 20 individuals own between them, directly or indirectly (through one or more interposed entities) and for their own benefit, *shares in the company:
	(a)	carrying fixed entitlements to:
	(i)	at least 75% of the company’s income; or
	(ii)	at least 75% of the company’s capital; or
	(b)	carrying at least 75% of the voting rights in the company.
	(4)	Section 115‑45 may prevent a *capital gain from an interest in a trust from being a *discount capital gain if an individual owns, or up to 20 individuals own between them, directly or indirectly (through one or more interposed entities) and for their own benefit, interests in the trust:
	(a)	carrying fixed entitlements to:
	(i)	at least 75% of the trust’s income; or
	(ii)	at least 75% of the trust’s capital; or
	(b)	if beneficiaries of the trust have a right to vote in respect of activities of the trust—carrying at least 75% of those voting rights.
	(5)	Subsections (3) and (4) operate as if all of these were a single individual:
	(a)	an individual, whether or not the individual holds *shares in the company or interests in the trust (as appropriate);
	(b)	the individual’s *associates;
	(c)	for any *shares or interests in respect of which other individuals are nominees of the individual or of the individual’s associates—those other individuals.
No discount capital gain if rights can be varied to concentrate ownership
	(6)	Section 115‑45 may prevent a *capital gain from a *share in a company, or from an interest in a trust, from being a *discount capital gain if, because of anything listed in subsection (7), it is reasonable to conclude that the rights attaching to any of the *shares in the company or interests in the trust (as appropriate) can be varied or abrogated in such a way that subsection (3) or (4) would be satisfied.
	(7)	These are the things:
	(a)	any provision in the constituent document of the company or trust, or in any contract, agreement or instrument:
	(i)	authorising the variation or abrogation of rights attaching to any of the *shares in the company or interests in the trust (as appropriate); or
	(ii)	relating to the conversion, cancellation, extinguishment or redemption of any of those shares or interests;
	(b)	any contract, *arrangement, option or instrument under which a person has power to acquire any of those shares or interests;
	(c)	any power, authority or discretion in a person in relation to the rights attaching to any of those shares or interests.
	(8)	It does not matter for the purposes of subsection (6) whether or not the rights attaching to any of the *shares or interests are varied or abrogated in the way described in that subsection.
Subdivision 115‑B—Discount percentage
Table of sections
115‑100	What is the discount percentage for a discount capital gain?

	(a)	50% if the gain is made by an individual or a trust; or
	(b)	331/3% if the gain is made by a *complying superannuation entity.
	(2)	The discount percentage for an amount of a *discount capital gain made by a *complying superannuation entity that is a trust is 331/3%.
Subdivision 115‑C—Rules about trusts with net capital gains
Guide to Subdivision 115‑C
115‑200  What this Division is about
This Subdivision sets out rules for dealing with the net income of a trust that has a net capital gain. The rules treat parts of the net income attributable to the trust’s net capital gain as capital gains made by the beneficiary entitled to those parts. This lets the beneficiary reduce those parts by any capital losses and unapplied net capital losses it has.
The part attributable to the trust’s discount capital gains is doubled and treated as a discount capital gain of the beneficiary (if appropriate). This lets the beneficiary apply the appropriate discount percentage (if any) after applying its capital losses.
The rules also give the beneficiary a deduction if necessary to prevent it from being taxed twice on the same parts of the trust’s net income.

115‑225	Special rule for assessing trustee under section 99A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936
[This is the end of the Guide. The next section is section 115‑210.]
Operative provisions
115‑210  When this Subdivision applies
	(1)	This Subdivision applies if a trust estate has a *net capital gain for an income year that is taken into account in working out the trust estate’s net income (as defined in section 95 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936) for the income year.
	(2)	If the trust estate has a beneficiary that is a *complying superannuation entity that is a trust, this Subdivision applies in relation to the complying superannuation entity as a beneficiary but not as a trust estate. This Subdivision does not apply otherwise to a *complying superannuation entity that is a trust.
115‑215  Assessing presently entitled beneficiaries
Purpose
	(1)	The purpose of this section is to ensure that appropriate amounts of the trust estate’s net income attributable to the trust estate’s *capital gains are treated as a beneficiary’s *capital gains when assessing the beneficiary, so:
	(a)	the *discount percentage (if any) appropriate to the beneficiary can be applied; and
	(b)	the beneficiary can apply *capital losses against those amounts.
Application
	(2)	This section treats you as having certain extra capital gains, and gives you a deduction, if:
	(a)	you are the beneficiary of the trust estate; and
	(b)	your assessable income for the income year includes an amount (the trust amount):
	(i)	under paragraph 97(1)(a) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936; or
	(ii)	under subsection 98A(1) of that Act because you are a beneficiary described in subsection 98(4) of that Act; or
	(iii)	under subsection 100(1) of that Act.
Extra capital gains
	(3)	Division 102 applies to you as if:
	(a)	you had (in addition to any other *capital gains you have for the income year):
	(i)	a *capital gain equal to the part (if any) of the trust amount that is attributable to the trust estate’s non‑discounted capital gain mentioned in subsection 102‑5(1) (as it applies to the trust estate); and
	(ii)	another *capital gain equal to twice the part (if any) of the trust amount that is attributable to the trust estate’s discounted capital gain mentioned in subsection 102‑5(1) (as it applies to the trust estate); and
	(b)	the capital gain mentioned in subparagraph (a)(ii) were a *discount capital gain, if you can have a *discount capital gain.
Note:	This ensures that your share of the trust estate’s net capital gain is taxed as if it were a capital gain you made (assuming you made the same choices about cost bases including indexation as the trustee).
Section 118‑20 does not reduce extra capital gains
	(4)	To avoid doubt, section 118‑20 does not reduce a *capital gain that subsection (3) treats you as having for the purpose of applying Division 102.
Deduction
	(5)	You can deduct for the income year the sum of:
	(a)	the part (if any) of the trust amount that is attributable to the trust estate’s non‑discounted capital gain mentioned in subsection 102‑5(1); and
	(b)	the part (if any) of the trust amount that is attributable to the trust estate’s discounted capital gain mentioned in subsection 102‑5(1).
Note:	This deduction ensures you are not taxed twice on the part of the trust amount that is attributable to the trust estate’s net capital gain.
115‑220  Special rule for assessing trustee under subsection 98(3) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936
Purpose
	(1)	The purpose of this section is to ensure a trustee assessed under subsection 98(3) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (in respect of the share of the net income to which a beneficiary that is a company is entitled) does not get the benefit in that assessment of the *discount percentage that the company would not have got if it had been assessed in respect of the share.
Modification of subsection 98(3)
	(2)	The trustee is to be assessed (and pay tax) under subsection 98(3) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 as if the part of the share that is attributable to the trust estate’s discounted capital gain mentioned in subsection 102‑5(1) were double the amount that it actually is.
115‑225  Special rule for assessing trustee under section 99A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936
Purpose
	(1)	The purpose of this section is to reverse the benefit of applying the *discount percentage in working out the trust estate’s net income when the trustee is assessed under section 99A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 on an amount of the net income.
Modification of section 99A
	(2)	The trustee is to be assessed (and pay tax) under section 99A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 as if the part of the amount that is attributable to the trust estate’s discounted capital gain mentioned in subsection 102‑5(1) were double the amount that it actually is.

(2)	The amendments of sections 110‑25 and 114‑5 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 made by this Part apply to the calculation of a cost base of a CGT asset for a CGT event happening after 11.45 am (by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory) on 21 September 1999.
