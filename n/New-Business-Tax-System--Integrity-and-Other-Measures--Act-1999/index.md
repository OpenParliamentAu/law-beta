165-115E  What is an unrealised net loss

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

		The question whether a company has an _unrealised net loss_ at a

particular time (the _relevant time_) is worked out in this way.

 </dl></dl>

_Method statement_

_Step 1_.	Work out under section 165-115F in respect of each <sup>*</sup>CGT asset that the company owned at the relevant time any notional capital gain or notional revenue gain or any notional capital loss or notional revenue loss that the company has at that time in respect of the asset.
 	The sum of the notional capital gains is the company's _unrealised capital gain_ at the relevant time.
 	The sum of the notional capital losses is the company's _unrealised capital loss_ at the relevant time.
 	The sum of the notional revenue gains is the company's _unrealised revenue gain_ at the relevant time.
 	The sum of the notional revenue losses is the company's _unrealised revenue loss_ at the relevant time.
 _Step 2_.	Add up the unrealised capital gain and the unrealised revenue gain at the relevant time. The total is the _unrealised gross gain_ at that time.
 _Step 3_.	Add up the unrealised capital loss and the unrealised revenue loss at the relevant time. The total is the _unrealised gross loss_ at that time.
 _Step 4_.	If the unrealised gross loss at the relevant time exceeds the unrealised gross gain at that time, the excess is the company's _unrealised net loss_ at that time.

<center>Back to Top</center>

_Working out your net capital gain_

_Step 1._	Reduce the <sup>*</sup>capital gains you made during the income year by the <sup>*</sup>capital losses (if any) you made during the income year.

	Note 1:	You choose the order in which you reduce your capital gains. You have a net capital loss for the income year if your capital losses exceed your capital gains: see section 102-10.
 	Note 2:	Some provisions of this Act (such as Divisions 104 and 118) permit or require you to disregard certain capital gains or losses when working out your net capital gain.

_Step 2._	Apply any previously unapplied <sup>*</sup>net capital losses from earlier income years to reduce the amounts (if any) remaining after the reduction of <sup>*</sup>capital gains under step 1 (including any <sup>*</sup>capital gains not reduced under that step because the <sup>*</sup>capital losses were less than the total of your capital gains).

	Note 1:	Section 102-15 explains how to apply net capital losses.
 	Note 2:	You choose the order in which you reduce the amounts.

_Step 3._	Add up the amounts of <sup>*</sup>capital gains (if any) remaining after step 2, except amounts of <sup>*</sup>discount capital gains. The sum is the _non-discounted capital gain_.

	Note 1:	Only some entities can have discount capital gains, and only if they have capital gains from CGT assets acquired at least a year before making the gains. See Division 115.
 	Note 2:	If you do not have any amounts of discount capital gains remaining after step 2, your non-discounted capital gain is your net capital gain (so you can go straight to step 6). This will be so if you had no discount capital gains or all you had were reduced to nil in step 1 or 2.

_Step 4._	Reduce by the <sup>*</sup>discount percentage each amount of a <sup>*</sup>discount capital gain remaining after step 2 (if any).
 _Step 5._	Add up each amount of a <sup>*</sup>discount capital gain remaining after step 4\. The sum is the _discounted capital gain_.
 _Step 6._	Add up the non-discounted capital gain and the discounted capital gain. The sum is your _net capital gain_ for the income year.

 115-1  What this Division is about

A discount capital gain remaining after the application of any capital losses and net capital losses from previous income years is reduced by the discount percentage when working out your net capital gain.
 A capital gain from a CGT asset is a discount capital gain only if the entity making the gain acquired the asset at least a year before the CGT event causing the gain and no choice has been made to include indexation in the cost base of the asset.
 Special rules apply to the net income of trusts with net capital gains, to ensure that the appropriate discount percentage is applied and to let beneficiaries apply their capital losses against their share of the trust's capital gains.

Subdivision 115-C&#151;Rules about trusts with net capital gains
 Guide to Subdivision 115-C
 115-200  What this Division is about

This Subdivision sets out rules for dealing with the net income of a trust that has a net capital gain. The rules treat parts of the net income attributable to the trust's net capital gain as capital gains made by the beneficiary entitled to those parts. This lets the beneficiary reduce those parts by any capital losses and unapplied net capital losses it has.
 The part attributable to the trust's discount capital gains is doubled and treated as a discount capital gain of the beneficiary (if appropriate). This lets the beneficiary apply the appropriate discount percentage (if any) after applying its capital losses.
 The rules also give the beneficiary a deduction if necessary to prevent it from being taxed twice on the same parts of the trust's net income.

Operative provisions
 115-210  When this Subdivision applies

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>This Subdivision applies if a trust estate has a <sup>*</sup>net capital

gain for an income year that is taken into account in working out the trust

115-215  Assessing presently entitled beneficiaries

_Purpose_

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>The purpose of this section is to ensure that appropriate amounts of the

trust estate's net income attributable to the trust estate's

<sup>*</sup>capital gains are treated as a beneficiary's <sup>*</sup>capital

gains when assessing the beneficiary, so:

</dd> </dl></dl>

<center>Back to Top</center>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>the <sup>*</sup>discount percentage (if any) appropriate to the

beneficiary can be applied; and</dd>

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

_Application_

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(2)</dt><dd>This section treats you as having certain extra capital gains, and gives

you a deduction, if:

</dd> </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>you are the beneficiary of the trust estate; and</dd>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(i)</dt><dd>under paragraph 97(1)(a) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_;

described in subsection 98(4) of that Act; or</dd>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(ii)</dt><dd>another <sup>*</sup>capital gain equal to twice the part (if any) of the

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note:	This ensures that your share of the trust estate's net

capital gain is taxed as if it were a capital gain you made (assuming you made

the same choices about cost bases including indexation as the trustee).

 </dl></dl>

_Section 118-20 does not reduce extra capital gains_

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(4)</dt><dd>To avoid doubt, section 118-20 does not reduce a <sup>*</sup>capital gain

_Deduction_

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(5)</dt><dd>You can deduct for the income year the sum of:
