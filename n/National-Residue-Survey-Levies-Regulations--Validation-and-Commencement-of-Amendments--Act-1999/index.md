An Act to provide for the validation and commencement of certain regulations changing the rate of National Residue Survey Levy imposed on certain sheep and lamb transactions, and for related matters

[_Assented to 10 December 1999_]

The Parliament of Australia enacts:

##### <a id="1"></a>1  Short title

                   This Act may be cited as the _National Residue Survey Levies Regulations (Validation and Commencement of Amendments) Act 1999_.

##### <a id="2"></a>2  Commencement

                   This Act commences on the day on which it receives the Royal Assent.

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Validation and commencement of regulations

             (1)  The Primary Industries Levies and Charges (National Residue Survey Levies) Regulations 1998 (Amendment)(Statutory Rules No. 182 of 1998) are taken to be valid and, despite regulation 1 of those regulations, are taken to have commenced on 1 August 1998.

Note:          Subsection 48(2) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_(which limits the circumstances in which regulations may take effect retrospectively) does not affect the operation of this section.

             (2)  Other regulations made  before or after the commencement of this Act that amend the _Primary Industries Levies and Charges (National Residue Survey Levies) Regulations 1998_ have the same effect as they would have had if the regulations to which subsection (1) applies had actually commenced on 1 August 1998.
