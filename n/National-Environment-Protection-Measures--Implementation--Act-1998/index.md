##### <a id="3"></a>3  Objects of Act

                   The objects of this Act are:

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Simplified outline of Act

                   The following is a simplified outline of the operation of this Act:

* * *

State and Territory laws implementing national environment protection measures (**_NEPMs_**) do not apply to the activities of the Commonwealth or Commonwealth authorities, either of their own force or because of the _Commonwealth Places (Application of Laws) Act 1970_(see section 9).

Under this Act, the Environment Minister may (subject to considerations of national interest or administrative efficiency):

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•     apply

those State laws to the activities of the Commonwealth or Commonwealth

authorities in Commonwealth places (Part 2); or</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•     apply

those State or Territory laws to the activities of the Commonwealth or

Commonwealth authorities in other places (Part 3).</li>

If NEPMs are not implemented in relation to the activities of the Commonwealth or Commonwealth authorities under Part 2 or Part 3, they can be implemented: 

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•     by

regulations (Part 4); or</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•     if

there are no regulations under Part 4, through environmental audits and

environment management plans (Part 5).</li>

The implementation of NEPMs in relation to the activities of the Commonwealth or Commonwealth authorities may be restricted by the Environment Minister in the national interest.

                     (b)  that the application of that alternative Commonwealth regime is more appropriate than taking any action under this Part:

                              (i)  because the activity involves a specified matter of national interest; or
