An Act to implement the New Business Tax System by amending the law relating to taxation, and for related purposes

[_Assented to__10 December 1999_]

The Parliament of Australia enacts:

##### <a id="1"></a>1  Short title

                   This Act may be cited as the _New Business Tax System (Capital Allowances) Act 1999_.

##### <a id="2"></a>2  Commencement

             (1)  Subject to this section, this Act commences on the day on which it receives the Royal Assent.

             (2)  Items 17 and 18 of Schedule 2 commence on the day on which the _Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No. 5) 1999_ receives the Royal Assent.

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Schedule(s)

                   Subject to section 2, each Act that is specified in a Schedule to this Act is amended or repealed as set out in the applicable items in the Schedule concerned, and any other item in a Schedule to this Act has effect according to its terms.

###### Schedule 1—Full balancing adjustments on disposal of plant

Income Tax Assessment Act 1997

## 1  Subsection 40-25(5) (note)

Omit “Note”, substitute “Note 1”.

## 2  At the end of subsection 40-25(5)

Add:

Note 2:       In the case of plant that has been depreciated:

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">          </span>a further amount is included in your assessable income if the termination value exceeds the written down value by more than the sum of your depreciation deductions; or

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">          </span>you can deduct a further amount in some cases where the termination value is less than the plant’s undeducted cost. 

                   A capital gain or loss from the plant is disregarded. 

## 3  Section 42-1

After “unit of plant.”, insert “It also provides for balancing adjustments on disposal of plant, even if you have not deducted an amount for depreciation.”.

## 4  Section 42-5

Repeal the section, substitute:

##### <a id="42-5"></a>42-5  Key concepts used in this Division

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004C01075/Html/image002.gif)

## 5  Subsection 42-30(1) (note 2)

Omit “an amount” (wherever occurring), substitute “one or more amounts”.

## 6  Subsection 42-30(2)

After “Balancing adjustments”, insert “made because of subsection (1)”.

## 7  After subsection 42-30(2)

Insert:

          (2A)  You must also make a balancing adjustment calculation for <sup>* </sup>plant if a <sup>* </sup>balancing adjustment event occurs, but subsection (1) does not apply.

Note 1:       However, no balancing adjustment calculation is required if Common rule 1 applies to the balancing adjustment event or if any of the exceptions in section 42-198 applies.

Note 2:       A balancing adjustment calculation may include an amount in your assessable income or allow you to deduct an amount. If you are required to include an amount in your assessable income, balancing adjustment relief may be available: see sections 42-285, 42-290, 42-293 and 42-295.

          (2B)  Balancing adjustments made because of subsection (2A) are calculated under Subdivision 42-GA.

          (2C)  Subsection (2A) and Subdivision 42-GA apply to a unit of <sup>* </sup>plant that has not yet been fully completed or constructed, in the same way as they apply to a unit of plant that has, and the other provisions of this Act have effect accordingly.

## 8  Section 42-180

Omit “an amount” (twice occurring), substitute “one or more amounts”.

## 9  Section 42-182

Repeal the section, substitute:

## 10  After section 42-190

Insert:

##### <a id="42-192"></a>42-192  Including a further amount in your assessable income

             (1)  If the <sup>* </sup>plant’s <sup>* </sup>termination value exceeds the total of:

                     (a)  the plant’s <sup>* </sup>written down value; and

                     (b)  the amount that section 42-190 includes in your assessable income;

 your assessable income also includes that excess.

For exceptions, see section 42-198.

For balancing adjustment relief, see sections 42-285, 42-290, 42-293 and 42-295.

             (2)  However, the amount that subsection (1) includes in your assessable income is reduced if:

                     (a)  you acquired the <sup>* </sup>plant at or before 11.45 am, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 21 September 1999; and

                     (b)  the plant’s <sup>* </sup>cost base at the time of the <sup>* </sup>balancing adjustment event exceeds the total referred to in subsection (1).

The amount is reduced (but not below nil) by the excess of that cost base over that total.

Note:          The main reasons why the cost base would exceed that total are: 

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">          </span>indexation of elements of the cost base (up to 30 September 1999);

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">          </span>amounts being included in the cost base that are not part of the cost.

## 11  After section 42-195

Insert:

##### <a id="42-197"></a>42-197  Deducting a further amount

                   If:

                     (a)  you can deduct an amount under section 42-195; and

                     (b)  the plant’s <sup>* </sup>undeducted cost is less than its <sup>* </sup>reduced cost base; 

you can also deduct the difference between the undeducted cost and the reduced cost base.

For exceptions, see section 42-198.

##### <a id="42-198"></a>42-198  Exceptions to rules about including further amount in assessable income, or deducting further amount

CGT exemptions

             (1)  Section 42-192, 42-197, 42-223 or 42-224 or subsection 42-390(2A) does not apply if a <sup>* </sup>capital gain or <sup>* </sup>capital loss from the <sup>* </sup>plant would be disregarded, because of a provision listed in the table in this subsection, if:

                     (a)  you had made the gain or loss from <sup>* </sup>CGT event A1; and

                     (b)  that CGT event had happened at the time of the <sup>* </sup>balancing adjustment event.

             (2)  Section 42-192, 42-197, 42-223 or 42-224 or subsection 42-390(2A) does not apply if the <sup>* </sup>plant was a <sup>* </sup>pre-CGT asset at the time of the <sup>* </sup>balancing adjustment event.

Profit assessable under another provision

             (3)  Section 42-192 or 42-223 or subsection 42-390(2A) does not apply if a provision of this Act (outside this Division) includes in your assessable income an amount in respect of a profit you make because of the <sup>* </sup>balancing adjustment event.

Operative provisions

42-222      When do you make a balancing adjustment calculation?

42-223      Including an amount in your assessable income

42-224      Deducting an amount

#### Operative provisions

##### <a id="42-222"></a>42-222  When do you make a balancing adjustment calculation?

                   You must make a balancing adjustment calculation for the income year in which a <sup>* </sup>balancing adjustment event occurs.

##### <a id="42-223"></a>42-223  Including an amount in your assessable income

             (1)  If the <sup>* </sup>plant’s <sup>* </sup>termination value exceeds its <sup>* </sup>cost, your assessable income includes that excess.

For exceptions, see section 42-198.

For balancing adjustment relief, see sections 42-285, 42-290, 42-293 and 42-295.

             (2)  However, the amount that subsection (1) includes in your assessable income is reduced if:

                     (a)  you acquired the <sup>* </sup>plant, or began to construct it, at or before 11.45 am, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 21 September 1999; and

                     (b)  the plant’s <sup>* </sup>cost base at the time of the <sup>* </sup>balancing adjustment event exceeds the plant’s <sup>* </sup>cost.

The amount is reduced (but not below nil) by the excess of that cost base over that cost.

Note:          The main reasons why the cost base would exceed cost are: 

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">          </span>indexation of elements of the cost base (up to 30 September 1999);

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">          </span>amounts being included in the cost base that are not part of the cost.

##### <a id="42-224"></a>42-224  Deducting an amount

                   If the <sup>* </sup>plant’s <sup>* </sup>termination value is less than its <sup>* </sup>reduced cost base, you can deduct the difference.

For exceptions, see section 42-198.

## 13  After subsection 42-390(2)

Insert:

          (2A)  If the <sup>* </sup>termination value exceeds the <sup>* </sup>cost, your assessable income also includes that excess.

For exceptions, see section 42-198.

For balancing adjustment relief, see sections 42-285, 42-290 and 42-293.

          (2B)  However, the amount that subsection (2A) includes in your assessable income is reduced if:

                     (a)  you acquired the <sup>* </sup>plant at or before 11.45 am, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 21 September 1999; and

                     (b)  the plant’s <sup>* </sup>cost base at the time of the <sup>* </sup>balancing adjustment event exceeds its <sup>* </sup>cost.

The amount is reduced (but not below nil) by the excess of that cost base over that cost.

Note:          The main reasons why the cost base would exceed the cost are: 

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">          </span>indexation of elements of the cost base (up to 30 September 1999);

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">          </span>amounts being included in the cost base that are not part of the cost.

## 14  After section 118-22

Insert:

##### <a id="118-24"></a>118-24  Plant

                   A <sup>* </sup>capital gain or <sup>* </sup>capital loss you make from a <sup>* </sup>CGT asset is disregarded if, at the time of the <sup>* </sup>CGT event, the asset is:

                     (a)  your <sup>* </sup>plant; or

                     (b)  if you are a partner, plant of the partnership; or

                     (c)  if you are absolutely entitled to the asset as against the trustee of a trust (disregarding any legal disability), plant of the trustee.

## 15  Application of amendments

(2)        The amendment made by item 14 applies to a CGT event happening after 11.45 am, by legal time in the Australian Capital   Territory, on 21 September 1999.

(3)        The amendment made by item 14 also applies to a CGT event happening at or before 11.45 am, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 21 September 1999, if:

                     (a)  the event is CGT event A1 (disposal of a CGT asset); and

                     (b)  the time of the event is when you entered into the contract for the disposal of the CGT asset; and

                     (c)  the change of ownership constituting the disposal occurred after 11.45 am, by legal time in the Australian Capital   Territory, on 21 September 1999.

             (6)  However, you can make a choice under this section for any <sup>* </sup>balancing adjustment event if you are a <sup>* </sup>small business taxpayer for the income year in which the event occurred.

## 8  Paragraph 42-290(2)(d)

After “42-285”, insert “or 42-293”.

## 9  At the end of section 42-290

Add:

             (4)  Unless subsection (5) applies to you, you can only make a choice under this section for a <sup>* </sup>balancing adjustment event that occurred at or before 11.45 am, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 21 September 1999.

             (5)  However, you can make a choice under this section for any <sup>* </sup>balancing adjustment event if you are a <sup>* </sup>small business taxpayer for the income year in which the event occurred.

## 10  After section 42-290

Insert:

##### <a id="42-293"></a>42-293  Involuntary disposals

             (1)  You may exclude an amount that has been included in your assessable income for <sup>* </sup>plant (the **_original plant_**) as a result of a balancing adjustment calculation for a <sup>* </sup>balancing adjustment event that occurs after 11.45 am, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 21 September 1999, to the extent that you choose to treat that amount as an amount you have deducted for depreciation of an item or items of replacement plant.

             (2)  You can only make this choice if the balancing adjustment event is one of these:

                     (a)  the original plant is compulsorily acquired by an <sup>* </sup>Australian government agency;

                     (b)  the original plant is lost or destroyed;

                     (c)  you dispose of the original plant to an Australian government agency after a notice was served on you by or on behalf of the agency:

                              (i)  inviting you to negotiate with the agency with a view to the agency acquiring it by agreement; and

                             (ii)  informing you that, if the negotiations are unsuccessful, it will be compulsorily acquired by the agency.

             (3)  You can only make this choice for replacement <sup>* </sup>plant if you incur the expenditure on the replacement plant, or you acquire it:

                     (a)  no earlier than one year, or within a further period the Commissioner allows, before the <sup>* </sup>balancing adjustment event occurred; and

`                    (b)  no later than one year, or within a further period the Commissioner allows, after the end of the income year in which the balancing adjustment event occurred.

             (4)  You can only make this choice for replacement <sup>* </sup>plant if:

                     (a)  at the end of the income year in which you acquired it, you used it, or had it <sup>* </sup>installed ready for use, wholly for the <sup>* </sup>purpose of producing assessable income; and

                     (b)  you can deduct an amount for depreciation of it; and

                     (c)  you have not made a choice under section 42-285 or 42-290 for the <sup>* </sup>balancing adjustment event.

             (5)  The amount covered by the choice is taken to be an amount you have deducted for depreciation of the replacement <sup>* </sup>plant as at the first day of the income year in which you acquired it.

             (6)  If you are making the choice for 2 or more items of replacement <sup>* </sup>plant, you apportion the amount covered by the choice between those items in proportion to their <sup>* </sup>cost.

Note:          Therefore, the amount must be taken into account for the plant under paragraph (a) of the definition of **_undeducted cost_** in section 42-175\. Also, because the amount is taken to have been deducted as at the first day of the income year, it will reduce the opening undeducted cost of the plant if you are using the diminishing value method.

## 11  Paragraph 42-295(3)(e)

Omit “or 42-290 (later year relief)”, substitute “, 42-290 (later year relief) or 42-293 (involuntary disposals)”.

                     (b)  if you did not carry on a <sup>* </sup>business in each of the current year and the 2 years before the current year, the number of those income years in which you carried on a business.

Note:          You are treated as carrying on a business if you are winding up a business and you were previously a small business taxpayer: see section 960-355.

                    <a name="sum-relev-group-turnov"></a>**_sum of relevant group turnovers_** is the sum of:

                     (a)  your <sup>* </sup>group turnover for the current year; and

                     (b)  your group turnover (if any) for the 2 preceding income years.

##### <a id="960-345"></a>960-345  Meaning of _group turnover_

             (1)  The **_group turnover_** of an entity (the **_primary entity_**) for an income year is the sum of:

                     (a)  the <sup>* </sup>value of the business supplies the primary entity made in the income year; and

                     (b)  the value of the business supplies entities <sup>* </sup>connected with the primary entity made in the income year;

reduced by:

                     (c)  that part of the value of the business supplies the primary entity made in the income year that is attributable to <sup>* </sup>supplies it made during the year to entities connected with it when they were connected with it; and

                     (d)  that part of the value of the business supplies entities connected with the primary entity made in the income year that is attributable to supplies the connected entities made during the year to the primary entity when they were connected with it; and

                     (e)  that part of the value of the business supplies another entity made in the income year that is attributable to supplies the other entity made to a third entity at a time when both the other entity and third entity were connected with the primary entity.

             (2)  The **_value of the business supplies_** an entity makes in an income year is the sum of:

                     (a)  for <sup>* </sup>taxable supplies (if any) the entity made during the year in the ordinary course of carrying on a <sup>* </sup>business—the value (as defined by section 9-75 of the <sup>* </sup>GST Act) of the <sup>* </sup>supplies; and

                     (b)  for other supplies the entity made during the year in the ordinary course of carrying on a business—the prices (as defined by section 9-75 of the GST Act) of the supplies.

##### <a id="960-350"></a>960-350  Recalculating average turnover for opening years

             (1)  You may choose to recalculate your <sup>* </sup>average turnover for an income year before the 2001-02 income year (the **_calculation year_**) under this section if you would not be a <sup>* </sup>small business taxpayer for that year because your average turnover for that year is not less than $1,000,000.

             (2)  You make the recalculation in this way:

* * *

_Method statement_

_Step 1._   Ignore your <sup>* </sup>group turnover (if any) for each of the 2 income years preceding the calculation year.

_Step 2._   Make a reasonable estimate of your <sup>* </sup>group turnover for each of the 2 income years following the calculation year (ignoring either or both of those years if you do not expect to be carrying on a <sup>* </sup>business at any time in that year).

_Step 3._   Work out the average of your <sup>* </sup>group turnover for the calculation year and the estimates you made for the 2 following years (if any).

_Step 4._   If the amount from step 3 is less than $1,000,000, you are a **_small business taxpayer_** for the calculation year.

* * *

##### <a id="960-355"></a>960-355  Winding up a business

                   This Subdivision applies to you as if you carried on a <sup>* </sup>business in an income year if:

                     (a)  in that year you were winding up a business you previously carried on; and

                     (b)  you were a <sup>* </sup>small business taxpayer for the income year in which you stopped carrying on that business.

             (2)  A **_plant lease_** of <sup>* </sup>plant is an agreement (including a renewal of an agreement) under which the owner or <sup>* </sup>quasi-owner of the plant grants a right to use the plant to another entity. However, a **_plant lease_** does not include a <sup>* </sup>hire purchase agreement or a <sup>* </sup>short-term hire agreement.

             (3)  A **_short-term hire agreement_** is an agreement for the intermittent hire of an asset on an hourly, daily, weekly or monthly basis.

             (4)  However, an agreement for the hire of an asset is not a **_short-term hire agreement_** if, having regard to any other agreements for the hire of the same asset to the same entity or an <sup>* </sup>associate of that entity, there is a substantial continuity of hiring so that the agreements together are for longer than a short-term basis.

             (5)  For the purposes of item 2 in the table in subsection (1), an entity is treated as if it is not carrying on a <sup>* </sup>business in relation to the activities of a partnership in which the entity is a partner unless the entity is <sup>* </sup>connected with the partnership.

### Division 44—IRUs and submarine cable systems

#### Guide to Division 44

This Division allows you to deduct expenditure you incur on acquiring an indefeasible right to use an international telecommunications submarine cable system (an IRU) as if it were plant.

It modifies some of the depreciation provisions for IRUs.

It also provides special rules for part disposals of IRUs and submarine cable systems.

#### Operative provisions

##### <a id="44-5"></a>44-5  Depreciating IRUs

             (1)  The provisions of this Part and Parts 3-1 and 3-3 apply to <sup>* </sup>IRUs as if they were units of <sup>* </sup>plant that you own, but with the modifications set out in this Division.

Note:          If an amount of expenditure on IRUs is recouped, the amount may be included in your assessable income: see Subdivision 20-A.

             (2)  An **_IRU_** is an indefeasible right to use an international telecommunications submarine cable system.

             (3)  To avoid doubt, the treatment of <sup>* </sup>IRUs as if they were units of <sup>* </sup>plant is not intended to affect the nature of expenditure on IRUs for the purposes of provisions of this Act outside this Part and Parts 3-1 and 3-3.

##### <a id="44-10"></a>44-10  When you start deducting for an IRU

                   You can start to deduct an amount for depreciation of an <sup>* </sup>IRU for the income year in which you first use it for the <sup>* </sup>purpose of producing assessable income.

##### <a id="44-15"></a>44-15  Rate

             (1)  The rate you use depends on whether you use the <sup>* </sup>diminishing value method or the <sup>* </sup>prime cost method.

Rate using the diminishing value method

             (2)  Your rate using the <sup>* </sup>diminishing value method is:

<sub>![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004C01075/Html/image007.gif)</sub>

where:

                    <a name="cabl-effect-life"></a>**_cable’s effective life_** is the period, in years, that you work out, under Division 42, to be the <sup>* </sup>effective life of the international telecommunications submarine cable over which the IRU has been granted.

Rate using the prime cost method

             (3)  Your rate using the <sup>* </sup>prime cost method is:

<sub>![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004C01075/Html/image008.gif)</sub>

##### <a id="44-20"></a>44-20  Part disposals

             (1)  This section and section 44-25 apply to you if you own an <sup>* </sup>IRU (the **_original plant_**) and you dispose of part of it.

             (2)  This Part applies to you as if, just before the disposal happened, you had split the original plant into 2 items of <sup>* </sup>plant:

                     (a)  the part you stopped owning; and

                     (b)  the part you continue to own (your **_new plant_**).

             (3)  You are taken to have disposed of an asset (the part you stopped owning) and to have acquired your new plant at the time of the disposal.

             (4)  The <sup>* </sup>written down value of the part you stopped owning is that part of the written down value of the original plant just before it was split as is reasonably attributable to the part you stopped owning. The <sup>* </sup>cost, and the first element of the <sup>* </sup>cost base, of that part are worked out similarly.

Note:          You must make a balancing adjustment calculation under Subdivision 42-F for the asset representing the part you stopped owning.

             (5)  Subdivision 42-J does not apply to the disposal mentioned in paragraph (1)(a).

##### <a id="44-25"></a>44-25  Calculating later depreciation deductions

             (1)  You must work out the <sup>* </sup>undeducted cost of the original plant just before it was split and apportion that amount on a reasonable basis between each of the assets into which it was split.

             (2)  You can deduct amounts for depreciation of your new plant for the remainder of the income year in which the event happened and for later years. The part of the <sup>* </sup>undeducted cost you apportioned to your new plant under subsection (1) is its <sup>* </sup>cost.

             (3)  If you were using the <sup>* </sup>diminishing value method, you must continue to do so. If you were using the <sup>* </sup>prime cost method, you must continue to do so.

             (4)  You must also adjust the rate if you are using the <sup>* </sup>prime cost rate.

             (5)  You work out the rate adjustment in this way:

<sub>![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004C01075/Html/image009.gif)</sub>

where:

                    <a name="remain-effect-life"></a>**_remaining effective life_** is the cable’s remaining <sup>* </sup>effective life, in years (including the income year in which the disposal occurred).

##### <a id="44-30"></a>44-30  Application of part disposal rules to cables

             (1)  Sections 44-20 and 44-25 apply also to the granting of an <sup>* </sup>IRU over an international telecommunications submarine cable system in the same way that they apply to the part disposal of an IRU.

             (2)  For the cable system:

                     (a)  the granting of the <sup>* </sup>IRU is a part disposal of the system; and

                     (b)  the cable system before you granted the IRU is the original plant; and

                     (c)  the residue of the cable system after you granted the IRU is the new plant; and

                     (d)  the part you stop owning is the part of the cable system applicable to the IRU you granted.

##### <a id="44-35"></a>44-35  Acquiring additional capacity

             (1)  If, after you start to use an <sup>* </sup>IRU for the <sup>* </sup>purpose of producing assessable income, you pay an amount that increases the capacity of the IRU, you add that amount to the IRU’s <sup>* </sup>cost and to its opening undeducted cost for the income year in which you paid the amount.

             (2)  You must also adjust the rate if you are using the <sup>* </sup>prime cost rate. Use subsection 44-25(5) to make the adjustment.

##### <a id="44-40"></a>44-40  Application of Division 41 Common rules

             (1)  Common rules 1 (roll-over relief for related entities) and 2 (non-arm’s length transactions) apply to this Division.

             (2)  However, the transferor and transferee cannot jointly elect for roll-over relief under subsection 42-335(3).

## 12  Application of amendments

(1)        The amendments made by this Schedule relating to IRUs apply to  expenditure on IRUs incurred after 11.45 am, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 21 September 1999.

(2)        The amendments made by this Schedule relating to part disposals of a cable system apply to the granting of IRUs over the system under contracts entered into after 11.45 am, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 21 September 1999.

(3)        Those amendments do not apply to an international telecommunications submarine cable system, or an IRU over the system, if the system had been used for telecommunications purposes at or before 11.45 am, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 21 September 1999.

###### Schedule 5—Working out new effective life

Income Tax Assessment Act 1997

## 1  Paragraph 42-105(2)(a)

Repeal the paragraph.

## 2  Subsection 42-105(3)

Omit “This conclusion is also to be made on the assumption that the plant is new.”.

## 3  After section 42-110

Insert:

##### <a id="42-112"></a>42-112  Working out new effective life

             (1)  You can choose to work out a new <sup>* </sup>effective life of <sup>* </sup>plant if, after the end of the first income year for which you can deduct an amount for depreciation of the plant, you conclude that the effective life you have been using is no longer accurate because of changed circumstances.

Note 1:       This means that the choice is not available for working out notional depreciation deductions for a transition entity under Division 58.

Note 2:       However, a transition entity can make the choice for an income year after the one in which depreciation deductions first become available to it for the plant: see subsection 58-85(3A).

             (2)  The new effective life starts to apply for the income year for which you make the choice.

             (3)  However, you cannot do so if a rate under Subdivision 42-D, and the calculation formula in subsection 42-160(1) or 42-165(1), applies to depreciation of the <sup>* </sup>plant.

Note:          Those rates and calculation formulas can apply to small business taxpayers who satisfy certain conditions.

             (4)  Some examples of changes in circumstances that may result in your working out a new effective life are:

                     (a)  your use of the <sup>* </sup>plant turns out to be more or less rigorous than you expected (or was anticipated by the Commissioner’s determination);

                     (b)  there is a downturn in demand for the goods or services the plant is used to produce that will result in the plant being scrapped;

                     (c)  legislation prevents the plant’s continued use;

                     (d)  changes in technology make the plant redundant.

             (5)  You must work out how long (in years) the <sup>* </sup>plant can be used by any entity for income producing purposes as from the start of the income year for which you make the choice:

                     (a)  having regard to the wear and tear on the plant that will result from your expected circumstances of use; and

                     (b)  assuming that it will be maintained in reasonably good order and condition; and

                     (c)  having regard to when you would be likely to scrap the plant, sell it for scrap or abandon it.

That period is the new <sup>* </sup>effective life of the plant.

             (6)  You will need to work out your depreciation deductions under subsection 42-160(3) or 42-165(2A) using the plant’s <sup>* </sup>effective life worked out under subsection (5) of this section, in years (including the income year for which the choice is made).

             (7)  If you are using the <sup>* </sup>prime cost rate, you use the <sup>* </sup>plant’s <sup>* </sup>undeducted cost as at the start of the income year for which the choice is made as its <sup>* </sup>cost for the purposes of calculating your depreciation deductions.

             (8)  This section applies despite the rule in section 42-40 about choices.

## 4  At the end of section 42-175

Add:

             (3)  However, subparagraphs (1)(b)(ii) and (1)(c)(ii) apply differently if you have chosen to work out a new <sup>* </sup>effective life for the <sup>* </sup>plant under section 42-112.

             (4)  You work out the amount applicable under that subparagraph before the income year (the **_start year_**) in which the new <sup>* </sup>effective life started to apply, and add to that amount the amounts worked out under that subparagraph for the start year and later income years as if the start year were the first one for which a depreciation deduction were allowable to you for the plant.

## 5  After subsection 58-85(3)

Insert:

          (3A)  Despite subsection (3), the <sup>* </sup>transition entity can work out a new <sup>* </sup>effective life for the unit under section 42-112 for an income year after the <sup>* </sup>transition year. It would then use the formula in subsection 42-160(3) or 42-165(2A) in calculating its deductions for depreciation of the unit.

## 6  Application of amendments

The amendments made by this Schedule apply to plant if:

                     (a)  you became its owner or quasi-owner under a contract entered into after 11.45 am, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 21 September 1999; or

                     (b)  you constructed it and the construction started after that time; or

                     (c)  you acquired it in some other way after that time.
