## An Act to make provision for determining the financial support payable by parents for their children, and for other purposes

## Part 1—Preliminary

##### <a id="1"></a>1  Short title [_see_ Note 1]

                   This Act may be cited as the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989_.

##### <a id="2"></a>2  Commencement [_see_ Note 1]

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), this Act commences on a day to be fixed by Proclamation.

             (2)  If this Act does not commence under subsection (1) within the period of 6 months beginning on the day on which it receives the Royal Assent, it commences on the first day after the end of that period.

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Duty of parents to maintain their children

             (1)  The parents of a child have the primary duty to maintain the child.

             (2)  Without limiting subsection (1), the duty of a parent to maintain a child:

                     (a)  is not of lower priority than the duty of the parent to maintain any other child or another person; and

                     (b)  has priority over all commitments of the parent other than commitments necessary to enable the parent to support:

                              (i)  himself or herself; and

                             (ii)  any other child or another person that the parent has a duty to maintain; and

                     (c)  is not affected by:

                              (i)  the duty of any other person to maintain the child; or

                             (ii)  any entitlement of the child or another person to an income tested pension, allowance or benefit.

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Objects of Act

             (1)  The principal object of this Act is to ensure that children receive a proper level of financial support from their parents.

             (2)  Particular objects of this Act include ensuring:

                     (a)  that the level of financial support to be provided by parents for their children is determined according to their capacity to provide financial support and, in particular, that parents with a like capacity to provide financial support for their children should provide like amounts of financial support; and

                     (b)  that the level of financial support to be provided by parents for their children should be determined in accordance with the costs of the children; and

                     (c)  that persons who provide ongoing daily care for children should be able to have the level of financial support to be provided for the children readily determined without the need to resort to court proceedings; and

                     (d)  that children share in changes in the standard of living of both their parents, whether or not they are living with both or either of them; and

                     (e)  that Australia is in a position to give effect to its obligations under international agreements or arrangements relating to maintenance obligations arising from family relationship, parentage or marriage.

             (3)  It is the intention of the Parliament that this Act should be construed, to the greatest extent consistent with the attainment of its objects:

                     (a)  to permit parents to make private arrangements for the financial support of their children; and

                     (b)  to limit interferences with the privacy of persons.

##### <a id="5B"></a>5B  Definition of _target foreign income_

             (1)  A parent’s **_target foreign income_** for a year of income is:

                     (a)  the amount of the parent’s foreign income (as defined in section 10A of the _Social Security Act 1991_) for the year of income that is neither:

                              (i)  taxable income; nor

                             (ii)  received in the form of a fringe benefit (as defined in the _Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986_, as it applies of its own force or because of the _Fringe Benefits Tax (Application to the Commonwealth) Act 1986_) in relation to the parent as an employee (as defined in the _Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986_) and a year of tax; and

             (2)  If it is necessary, for the purposes of this Act, to work out an amount of foreign income expressed in a foreign currency received in a year of income, the amount in Australian currency is to be worked out using the market exchange rate for 1 July in that year of income.

             (3)  If there is no market exchange rate for 1 July in the year of income (for example, because of a national public holiday), the market exchange rate to be used is the market exchange rate that applied on the last working day immediately before that 1 July.

             (4)  For the purposes of this section, the appropriate market exchange rate on a particular day for a foreign currency is:

                     (a)  if there is an on‑demand airmail buying rate for the currency available at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia at the start of business in Sydney on that day and the Secretary determines that it is appropriate to use that rate—that rate; or

                     (b)  in any other case:

                              (i)  if there is another rate of exchange for the currency, or there are other rates of exchange for the currency, available at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia at the start of business in Sydney on that day and the Secretary determines that it is appropriate to use the other rate or one of the other rates—the rate so determined; or

                             (ii)  otherwise—a rate of exchange for the currency available from another source at the start of business in Sydney on that day that the Secretary determines it is appropriate to use.

##### <a id="7A"></a>7A  Meaning of _child support period_

What is a child support period?

             (1)  A **_child support period_** is a period that:

                     (a)  starts at a time described in subsection (2); and

                     (b)  ends at the time described in subsection (3) that occurs soonest after the start of the period.

Note:          Subsections (5) to (8) provide some examples of child support periods. The examples are not exhaustive: see section 15AD of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

When does a child support period start?

             (2)  Each of the following times is the start of a child support period:

                     (a)  the beginning of the day on which an application for an administrative assessment of the child support payable for a child is properly made under Part 4;

                     (b)  the beginning of the day mentioned in paragraph 93(1)(g) (child support payable under a child support agreement accepted by Registrar);

                     (c)  the start of the first day for which a child support agreement described in section 34B is to affect the rate of child support payable for a child;

                     (d)  immediately after the end of the preceding child support period that relates to child support payable for the child (whether it was a period starting as described in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) or this paragraph).

Note:          Despite paragraph (2)(a), a child support period might not start if a non‑parent carer applies for an administrative assessment of child support during a child support period (see section 40B).

End of the child support period

             (3)  The child support period ends at whichever of the following times occurs soonest after the start of the period:

                     (a)  the time 15 months after the period started;

                     (b)  the end of the calendar month during which the Registrar makes an assessment relating to the annual rate of child support payable for the child as required by section 34A (assessment when new tax figure is available);

                     (c)  the time immediately before the day mentioned in paragraph 93(1)(g) (child support payable under a child support agreement accepted by Registrar);

                     (d)  the end of the day immediately before the first day for which a child support agreement described in section 34B is to affect the rate of child support payable for the child.

Examples

             (4)  Subsections (5), (6), (7) and (8) merely give a series of examples of the operation of the rules in subsections (1), (2) and (3). The examples involve Mary and Peter. Mary cares for their child and, on 8 June 2000, makes an application under Part 4 and receives a child support assessment for Peter to pay her child support for the child.

Example—initial child support period resulting from application under Part 4

             (5)  On 20 October 2000, the Registrar makes a new administrative assessment based on an assessment under the income tax law of Peter’s taxable income for the 1999‑2000 year of income (as required by section 34A). The first child support period starts on 8 June 2000 and ends at the end of 31 October 2000, and the second starts on 1 November 2000.

Example—end of child support period if new taxable income not available within 15 months

             (6)  If no assessment of the taxable income of Mary or Peter for the 1999‑2000 or the 2000‑2001 year of income had been made under the income tax law before the end of 7 September 2001, the first child support period would start on 8 June 2000 and end at the end of 7 September 2001 (15 months after it started).

Example—child support agreement ends existing child support period and starts a new one

             (7)  If Mary and Peter make a child support agreement to influence the annual rate of child support on and after 15 September 2000:

                     (a)  the child support period that started on 8 June 2000 ends at the end of 14 September 2000; and

                     (b)  a new child support period starts on 15 September 2000.

Example—child support period for child support agreement setting child support rate lasts 15 months

             (8)  If the child support agreement set the rate of child support payable for the next 2 years (so section 34A did not require the Registrar to make an administrative assessment on 20 October 2000 as described in subsection (5)), the child support period that started on 15 September 2000 would end 15 months later at the end of 14 December 2001 (unless Mary and Peter made another child support agreement to affect the rate of child support payable for a day before 15 December 2001).

##### <a id="7B"></a>7B  Meaning of _eligible carer_

             (1)  In this Act, **_eligible carer_**, in relation to a child, means a person who has at least shared care of the child.

                     (a)  a person cares for a child; and

                     (b)  the person is neither a parent nor a legal guardian of the child; and

                     (c)  a parent or legal guardian of the child has indicated that he or she does not consent to the person caring for the child;

then the person is not an eligible carer in relation to the child unless it would be unreasonable in the circumstances for a parent or legal guardian of the child to care for the child.

             (3)  For the purposes of subsection (2), it is unreasonable for a parent or legal guardian to care for a child if:

                     (a)  the Registrar is satisfied that there has been extreme family breakdown; or

                     (b)  the Registrar is satisfied that there is a serious risk to the child’s physical or mental wellbeing from violence or sexual abuse in the home of the parent or legal guardian concerned.

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Interpretation—meaning of _separated_ 

                   For the purposes of this Act, the parents of a child are to be taken to have separated in circumstances in which the parties to a marriage are, under the _Family Law Act 1975_, taken to have separated.

##### <a id="10"></a>10  Interpretation—meaning of _resident of__Australia_ 

                   For the purposes of this Act, a person is a resident of Australia on a day if on that day the person is a resident of Australia for the purposes of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ otherwise than because of subsection 7A(2) of that Act.

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Interpretation—happening of child support terminating events

### Division 2—Decision on application

##### <a id="29"></a>29  How decision is to be made

             (1)  Subject to this section, in determining whether an application for administrative assessment of child support complies with sections 24, 25 and 25A, the Registrar may act on the basis of the application and the documents accompanying the application, and is not required to conduct any inquiries or investigations into the matter.

             (2)  The Registrar is to be satisfied that a person is a parent of a child only if the Registrar is satisfied:

                     (b)  that the person’s name is entered in a register of births or parentage information, kept under the law of the Commonwealth or of a State, Territory or prescribed overseas jurisdiction, as a parent of the child; or

                     (c)  that, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, a federal court, a court of a State or Territory or a court of a prescribed overseas jurisdiction has:

                              (i)  found expressly that the person is a parent of the child; or

                             (ii)  made a finding that it could not have made unless the person was a parent of the child;

                     (e)  that the child has been adopted by the person; or

                     (a)  2 or more paragraphs of subsection (2) are relevant to a particular application; and

                     (b)  those paragraphs, or some of them, conflict with each other;

the paragraph that appears to the Registrar to be the more or most likely to be the correct presumption prevails.

##### <a id="29A"></a>29A  Person by whom child support is payable must be Australian resident or resident of reciprocating jurisdiction

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  an application is made under section 25 or 25A for a parent to be assessed in respect of the costs of the child; and

                     (b)  the parent is not a resident of Australia on the day on which the application is made.

             (2)  The Registrar must determine whether child support is reasonably likely to be payable by the parent.

             (3)  If the Registrar determines that child support is reasonably likely to be payable by the parent, the application is taken to have been properly made only if:

                     (a)  subsection 24(2) does not apply in relation to the child (payee of child support resident in reciprocating jurisdiction); and

                     (b)  the parent is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction on the day on which the application is made.

Note:          If an application is not properly made, the Registrar must refuse the application under section 30.

##### <a id="29B"></a>29B  Applications by residents of reciprocating jurisdictions

             (1)  If a person applying under section 25 or 25A is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction, the application must be made:

                     (a)  by the person and given to the Registrar by an overseas authority of the reciprocating jurisdiction; or

                     (b)  if an overseas authority of the reciprocating jurisdiction believes that child support is reasonably likely to be payable to the person in respect of a child—by the overseas authority on behalf of the person; or

                     (c)  if the person believes that child support is reasonably likely to be payable by him or her to another person in respect of a child—directly to the Registrar by the person.

             (2)  If an application is made by an overseas authority of a reciprocating jurisdiction on behalf of a person, the regulations may prescribe actions the overseas authority may take for the person.

             (3)  If an application is made by a person and given to the Registrar by an overseas authority of a reciprocating jurisdiction, the regulations may prescribe actions the overseas authority may take for the person with the person’s consent.

##### <a id="30"></a>30  Decision on application

             (1)  If the Registrar is satisfied that an application has been properly made for administrative assessment of child support for a child, the Registrar must accept the application.

             (2)  If the Registrar is not so satisfied, the Registrar may refuse to accept the application.

             (3)  This section is subject to sections 30A and 30B.

##### <a id="30A"></a>30A  No administrative assessment or acceptance of agreement if contrary to international maintenance arrangement

             (1)  An application for:

                     (a)  an administrative assessment of child support for a child; or

                     (b)  acceptance of a child support agreement;

is taken not to have been properly made by a parent by whom, under a determination made under section 29A, child support is reasonably likely to be payable and who is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction specified in regulations made for the purposes of this section.

             (2)  A reciprocating jurisdiction may be specified in regulations made for the purposes of this section if the acceptance of an application for:

                     (a)  an administrative assessment of child support for a child; or

                     (b)  a child support agreement;

in relation to a parent by whom, under a determination made under section 29A, child support is reasonably likely to be payable who is a resident of the jurisdiction would not be permitted by the law of the jurisdiction.

             (3)  This section has effect despite subsection 29A(3).

##### <a id="30B"></a>30B  Registrar may refuse application for administrative assessment if overseas liability already registered

                   If:

                     (a)  a registered maintenance liability of a kind mentioned in section 18A of the Registration and Collection Act relates to a particular child, a liable parent and a carer entitled to child support; and

                     (b)  after the registration of the liability, an application is made for an administrative assessment of child support in relation to the child, the liable parent and the carer entitled to child support; and

                     (c)  either the liable parent or the carer entitled to child support is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction;

then the Registrar may determine that the application is taken not to have been properly made.

##### <a id="31"></a>31  Requirement to assess child support on acceptance of application

             (1)  If the Registrar accepts an application for administrative assessment of child support for a child, the Registrar must, as quickly as possible:

                     (a)  either:

                              (i)  if the application is made under section 25—assess both parents in respect of the costs of the child under Part 5; or

                             (ii)  if the application is made under section 25A (non‑parent carer applications)—assess both parents, or the relevant parent, (as the case requires) in respect of the costs of the child under Part 5; and

                     (b)  assess under Part 5 the annual rate of child support payable by a parent for the child for the days in the child support period that starts:

                              (i)  if child support is payable by a parent who is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction—on the first day on which all prior requirements (if any) under the applicable international maintenance arrangement, and under the laws of the reciprocating jurisdiction, have been complied with; and

                             (ii)  otherwise—on the day on which the application is made.

Example:    Some reciprocating jurisdictions require that notice be given about the making and substance of the application for administrative assessment of child support and how the person may object to the application, or require that a person have an opportunity to be heard before making a decision on an application.

Note:          Part 4A deals with assessments for later child support periods.

             (2)  Child support is payable until the day immediately before the day on which a child support terminating event happens in relation to the child, the carer entitled to child support, the liable parent or all 3 of them.

##### <a id="32"></a>32  Withdrawal of application by applicant

             (1)  Where:

                     (a)  a person has made an application to the Registrar for administrative assessment of child support for a child; and

                     (b)  the Registrar has not accepted, or refused to accept, the application;

the person may, by notice given to the Registrar, withdraw the application.

             (2)  The notice must be given in the manner specified by the Registrar.

Note:          Section 150A provides for the Registrar to specify the manner in which a notice may be given.

             (4)  Where a notice that complies with subsections (2) is given to the Registrar in relation to an application for administrative assessment, the application is to be taken not to have been made.

### Division 3—Notice of decision

##### <a id="33"></a>33  Notice to be given to unsuccessful applicant

             (1)  If the Registrar refuses to accept an application for administrative assessment of child support for a child, the Registrar must immediately notify the applicant in writing.

Refusals on ground that Registrar not satisfied that person a parent

             (3)  If one of the reasons the Registrar refused to accept the application was because the Registrar was not satisfied under section 29 that a person who was to be assessed in respect of the costs of the child is a parent of the child, the notice must include, or be accompanied by:

                     (a)  a statement that the Registrar was not satisfied under section 29 that the person is a parent of the child; and

                     (b)  a statement to the effect that an application may be made to a court having jurisdiction under this Act for a declaration under section 106A that the person should be assessed in respect of the costs of a child because the person is a parent of the child.

Refusals on other grounds

             (4)  If subsection (3) does not apply, the notice must include, or be accompanied by, a statement to the effect that:

                     (a)  the applicant may, subject to the Registration and Collection Act, object to the decision (the **_original decision_**); and

                     (b)  the applicant may, if aggrieved by a later decision on an objection to the original decision (no matter who lodges the objection), subject to that Act, apply to the SSAT for review of the later decision.

Validity of decisions

             (5)  A contravention of subsection (3) or (4) in relation to a decision does not affect the validity of the decision.

##### <a id="34"></a>34  Giving notice of successful application

             (1)  If the Registrar accepts an application for administrative assessment of child support for a child, the Registrar must notify the applicant and any parent who is to be assessed in respect of the costs of the child.

             (2)  The notice must include, or be accompanied by, a statement to the effect that:

                     (a)  an application may be made to a court having jurisdiction under this Act for a declaration under section 107 that a person should not be assessed in respect of the costs of the child because the person is not a parent of the child; and

                     (b)  in any case:

                              (i)  the applicant or a parent who is to be assessed in respect of the costs of the child, may, subject to the Registration and Collection Act, object to the decision (the **_original decision_**) (other than because a person is not a parent of the child); and

                             (ii)  the applicant or a parent who is to be assessed in respect of the costs of the child, if aggrieved by a later decision on an objection in relation to the original decision (no matter who lodges the objection), may, subject to that Act, apply to the SSAT for review of the later decision.

## Part 4A—Assessments of child support for later child support periods

##### <a id="34A"></a>34A  Registrar must make assessment when new tax figure is available

Application of section

             (1)  This section requires the Registrar to assess the annual rate of child support payable in some cases if:

                     (a)  child support is payable by a liable parent for a child for a day in a child support period (the **_earlier period_**); and

                     (b)  during the earlier period, an assessment (the **_tax assessment_**) is made under an Income Tax Assessment Act of the taxable income, or any other component of the adjusted taxable income, of the liable parent or the other parent, for the latest year of income (the **_last year_**) that ended after the start of the earlier period.

Registrar must make assessment using new tax figures

             (2)  As soon as practicable after the tax assessment is made, the Registrar must assess the annual rate of child support payable for the child for days in a child support period starting on the first day of the next calendar month (after the calendar month in which the Registrar makes the assessment).

When new assessment is not required

             (3)  This section does not require the Registrar to make an assessment if:

                     (a)  the Registrar calculates that the tax assessment for the last year could not affect the annual rate of child support payable for the child for a day in a child support period; or

                     (b)  the annual rate of child support payable for the child for the first day of the next calendar month is to be worked out without reference to the actual taxable income of the parent mentioned in paragraph (1)(b) because of:

                              (i)  a child support agreement between the parents of the child; or

                             (ii)  a determination under Part 6A (departure determination); or

                            (iii)  an order made by a court under this Act or the Registration and Collection Act; or

                     (c)  the earlier period will end before the end of the earliest calendar month in which it is practicable for the Registrar to make the assessment mentioned in subsection (2).

Note:          In the case of paragraph (3)(c), the Registrar must use the information from the tax assessment to make an assessment for the period starting immediately after the end of the earlier period (unless the information is not relevant to an assessment, because of an agreement, determination or order) (see section 34C).

##### <a id="34B"></a>34B  Administrative assessment for child support period started by new agreement when support already payable

             (1)  The Registrar must assess the annual rate of child support payable for a child for a day in a child support period if:

                     (a)  the Registrar accepts a child support agreement made in relation to the child; and

                     (b)  child support is already payable by a parent for the child under an administrative assessment; and

                     (c)  the agreement is to affect the annual rate of child support payable for the child.

The Registrar must assess the annual rate immediately after accepting the agreement.

Note 1:       Section 95 explains how the provisions of the agreement affect the assessment.

Note 2:       If the Registrar makes an assessment under this section, the Registrar must make a provisional notional assessment under section 146B.

             (2)  The child support period starts:

                     (a)  if:

                              (i)  the application for acceptance of the agreement was made to the Registrar within 28 days after the day on which the agreement was signed; and

                             (ii)  the agreement states that child support is to be payable from a specified day; and

                            (iii)  the day specified is not earlier than the day on which child support first became payable under the administrative assessment;

                            on the specified day; or

                     (b)  if:

                              (i)  the application for acceptance of the agreement was made to the Registrar within 28 days after the day on which the agreement was signed; and

                             (ii)  the agreement states that child support is to be payable from a specified day; and

                            (iii)  the day specified is earlier than the day on which child support first became payable under the administrative assessment;

                            on the day on which child support first became payable under the administrative assessment; or

                     (c)  if:

                              (i)  the application for acceptance of the agreement was made to the Registrar within 28 days after the day on which the agreement was signed; and

                             (ii)  the agreement does not specify a day from which child support is to be payable;

                            on the day on which the agreement was signed; or

                     (d)  otherwise—on the day on which the application was made to the Registrar for acceptance of the agreement.

             (3)  However, if the applicant for acceptance of the agreement is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction, subsection (2) applies as if the references in subparagraphs (2)(a)(i), (b)(i) and (c)(i) were references to 90 days instead of 28 days.

##### <a id="34C"></a>34C  Administrative assessments for child support periods not started by application or new agreement

                   The Registrar must assess under this Act the annual rate of child support payable for a child for days in a child support period either before, or as soon as practicable after, the start of the period unless:

##### <a id="35C"></a>35C  Application of Part to determine annual rate of child support

                   This Part applies in relation to the assessment of child support payable by a parent for a child, subject to:

                     (a)  any determination made by the Registrar under Part 6A (departure determinations); and

                     (b)  any order made by a court under Division 4 of Part 7 (departure orders); and

                     (c)  any provisions of a child support agreement that have effect, for the purposes of this Part, as if they were such an order made by consent.

#### Subdivision B—Working out annual rates of child support using incomes of both parents in single child support case

##### <a id="35D"></a>35D  Application of Subdivision

             (1)  The annual rate of child support payable for a child for a day in a child support period is assessed under this Subdivision if:

                     (a)  both parents of the child are to be assessed in respect of the costs of the child; and

                     (b)  both parents are to be assessed only in respect of the costs of:

                              (i)  that child; and

                             (ii)  any other child in the child support case that relates to that child.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply if at least one of the parents is liable to pay child support for a child under an administrative assessment under the law of a reciprocating jurisdiction.

##### <a id="35"></a>35  Formula 1: Method statement using incomes of both parents in single child support case with no non‑parent carer

                   This is how to work out the annual rate of child support payable for a child for a day in a child support period if no non‑parent carer has a percentage of care for the child for the day.

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.   Work out each parent’s child support income for the child for the day (see section 41).

Step 2.   Work out the parents’ combined child support income for the child for the day (see section 42).

Step 3.   Work out each parent’s income percentage for the child  for the day (see section 55B).

Step 4.   Work out each parent’s percentage of care for the child for the day (see Subdivision B of Division 4 of Part 5).

Step 5.   Work out each parent’s cost percentage for the child for the day (see section 55C).

Step 6.   Work out each parent’s child support percentage for the child for the day (see section 55D).

Step 7.   Work out the costs of the child for the day under sections 55G and 55H.

Step 8.   If a parent has a positive child support percentage under step 6, the **_annual rate of child support_** payable by the parent for the child for the day is worked out using the formula:

              ![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00611/Html/32e93191-9edf-40da-82bb-c6a259ae8797_files/image002.gif)

* * *

Note:          If a parent’s percentage of care for a child is more than 65%, the parent’s annual rate of child support for the child is nil (see section 40C).

##### <a id="36"></a>36  Formula 2: Working out annual rates of child support using incomes of both parents in single child support case with a non‑parent carer

             (1)  This is how to work out the annual rate of child support payable for a child for a day in a child support period if one or more non‑parent carers have a percentage of care for the child for the day.

             (2)  Follow steps 1 to 8 of the method statement in section 35 for each parent (disregarding subsection 55D(2) (negative child support percentages)).

Annual rate payable by parent

             (3)  If a parent’s (the **_first parent’s_**) child support percentage under step 6 of the method statement in section 35 is positive, then the **_annual rate of child support_** payable by the first parent for the child for the day is the annual rate of child support for the child worked out under step 8 of the method statement.

Annual rate payable only to non‑parent carers

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  the second parent’s child support percentage is also positive; or

                     (b)  the second parent’s child support percentage is nil or negative, and the second parent does not have at least shared care of the child during the relevant care period;

then, subject to section 40B, the first parent must pay the annual rate of child support that is payable by the first parent for the child under subsection (3) to the non‑parent carer or carers in accordance with section 40A.

Note 1:       If both parents have a positive child support percentage, then the non‑parent carer or carers are entitled to be paid the total of the 2 annual rates of child support that are payable by the parents for the child.

Note 2:       Under section 40B, a non‑parent carer of a child is not entitled to be paid child support unless he or she applies under section 25A in relation to the child.

Annual rate payable to parent and non‑parent carer

             (5)  If the second parent’s child support percentage is negative, and the second parent has at least shared care of the child during the relevant care period, then:

                     (a)  the first parent must pay to the second parent the annual rate of child support for the child worked out under step 8 of the method statement using the second parent’s negative child support percentage (expressed as a positive); and

                     (b)  subject to section 40B, the first parent must pay to the non‑parent carer an annual rate of child support for the child that is the difference between:

                              (i)  the annual rate of child support payable by the first parent for the child under subsection (3); and

                             (ii)  the rate referred to in paragraph (a) of this subsection.

#### Subdivision C—Working out annual rates of child support using incomes of both parents in multiple child support cases

##### <a id="36A"></a>36A  Application of Subdivision

             (1)  The annual rate of child support payable for a child for a day in a child support period is assessed under this Subdivision if:

                     (a)  both parents of the child are to be assessed in respect of the costs of that child; and

                     (b)  at least one of the parents of the child is to be assessed in respect of the costs of another child in another child support case.

             (2)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), a parent is taken to be assessed in respect of the costs of another child in another child support case if the parent is liable to pay child support for that child under an administrative assessment under the law of a reciprocating jurisdiction.

##### <a id="37"></a>37  Formula 3: Method statement using incomes of both parents in multiple child support cases with no non‑parent carer

                   This is how to work out the annual rate of child support payable for a child for a day in a child support period if no non‑parent carer has a percentage of care for the child for the day.

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.   Follow steps 1 to 6 in the method statement in section 35 for each parent.

Step 1A. Work out the costs of the child for the day under section 55HA.

Step 1B. If a parent has a positive child support percentage under step 6 of the method statement in section 35, work out the following rate:

Step 2.   Work out each parent’s multi‑case cap (if any) for the child for the day (see section 55E).

Step 3.   If a parent has a positive child support percentage under step 6 of the method statement in section 35, the **_annual rate of child support_** payable by the parent for the child for the day is the lower of:

(a)     the rate worked out under step 1B of the method statement in this section; and

              (b)     the parent’s multi‑case cap (if any) for the child for the day.

* * *

Note:          If a parent’s percentage of care for a child is more than 65%, the parent’s annual rate of child support for the child is nil (see section 40C).

##### <a id="38"></a>38  Formula 4: Working out annual rates of child support using incomes of both parents in multiple child support cases with a non‑parent carer

             (3)  Work out each parent’s multi‑case cap (if any) for the child for the day (see section 55E).

Annual rate payable by parent

             (4)  If a parent’s (the **_first parent’s_**) child support percentage under step 6 of the method statement in section 35 is positive, then the **_annual rate of child support_** payable by the first parent for the child for the day is the lower of:

(a)  the rate worked out under subsection (2B); and

                     (b)  the first parent’s multi‑case cap (if any) for the child for the day.

Annual rate payable only to non‑parent carers

             (5)  If:

                     (a)  the second parent’s child support percentage is also positive; or

                     (b)  the second parent’s child support percentage is nil or negative, and the second parent does not have at least shared care of the child during the relevant care period;

then, subject to section 40B, the first parent must pay the annual rate of child support that is payable by the first parent for the child under subsection (4) to the non‑parent carer or carers in accordance with section 40A.

Note 1:       If both parents have a positive child support percentage, then the non‑parent carer or carers are entitled to be paid the total of the 2 annual rates of child support that are payable by the parents for the child.

Note 2:       Under section 40B, a non‑parent carer of a child is not entitled to be paid child support unless he or she applies under section 25A in relation to the child.

Annual rate payable to parent and non‑parent carer

             (6)  If:

                     (a)  the second parent’s child support percentage is negative; and

                     (b)  the second parent has at least shared care of the child during the relevant care period;

then, subject to section 40B, the first parent must pay the annual rate of child support that is payable by the first parent for the child under subsection (4) to the second parent and the non‑parent carer in accordance with section 40A.

#### Subdivision D—Working out annual rates of child support using income of one parent

##### <a id="38A"></a>38A  Application of Subdivision

                   The annual rate of child support payable for a child for a day in a child support period is assessed under this Subdivision if only one parent of the child is to be assessed in respect of the costs of the child.

##### <a id="39"></a>39  Formula 5: Method statement using income of one parent where other parent not a resident of Australia or in special circumstances

             (1)  This is how to work out the annual rate of child support payable for a child for a day in a child support period if a non‑parent carer of the child has applied for a parent of the child to be assessed in respect of the costs of the child because of subparagraph 25A(b)(ii) or (iii) (non‑resident of Australia or special circumstances).

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.   Work out the parent’s child support income for the day (see section 41) and double that income.

Step 2.   Work out the parent’s percentage of care for the child for the day (see Subdivision B of Division 4 of Part 5).

Step 3.   Work out the parent’s cost percentage for the child for the day (see section 55C).

Step 4.   If the parent is assessed in respect of the costs of another child who is in another child support case, work out the costs of the child for the day under section 55HA. Otherwise, work out the costs of the child for the day under sections 55G and 55H. Assume, in applying section 55G or 55HA and Schedule 1, that the reference to the child support income of the parent in the Costs of the Children Table is a reference to the amount worked out under step 1.

Step 5.   Work out the following rate:

              ![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00611/Html/32e93191-9edf-40da-82bb-c6a259ae8797_files/image004.gif)

Step 6.   If the parent is not assessed in respect of the costs of another child who is in another child support case, the **_annual rate of child support_** payable by the parent for the child for the day is the rate worked out under step 5.

Step 7.   If the parent is assessed in respect of the costs of another child who is in another child support case, work out the parent’s multi‑case cap for the child for the day (see section 55E).

Step 8.   The **_annual rate of child support_** payable by the parent for the child for the day is the lower of:

               (a)     the rate worked out under step 5; and

              (b)     the parent’s multi‑case cap for the child for the day.

Step 9.   If there is only one non‑parent carer who has a percentage of care for the child for the day, the parent must pay the annual rate of child support that is payable for the child under step 5 or 8 to the non‑parent carer. If there are 2 non‑parent carers who have a percentage of care for the child for the day, then, subject to section 40B, the parent must pay the annual rate of child support that is payable for the child under step 5 or 8 to the non‑parent carers in accordance with section 40A.

* * *

Note:          Under section 40B, a non‑parent carer of a child is not entitled to be paid child support unless he or she applies under section 25A in relation to the child.

             (2)  For the purposes of steps 4, 6 and 7 of the method statement in subsection (1), a parent is taken to be assessed in respect of the costs of another child who is in another child support case if the parent is liable to pay child support for that child under an administrative assessment under the law of a reciprocating jurisdiction.

##### <a id="40"></a>40  Formula 6: Method statement using income of one parent where other parent deceased

             (1)  This is how to work out the annual rate of child support payable for a child for a day in a child support period if a non‑parent carer of the child has applied for a parent of the child to be assessed in respect of the costs of the child because of subparagraph 25A(b)(iv) (deceased parent).

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.   Work out the parent’s child support income for the day (see section 41).

Step 2.   Work out the parent’s percentage of care for the child for the day (see Subdivision B of Division 4 of Part 5).

Step 3.   Work out the parent’s cost percentage for the child for the day (see section 55C).

Step 4.   If the parent is assessed in respect of the costs of another child who is in another child support case, work out the costs of the child for the day under section 55HA. Otherwise, work out the costs of the child for the day under sections 55G and 55H.

Step 5.   Work out the following rate:

              ![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00611/Html/32e93191-9edf-40da-82bb-c6a259ae8797_files/image005.gif)

Step 6.   If the parent is not assessed in respect of the costs of another child who is in another child support case, the **_annual rate of child support_** payable by the parent for the child for the day is the rate worked out under step 5.

Step 7.   If the parent is assessed in respect of the costs of another child who is in another child support case, work out the parent’s multi‑case cap for the child for the day (see section 55E).

Step 8.   The **_annual rate of child support_** payable by the parent for the child for the day is the lower of:

               (a)     the rate worked out under step 5; and

              (b)     the parent’s multi‑case cap for the child for the day.

Step 9.   If there is only one non‑parent carer who has a percentage of care for the child for the day, the parent must pay the annual rate of child support that is payable for the child under step 5 or 8 to the non‑parent carer. If there are 2 non‑parent carers who have a percentage of care for the child for the day, then, subject to section 40B, the parent must pay the annual rate of child support that is payable for the child under step 5 or 8 to the non‑parent carers in accordance with section 40A.

* * *

Note:          Under section 40B, a non‑parent carer of a child is not entitled to be paid child support unless he or she applies under section 25A in relation to the child.

             (2)  In applying subsection (1), even if a non‑parent carer is not entitled to be paid an annual rate of child support because of section 40B, the non‑parent carer’s cost percentage is taken into account.

##### <a id="40B"></a>40B  Non‑parent carer must have applied for child support

             (1)  A non‑parent carer of a child is not, under section 36, 38, 39, 40, 65A or 66, entitled to be paid an annual rate of child support for the child for a day in a child support period unless the non‑parent carer has made an application under section 25A in relation to the child.

             (2)  If a non‑parent carer is not entitled to be paid child support for a child for a day in a child support period under subsection (1), the **_annual rate of child support_** payable by the parent for the child for the day is reduced by the amount that is not payable because of subsection (1).

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  a non‑parent carer of a child has not so applied at the time the administrative assessment of child support for the child for the child support period is made; but

### Division 3—Child support income

#### Subdivision A—Preliminary

##### <a id="40E"></a>40E  Simplified outline

                   The following is a simplified outline of this Division:

* * *

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      The income used in

determining a parent’s capacity to meet the costs of his or her children might

be reduced by the following amounts:</li>

               (a)     the self‑support amount (to take account of the parent’s need to support himself or herself);

              (b)     a relevant dependent child amount (if the parent cares for a relevant dependent child or step‑child of the parent);

               (c)     a multi‑case allowance (if the parent has multiple child support cases).

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      The relevant dependent

child amount and the multi‑case allowance take account of the costs of relevant

dependent children, and children in other child support cases, in a similar way

to the way in which the costs of the children are worked out for children in a

child support case.</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      A parent’s adjusted taxable

income for a year of income can be reduced under section 44 in respect of

a particular child if the parent earns additional income during the first 3

years after separating from the other parent of the child.</li>

#### Subdivision B—Child support income and combined child support income

##### <a id="41"></a>41  Working out parent’s child support income

Single child support case—no relevant dependent children

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a parent is to be assessed in respect of the costs of a child in only one child support case; and

#### Subdivision C—Working out the components of child support income

##### <a id="43"></a>43  Working out parent’s adjusted taxable income

             (1)  Subject to this Part, a parent’s **_adjusted taxable income_** for a child for a day in a child support period is the total of the following components:

                     (a)  the parent’s taxable income for the last relevant year of income in relation to the child support period;

                      (f)  the parent’s reportable superannuation contributions (within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_) for that year of income.

Note 1:       Other provisions that relate to a person’s adjusted taxable income are section 34A and Subdivisions B and C of Division 7.

Note 2:       The components of the definition of **_adjusted taxable income_** are defined in section 5.

             (2)  If the Registrar amends an assessment under section 44, then for the purposes of the assessment, the person’s **_adjusted taxable income_** for a child to whom the assessment relates, for a day in the child support period, is the amount determined by the Registrar.

##### <a id="44"></a>44  Post‑separation costs

Application for post‑separation income to be excluded

             (1)  A parent (the **_applicant_**) of a child may apply to the Registrar to amend an administrative assessment of child support payable by or to the parent for the child for part of a child support period if:

                     (a)  the applicant and the other parent of the child lived together on a genuine domestic basis for at least 6 months; and

                     (b)  the separation, following that 6 month period, of the applicant from the other parent occurred:

                              (i)  within the last 3 years; and

                             (ii)  before the application for administrative assessment of child support for the child was made under section 25 or 25A; and

                     (c)  at the time of the application under this section, the applicant and the other parent remain separated; and

                     (d)  in the last relevant year of income, or in the application period for an income election (if such an election has been made by the parent), the applicant earns, derives or receives income:

                              (i)  in accordance with a pattern of earnings, derivation or receipt that is established after the applicant and the other parent first separate; and

                             (ii)  that is of a kind that it is reasonable to expect would not have been earned, derived or received in the ordinary course of events.

             (2)  If the applicant makes an application under this section, the Registrar may determine that the applicant’s adjusted taxable income for the child for a day in the child support period is a specified amount that excludes the income referred to in paragraph (1)(d).

             (3)  However, the Registrar may make a determination under subsection (2) only if the determination:

                     (a)  reduces the applicant’s adjusted taxable income for the child for a day in the child support period by 30% or less; and

                     (b)  applies in respect of a day in the child support period, being a day that is less than 3 years after the last separation referred to in paragraph (1)(b).

Registrar to implement determinations

             (4)  The Registrar is to take such action as is necessary to give effect to the determination by amending any administrative assessment that has been made in relation to the child support period.

Notice to be served if Registrar refuses application

             (5)  If the Registrar refuses to make a determination under subsection (2), the Registrar must serve written notice of the decision on the applicant.

             (6)  The notice must include, or be accompanied by, a statement to the effect:

                     (a)  that the applicant may, subject to the Registration and Collection Act, object to the particulars of the assessment in relation to which the applicant sought to make the application; and

                     (b)  that if the applicant is aggrieved by the decision on the objection, he or she may, subject to that Act, apply to the SSAT for review of the decision.

             (7)  This section does not prevent the Registrar from making a new assessment for part of the child support period.

Note:          This section does not limit the power under section 75 to amend assessments (see subsection 75(5)).

##### <a id="45"></a>45  Working out the self‑support amount

                   A parent’s **_self‑support amount_** for a day in a child support period is:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00611/Html/32e93191-9edf-40da-82bb-c6a259ae8797_files/image011.gif)

Note:          A parent’s self‑support amount can be varied by a determination or order under section 98S or 118.

##### <a id="46"></a>46  Working out parent’s relevant dependent child amount

                   A parent’s **_relevant dependent child amount_** for a day in a child support period is the total  of the amounts worked out for each relevant dependent child of the parent using this method statement.

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.   Work out the difference between the parent’s adjusted taxable income for the child for the day and the parent’s self‑support amount for the day (see sections 43 and 45).

Step 2.   Work out the parent’s percentage of care for the child for the day (see Subdivision B of Division 4 of Part 5).

Step 3.   Work out the parent’s cost percentage for the child for the day (see section 55C).

Step 4.   Work out the costs of the child for the day under sections 55G and 55H as if:

               (a)     the parent’s annual rate of child support were assessed under Subdivision D of Division 2; and

              (b)     the reference in subsection 55G(2) to the parent’s child support income were a reference to the amount worked out under step 1; and

               (c)     references in sections 55G and 55H to children in the child support case that relates to the child were references to all of the parent’s relevant dependent children.

Step 5.   Work out the following amount for the child for a day in the child support period:

              ![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00611/Html/32e93191-9edf-40da-82bb-c6a259ae8797_files/image012.gif)

* * *

Note:          Section 73A deals with the Registrar discovering, after making an administrative assessment, that a parent has a relevant dependent child.

##### <a id="47"></a>47  Working out multi‑case allowances

             (1)  A parent’s **_multi‑case allowance_** for a child (the **_particular child_**) for a day in a child support period is worked out using this method statement.

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.   Work out the following amount:

              ![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00611/Html/32e93191-9edf-40da-82bb-c6a259ae8797_files/image013.gif)

Step 2.   If the parent has a relevant dependent child, take the parent’s relevant dependent child amount (see section 46) for the day from the amount worked out under step 1.

Step 3.   For each of the children (the **_multi‑case children_**) for whom the parent is assessed in respect of the costs of the child for the day, work out the **_multi‑case child costs_** for the particular child for the day under section 55HA, as if:

               (a)     the parent’s annual rate of child support were assessed under Subdivision D of Division 2; and

              (b)     the reference in subsection 55HA(2) to the parent’s child support income were a reference to the amount worked out under step 1 or 2 (as the case requires); and

               (c)     references in section 55HA to children in the child support case that relates to the child were references to all of the parent’s multi‑case children.

Step 4.   The parent’s **_multi‑case allowance_** for the particular child for the day is the sum of the multi‑case child costs for each of the other multi‑case children (excluding the particular child and any other children in the child support case that relates to the particular child).

* * *

             (2)  For the purposes of step 3 of the method statement, a parent is taken to be assessed in respect of the costs of a child if the parent is liable to pay child support for the child under an administrative assessment under the law of a reciprocating jurisdiction.

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a determination of a responsible person’s percentage of care (the **_existing percentage of care_**) for a child has been made under section 49 or 50; and

                     (b)  if section 51 or 52 applied in relation to the responsible person—the interim period for the determination has ended; and

                     (c)  the Registrar or the Family Assistance Secretary is notified, or otherwise becomes aware, that the care of the child that is actually taking place does not correspond with the responsible person’s existing percentage of care for the child; and

                     (d)  the Registrar is satisfied that the responsible person’s cost percentage for the child would change if the Registrar were to determine, under section 49 or 50, another percentage to be the person’s percentage of care for the child; and

                     (e)  section 54G does not apply;

the Registrar must revoke the determination.

Note:          The Registrar must make a new determination under section 49 or 50 to replace the revoked determination: see paragraph 49(1)(b) or 50(1)(b).

             (2)  The revocation of the determination takes effect at the end of:

                     (a)  if the Registrar or the Family Assistance Secretary is notified, or otherwise becomes aware, of the matter referred to in paragraph (1)(c) within 28 days after the change of care day for the responsible person:

                     (b)  the first responsible person has had no care of the child, or has had a pattern of care that is less than regular care of the child, despite another responsible person for the child making the child available to the first responsible person; and

                     (c)  a determination of the other responsible person’s percentage of care for the child has been made under section 50; and

                     (d)  the other responsible person notifies the Registrar or the Family Assistance Secretary of the matter referred to in paragraph (b) of this subsection within a period that the Registrar considers is reasonable in the circumstances;

represents the extent to which the parent is taken to have met the costs of the

child through care.</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      A parent’s child support

percentage is the difference between the parent’s income percentage and his or

her cost percentage. Generally, if the parent has a positive child support

percentage, the annual rate of child support payable by the parent is that

percentage of the costs of the child.</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      If a parent has multiple

child support cases, the annual rate of child support payable by the parent for

a child is capped by the parent’s multi‑case cap for the child.</li>

#### Subdivision B—Adjusted taxable income determined by reference to taxable income etc.

##### <a id="56"></a>56  Taxable income is as assessed under Income Tax Assessment Act

Meaning of **taxable income**

             (1)  For the purposes of assessing a parent in respect of the costs of a child in relation to a child support period, if the parent’s taxable income has been assessed under an Income Tax Assessment Act for the last relevant year of income in relation to the child support period, the parent’s **_taxable income_** for that year is the amount as so assessed.

Note:          Sections 34A and 57 are also relevant to a person’s taxable income.

When amended tax assessment may be taken into account

             (2)  If, after an administrative assessment of child support is made, the assessment (the **_tax assessment_**) of a parent’s taxable income is amended (whether or not because of an objection, appeal or review), the Registrar must not amend the administrative assessment to take account of the amendment to the tax assessment unless one of the following applies:

             (3)  For the purposes of this section, if:

                     (a)  notice of an assessment (including an amended assessment) of a parent’s taxable income under an Income Tax Assessment Act has been served on the parent under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; and

                     (b)  the notice is dated;

then the assessment is taken to have been made on the date of the notice.

##### <a id="57"></a>57  Taxable income for child support purposes where taxable income determined to be nil under Income Tax Assessment Act

             (1)  This section does not apply to a parent for a year of income if the parent has a component of adjusted taxable income mentioned in paragraphs 43(1)(b) to (e) for the year of income.

Determinations that taxable income nil or no tax payable

             (2)  A parent’s **_taxable income_** for a year of income is nil if the parent’s taxable income for that year has been determined to be nil under an Income Tax Assessment Act.

             (3)  A parent’s **_taxable income_** for a year of income is also nil if:

                     (a)  the Commissioner has determined under an Income Tax Assessment Act that no tax was payable (before the allowance of any rebate or credit) under that Act on the parent’s taxable income for the year of income; and

             (4)  Subsections (2) and (3) do not apply in relation to an administrative assessment made in relation to a parent if:

                     (a)  before the administrative assessment is made; but

                     (b)  after the most relevant notice mentioned in subsection (5) or (6) is made;

an assessment is issued under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ of the person’s taxable income for the year of income under an Income Tax Assessment Act.

Notices issued under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936

             (5)  If a parent has been served a notice under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ to the effect that the taxable income of the parent under an Income Tax Assessment Act for a year of income is nil, then:

                     (a)  the parent’s taxable income for that year is taken to have been determined to be nil under an Income Tax Assessment Act; and

                     (b)  if the notice was dated—the determination is taken to have been made on the date of the notice.

             (6)  If a parent has been served a notice under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ to the effect that no tax is payable (before the allowance of any rebate or credit) under an Income Tax Assessment Act on the taxable income of the parent for a year of income, then:

                     (a)  the Commissioner is taken to have determined under the Income Tax Assessment Act that no tax was payable (before the allowance of any rebate or credit) under that Act on the parent’s taxable income for the year of income; and

                     (b)  if the notice was dated—the determination is taken to have been made on the date of the notice.

When amended tax assessment may be taken into account

             (7)  If, after an administrative assessment of child support is made, the assessment (the **_tax assessment_**) of the parent’s taxable income is amended (whether or not because of an objection, appeal or review), the Registrar must not amend the administrative assessment to take account of the amendment to the tax assessment unless either of the following applies:

                     (a)  the subsequent assessment was made because the parent had not made to the Commissioner a full and true disclosure of all the material facts necessary for the Commissioner’s assessment, or in other circumstances prescribed for the purposes of this subsection;

                     (b)  the amendment is made solely for the purposes of working out the parent’s adjusted taxable income for the last relevant year of income for the purposes of paragraph 60(1)(b) (first estimate must be lower than adjusted taxable income).

                     (a)  the parent’s taxable income for the last relevant year of income in relation to the period has not been assessed under an Income Tax Assessment Act;

                     (b)  the Registrar is unable to ascertain whether or not the parent’s taxable income for that year has been so assessed.

Information or document in the possession of the Registrar etc.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  the Registrar or the Commissioner of Taxation has information (whether oral or written) or a document in his or her possession; and

                     (b)  either:

                              (i)  an amount is specified in that information or document as the parent’s adjusted taxable income for the last relevant year of income; or

                             (ii)  that information or document allows the amount of the parent’s adjusted taxable income for the last relevant year of income to be worked out; and

                     (c)  the Registrar is satisfied that the specified amount, or the amount so worked out, is a reasonable approximation of the parent’s adjusted taxable income for that year;

the Registrar may determine that the specified amount, or the amount so worked out, is the parent’s adjusted taxable income for that year.

Parent’s taxable income assessed for the previous year of income

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  the parent’s taxable income for a year of income has been assessed under an Income Tax Assessment Act; and

                     (b)  that year (the **_previous year_**) is the year of income before the last relevant year of income;

the Registrar may determine that the parent’s adjusted taxable income for the last relevant year of income is the amount worked out by multiplying the parent’s adjusted taxable income for the previous year by the ATI indexation factor.

Parent’s taxable income assessed for an earlier year of income

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  the parent’s taxable income for the previous year has not been assessed under an Income Tax Assessment Act; but

                     (b)  the parent’s taxable income for an earlier year of income has been so assessed;

the Registrar may determine that the parent’s adjusted taxable income for the last relevant year of income is the greater of the following amounts:

                     (c)  the amount worked out by multiplying the parent’s adjusted taxable income for the earlier year of income (or, if the parent’s taxable income has been so assessed for more than one earlier year of income, the most recent of those years) by the ATI indexation factor;

                     (d)  the amount that is equal to two‑thirds of the annualised MTAWE figure for the relevant September quarter in relation to the child support period.

Other circumstances

             (5)  If:

                     (b)  the Registrar decides not to make a determination in relation to the parent under one of those subsections;

the Registrar may determine that the parent’s adjusted taxable income for the last relevant year of income is an amount that is at least two‑thirds of the annualised MTAWE figure for the relevant September quarter in relation to the child support period.

##### <a id="58AA"></a>58AA  _ATI indexation factor_ for determinations under section 58

             (1)  The **_ATI indexation factor_** is:

where:

                    <a name="aw-amount"></a>**_AWE amount_** for a September quarter of a year of income means the amount published for the reference period in the quarter by the Australian Statistician in a document titled “Average Weekly Earnings, Australia” (or, if that title changes, in a replacement document) under the headings “Average Weekly Earnings—Trend—Persons—All employees total earnings” (or, if any of those headings change, under any replacement headings).

                    <a name="refer-period"></a>**_reference period_** in a September quarter of a year of income means the period described by the Australian Statistician as the last pay period ending on or before the third Friday of the middle month of the quarter.

                    <a name="septemb-quarter"></a>**_September quarter_** of a year of income means the quarter ending on 30 September of that year.

                    <a name="tax-return-year"></a>**_tax return year_** means:

                     (b)  if subsection 58(4) applies—the earlier year of income that applies under paragraph 58(4)(c).

             (2)  The ATI indexation factor is to be calculated to 3 decimal places (rounding up if the fourth decimal place is 5 or more).

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  the Australian Statistician publishes an AWE amount (the **_later amount_**) for a September quarter of a year of income; and

                     (b)  the later amount is published in substitution for an AWE amount for that quarter that was previously published by the Australian Statistician;

the publication of the later amount is to be disregarded for the purposes of this section.

##### <a id="58A"></a>58A  Subsequently ascertaining components of a parent’s adjusted taxable income

             (1)  The Registrar must immediately amend an administrative assessment of child support payable by or to a parent in relation to a child support period if:

                     (a)  the assessment was made on the basis of a determination under section 58; and

                     (b)  either:

                              (i)  the Registrar subsequently ascertains the amount of the parent’s adjusted taxable income for the last relevant year of income; or

                             (ii)  the Registrar makes a later determination under section 58; and

                     (c)  either:

                              (i)  if subparagraph (b)(i) applies—the amount that was subsequently ascertained is different from the amount that was determined under section 58; or

                             (ii)  if subparagraph (b)(ii) applies—the later amount that the Registrar determines is different from the earlier amount determined under section 58.

Retrospective determinations

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  at the time the Registrar is to amend the administrative assessment under this section, the parent could lodge his or her tax return by the date required under Part IV of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_(taking into account any deferral under section 388‑55 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_); or

                     (b)  paragraph (a) of this subsection does not apply and:

                              (i)  the amount subsequently ascertained, as mentioned in subparagraph (1)(b)(i), is higher than the amount that was determined under section 58; or

                             (ii)  the later amount that the Registrar determines, as mentioned in subparagraph (1)(b)(ii), is higher than the earlier amount determined under section 58; or

                     (c)  neither paragraph (a) nor (b) applies, but circumstances prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this section apply in relation to the parent;

then the Registrar must immediately amend the administrative assessment for the child support period on the basis that the parent’s adjusted taxable income for that year of income is, and has always been, the amount that was subsequently ascertained or later determined (as the case requires).

Prospective determinations

             (3)  If subsection (2) does not apply, then the Registrar must immediately amend the administrative assessment for the child support period on the basis that for each later day in the period the parent’s adjusted taxable income for that year of income is the amount that was subsequently ascertained or later determined (as the case requires).

No taxation assessment required

             (4)  This section applies whether or not the Commissioner of Taxation has made an assessment under an Income Tax Assessment Act of the parent’s taxable income for that year of income.

#### Subdivision BA—Overseas income

##### <a id="58B"></a>58B  Inclusion of overseas income in working out a parent’s adjusted taxable income

                   For the purposes of working out a parent’s adjusted taxable income for a child for a day in a child support period if the parent is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction, a reference in this Division to the parent’s taxable income includes a reference to the parent’s overseas income as determined under this Subdivision.

##### <a id="58C"></a>58C  Determination of overseas income if information and documents in Registrar’s possession are sufficient

             (1)  This section applies if the Registrar possesses sufficient information and documents to determine a parent’s overseas income (whether as a result of seeking information or documents under section 162A or not).

             (2)  In making an administrative assessment in relation to the parent and a child support period, the Registrar may determine, from the information and documents in the Registrar’s possession, an amount to be the parent’s overseas income for the year of income for the purpose of working out the person’s adjusted taxable income.

##### <a id="58D"></a>58D  Determination of overseas income if information and documents in Registrar’s possession are insufficient

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  the Registrar does not possess sufficient information and documents to determine a parent’s overseas income; and

                     (b)  despite requesting, under section 162A, information or documents from the parent or from an overseas authority that are necessary to determine the parent’s overseas income, the information or documents requested have not been supplied.

             (2)  In making an administrative assessment of the child support in relation to the parent and a child support period, the Registrar may determine that the parent’s overseas income for the year of income, for the purpose of working out the parent’s adjusted taxable income, is an amount that the Registrar considers appropriate of at least two‑thirds of the annualised MTAWE figure for the relevant September quarter.

#### Subdivision C—Child support income determined by reference to parent’s estimate of adjusted taxable income

##### <a id="60"></a>60  Parent may elect to estimate his or her adjusted taxable income for a year of income

                             (ii)  an amount that the parent declares is the total of the parent’s adjusted taxable income for the last relevant year of income for the child support period, and the Registrar is satisfied that the declared amount is correct.

Estimate for a whole year of income

             (2)  If the parent makes the election under subsection (1) before the year of income starts or on the first day of the year of income, the amount is the total of the following amounts (the **_income component amounts_**) as estimated by the parent:

                     (a)  the parent’s taxable income for the year;

                     (b)  the parent’s reportable fringe benefits total for the year;

                     (a)  the parent is to use the method in subsection (4) to work out the amount; and

                     (b)  the parent is to estimate each income component amount for the parent for the period that:

                              (i)  started on the first day of the year of income; and

                             (ii)  ended at the end of the day before the start day for the election.

             (4)  For the purposes of paragraph (3)(a), the method is as follows:

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.   Estimate each income component amount for the parent for the period (the **_remaining period_**):

               (a)     starting on the start day for the election; and

              (b)     ending at the end of the last day of the year of income.

Step 2.   Add up those amounts. The result is the **_partial year income amount_**.

                     (b)  at the time of the revocation, the application period for the earlier election has started;

the parent must elect that the parent’s adjusted taxable income for the year of income is to be the amount the parent works out as follows:

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.   Estimate each income component amount for the parent for the period (the **_remaining period_**):

               (a)     starting on the start day for the election made under this subsection; and

              (b)     ending at the end of the last day of the year of income.

Step 2.   Add up those amounts. The result is the **_partial year income amount_**.

Step 4.   Multiply the quotient by 365.

* * *

Start day

             (2)  Subject to subsection (3), the start day for the election under subsection (1) must be the day on which the parent makes that election.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  an event affecting the accuracy of an estimate on which the earlier election is based has occurred; and

                     (b)  the amount that would be worked out under subsection (1) for an election under that subsection if the start day for that election was the day on which the event occurred is more than:

                              (i)  if subsection 60(2) or (3) applied to the earlier election—the amount that applied under that subsection; or

                             (ii)  if the earlier election was made under subsection (1) of this section—the amount worked out under that subsection;

the start day for the election under subsection (1) of this section must be the day on which the event occurred.

                     (b)  the parent’s applicable year to date income amount (if any) for the year of income;

is more than the parent’s estimated ATI amount for the year of income, then the parent’s adjusted taxable income for a day that occurs in the application period of each income election made by the parent is taken to be, and to have always been, the amount worked out for that income election using the method in subsection (4).

Estimated ATI amount

             (3)  The parent’s **_estimated ATI amount_** for the year of income is worked out using the following method:

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.   For each income election relating to the year of income that had an application period that ended before the last day of the year of income:

               (a)     if subsection 60(2) applied to the income election—divide the amount that applied under that subsection by 365; or

              (b)     otherwise—divide the partial year income amount worked out under subsection 60(4) or 62A(1) by the number of days in the remaining period to which the income election related.

Step 2.   For each of those income elections, multiply the result of step 1 by the number of days in the application period for the income election.

Step 3.   Add up each of the amounts worked out under step 2.

Step 4.   Add the result of step 3 and the partial year income amount worked out under subsection 62A(1) for the last income election relating to the year of income that was made by the parent.

* * *

Amount for the purposes of subsection (2)

             (4)  For the purposes of subsection (2), the amount for each income election is worked out using the following method:

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.   Subtract the parent’s estimated ATI amount from the parent’s actual ATI amount.

Step 2.   Divide the result by the total number of days in the application periods for each income election relating to the year of income that was made by the parent. The result is the **_additional daily rate_**.

Step 3.   For each of those income elections, multiply the additional daily rate by the number of days in the application period for the income election. The result is the **_underestimated amount_** for the income election.

Step 4.   For each of those income elections, add the underestimated amount for the income election and:

               (a)     if the income election had an application period that ended before the last day of the year of income—the amount worked out for the income election under step 2 of the method statement in subsection (3); or

              (b)     otherwise—the partial year income amount worked out under subsection 62A(1) for the income election.

Step 5.   For each of those income elections:

               (a)     divide the result of step 4 by the number of days in the application period for the income election; and

              (b)     multiply the quotient by 365.

* * *

                            is more than the partial year income amount worked out by the parent under subsection 60(4);

the parent’s adjusted taxable income for a day that occurs in the application period for the income election is taken to be, and to have always been, the amount worked out under subsection (4).

             (4)  For the purposes of subsection (3), the amount is worked out by:

                     (a)  dividing the amount worked out under paragraph (3)(b) by the number of days in the remaining period to which the income election related; and

                     (b)  multiplying the quotient by 365.

Income amount orders

             (5)  This section does not apply if an income amount order applies in relation to the parent and any part of the application period for the income election.

##### <a id="64AD"></a>64AD  Reconciliation using a parent’s determined ATI—more than one income election

             (1)  This section applies for the purposes of assessing a parent in relation to the costs of a child of the parent for a day in a child support period if:

                     (a)  the day occurs in the application period for an income election relating to a year of income that was made by the parent; and

                     (b)  the parent made more than one income election relating to the year of income; and

                     (c)  the Registrar makes a determination under subsection 64AB(1) in relation to the parent; and

                     (d)  if, under section 63A, 63B or 63C, the Registrar has amended an assessment of child support payable by or to the parent—the Registrar determines that this section should apply in relation to the parent.

Reconciliation

             (2)  Subject to this section, if the difference (the **_actual ATI amount_**) between:

                     (a)  the parent’s determined ATI for the year of income; and

                     (b)  the parent’s applicable year to date income amount (if any) for the year of income;

is more than the parent’s estimated ATI amount for the year of income, then the parent’s adjusted taxable income for a day that occurs in the application period of each income election made by the parent is taken to be, and to have always been, the amount worked out for that income election using the method in subsection (4).

Estimated ATI amount

             (3)  The parent’s **_estimated ATI amount_** for the year of income is worked out using the following method:

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.   For each income election relating to the year of income that had an application period that ended before the last day of the year of income:

               (a)     if subsection 60(2) applied to the income election—divide the amount that applied under that subsection by 365; or

              (b)     otherwise—divide the partial year income amount worked out under subsection 60(4) or 62A(1) by the number of days in the remaining period to which the income election related.

Step 2.   For each of those income elections, multiply the result of step 1 by the number of days in the application period for the income election.

Step 3.   Add up each of the amounts worked out under step 2.

Step 4.   Add the result of step 3 and the partial year income amount worked out under subsection 62A(1) for the last income election relating to the year of income that was made by the parent.

* * *

Amount for the purposes of subsection (2)

             (4)  For the purposes of subsection (2), the amount for each income election is worked out using the following method:

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.   Subtract the parent’s estimated ATI amount from the parent’s determined ATI.

Step 2.   Divide the result by the total number of days in the application periods for each income election relating to the year of income that was made by the parent. The result is the **_additional daily rate_**.

Step 3.   For each of those income elections, multiply the additional daily rate by the number of days in the application period for the income election. The result is the **_underestimated amount_** for the income election.

Step 4.   For each of those income elections, add the underestimated amount for the income election and:

               (a)     if the income election had an application period that ended before the last day of the year of income—the amount worked out for the income election under step 2 of the method statement in subsection (3); or

              (b)     otherwise—the partial year income amount worked out under subsection 62A(1) for the income election.

Step 5.   For each of those income elections:

               (a)     divide the result of step 4 by the number of days in the application period for the income election; and

              (b)     multiply the quotient by 365.

* * *

Income amount orders

             (5)  This section does not apply if an income amount order applies in relation to the parent and any part of an application period for any of the income elections.

##### <a id="64AE"></a>64AE  Action by Registrar following reconciliation

                   The Registrar is to take such action as is necessary to give effect to sections 64AC and 64AD in relation to a parent (whether by amending any administrative assessment that has been made in relation to the parent or otherwise).

#### Subdivision C—Penalty

##### <a id="64AF"></a>64AF  Penalty if a parent underestimates an income amount

             (1)  A parent is liable to pay the Registrar a penalty if:

                     (a)  the parent made an income election relating to a year of income; and

                     (b)  the parent’s actual adjusted taxable income for the year of income has been ascertained by the Registrar; and

                     (c)  the parent has underestimated an income amount in making the income election.

             (2)  If the parent did not make more than one income election relating to the year of income, the parent has **_underestimated an income amount_** in making the income election if:

                     (a)  in a case where subsection 60(2) applied to the income election—the parent’s actual adjusted taxable income for the year of income is at least 110% of the amount that applied under that subsection; or

                     (b)  in a case where subsection 60(3) applied to the income election—the amount worked out by subtracting:

                              (i)  the parent’s applicable year to date income amount for the year of income; from

                             (ii)  the parent’s actual adjusted taxable income for the year of income;

                            is at least 110% of the partial year income amount worked out by the parent under subsection 60(4).

             (3)  If the parent made more than one income election relating to the year of income, the parent has **_underestimated an income amount_** in making the income elections if the amount worked out by subtracting:

                     (a)  the parent’s applicable year to date income amount (if any) for the year of income; from

                     (b)  the parent’s actual adjusted taxable income for the year of income;

is at least 110% of the parent’s estimated ATI amount for the year of income worked out under subsection 64A(3).

##### <a id="64AG"></a>64AG  Amount of penalty

             (1)  If a parent is liable under subsection 64AF(1) to pay a penalty, the amount of the penalty for each income election made by the parent relating to the year of income is 10% of the difference between:

                     (a)  the administrative assessment of child support made under section 64AA in relation to the parent; and

                     (b)  the administrative assessment of child support that would have been made if it were based entirely on the amount that applied under subsection 60(2) or (3), or that was worked out under subsection 62A(1).

             (2)  The penalty is a debt due to the Commonwealth by the parent and is due and payable on the issue of the administrative assessment of child support made under section 64AA in relation to the parent.

##### <a id="64AH"></a>64AH  Remission of penalty

             (1)  The Registrar may remit the whole or a part of a penalty that a parent who made an income election is liable to pay under subsection 64AF(1) if:

                     (a)  the parent underestimated an income amount in making the income election because of an amendment of an Income Tax Assessment Act, or because of a ruling or determination under that Act; or

                     (b)  the parent underestimated an income amount in making the income election for some other reason, and the Registrar is satisfied that it would be fair and reasonable in the circumstances to remit the whole or that part of the penalty.

             (2)  If the Registrar makes a decision to remit only part of the penalty, or not to remit any part of the penalty, the Registrar must give written notice of the decision to the parent by whom the penalty is, or but for the remission would be, payable.

             (3)  The notice must include, or be accompanied by, a statement to the effect:

                     (a)  that the parent may, subject to the Registration and Collection Act, object to the decision (the **_original decision_**); and

                     (b)  that if the parent is aggrieved by a later decision on an objection to the original decision, he or she may, subject to that Act, apply to the SSAT for review of the later decision.

             (4)  A contravention of subsection (3) in relation to a decision does not affect the validity of the decision.

* * *

#### Subdivision B—Annual rates of child support for low income parents and minimum annual rates of child support

##### <a id="65A"></a>65A  Annual rate of child support for low income parents not on income support

Assessment of annual rate

             (1)  The Registrar must assess an annual rate of child support payable by a parent for a child for a day in a child support period as the rate specified in subsection (2) if:

                     (a)  the parent did not receive an income support payment during the last relevant year of income; and

                     (b)  the following amount is less than the pension PP (single) maximum basic amount:

                              (i)  if subparagraph (ii) does not apply—the parent’s adjusted taxable income determined in accordance with section 43 for the last relevant year of income for the child support period;

                             (ii)  if the day occurs in the application period for an income election made by the parent—the amount that applied under subsection 60(2) or (3), or that was worked out under subsection 62A(1); and

                     (c)  the parent does not have at least shared care of the child during the relevant care period.

How much is the annual rate

             (2)  The annual rate of child support payable is $1060.

Note:          The annual rate of child support specified in subsection (2) is indexed under section 153A.

             (3)  The Registrar must not assess the total annual rate of child support payable by a parent under subsection (1) (including any child support that is not actually payable because of subsection 40B(1)) for a day in a child support period as more than 3 times the rate specified in subsection (2).

             (4)  If an annual rate of child support is payable by a parent under subsection (1) (including any child support that is not actually payable because of subsection 40B(1)) for more than 3 children for a day in a child support period, then the annual rate of child support payable by the parent for each child for a day in the child support period is:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00611/Html/32e93191-9edf-40da-82bb-c6a259ae8797_files/image018.gif)

          (4A)  For the purposes of subsection (4), if a parent is liable to pay child support for one or more children under an administrative assessment under the law of a reciprocating jurisdiction, then that child support is taken to be payable by the parent for those children under subsection (1).

Paying the annual rate to more than one person

             (5)  If, (disregarding section 40B) the rate under subsection (2) or (4) would be payable for a child to:

                     (a)  a parent and a non‑parent carer of the child; or

                     (b)  2 non‑parent carers of the child;

then, subject to section 40B, the annual rate of child support for the child worked out under this section is payable in accordance with section 40A.

Note:          Under section 40B, a non‑parent carer of a child is not entitled to be paid child support unless he or she applies under section 25A in relation to the child.

##### <a id="65B"></a>65B  Application for section 65A not to apply

             (1)  If the Registrar makes an assessment of an annual rate of child support payable by a parent for a day in a child support period under section 65A:

                     (a)  the parent may apply to the Registrar for the section not to apply; or

                     (b)  the parent is taken to have applied to the Registrar for the section not to apply if, immediately before the end of the previous child support period, the section did not apply because of a determination under this section.

             (2)  The parent making the application must provide evidence to the Registrar concerning the parent’s income (within the meaning of subsection 66A(4)) to demonstrate that his or her current income is:

                     (a)  less than the pension PP (single) maximum basic amount; and

                     (b)  that it would be unjust and inequitable to expect him or her to pay the amount assessed under this section.

             (3)  An assessment issued by the Commissioner of Taxation for the last relevant year of income shall not be sufficient evidence of the income of the parent for the purposes of this section. 

             (4)  If the parent makes an application, the Registrar may determine in writing that the section not apply to the parent if the parent’s current income (within the meaning of subsection 66A(4)) is less than the pension PP (single) maximum basic amount and it would be unjust and inequitable to expect him or her to pay the amount assessed under this section.

Note:          If the Registrar refuses to grant an application under this section, the Registrar must serve a notice on the applicant under section 66C.

             (5)  The Registrar must specify the day in the child support period on which the section ceases to apply to the parent. The day may be any day from the first day of the child support period on which an annual rate of child support under section 65A became payable by the parent.

##### <a id="66"></a>66  Minimum annual rate of child support

Assessment of annual rate

             (1)  The Registrar must assess the total of the annual rates of child support payable by a parent for all the children in a child support case for a day in a child support period as the minimum annual rate of child support for the child support period if:

                     (a)  the parent does not have at least regular care of at least one of the children in the child support case for the day; and

                     (b)  the total payable by the parent for all the children in the child support case would (apart from this section) be assessed as less than the minimum annual rate of child support for the child support period.

Note:          The Registrar must not make an assessment under this subsection in certain cases (see subsections (2) and (8)).

             (2)  To avoid doubt, the Registrar must not make an assessment in respect of a parent whose annual rate of child support could be assessed under section 65A (low income parents not on income support) unless the Registrar has determined under section 65B that section 65A does not apply.

When assessment applies

             (4)  An assessment in respect of a parent covered by paragraph (1)(b) applies to each day in the period:

                     (a)  beginning on the first day in the child support period on which the total payable by the parent in respect of the child support case would (apart from this section) be assessed as less than the minimum annual rate of child support for the child support period; and

                     (b)  ending:

                              (i)  if the parent would be so assessed until the end of the child support period—at the end of the child support period; or

                             (ii)  otherwise—28 days after the day on which the person would cease to be so assessed (even if that day is after the end of the child support period).

How much is the minimum annual rate

             (5)  The **_minimum annual rate_** **_of child support_** is $320.

Note:          The minimum annual rate of child support specified in subsection (5) is indexed under section 153A.

             (6)  If:

                     (a)  the Registrar makes an assessment in respect of a parent under subsection (1); and

                     (b)  the parent is assessed (whether under subsection (1) or otherwise) for a day in a child support period in respect of the costs of children in more than 3 child support cases;

then the **_annual rate of child support_** payable by the parent for a day in the child support period for a particular child support case is:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00611/Html/32e93191-9edf-40da-82bb-c6a259ae8797_files/image019.gif)

          (6A)  For the purposes of subsection (6), if a parent is liable to pay child support for one or more children for a day under an administrative assessment under the law of a reciprocating jurisdiction, then the parent is taken to be assessed for the day in respect of the costs of children in a child support case.

Paying the minimum annual rate to more than one person for a single child support case

             (7)  If the rate worked out under subsection (5) or (6) is payable by a parent for a child support case to:

                     (a)  the parent of the children to whom the case relates and to one or more non‑parent carers of those children; or

                     (b)  2 or more non‑parent carers of those children;

then:

                     (c)  if 2 or more persons have equal percentages of care of the children, and those percentages are the highest percentages—each of those persons is entitled to be paid an equal proportion of the annual rate of child support that is payable by the parent; and

                     (d)  otherwise—only the person who has the highest percentage of care of the children is entitled to be paid the annual rate of child support that is payable by the parent.

Registrar not to make minimum rate assessment in certain cases

             (8)  The Registrar must not make an assessment under subsection (1) in relation to the child support payable by a parent:

                     (a)  in accordance with a determination made under Part 6A (departure determinations); or

                     (b)  in accordance with an order made under Division 4 of Part 7 (departure orders); or

                     (c)  in accordance with provisions of a child support agreement that have effect, for the purposes of this Part, as if they were such an order made by consent.

Definition of **income support payment**

             (9)  In this Act:

                    <a name="incom-support-payment"></a>**_income support payment_**:

                     (a)  has the meaning given by subsection 23(1) of the _Social Security Act 1991_; and

                     (b)  includes a payment under the ABSTUDY scheme that includes an amount identified as living allowance, being an allowance that is paid at the maximum basic rate.

##### <a id="66A"></a>66A  Registrar may reduce an assessment to nil in certain cases

             (1)  If the Registrar has made an assessment under section 66 in respect of the annual rate of child support payable by a parent for all the children in a child support case for a day in a child support period, the Registrar may, on an application made by the parent that:

                     (a)  is in accordance with the regulations; and

                     (b)  either:

                              (i)  nominates the whole (the **_nominated period_**) of that child support period (if the first day of that child support period is the day referred to in paragraph 66(4)(a)); or

                             (ii)  nominates a part (the **_nominated period_**) of that child support period, being a part that is at least 2 months and that begins on or after the day referred to in paragraph 66(4)(a);

reduce the annual rate of child support payable by the parent for those children for the nominated period to nil. This subsection is subject to subsection (3C).

Note:          If the Registrar refuses to grant an application under this section, the Registrar must serve a notice on the applicant under section 66C.

             (2)  The Registrar must not grant an application under subsection (1) unless the Registrar is satisfied that the amount worked out under subsection (3) is less than the amount worked out under subsection (3A).

          (2A)  For the purposes of subsection (2), a parent is taken to have a child support case if the parent is liable to pay child support for one or more children under an administrative assessment under the law of a reciprocating jurisdiction.

             (3)  The amount for the purposes of this subsection is:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00611/Html/32e93191-9edf-40da-82bb-c6a259ae8797_files/image020.gif)

          (3B)  For the purposes of subsection (3A), a parent is taken to have a child support case if the parent is liable to pay child support for one or more children under an administrative assessment under the law of a reciprocating jurisdiction.

          (3C)  A reduction under subsection (1) has no effect in relation to a day to which the assessment under section 66 does not apply.

Note:          Subsection 66(4) deals with when an assessment under section 66 applies.

             (4)  In this section:

                    <a name="incom"></a>**_income_**, in relation to a person, means:

                     (a)  any money earned, derived or received by the parent for his or her own use or benefit, other than money earned, derived or received in a manner, or from a source, prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph; or

                     (b)  a periodical payment by way of a gift or allowance, other than a payment of a kind prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph.

##### <a id="66B"></a>66B  Amendment of assessment made under section 65B or 66A

                   The Registrar may amend an assessment at any time if:

                     (a)  either:

                              (i)  under section 65B, the Registrar has determined that section 65A does not apply to a parent; or

                     (b)  the Registrar becomes satisfied that the parent does not satisfy the condition in subsection 65B(4) or 66A(2) (as the case requires).

##### <a id="66C"></a>66C  Notice to be given to unsuccessful applicant

             (1)  If the Registrar refuses to grant an application under section 65B or 66A, or amends an assessment in accordance with section 66B, the Registrar must serve written notice of the decision on the parent.

             (2)  The notice must include, or be accompanied by, a statement to the effect:

                     (a)  that the parent may, subject to the Registration and Collection Act, object to the particulars of:

                              (i)  the assessment in relation to which the unsuccessful application was made; or

                             (ii)  the assessment that was amended;

                            (as the case requires); and

             (3)  A contravention of subsection (2) in relation to a decision does not affect the validity of the decision.

#### Subdivision C—Making administrative assessments

##### <a id="66D"></a>66D  How assessment is to be made

                   In making an administrative assessment, the Registrar may act on the basis of the documents and information in his or her possession, and is not required to conduct any inquiries or investigations into the matter or to require (whether under this Act  or otherwise) the giving of any information or the production of any document.

##### <a id="67"></a>67  Assessment to relate to all children for whom child support is payable by parent

             (1)  If child support is payable by a parent to a person for 2 or more children for a day in a child support period, any administrative assessment of the child support payable by the parent in relation to the day is to relate to all of the children and not to any of the children separately.

             (2)  Subsection (1) applies whether or not the child support is payable because of:

                     (a)  the acceptance by the Registrar of 2 or more separate applications for administrative assessment made otherwise than in the same form; or

                     (b)  the acceptance by the Registrar of 2 or more child support agreements made otherwise than in the same document; or

                     (c)  the acceptance by the Registrar of an application for administrative assessment and of an application for acceptance of a child support agreement.

             (3)  Subsection (1) does not require a single administrative assessment to be made of the child support payable by a parent to 2 or more other persons.

##### <a id="67A"></a>67A  Offsetting of child support liabilities

                   The annual rate of child support that would, apart from this section, be payable for a child or children in a child support case, for a day in a child support period, by one parent to the other parent is to be reduced (but not below nil) by the annual rate of child support that would, apart from this section, be payable to that parent in relation to that day by the other parent for the child or the children in the child support case.

##### <a id="68"></a>68  Assessment to relate to whole or part of single child support period

             (1)  An administrative assessment of child support is to relate to all the days, or some of the days, of a single child support period.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not prevent a single notice of assessment under section 76 dealing with more than one administrative assessment.

##### <a id="69"></a>69  Conversion of annual rates into daily rates of payment

                   If the Registrar assesses the annual rate of child support payable by a parent for a child or children in a child support case, for a day in a child support period, the Registrar must, in accordance with the regulations, convert that annual rate into a daily rate and specify both the annual and daily rates in the notice of assessment given under section 76 in relation to the assessment.

##### <a id="70"></a>70  Evidence relating to assessments

             (1)  The production of a notice of administrative assessment, or of a document signed by the Registrar that appears to be a copy of a notice of administrative assessment, is prima facie evidence of:

                     (a)  the proper making of the assessment; and

                     (b)  except in proceedings under Part VIIA, or under Subdivision B of Division 3 of Part VIII, of the Registration and Collection Act on an appeal relating to the assessment, that all the particulars of the notice of assessment are correct.

             (2)  The production of a document signed by the Registrar that appears to be a copy of, or an extract from, any return or notice of administrative assessment is evidence of the matters in the document to the same extent as the original would be if it were produced.

##### <a id="71"></a>71  Assessment for part of a child support period

                   In making an administrative assessment of the annual rate of child support payable for days in a period (the **_part period_**) that is not a whole child support period, the Registrar may apply this Act as if the beginning and end of the part period were the beginning and end respectively of a child support period.

##### <a id="72"></a>72  Validity of assessments

                   Except in an appeal under Part VIIA, or under Subdivision B of Division 3 of Part VIII, of the Registration and Collection Act, the validity of an assessment is not affected because any of the provisions of this Act have not been complied with.

##### <a id="73"></a>73  Assumptions as to future events

                   In assessing the annual rate at which child support is payable for a day in the future, the Registrar may act on the assumption that the state of affairs known to the Registrar at the time the assessment is made will remain unchanged on that day.

##### <a id="73A"></a>73A  Registrar becoming aware of relevant dependent child

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  an administrative assessment of child support is in force in relation to a parent; and

                     (b)  the Registrar is later notified, or otherwise becomes aware, of the fact that the parent has a relevant dependent child who was not taken into account for the purposes of making the assessment;

then, for the purposes of working out the parent’s relevant dependent child amount under section 46, the parent is taken to have the relevant dependent child:

                     (c)  if the Registrar was notified, or otherwise became aware, of the fact that the child is a relevant dependent child of the parent within 28 days after the day on which the child became such a child—on and from the day the child became such a child; or

                     (d)  if paragraph (c) does not apply and the Registrar was notified, or otherwise became aware, of the fact within 28 days after giving a notice under section 34 (giving notice of successful application)—on and from the day on which the application was made; or

                     (e)  if neither paragraph (c) nor (d) applies—on and from the day the Registrar was notified, or otherwise became aware, of the fact that the child is a relevant dependent child of the parent.

             (2)  If the parent is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction, subsection (1) has effect as if the references in paragraphs (1)(c) and (d) to 28 days were references to 90 days.

##### <a id="74"></a>74   Registrar to give effect to happening of child support terminating events etc.

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  child support is payable for a child; and

                     (b)  the Registrar is notified of, or otherwise becomes aware of:

                              (i)  the happening of a child support terminating event in relation to the child, a liable parent, or a carer entitled to child support, or all 3; or

                             (ii)  the happening of an event or change of circumstances that affects the annual rate at which the child support is payable under this Act;

the Registrar must immediately take such action as is necessary to take account of the happening of the event or change of circumstances (whether by amending any administrative assessment or otherwise).

             (2)  Nothing in subsection (1) is to be taken to prevent the Registrar from taking such action as the Registrar considers appropriate to take account of the likely happening of an event or change of circumstances of which the Registrar is notified or otherwise becomes aware (whether by amending any administrative assessment or otherwise).

##### <a id="74A"></a>74A  Date of effect of change in care

                   If:

                     (a)  child support is payable for a child; and

                     (b)  a determination of a responsible person’s percentage of care for the child is revoked; and

                   (ba)  another such determination (the **_later determination_**) is made in relation to the responsible person; and

                     (c)  as a result, the Registrar amends an administrative assessment under section 75 to alter the annual rate at which the child support is payable for the child;

the altered annual rate is to apply on and from the first day in a child support period to which the responsible person’s percentage of care under the later determination applies.

Note:          If the Registrar becomes aware of a relevant dependent child who was not taken into account for the purposes of making an assessment, the Registrar must take action in accordance with section 73A.

##### <a id="75"></a>75  Amendment of assessments

             (1)  The Registrar may, at any time, amend any administrative assessment by making such alterations and additions as the Registrar considers necessary to give effect to this Act or the Registration and Collection Act.

             (2)  However, if the amendment relates to a responsible person’s percentage of care for a child, the Registrar must not amend an administrative assessment unless:

                     (a)  the amendment relating to the responsible person’s percentage of care for the child would cause the person’s cost percentage for the child to change; or

                     (d)  the child is a relevant dependent child and the Registrar has become aware that the child was not taken into account for the purpose of making the assessment.

             (3)  Subsection (1) has effect despite the fact that:

                     (a)  child support has been paid under the administrative assessment; or

                     (b)  the child support period, or the part of the child support period, to which the administrative assessment relates has ended; or

                     (c)  proceedings are pending in a court having jurisdiction under this Act or the Registration and Collection Act, or in the SSAT, against or in relation to the administrative assessment.

             (4)  Without limiting subsection (1), the Registrar may amend any administrative assessment for the purpose of:

                     (a)  correcting any error or mistake (whether or not made by the Registrar); or

                     (b)  correcting the effect of any false or misleading statement made to the Registrar; or

                     (c)  giving effect to the happening of a child support terminating event in relation to a child, the liable parent, the carer entitled to child support, or all 3; or

                     (d)  giving effect to the happening of an event or change of circumstances that, under this Act or the Registration and Collection Act, affects the annual rate at which child support is or was payable; or

                     (e)  giving effect to the acceptance of a child support agreement by the Registrar; or

                      (f)  giving effect to a decision or order of a court having jurisdiction under this Act or the Registration and Collection Act, or of the SSAT.

             (5)  Where a provision of this Act or the Registration and Collection Act expressly authorises the Registrar to amend an administrative assessment, that provision does not by implication limit the power of the Registrar (whether under this section or otherwise) to amend the assessment.

             (6)  Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Act or the Registration and Collection Act, every amended administrative assessment is to be taken to be an administrative assessment for all the purposes of this Act and the Registration and Collection Act.

##### <a id="76"></a>76  Notice of assessment to be given

             (1)  When the Registrar makes an administrative assessment, the Registrar must immediately give written notice of the assessment to the liable parent and the carer entitled to child support.

             (2)  The notice must (in addition to specifying the matters that section 69 (daily rate conversion) requires to be specified in the notice) specify at least the following matters:

                     (a)  the adjusted taxable income, and child support income, of any parent (the **_assessed parent_**) who was assessed in respect of the costs of the children in the child support case to which the assessment relates;

                     (b)  the names and dates of birth of those children;

                     (c)  the number and age ranges of the relevant dependent children (if any) of an assessed parent;

                     (d)  the number and age ranges of the other children in other child support cases (if any) of an assessed parent;

                     (e)  an assessed parent’s, and non‑parent carer’s, percentage of care for each child in the child support case to which the assessment relates;

                     (g)  the costs of each child in the child support case to which the assessment relates;

                    (ga)  if a child support agreement includes lump sum payment provisions, or if a court has made an order under section 123A, in respect of the children in the child support case to which the assessment relates:

                              (i)  the amount of the lump sum payment specified in the agreement or order; and

                             (ii)  the amount of any remaining lump sum payment (within the meaning of the Registration and Collection Act); and

                            (iii)  any annual rate and daily rate of child support that remains payable under section 78 of this Act after taking into account any remaining lump sum payment that will be credited under section 69A of the Registration and Collection Act;

                     (h)  such other matters as are prescribed.

       (2AA)  For the purposes of paragraph (2)(d), a parent is taken to have a child support case if the parent is liable to pay child support for one or more children under an administrative assessment under the law of a reciprocating jurisdiction.

          (2A)  Despite subsection (2), if an administrative assessment is affected either:

                     (a)  by an order made by a court under Division 4 of Part 7; or

                     (b)  by the provisions of a child support agreement;

the Registrar is not required to specify any matter referred to in that subsection that is not relevant to the making of the assessment.

             (3)  The notice must also include, or be accompanied by, statements of the following kinds:

                     (a)  a statement that specifically draws the attention of the liable parent and the carer entitled to child support to the right:

                              (i)  to object, subject to the Registration and Collection Act, to particulars of the assessment; and

                             (ii)  if aggrieved by the decision on an objection to particulars of the assessment (no matter who lodges the objection but subject to that Act), to apply to the SSAT for review of the decision;

                     (b)  a statement that specifically draws the attention of the liable parent and the carer entitled to child support to the right, if aggrieved by a decision of the SSAT in relation to the percentage of care of the liable parent or the carer entitled to child support, to apply to the AAT for review of the decision;

                     (c)  a statement that specifically draws the attention of the liable parent and the carer entitled to child support to the right to apply to the Registrar for a determination under Part 6A having the effect that the provisions of this Act relating to administrative assessment of child support will be departed from in relation to a child in the special circumstances of the case;

                    (ca)  a statement that specifically draws the attention of the liable parent and the carer entitled to child support to the right to apply to a court having jurisdiction under this Act for an order under section 123A that the liable parent provide child support for the child in the form of a lump sum payment to be credited against the amount payable under the liability of the liable parent under any relevant administrative assessment;

                     (d)  a statement that specifically draws the attention of the liable parent and the carer entitled to child support to the right, subject to the _Family Law Act 1975_, to apply to a court having jurisdiction under this Act for an order under section 124 that a parent provide child support for the child otherwise than in the form of periodic amounts.

### Division 9—Liability to pay child support as assessed

##### <a id="76A"></a>76A  Simplified outline

                   The following is a simplified outline of this Division:

* * *

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      The amount of child support

payable for a child or children for a day in a child support period is the

daily rate specified in the notice of assessment.</li>

* * *

##### <a id="77"></a>77  Effect of assessment

             (1)  This section applies if the Registrar:

                     (a)  assesses the annual rate of child support payable for a child or children in a child support case, for a day in a child support period, by a liable parent to a carer entitled to child support; and

                     (b)  converts the annual rate into a daily rate and specifies both rates in a notice of assessment given under section 76 in relation to the assessment.

             (2)  Child support is payable for the child or children  by the liable parent to the carer entitled to child support for each day in the child support period.

             (3)  The amount of child support payable for the child or children for the day by the liable parent to the carer entitled to child support is the amount of the daily rate specified in the notice of assessment.

##### <a id="78"></a>78  When amounts of child support due and payable

             (1)  An amount of child support payable by a liable parent in relation to a day in any calendar month is due and payable on the later of the following days:

                     (a)  the seventh day of the following calendar month;

                     (b)  the 30th day after the liable parent was given a notice of assessment under section 76 specifying the annual and daily rates of child support in relation to that day.

Note:          Section 66 of the Registration and Collection Act deals with when child support debts become due and payable.

             (2)  An amount payable under subsection (1), in relation to a day in a calendar month in a year of income, is taken to be paid at the time that the amount becomes due and payable, to the extent that a remaining lump sum payment will be credited, under section 69A of the Registration and Collection Act, at the end of the year of income against that amount.

##### <a id="79"></a>79  Recovery of amounts of child support

                   An amount of child support due and payable by a liable parent to a carer entitled to child support is a debt due and payable by the liable parent to the carer, and may be sued for and recovered in:

                     (a)  a court having jurisdiction for the recovery of debts up to the amount of the child support; or

                     (b)  a court having jurisdiction under this Act.

Note:          Amounts covered by section 30 of the Registration and Collection Act are debts due to the Commonwealth.

## Part 6—Consent arrangements

### Division 1—Preliminary

##### <a id="80A"></a>80A  Simplified outline

                   The following is a simplified outline of this Part:

* * *

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      Parents (and non‑parent

carers) of a child can, using a child support agreement, agree between

themselves the child support that is to be payable for the child.</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      There are 2 sorts of

agreements. The first is a binding child support agreement. Each party to the

agreement must have received legal advice before entering the agreement, and

must also receive legal advice before terminating the agreement.</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      The second sort of

agreement is a limited child support agreement. An administrative assessment

must be in place before a limited child support agreement can be accepted by

the Registrar. The annual rate of child support payable under the agreement

must be at least the annual rate of child support otherwise payable under this

Act.</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      Agreements may include

provisions that state that child support is to be payable otherwise than in the

form of periodic amounts. There are 2 main kinds of such provisions:</li>

               (a)     non‑periodic payment provisions, under which lump sum payments and other non‑periodic payments (such as school fees) may be made; and

              (b)     lump sum payment provisions, under which lump sum payments may be made.

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      Payments made under non‑periodic

payment provisions reduce the annual rate of child support payable.</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      Payments made under lump

sum payment provisions are credited against the amount payable under the

liability of a party to the agreement (rather than reducing the annual rate of

child support payable).</li>

##### <a id="80B"></a>80B  Cases in relation to which Part applies

                   This Part applies where the parents of an eligible child, or a parent or the parents of an eligible child and a non‑parent carer of the child, want to give effect to an agreement between themselves in relation to child support payable for the child.

### Division 1A—Binding and limited child support agreements

##### <a id="80D"></a>80D  Terminating binding child support agreements

             (1)  A binding child support agreement (the **_previous agreement_**) may be terminated only by:

                     (b)  the parties to the previous agreement making a written agreement (a **_termination agreement_**):

                              (i)  that is binding on the parties in accordance with subsection (2); and

                             (ii)  to the effect that the agreement is terminated; or

                     (c)  a court order setting aside the previous agreement under section 136.

             (2)  For the purposes of subparagraph (1)(b)(i), an agreement is binding on the parties if, and only if:

                              (i)  if the new binding child support agreement specifies a day on which it takes effect—that day;

                             (ii)  otherwise—the day on which the new binding child support agreement is signed; and

                     (b)  if paragraph (1)(b) applies—on the day set out in the following paragraph:

                              (i)  if the termination agreement specifies a day on which it takes effect—that day;

                             (ii)  otherwise—the day on which the termination agreement is signed; and

                     (c)  if paragraph (1)(c) applies—on the day on which the court order takes effect.

#### Subdivision B—Limited child support agreements

##### <a id="80E"></a>80E  Making limited child support agreements

             (1)  An agreement is a **_limited child support agreement_** if:

                     (a)  it is in writing; and

                     (b)  it is signed by the parties to the agreement; and

                     (c)  it complies with subsection 81(2); and

                     (d)  either:

                              (i)  it meets the conditions in subsection (2), (3) or (4), as the case requires, (assuming the agreement is accepted by the Registrar); or

                             (ii)  it has been accepted by the Registrar under section 98U.

Note:          In addition to the requirements in this section, there must be an administrative assessment in force in relation to the child in respect of whom the agreement is made (see subsection 92(3)).

Child support payable on day application for acceptance of agreement is made to Registrar

             (2)  An agreement meets the condition in this subsection if:

                     (a)  child support is to be payable under the agreement, by one party to the agreement to the other party or parties, on the day on which the application is made to the Registrar for acceptance of the agreement; and

                     (b)  the annual rate of child support that is so payable under the agreement on that day is at least the annual rate of child support that would otherwise be payable under this Act on that day.

Note:          If the child support payable under the agreement is not a periodic amount, the regulations can prescribe the method by which that amount is to be converted into an annual rate (see subsection (5)).

Child support payable on day agreement commences

             (3)  An agreement meets the condition in this subsection if:

                     (a)  child support is not to be payable under the agreement, by one party to the agreement to the other party or parties, on the day on which the application is made to the Registrar for acceptance of the agreement; but

             (4)  An agreement meets the condition in this subsection if:

                     (a)  child support is payable under the agreement, by one party to the agreement to the other party or parties, for a period before the day on which the application is made to the Registrar for acceptance of the agreement; and

                     (b)  the amount of child support that is so payable under the agreement for that period is at least the amount of child support that would otherwise be payable under this Act for that period.

Regulations

             (5)  The regulations may, for the purposes of subsections (2), (3) and (4), provide a method of converting an amount of child support that is payable under an agreement otherwise than in the form of periodic amounts into an annual rate of child support.

##### <a id="80F"></a>80F  No variation of limited child support agreements

             (1)  A limited child support agreement must not be varied.

Note:          A limited child support agreement can be terminated and replaced with a new limited child support agreement.

             (2)  However, subsection (1) does not prevent a limited child support agreement between parties from incorporating by reference the provisions of a previous child support agreement between the parties.

##### <a id="80G"></a>80G  Terminating limited child support agreements

             (1)  A limited child support agreement (the **_previous agreement_**) may be terminated only by:

                     (a)  a provision being included in:

                              (i)  a new limited child support agreement made by the parties to the previous agreement; or

                             (ii)  a binding child support agreement made by the parties to the previous agreement;

                            to the effect that the previous agreement is terminated; or

                     (b)  the parties to the previous agreement making a written agreement that is signed by those parties to the effect that the previous agreement is terminated; or

                     (c)  a court order setting aside the previous agreement under section 136; or

                     (e)  if the previous agreement was made 3 or more years earlier—a party to the previous agreement giving the Registrar written  notice of the termination of the previous agreement.

          (1A)  If the parent is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction, subsection (1) has effect as if the reference in paragraph (1)(d) to 60 days were a reference to 90 days.

                     (b)  if paragraph (1)(b) applies—on the day set out in the following paragraph:

                              (i)  if the written agreement specifies a day on which it takes effect—that day;

### Division 2—Child support agreement requirements

##### <a id="81"></a>81  _Child support agreement_ definition and general requirement

             (1)  An agreement is a **_child support agreement_** if:

                     (a)  the agreement is a binding child support agreement; or

                     (b)  the agreement is a limited child support agreement.

Note:          For the definitions of **_binding child support agreement_** and **_limited child support agreement_**, see sections 80C and 80E.

             (2)  An agreement is a binding child support agreement or a limited child support agreement if it complies with the following provisions:

                     (a)  section 82 (children in relation to whom agreements may be made);

                     (b)  section 83 (persons who may be parties to agreements);

                     (c)  section 84 (provisions that may be included in agreements).

Note:          A parenting plan under the _Family Law Act 1975_ may, subject to the requirements of this Division, be a child support agreement.

##### <a id="82"></a>82  Children in relation to whom agreements may be made

             (1)  An agreement is a child support agreement only if it is made in relation to a child in relation to whom an application for administrative assessment is, under section 24, entitled to be made on the day the agreement is entered into.

             (2)  If the agreement is also made in relation to another child in relation to whom subsection (1) does not apply, the other child is to be disregarded for the purposes of this Act.

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not affect the operation of the agreement in relation to the other child for any other purpose.

##### <a id="83"></a>83  Persons who may be parties to agreements

             (1)  An agreement is a child support agreement only if it is made between:

                     (a)  2 parents of a child who, under section 25, would be able to properly make an application for administrative assessment of child support for the child in relation to whom the agreement is made on the day on which the agreement is entered into; or

                     (b)  one or both parents of a child, and a non‑parent carer of the child, who, under sections 25 and 25A, would be able to properly make an application for administrative assessment of child support for the child in relation to whom the agreement is made on the day on which the agreement is entered into.

             (2)  If there is a party to the agreement in relation to whom subsection (1) does not apply, that party is to be disregarded for the purposes of this Act.

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not affect the operation of the agreement in relation to that party for any other purpose.

##### <a id="84"></a>84  Provisions that may be included in agreements

Provisions that may be included

             (1)  An agreement is a child support agreement only if it includes one or more of the following kinds of provisions:

                     (a)  provisions under which a party is to pay child support for a child to another party in the form of periodic amounts paid to the other party;

                     (b)  provisions under which the rate at which a party is already liable to pay child support for a child to another party in the form of periodic amounts paid to the other party is varied;

                     (c)  provisions agreeing between parties any other matter that may be included in an order made by a court under Division 4 of Part 7 (departure orders);

                     (d)  provisions (the **_non‑periodic payment provisions_**) that state:

                              (i)  that a party (the **_liable party_**) is to provide child support for a child to another party otherwise than in the form of periodic amounts; and

                             (ii)  that the annual rate of child support payable for the child by the liable party under any relevant administrative assessment is to be reduced, in the manner specified under subsection (6), by the amount of child support to be provided by the liable party;

                     (e)  provisions (the **_lump sum payment provisions_**) that meet the requirements of subsection (7) and that state:

                              (i)  that a party (the **_liable party_**) is to provide child support for a child to another party in the form of a lump sum payment (including by way of transfer or settlement of property); and

                             (ii)  that the lump sum payment is to be credited against the amount payable under the liable party’s liability under the relevant administrative assessment;

                      (f)  provisions under which a party is to provide child support for a child to another party otherwise than in the form of periodic amounts and that are not non‑periodic payment provisions or lump sum payment provisions;

                     (g)  provisions under which the liability of a party to pay or provide child support for a child to another party is to end from a specified day.

             (2)  The agreement may include more than one kind of provision in relation to different parts of a child support period and different child support periods.

Other kinds of provisions not to have effect

             (3)  If the agreement also includes provisions of a kind not referred to in subsection (1), those provisions do not have effect for the purposes of this Act.

             (4)  Subsection (3) does not affect the operation of provisions of the kind referred to in that subsection for any other purpose.

Agreement may also be parenting plan, maintenance agreement or financial agreement

             (5)  Without limiting subsection (4), nothing in this Part is to be taken to prevent the same document being both a child support agreement and:

                     (a)  a parenting plan; or

                     (b)  a maintenance agreement or financial agreement under the _Family Law Act 1975_; or

                     (c)  a Part VIIIAB financial agreement (within the meaning of that Act).

Additional requirements of agreements with non‑periodic payment provisions

             (6)  If an agreement includes provisions of the kind referred to in paragraph (1)(d), the statement referred to in subparagraph (1)(d)(ii) must specify either:

                     (a)  that the annual rate of child support payable under the administrative assessment is to be reduced by a specified amount that represents an annual value of the child support payable; or

                     (b)  that the annual rate of child support payable under the administrative assessment is to be reduced by 100% or another specified percentage that is less than 100%.

Note:          Non‑periodic payment provisions are taken to have effect as if they were a statement made by a court under section 125 in an order made under section 124 (see subsection 95(3)).

Additional requirements etc. of agreements with lump sum payment provisions

             (7)  If an agreement includes provisions of the kind referred to in paragraph (1)(e), the provisions meet the requirements of this subsection if:

                     (a)  the agreement is a binding child support agreement; and

                     (b)  an administrative assessment, in relation to the child in respect of whom the agreement is made, is in force immediately before the application for acceptance of the agreement is made; and

                     (c)  the amount of the lump sum payment:

                              (i)  is specified in the agreement; and

                             (ii)  equals or exceeds the annual rate of child support payable for the child under the administrative assessment.

Note:          If an agreement includes provisions of the kind referred to in paragraph (1)(e) (lump sum payment provisions), the lump sum payment is credited under section 69A of the Registration and Collection Act against the amount payable under the liable party’s liability (rather than reducing the annual rate of child support payable under the administrative assessment).

             (8)  An agreement that includes lump sum payment provisions may also state that the lump sum payment is to be credited against 100%, or another specified percentage that is less than 100%, of the amount payable under the liability.

Note:          If an agreement does not specify a percentage, the lump sum payment is credited against 100% of the amount payable under the liability (see section 69A of the Registration and Collection Act).

##### <a id="87"></a>87  Agreement may be made in relation to 2 or more children etc.

             (1)  If an agreement is made in the same document in relation to 2 or more children, the document may be treated as if it contained separate agreements for each of the children.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  agreement is made in the same document in relation to a child or 2 or more children; and

                     (b)  child support is to be payable to or by 2 or more parties to the agreement for the child or any of the children;

the document may be treated as if it contained separate agreements made in relation to the child or each of the children by each of the parties to or by whom child support is to be payable.

### Division 3—Applications to Registrar for acceptance of child support agreements

##### <a id="88"></a>88  Application requirements generally

                   An application for acceptance by the Registrar of an agreement made in relation to a child is properly made if:

                     (a)  either:

                              (i)  the agreement is a child support agreement; or

                             (ii)  the agreement is a termination agreement or a written agreement referred to in paragraph 80G(1)(b); and

                     (b)  the application complies with section 89.

##### <a id="89"></a>89  Formal requirement for applications

                   An application for acceptance by the Registrar of an agreement made in relation to a child must be made in the manner specified by the Registrar.

Note:          Section 150A provides for the Registrar to specify the manner in which an application may be made.

##### <a id="90"></a>90  Application for 2 or more separate agreements may be made in same form

                   If application is made in the same form for acceptance of 2 or more agreements made in relation to a child or 2 or more children (whether or not the agreements have been made in the same document), the form may be treated as if it contained separate applications for each of the agreements.

### Division 4—Decisions on applications

##### <a id="91"></a>91  How decision is to be made

                   In determining whether an agreement made in relation to a child is an agreement referred to in paragraph 88(a), the Registrar may act on the basis of the application made to the Registrar for acceptance of the agreement, the documents accompanying the application and the agreement itself, and is not required to conduct any inquiries or investigations into the matter.

##### <a id="92"></a>92  Decision on application

             (1)  Subject to this section, if the Registrar is satisfied that an application made to the Registrar for acceptance of an agreement made in relation to a child has been properly made, the Registrar must accept the agreement.

             (2)  If the Registrar is not so satisfied, the Registrar may refuse to accept the agreement.

             (3)  The Registrar must refuse to accept a limited child support agreement if, immediately before the application for acceptance of the agreement is made, no administrative assessment is in force in relation to the child.

             (5)  The Registrar must refuse to accept the agreement if:

                     (a)  immediately before the application is made, an administrative assessment is in force in relation to the child and the 2 parties to the agreement; and

                     (b)  the application for administrative assessment was made, in accordance with paragraph 29B(1)(b), by an overseas authority of a reciprocating jurisdiction on behalf of the one of the parties to the agreement; and

                     (d)  the overseas authority does not approve the acceptance of the agreement.

##### <a id="93"></a>93  Liability to pay child support arises on acceptance of application where child support not already payable etc.

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  the Registrar accepts a child support agreement made in relation to a child; and

                     (b)  either:

                              (i)  child support is not already payable for the child; or

                             (ii)  child support is already payable by a person to another person for the child, but child support is to be paid or provided under agreement for the child otherwise than by the first‑mentioned person to the other person;

then:

                     (c)  the acceptance of the agreement by the Registrar has the same effect (as provided by this section) as the acceptance by the Registrar of an application for administrative assessment of child support for the child; and

                     (d)  a person to whom child support is to be paid or provided under the agreement is a **_carer entitled to child support_** in relation to the child; and

                     (e)  a person by whom child support is to be paid or provided under the agreement to the carer entitled to child support is a **_liable parent_** in relation to the child and the carer entitled to child support; and

                      (f)  child support is payable for the child by the liable parent to the carer entitled to child support; and

                     (g)  the child support is payable from the day on which the application was made to the Registrar for acceptance of the agreement; and

                     (h)  the child support is payable until the earlier of the following days:

                              (i)  the day immediately before the day on which a child support terminating event happens in relation to the child, the carer entitled to child support, the liable parent or all 3 of them;

                             (ii)  the day on which the agreement is terminated under section 80D or 80G.

             (2)  The Registrar must assess under this Act the annual rate of the child support payable by the liable parent to the carer entitled to the child support for the child for the days in the child support period that starts on the day on which the application was made to the Registrar for acceptance of the agreement. The Registrar must do so as quickly as practicable.

Note 1:       The Registrar must assess, under section 34B, the annual rate of child support payable under an agreement if an annual rate of child support is already payable and the agreement is to affect that annual rate.

Note 2:       If the Registrar makes an assessment under this section, the Registrar must make a provisional notional assessment under section 146B.

             (3)  In making any administrative assessment in relation to the child, the carer entitled to child support and the liable parent, the Registrar must act in accordance with section 95 (Effect of certain provisions of accepted child support agreements).

##### <a id="94"></a>94  Registrar to take action to give effect to accepted child support agreement or termination agreement etc.

             (1)  After the Registrar accepts a child support agreement made in relation to a child, the Registrar must immediately take such further action (if any) as is necessary to give effect to the agreement _._

Note:          After accepting the agreement, section 34B or 93 or Part 5 might require the Registrar to assess an annual rate of child support payable.

             (2)  In making any administrative assessment in relation to the child, the Registrar must act in accordance with section 95 (effect of certain provisions of accepted child support agreements).

             (3)  After the Registrar accepts a termination agreement, or a written agreement referred to in paragraph 80G(1)(b), the Registrar must immediately take such further action (if any) as is necessary to give effect to the agreement _._

##### <a id="95"></a>95  Effect of certain provisions of accepted child support agreements

             (1)  This section applies in relation to a child support agreement that has been accepted by the Registrar.

             (2)  If the agreement includes:

                     (a)  provisions under which a party is to pay child support for a child to another party in the form of periodic amounts paid to the other party; or

                     (b)  provisions under which the rate at which a party is already liable to pay child support for a child to another party in the form of periodic amounts paid to the other party is varied; or

                     (c)  provisions agreeing between parties any other matter that may be included in an order made by a court under Division 4 of Part 7 (Orders for departure from administrative assessment in special circumstances);

the provisions have effect, for the purposes of Part 5, as if they were an order made by consent by a court under Division 4 of Part 7.

             (3)  If the agreement includes non‑periodic payment provisions:

                     (a)  the provisions have effect, for the purposes of this Act, as if they were a statement made by a court under section 125 in an order made under section 124; and

                     (b)  if the provisions or the agreement is registered in a court having jurisdiction under Part VII of the _Family Law Act 1975_—Division 13A of Part VII, and Parts XIII and XIIIB, of that Act apply in relation to the provisions as if the provisions were an order made by the court under Part VII of that Act.

Note 1:       The effect of paragraph (3)(a) is that the Registrar must make any subsequent administrative assessment on the basis of the annual rate of child support as reduced by the amount or percentage specified in the child support agreement (see section 127).

Note 2:       This section does not deal with lump sum payment provisions (see paragraph 84(1)(e) of this Act and section 69A of the Registration and Collection Act).

             (5)  The provisions of the agreement have effect despite any inconsistency with a court order made before the agreement was entered into.

             (6)  Where any difficulty arises in the application of this section in or in relation to a particular proceeding, the court exercising jurisdiction in the proceeding may, on the application of a party to the proceeding or of its own motion, give such directions, and make such orders, as it considers appropriate to resolve the difficulty.

### Division 5—Notice of the decision

##### <a id="96"></a>96  Notice of decision to be given

             (1)  If the Registrar accepts or refuses to accept an agreement made in relation to a child, the Registrar must immediately notify each party to the agreement of the decision.

             (2)  The notice must include, or be accompanied by, a statement that specifically draws the attention of the parties to the agreement to the right:

                     (a)  to object, subject to the Registration and Collection Act, to the decision (the **_original decision_**); and

                     (b)  if aggrieved by a later decision on an objection to the original decision (no matter who lodges the objection but subject to that Act), to apply to the SSAT for review of the later decision.

             (3)  A contravention of subsection (2) in relation to a decision does not affect the validity of the decision.

             (4)  If a child support agreement includes lump sum payment provisions, the notice must specify:

                     (a)  the amount of the lump sum payment specified in the agreement; and

                     (b)  any annual rate and daily rate of child support that remains payable after taking into account any remaining lump sum payment (within the meaning of the Registration and Collection Act) that will be credited under section 69A of that Act.

                     (a)  the liable parent concerned; or

                     (b)  the carer entitled to child support concerned;

is of the view that, because of special circumstances that exist, the provisions of this Act relating to administrative assessment of child support should be departed from in relation to the child, the liable parent or carer may, by written application, ask the Registrar to make a determination under this Part.

Note 1:       For the determinations that the Registrar may make under this Part see section 98S.

Note 2:       The Registrar may only make a determination under this Part in respect of a day that is more than 18 months earlier than the day on which the relevant application is made with a court’s leave under section 112 (see subsection 98S(3B)).

                                        (A)  just and equitable as regards the child, the liable parent, and the carer entitled to child support; and 

                                        (B)  otherwise proper;

                     (b)  subparagraph 117(2)(b)(ib) has effect subject to subsections 117(3A) to (3C).

             (3)  Subsections 117(4) to (9) (inclusive) apply to the Registrar in the exercise of his or her powers under this Division as if:

                     (a)  any reference in those subsections to the court were a reference to the Registrar; and

                     (b)  any reference to an order were a reference to a determination.

                     (b)  recommend that application be made to a court having jurisdiction under this Act for an order under Division 4 of Part 7.

##### <a id="98F"></a>98F  Application disclosing no grounds etc. for making determination—how dealt with

                   If the Registrar is satisfied, after considering the application, that:

                     (a)  there are no grounds for departing from the provisions of this Act relating to administrative assessment of child support in relation to the child concerned; or

                     (b)  that it would not be:

                              (i)  just or equitable as regards the child or either party to the application; or

                             (ii)  otherwise proper;

                            to make the determination;

the Registrar may refuse to make the determination without taking any further action under this Part.

##### <a id="98G"></a>98G  Other party to be notified

                     (a)  may act on the basis of:

                              (i)  the application and the documents accompanying it; and

                             (ii)  if action has been taken under section 98G—the reply (if any) to the application and the documents (if any) accompanying it; and

                     (b)  may, but is not required to, conduct any inquiry or investigation into the matter.

##### <a id="98K"></a>98K  Registrar may initiate a determination under this Part

             (1)  If, at any time when an administrative assessment is in force in relation to a child, the Registrar is of the view that, because of special circumstances that exist, the provisions of this Act relating to administrative assessment of child support should be departed from in relation to the child, the Registrar may make a determination under this Part.

Note 1:       For the determinations that the Registrar may make under this Part see section 98S.

##### <a id="98L"></a>98L  Matters as to which Registrar must be satisfied before making determination

             (1)  Subject to this Part, the Registrar may make the determination if:

                     (a)  the Registrar is satisfied that, in the special circumstances of the case, application in relation to a child of the provisions of this Act relating to administrative assessment of child support would result in an unjust and inequitable determination of the level of financial support to be provided by the liable parent for the child because of the income, earning capacity, property and financial resources of either parent; and

                     (b)  that it would be: 

                              (i)  just and equitable as regards the child, the liable parent, and the carer entitled to child support; and 

                             (ii)  otherwise proper;

to make a particular determination under this Part.

             (2)  Subsections 117(4) to (9) (inclusive) apply to the Registrar in the exercise of his or her powers under this section as if:

                     (e)  a determination that:

                              (i)  the column in the Costs of the Children Table that covers a parent’s child support income or combined child support income that is, or is determined to be, greater than 2.5 times the annualised MTAWE figure for the relevant September quarter, is the column headed “2 to 2.5”; and

                             (ii)  the column is to apply as if the second dollar amount in the heading to that column did not apply;

                      (f)  a determination varying a parent’s child support percentage;

                     (g)  a determination varying a parent’s adjusted taxable income;

                     (h)  a determination varying a parent’s relevant dependent child amount or multi‑case allowance;

                      (i)  a determination varying a parent’s self‑support amount;

                      (j)  a determination varying the costs of the children.

Note:          There are limitations on the Registrar making a determination that varies an annual rate of child support payable in respect of a child support case below the minimum annual rate (see section 98SA).

             (2)  In proceedings under Division 2, the determinations under subsection (1) that the Registrar may make are not limited by the terms of the application.

             (3)  A determination under this Division may make different provision in relation to different child support periods and in relation to different parts of a child support period.

          (3B)  The Registrar may only make a determination under this Part in respect of a day in a child support period, being a day that is more than 18 months earlier than:

                     (a)  the day on which the application for the determination is made under section 98B; or

                     (b)  the day on which the Registrar notifies the relevant parties under subsection 98M(1);

if a court has granted leave under section 112 for the determination to be made.

          (3C)  If a court has granted leave under section 112, the Registrar may only make a determination under this Part in respect of a day in a child support period if the day is within the period specified by the court, under subsection 112(6), in the order granting the leave.

             (4)  The Registrar must give, in writing, the reasons for making the determination (including the reasons for which the Registrar is satisfied as required by paragraph 117(1)(b)).

             (5)  A contravention of subsection (4) in relation to a determination does not affect the validity of the determination.

##### <a id="98SA"></a>98SA  Variation not to be below minimum annual rate of child support

                   The Registrar must not make a determination under this Part that varies, or that has the effect of varying, the annual rate of child support payable, for a day in a child support period, by a liable parent for all of the children in the child support case that relates to the child in respect of whom the determination is made to a rate below the minimum annual rate of child support for the child support period, unless the liable parent has at least regular care of at least one of the children in that child support case.

### Division 5—Child support agreements

##### <a id="98T"></a>98T  Parties may enter into child support agreement

                   The parties to proceedings under this Part may, at any time before a determination is made in relation to the proceedings, enter into an agreement, purporting to be a child support agreement, in relation to the child support payable for the child in relation to whom the determination may be made.

##### <a id="98U"></a>98U  Decision on child support agreement

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), if the Registrar is satisfied that an agreement entered into by the parties to proceedings is a child support agreement, the Registrar must accept the agreement.

          (1A)  In working out whether an agreement is a limited child support agreement for the purposes of subsection (1), disregard:

                     (a)  paragraph 80E(1)(d); and

                     (b)  subsections 80E(2) to (5).

             (2)  For an agreement (other than a binding child support agreement), the Registrar must not accept the agreement unless he or she is also satisfied that it would be just and equitable, as regards the child, the liable parent and the carer entitled to child support, to accept the agreement.

             (3)  Subsections 117(4) to (9) (inclusive) apply to the Registrar in the exercise of his or her functions under subsection (2) as if:

                     (a)  any reference in those subsections to the court were a reference to the Registrar; and

                     (b)  any reference to the making of a particular order under Division 4 of Part 7 were a reference to the acceptance of an agreement.

             (4)  If the Registrar accepts the agreement:

                     (a)  whichever of sections 34B and 93 is appropriate applies; and

                    (aa)  sections 95 and 96 apply; and

                     (b)  the Registrar may not make a determination under this Part in relation to the proceedings.

             (5)  If the Registrar is not satisfied as required by subsections (1) and (2), the Registrar must refuse to accept the agreement.

                     (a)  section 96 applies; and

                     (b)  the Registrar must proceed to make a determination under this Part.

### Division 6—Pending applications

##### <a id="98V"></a>98V  Pending application not to affect assessment

                   Subject to section 111C of the Registration and Collection Act (Stay orders), the fact that proceedings are pending under this Part in relation to a person does not, in the meantime, interfere with, or affect, any administrative assessment made in relation to the person. Any such assessment may be registered under the Registration and Collection Act, and amounts of child support and other amounts recovered in relation to the assessment, as if no proceedings were pending.

person should be assessed in respect of the costs of a child because the person

is a parent of the child.</li>

person should not be assessed in respect of the costs of the child because the

person is not a parent of the child.</li>

* * *

##### <a id="106A"></a>106A  Declaration that a person should be assessed in respect of the costs of the child

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  the Registrar refuses to accept from an applicant an application for administrative assessment of child support for a child under subsection 30(2); and

                     (b)  one of the reasons for the Registrar so refusing was that the Registrar was not satisfied under section 29 that a person who was to be assessed in respect of the costs of the child is a parent of the child.

Applications for declarations

             (2)  An application may be made to a court having jurisdiction under this Act for a declaration that:

                     (a)  if the reason referred to in paragraph (1)(b) was the only reason for the Registrar refusing to accept the application—a person should be assessed in respect of the costs of the child because the person is a parent of the child; and

                     (b)  if the reason referred to in paragraph (1)(b) was one of the reasons for the Registrar refusing to accept the application—the Registrar should reconsider the application under Division 2 of Part 4 because a person who was to be assessed in respect of the costs of the child is a parent of the child.

             (3)  The application must be made within:

                     (a)  the time prescribed by the applicable Rules of Court; or

                     (b)  such further time as is allowed under the applicable Rules of Court.

                     (b)  if the application for administrative assessment was made under section 25A—the non‑parent carer who made the application and the person in respect of whom the declaration is sought.

Declarations

             (5)  The court may grant the declaration if the court is satisfied that:

                     (a)  if the reason referred to in paragraph (1)(b) was the only reason for the Registrar refusing to accept the application—the person should be assessed in respect of the costs of the child because the person is a parent of the child; or

                     (b)  if the reason referred to in paragraph (1)(b) was one of the reasons for the Registrar refusing to accept the application—the Registrar should reconsider the application under Division 2 of Part 4 because the person who was to be assessed in respect of the costs of the child is a parent of the child.

             (6)  If the court grants the declaration:

                     (a)  if the reason referred to in paragraph (1)(b) was the only reason for the Registrar refusing to accept the application—the Registrar is taken to have accepted the application for administrative assessment of child support; and

                     (b)  if the reason referred to in paragraph (1)(b) was one of the reasons for the Registrar refusing to accept the application—the Registrar must reconsider the application under Division 2 of Part 4.

##### <a id="107"></a>107  Declaration that a person should not be assessed in respect of the costs of the child

             (1)  If the Registrar accepts an application for administrative assessment of child support for a child, an application may be made, subject to subsection (1A), to a court having jurisdiction under this Act for a declaration that a person should not be assessed in respect of the costs of the child because the person is not a parent of the child.

          (1A)  However, an application must not be made in respect of a child and a person if a court has already declared under section 106A that the person should be assessed in respect of the costs of the child because the person is a parent of the child.

Note:          In that case, an appeal may be made against the declaration under Division 1 of Part 7.

             (2)  The application must be made within the time prescribed by the applicable Rules of Court or within such further time as is allowed under the applicable Rules of Court.

             (3)  Subject to section 145 (Registrar may intervene in proceedings), the parties to the proceeding are the person who was assessed in respect of the costs of the child and the applicant for administrative assessment of child support.

             (4)  The court may grant the declaration if the court is satisfied that the person should not be assessed in respect of the costs of the child because the person is not a parent of the child.

             (5)  If the court grants the declaration, the application for administrative assessment of child support is to be taken never to have been accepted by the Registrar.

             (6)  If the court grants the declaration, the court must, as soon as practicable, consider making an order under section 143.

##### <a id="108"></a>108  Implementation of decisions

                   When a decision of a court under this Division becomes final, the Registrar must immediately take such action as is necessary to give effect to the decision.

##### <a id="109"></a>109  Pending application not to affect assessment

             (1)  Subject to section 111C of the Registration and Collection Act (Stay orders), the fact that a proceeding is pending under this Division in relation to a person does not, in the meantime, interfere with, or affect, any administrative assessment made in relation to the person, and any such assessment may be registered under the  Registration and Collection Act, and amounts of child support and other amounts recovered in relation to the assessment, as if no proceeding were pending.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to a person in relation to a child if:

                     (a)  the person has made an application under section 107 in relation to the child; and

                     (c)  there is not a decision of a court determining that ground of the application that has become final.

If the court does so, the applicant is taken to have made an application to the court under section 116 for such an order.

             (3)  Otherwise, the court may grant leave for the Registrar to make a determination under section 98S.

          (3A)  To avoid doubt, the court may grant leave for the Registrar to make a determination under section 98S, or for the court to make an order under section 118, irrespective of what the applicant applied for under section 111.

Matters to be considered

                     (b)  is not limited by the terms of that application.

No requirement to make determination or order

             (8)  The granting of leave under subsection (1) does not imply that:

                     (a)  the Registrar is required to make a determination under section 98S; or

                             (ii)  that it would be: 

                                        (A)  just and equitable as regards the child, the carer entitled to child support and the liable parent; and 

                                        (B)  otherwise proper;

                                   to make a particular order under this Division;

the court may make the order.

Grounds for departure order

             (2)  For the purposes of subparagraph (1)(b)(i), the grounds for departure are as follows:

                     (a)  that, in the special circumstances of the case, the capacity of either parent to provide financial support for the child is significantly reduced because of:

                              (i)  the duty of the parent to maintain any other child or another person; or

                             (ii)  special needs of any other child or another person that the parent has a duty to maintain; or

                            (iii)  commitments of the parent necessary to enable the parent to support: 

                                        (A)  himself or herself; or 

                                        (B)  any other child or another person that the parent has a duty to maintain; or

                            (iv)  high costs involved in enabling a parent to spend time with, or communicate with, any other child or another person that the parent has a duty to maintain;

                    (aa)  that, in the special circumstances of the case, the capacity of either parent to provide financial support for the child is significantly reduced because of the responsibility of the parent to maintain a resident child of the parent (see subsection (10));

                     (b)  that, in the special circumstances of the case, the costs of maintaining the child are significantly affected:

                              (i)  because of high costs involved in enabling a parent to spend time with, or communicate with, the child; or

                            (ia)  because of special needs of the child; or

                            (ib)  because of high child care costs in relation to the child; or

                             (ii)  because the child is being cared for, educated or trained in the manner that was expected by his or her parents;

                     (c)  that, in the special circumstances of the case, application in relation to the child of the provisions of this Act relating to administrative assessment of child support would result in an unjust and inequitable determination of the level of financial support to be provided by the liable parent for the child:

                              (i)  because of the income, earning capacity, property and financial resources of the child; or

                            (ia)  because of the income, property and financial resources of either parent; or

                            (ib)  because of the earning capacity of either parent; or

                             (ii)  because of any payments, and any transfer or settlement of property, made or to be made (whether under this Act, the _Family Law Act 1975_ or otherwise) by the liable parent to the child, to the carer entitled to child support or to any other person for the benefit of the child.

High costs involved in enabling parent to care for a child

          (2B)  A parent’s costs involved in enabling the parent to care for a child can only be high for the purposes of subparagraph (2)(a)(iv) or (2)(b)(i) if the costs that have been or will be incurred, during a child support period, total more than 5% of the amount worked out by:

                     (a)  dividing the parent’s adjusted taxable income for the period by 365; and

                     (b)  multiplying the quotient by the number of days in the period.

          (2C)  If a parent has at least regular care of a child, then the only costs that can be taken into account for the purposes of subsection (2B) are costs related to travel to enable the parent to spend time with, or communicate with, the child.

High child care costs

          (3A)  The ground for departure mentioned in subparagraph (2)(b)(ib) is taken not to exist unless:

                     (a)  the costs are incurred by a parent or a non‑parent carer; and

                     (b)  the child is younger than 12 at the start of the child support period.

          (3B)  Child care costs for a parent can only be high for the purposes of subparagraph (2)(b)(ib) if, during a child support period, they total more than 5% of the amount worked out by:

                     (a)  dividing the parent’s adjusted taxable income for the period by 365; and

                     (b)  multiplying the quotient by the number of days in the period.

          (3C)  Child care costs for a non‑parent carer can only be high for the purposes of subparagraph (2)(b)(ib) if, during a child support period, they total at least 25% of the costs of the child for that period.

Matters to consider for purposes of subparagraph (1)(b)(ii)

             (4)  In determining whether it would be just and equitable as regards the child, the carer entitled to child support and the liable parent to make a particular order under this Division, the court must have regard to:

                     (a)  the nature of the duty of a parent to maintain a child (as stated in section 3); and

                     (b)  the proper needs of the child; and

                     (c)  the income, earning capacity, property and financial resources of the child; and

                     (d)  the income, property and financial resources of each parent who is a party to the proceeding; and

                   (da)  the earning capacity of each parent who is a party to the proceeding; and

                     (e)  the commitments of each parent who is a party to the proceeding that are necessary to enable the parent to support:

                              (i)  himself or herself; or

                             (ii)  any other child or another person that the person has a duty to maintain; and

                      (f)  the direct and indirect costs incurred by the carer entitled to child support in providing care for the child; and

                     (g)  any hardship that would be caused:

                              (i)  to: 

                                        (A)  the child; or 

                                        (B)  the carer entitled to child support;

                                   by the making of, or the refusal to make, the order; and

                             (ii)  to: 

                                        (A)  the liable parent; or 

                                        (B)  any other child or another person that the liable parent has a duty to support;

                                   by the making of, or the refusal to make, the order; and

                            (iii)  to any resident child of the parent (see subsection (10)) by the making of, or the refusal to make, the order.

             (5)  In determining whether it would be otherwise proper to make a particular order under this Division, the court must have regard to:

                     (a)  the nature of the duty of a parent to maintain a child (as stated in section 3) and, in particular, the fact that it is the parents of a child themselves who have the primary duty to maintain the child; and

                     (b)  the effect that the making of the order would have on:

                              (i)  any entitlement of the child, or the carer entitled to child support, to an income tested pension, allowance or benefit; or

                             (ii)  the rate of any income tested pension, allowance or benefit payable to the child or the carer entitled to child support.

Proper needs of the child

             (6)  In having regard to the proper needs of the child, the court must have regard to:

                     (a)  the manner in which the child is being, and in which the parents expected the child to be, cared for, educated or trained; and

                     (b)  any special needs of the child.

Income, earning capacity, property and financial resources

             (7)  In having regard to the income, earning capacity, property and financial resources of the child, the court must:

                     (a)  have regard to the capacity of the child to earn or derive income, including any assets of, under the control of, or held for the benefit of, the child that do not produce, but are capable of producing, income; and

                     (b)  disregard:

                              (i)  the income, earning capacity, property and financial resources of any person who does not have a duty to maintain the child, or who has such a duty but is not a party to the proceeding, unless, in the special circumstances of the case, the court considers that it is appropriate to have regard to them; and

                             (ii)  any entitlement of the child or the carer entitled to child support to an income tested pension, allowance or benefit.

          (7A)  In having regard to the income, property and financial resources of a parent of the child, the court must:

                     (a)  have regard to the capacity of the parent to derive income, including any assets of, under the control of, or held for the benefit of, the parent that do not produce, but are capable of producing, income; and

                     (b)  disregard:

                              (i)  the income, earning capacity, property and financial resources of any person who does not have a duty to maintain the child, or who has such a duty but is not a party to the proceeding, unless, in the special circumstances of the case, the court considers that it is appropriate to have regard to them; and

                             (ii)  any entitlement of the child or the carer entitled to child support to an income tested pension, allowance or benefit.

          (7B)  In having regard to the earning capacity of a parent of the child, the court may determine that the parent’s earning capacity is greater than is reflected in his or her income for the purposes of this Act only if the court is satisfied that:

                     (a)  one or more of the following applies:

                              (i)  the parent does not work despite ample opportunity to do so;

                             (ii)  the parent has reduced the number of hours per week of his or her employment or other work below the normal number of hours per week that constitutes full‑time work for the occupation or industry in which the parent is employed or otherwise engaged;

                            (iii)  the parent has changed his or her occupation, industry or working pattern; and

                     (b)  the parent’s decision not to work, to reduce the number of hours, or to change his or her occupation, industry or working pattern, is not justified on the basis of:

                              (i)  the parent’s caring responsibilities; or

                             (ii)  the parent’s state of health; and

                     (c)  the parent has not demonstrated that it was not a major purpose of that decision to affect the administrative assessment of child support in relation to the child.

Direct and indirect costs in providing care

             (8)  In having regard to the direct and indirect costs incurred by the carer entitled to child support in providing care for the child, the court must have regard to the income and earning capacity foregone by the carer entitled to child support in providing that care.

Subsections not to limit consideration of other matters

             (9)  Subsections (4) to (8) (inclusive) do not limit other matters to which the court may have regard.

Definition of **resident child**

           (10)  For the purposes of this section, a child is a **_resident child_** of a person only if:

                     (a)  the child normally lives with the person, but is not a child of the person; and

                     (b)  the person is, or was, for 2 continuous years, a member of a couple; and

                     (c)  the other member of the couple is, or was, a parent of the child; and

                     (d)  the child is aged under 18; and

                     (e)  the child is not a member of a couple; and

                      (f)  one or more of the following applies in respect of each parent of the child:

                              (i)  the parent has died;

                             (ii)  the parent is unable to support the child due to the ill‑health of the parent;

                            (iii)  the parent is unable to support the child due to the caring responsibilities of the parent; and

                     (g)  the court is satisfied that the resident child requires financial assistance.

##### <a id="118"></a>118  Orders that may be made under Division

             (1)  The orders that a court may make under this Division are as follows:

                     (a)  an order varying the annual rate of child support payable by a parent;

                     (b)  an order varying a parent’s or non‑parent carer’s  cost percentage for a child;

                     (c)  an order varying a parent’s child support income;

                     (d)  an order varying the parents’ combined child support income;

                     (e)  an order that:

                              (i)  the column in the Costs of the Children Table that covers a parent’s child support income or combined child support income that is, or is ordered to be, greater than 2.5 times the annualised MTAWE figure for the relevant September quarter, is the column headed “2 to 2.5”; and

                             (ii)  the column is to apply as if the second dollar amount in the heading to that column did not apply;

                      (f)  an order varying a parent’s child support percentage;

                     (g)  an order varying a parent’s adjusted taxable income;

                     (h)  an order varying a parent’s relevant dependent child amount or multi‑case allowance;

                      (i)  an order varying a parent’s self‑support amount;

                      (j)  an order varying the costs of the children.

             (2)  An order under this section may make different provision in relation to different child support periods and in relation to different parts of a child support period.

          (2B)  A court may only make an order under this Division in respect of a day in a child support period, being a day that is more than 18 months earlier than the day on which the application for the order is made under section 116, if the court has granted leave under section 112 for the order to be made.

          (2C)  If the court has granted leave under section 112, the court may only make an order under this Division in respect of a day in a child support period if the day is within the period specified by the court, under subsection 112(6), in the order granting the leave.

             (3)  If the court makes an order under this section, the court must:

                     (a)  give reasons for making the order (including reasons for its satisfaction as required by paragraph 117(1)(b)); and

                     (b)  cause the reasons to be entered in the records of the court.

             (4)  Subsection (3) does not apply in relation to an order if:

                     (a)  it is an order made by consent; and

                     (b)  the carer entitled to child support concerned is not in receipt of an income tested pension, allowance or benefit.

             (5)  A contravention of subsection (3) in relation to an order does not affect the validity of the order.

##### <a id="119"></a>119  Implementation of orders

             (1)  When a decision of a court making an order under this Division becomes final, the Registrar must immediately take such action as is necessary to give effect to the decision in relation to any administrative assessment that has been made in relation to the child, the carer entitled to child support and the liable parent concerned (whether by amending the assessment or otherwise).

             (2)  In subsequently making an administrative assessment in relation to the child, the carer entitled to child support and the liable parent concerned while the order is in force, the Registrar must act on the basis of the provisions of this Act as modified by the order.

##### <a id="120"></a>120  Pending proceeding not to affect assessment

                   Subject to section 111C of the Registration and Collection Act (Stay orders), the fact that a proceeding is pending under this Division in relation to a person does not, in the meantime, interfere with, or affect, any administrative assessment made in relation to the person, and any such assessment may be registered under the  Registration and Collection Act, and amounts of child support and other amounts recovered in relation to the assessment, as if no proceeding were pending.

### Division 5—Orders for provision of child support otherwise than in form of periodic amounts paid to carer

##### <a id="121"></a>121  Additional particular objects of Division

                   Additional particular objects of this Division include ensuring:

                     (a)  that children have their proper needs met from reasonable and adequate shares in the income, earning capacity, property and financial resources of both their parents; and

                     (b)  that parents share equitably in the support of their children.

##### <a id="122"></a>122  Cases in relation to which Division applies

                   This Division applies where a carer entitled to child support wants a liable parent to provide, or a liable parent wants to provide, child support for a child otherwise than in the form of periodic amounts paid to the carer entitled to child support.

##### <a id="123"></a>123  Application for order under Division

             (1)  An application may be made to a court having jurisdiction under this Act for:

                     (a)  an order that a liable parent provide child support otherwise than in the form of periodic amounts paid to the carer entitled to child support; or

                     (b)  an order that a liable parent provide child support in the form of a lump sum payment to be credited against the amount payable under the liability under the relevant administrative assessment.

             (2)  An application under subsection (1):

                     (a)  may only be made if an administrative assessment is in force in relation to the child, the carer entitled to child support and the liable parent; and

                     (b)  may be made by the carer entitled to child support or the liable parent.

             (3)  Before hearing the application, the court must hear and determine any pending application made to the court for an order under Division 3 (administrative assessments more than 18 months old) or Division 4 (departure orders) in relation to the child, the carer entitled to child support and the liable parent.

             (4)  Subject to section 145 (Registrar may intervene in proceedings), the parties to the application are the carer entitled to child support and the liable parent.

##### <a id="123A"></a>123A  Orders for provision of child support in the form of lump sum payment to be credited against amounts payable under liability

             (1)  The court may make an order that a liable parent provide child support for a child to a carer entitled to child support in the form of a lump sum payment to be credited against the amount payable under the liability under the relevant administrative assessment if:

                     (a)  the carer entitled to child support or the liable parent makes an application to a court under paragraph 123(1)(b); and

                     (b)  the court is satisfied that it would be:

                              (i)  just and equitable as regards the child, the carer entitled to child support and the liable parent; and

                             (ii)  otherwise proper;

                            to make an order under this section; and

                     (c)  the amount of the lump sum payment equals or exceeds the annual rate of child support payable for the child under the administrative assessment.

Note:          If the court makes such an order, the lump sum payment is credited under section 69A of the Registration and Collection Act against the amount payable under the liable parent’s liability (rather than reducing the annual rate of child support payable under the administrative assessment).

             (2)  A lump sum payment may include a payment by way of transfer or settlement of property.

             (3)  An order under subsection (1):

                     (a)  must specify the amount of the lump sum payment; and

                     (b)  must specify that the lump sum payment is to be credited against 100%, or another specified percentage that is less than 100%, of the amounts payable under the liability.

             (4)  In determining the application made under paragraph 123(1)(b), the court must have regard to:

                     (a)  the administrative assessment; and

                     (b)  any determination in force under Part 6A (departure determinations) in relation to the child, the carer entitled to child support and the liable parent; and

                     (c)  any order in force under Division 4 of this Part (departure orders) in relation to the child, the carer entitled to child support and the liable parent; and

                     (d)  whether the carer entitled to child support is in receipt of an income tested pension, allowance or benefit; and

                     (e)  if the carer entitled to child support is not in receipt of such a pension, allowance or benefit—whether the circumstances of the carer are such that, taking into account the effect of the order proposed to be made by the court, the carer would be unable to support himself or herself without an income tested pension, allowance or benefit.

             (5)  In determining whether it would be just and equitable as regards the child, the carer entitled to child support and the liable parent to make an order under subsection (1), the court must have regard to the matters mentioned in subsections 117(4), (6), (7), (7A) and (8).

             (6)  In having regard to the earning capacity of a parent of the child under paragraph 117(4)(da), the court may determine that the parent’s earning capacity is greater than is reflected in his or her income for the purposes of this Act only if the court is satisfied as mentioned in subsection 117(7B).

             (7)  In determining whether it would be otherwise proper to make an order under subsection (1), the court must have regard to the matters mentioned in subsection 117(5).

             (8)  Subsections (4), (5), (6) and (7) do not limit the matters to which the court may have regard.

##### <a id="124"></a>124  Orders for provision of child support otherwise than in form of periodic amounts paid to carer entitled to child support

             (1)  Where:

                     (a)  a carer entitled to child support or a liable parent makes an application under paragraph 123(1)(a); and

                     (b)  the court is satisfied that it would be:

                              (i)  just and equitable as regards the child, the carer entitled to child support and the liable parent; and

                             (ii)  otherwise proper;

                            to make an order that the liable parent provide child support for the child otherwise than in the form of periodic amounts paid to the carer entitled to child support;

the court may make the order.

             (2)  In determining the application, the court must have regard to:

                     (a)  the administrative assessment in force in relation to the child, the carer entitled to child support and the liable parent; and

                    (aa)  any determination in force under Part 6A (departure determinations) in relation to the child, the carer entitled to child support and the liable parent; and

                     (b)  any order in force under Division 4 (departure orders) in relation to the child, the carer entitled to child support and the liable parent; and

                     (c)  whether the carer entitled to child support is in receipt of an income tested pension, allowance or benefit or, if the carer entitled to child support is not in receipt of such a pension, allowance or benefit, whether the circumstances of the carer are such that, taking into account the effect of the order proposed to be made by the court, the carer would be unable to support himself or herself without an income tested pension, allowance or benefit.

             (3)  In determining whether it would be just and equitable as regards the child, the carer entitled to child support and the liable parent to make an order under subsection (1), the court must have regard to the matters mentioned in subsections 117(4), (6), (7), (7A) and (8).

          (3A)  In having regard to the earning capacity of a parent of the child under paragraph 117(4)(da), the court may determine that the parent’s earning capacity is greater than is reflected in his or her income for the purposes of this Act only if the court is satisfied as mentioned in subsection 117(7B).

             (4)  In determining whether it would be otherwise proper to make an order under subsection (1), the court must have regard to the matters mentioned in subsection 117(5).

             (5)  Subsections (2), (3), (3A) and (4) do not limit the matters to which the court may have regard.

##### <a id="125"></a>125  Court to state relationship between order and assessed child support

             (1)  If the court makes an order under section 124, the court must state in the order whether the annual rate of child support payable by the liable parent under any relevant administrative assessment is to be reduced, in the manner specified under subsection (3), by the child support ordered to be provided by the liable parent.

Note:          If the court makes a statement under this section that the annual rate of child support is to be reduced, the Registrar must make a provisional notional assessment under section 146B.

             (2)  The court may state that the annual rate of child support payable by the liable parent is not to be so reduced only if it is satisfied that, in the special circumstances of the case, it would be:

                     (a)  just and equitable as regards the child, the carer entitled to child support and the liable parent; and

                     (b)  otherwise proper;

that the annual rate of child support not be reduced by the child support ordered to be provided.

             (3)  If the court states in the order that the annual rate of child support is to be reduced by the child support ordered to be provided, the court must also state in the order either:

                     (a)  that the annual rate of child support payable is to be reduced by a specified amount that represents an annual value of the child support to be provided; or

                     (b)  that the annual rate of child support payable is to be reduced by 100% or another specified percentage that is less than 100%.

             (4)  The court may, under subsections (1) and (3), make different provision in relation to different child support periods and in relation to different parts of a child support period.

             (5)  In determining whether it would be just and equitable as regards the child, the carer entitled to child support and the liable parent to make a statement of the kind referred to in subsection (2), the court must have regard to the matters mentioned in subsections 117(4), (6), (7), (7A) and (8).

          (5A)  In having regard to the earning capacity of a parent of the child under paragraph 117(4)(da), the court may determine that the parent’s earning capacity is greater than is reflected in his or her income for the purposes of this Act only if the court is satisfied as mentioned in subsection 117(7B).

             (6)  In determining whether it would be otherwise proper to make a statement of the kind referred to in subsection (2), the court must have regard to the matters mentioned in subsection 117(5).

             (7)  Subsections (5), (5A) and (6) do not limit the matters to which the court may have regard.

##### <a id="126"></a>126  Court to give reasons for order

             (1)  If the court makes an order under section 123A or 124, the court must:

                     (a)  give reasons for:

                              (i)  making the order; and

                             (ii)  if the order is an order under section 123A—the matters specified in the order under subsection 123A(3); and

                            (iii)  if the order is an order under section 124—the statement or statements included in the order under section 125; and

                     (b)  cause the reasons to be entered in the records of the court.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to an order if:

                     (a)  it is an order made by consent; and

                     (b)  the carer entitled to child support concerned is not in receipt of an income tested pension, allowance or benefit.

             (3)  A contravention of subsection (1) in relation to an order does not affect the validity of the order.

##### <a id="127"></a>127  Effect of orders on administrative assessment of child support

             (1)  This section applies if the court makes an order under section 124 that includes a statement under section 125 that the annual rate of child support payable by a liable parent under an administrative assessment is to be reduced, in the manner specified under subsection 125(3), by the child support ordered to be provided by the liable parent.

             (2)  When the decision of the court making the order becomes final, the Registrar must immediately take such action as is necessary to give effect to the order in relation to any relevant administrative assessment that has been made (whether by amending the assessment or otherwise).

             (3)  In subsequently making a relevant administrative assessment, the Registrar must:

                     (a)  work out what would, apart from this Division, be the annual rate of child support payable by the liable parent to the carer entitled to child support; and

                     (b)  reduce (but not below 0) that annual rate by the amount or percentage specified in the statement included in the order under subsection 125(3); and

                     (c)  make the assessment on the basis of that reduced annual rate.

##### <a id="129"></a>129  Modification of orders under Division

             (1)  If an order under section 123A or 124 is in force in relation to a child (whether or not all things ordered to be done by the order have been done):

                     (a)  the court that made the order; or

                     (b)  another court having jurisdiction under this Act in which the order has been registered;

may under this section, by order:

                     (c)  discharge the order; or

                     (d)  suspend its operation wholly or in part and either until further order or until a fixed time or the happening of a future event; or

                     (e)  if the operation of the order has been suspended under paragraph (d)—revive its operation wholly or in part; or

                      (f)  subject to subsection (3), vary the order (including any matter specified under subsection 123A(3), or any statement made under section 125, included in the order) in any way.

             (2)  The court must not make an order under subsection (1) in relation to the order under section 123A or 124 unless the court is satisfied, having regard in particular to any matter specified under subsection 123A(3), or any statement made under section 125, that it would be:

                     (a)  just and equitable as regards the child, the carer entitled to child support and the liable parent concerned; and

                     (b)  otherwise proper;

to make the order.

             (3)  The court must not, by order under subsection (1), vary an order unless it is also satisfied:

                     (a)  that making the variation is justified because of a change in the circumstances of the child, the carer entitled to child support or a liable parent concerned since the order was made or last varied; or

                     (c)  that making the variation is justified because of a change in the cost of living since the order was made or last varied; or

                     (d)  in a case where the order was made by consent—that the order is not proper or adequate; or

                     (e)  that material facts were withheld from the court that made the order or from a court that varied the order, or that material evidence previously given before such a court was false.

             (4)  If the court proposes to vary an order made under section 123A or 124 otherwise than by varying any matter specified in the order under subsection 123A(3), or any statement included in the order under section 125, the court must consider whether, having regard to the proposed variation, it should also order the variation of any such matter or statement.

             (5)  In determining whether it would be just and equitable as regards the child, the carer entitled to child support and a liable parent to make an order under subsection (1), the court must have regard to the matters mentioned in subsections 117(4), (6), (7), (7A) and (8).

          (5A)  In having regard to the earning capacity of a parent of the child under paragraph 117(4)(da), the court may determine that the parent’s earning capacity is greater than is reflected in his or her income for the purposes of this Act only if the court is satisfied as mentioned in subsection 117(7B).

             (6)  In determining whether it would be otherwise proper to make an order under subsection (1), the court must have regard to the matters mentioned in subsection 117(5).

             (7)  Subsections (5), (5A) and (6) do not limit the matters to which the court may have regard.

             (8)  In satisfying itself for the purposes of paragraph (3)(d), the court must have regard to any payments, and any transfer or settlement of property, previously made by the liable parent to the child, to the carer entitled to child support or to any other person for the benefit of the child.

             (9)  In satisfying itself for the purposes of paragraph (3)(c), the court must have regard to any changes that have occurred in a relevant Consumer Price Index published by the Australian Statistician.

           (10)  The court must not, in considering the variation of an order, have regard to a change in the cost of living unless at least 12 months have elapsed since the order was made, or was last varied having regard to a change in the cost of living.

           (11)  Subject to any order made under section 131, the discharge of an order does not affect the recovery of arrears due under the order, or under this Act, when the discharge takes effect.

##### <a id="130"></a>130  Court to give reasons for modifications

             (1)  If the court makes an order under section 129, the court must:

                     (a)  give reasons:

                              (i)  for making the order; and

                             (ii)  if the court varies an order made under section 124 otherwise than by varying any statement included in the order under section 125 and does not order the variation of any such statement—for not ordering the variation of any such statement; and

                     (b)  cause the reasons to be entered in the records of the court.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to an order made by consent.

             (3)  A contravention of subsection (1) in relation to an order does not affect the validity of the order.

##### <a id="131"></a>131  Court may make orders consequential upon the discharge of orders etc.

             (1)  This section applies where an order under section 123A or 124 is discharged by a court under section 129 or ceases to be in force because of section 142 (Cessation of orders under Act).

             (2)  A court having jurisdiction under this Act may make such orders (including orders for the transfer of property) as it considers just and equitable for the purpose of preserving or adjusting the rights of the child concerned or a person who is or was a carer entitled to child support, or a liable parent, in relation to the child.

             (3)  An order under subsection (2) may be made in the proceeding in which the order is discharged or in another proceeding brought on the application of a person who is or was a carer entitled to child support, or a liable parent, in relation to the child concerned.

             (4)  In the exercise of its powers under this section, a court must have regard to the interests of, and must make any order proper for the protection of, a _bona fide_ purchaser or other person interested.

### Division 6—Setting aside accepted child support agreements

##### <a id="135"></a>135  Simplified outline

                   The following is a simplified outline of this Division:

* * *

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      Certain courts may set

aside a child support agreement or a termination agreement if:</li>

               (a)     the agreement of one of the parties was obtained by fraud, undue influence or unconscionable conduct; or

              (b)     there has been a significant change in circumstances; or

               (c)     the annual rate of child support payable under the agreement is not proper or adequate; or

              (d)     exceptional circumstances arise after the agreement is made.

* * *

##### <a id="136"></a>136  Power of court to set aside child support agreements or termination agreements

             (1)  A party to either of the following agreements may apply to a court having jurisdiction under this Act for the court to set aside the agreement:

                     (a)  a child support agreement that has been accepted by the Registrar under section 92 or 98U;

                     (b)  a termination agreement, or a written agreement referred to in paragraph 80G(1)(b), that has been accepted by the Registrar under section 92.

             (2)  If a party has applied under subsection (1), the court may set aside the agreement in accordance with the application if the court is satisfied:

                     (a)  that the party’s agreement was obtained by fraud or a failure to disclose material information; or

                     (b)  that another party to the agreement, or someone acting for another party:

                              (i)  exerted undue influence or duress in obtaining that agreement; or

                             (ii)  engaged in unconscionable or other conduct;

                            to such an extent that it would be unjust not to set aside the agreement; or

                     (c)  in the case of a limited child support agreement:

                              (i)  that because of a significant change in the circumstances of one of the parties to the agreement, or a child in respect of whom the agreement is made, it would be unjust not to set aside the agreement; or

                             (ii)  that the agreement provides for an annual rate of child support that is not proper or adequate, taking into account all the circumstances of the case (including the financial circumstances of the parties to the agreement); or

                     (d)  in the case of a binding child support agreement—that because of exceptional circumstances, relating to a party to the agreement or a child in respect of whom the agreement is made, that have arisen since the agreement was made, the applicant or the child will suffer hardship if the agreement is not set aside.

             (3)  Subject to section 145 (Registrar may intervene in proceedings), the parties to a proceeding under subsection (1) are the parties to the agreement.

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  the court sets aside a child support agreement under this section; and

                     (b)  the court is satisfied as mentioned in paragraph 117(1)(b) (departure orders);

the court may make an order under Division 4 of Part 7 without an application having been made under section 116.

             (5)  If:

                     (a)  the court sets aside a child support agreement under this section; and

                     (b)  the court is not satisfied as mentioned in paragraph 117(1)(b) (departure orders); and

                     (c)  the payee has received or will receive benefits pursuant to the agreement;

the court may still make an order that departs from the administrative assessment where it is just and equitable to do so, having regard to the benefits that the payee has already received pursuant to the agreement.

##### <a id="137"></a>137  Court may make orders consequential on setting aside of agreement

             (1)  This section applies where an agreement made in relation to a child is set aside under section 136.

             (2)  A court having jurisdiction under this Act may make such orders (including orders for the transfer of property) as it considers just and equitable for the purpose of preserving or adjusting the rights of the child or a party to the agreement.

             (3)  An order under subsection (2) may be made in the proceeding in which the agreement is set aside or in another proceeding brought on the application of a party to the agreement.

             (4)  In the exercise of its powers under this section, a court must have regard to the interests of, and must make any order proper for the protection of, a _bona fide_ purchaser or other person interested.

##### <a id="138"></a>138  Implementation of decisions

                   When a decision of a court under this Division becomes final, the Registrar must immediately take such action as is necessary to give effect to the decision for the purposes of this Act (whether by amending any administrative assessment or otherwise).

### Division 7—Urgent maintenance orders

##### <a id="138A"></a>138A  Simplified outline

                   The following is a simplified outline of this Division:

* * *

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      A court may make an order

for the payment of child support if:</li>

               (a)     a child is in urgent need of financial assistance; and

              (b)     an application has been made for an administrative assessment in relation to the child.

* * *

##### <a id="139"></a>139  Urgent maintenance orders

             (1)  Where, at any time after an application has been made to the Registrar for administrative assessment of child support for a child (whether or not the Registrar has accepted or refused to accept the application), a court having jurisdiction under this Act is of the opinion that the child is in urgent need of financial assistance, the court may order the payment of such periodic or other amount as the court considers appropriate.

             (2)  Subject to subsection (2A) and section 152, an order under subsection (1) has effect for the period specified in the order.

          (2A)  If:

                     (a)  the Registrar has made a decision refusing to accept the application for administrative assessment of child support; and

                     (b)  the order under subsection (1) has not sooner ceased to have effect under subsection (2);

the order ceases to have effect:

                     (c)  if the decision of the Registrar becomes final—at the time when that decision becomes final; or

                     (d)  if:

                              (i)  the decision of the Registrar does not become final; and

                             (ii)  one of the reasons for the Registrar so refusing was that the Registrar was not satisfied under section 29 that a person who was to be assessed in respect of the costs of the child is a parent of the child;

                            at the time when a decision of a court becomes final, being a decision (whether under section 106A or on appeal from a decision of a court under that section) that the person is not a parent of the child; or

                     (e)  in any other case—at the time when a decision that the applicant was not entitled to administrative assessment of child support becomes final, being a decision:

                              (i)  of the SSAT under Part VIIA of the Registration and Collection Act; or

                             (ii)  of a court under Subdivision B of Division 3 of Part VIII of the Registration and Collection Act or on appeal from a decision of a court under that Subdivision.

          (2B)  For the purposes of subsection (2A), a decision of the Registrar refusing to accept an application for administrative assessment of child support becomes final if an application:

                     (a)  to a court under section 106A (declarations of entitlement to administrative assessment); or

                     (b)  to the SSAT under Part VIIA of the Registration and Collection Act;

is not made within the period for doing so. The application becomes final at the end of the period.

Note:          For determining when decisions of the SSAT become final, see subsection 110W(1) of the Registration and Collection Act.

             (3)  A proceeding under this section may be instituted by the applicant for administrative assessment of child support against a person who was to be assessed in respect of the costs of the child.

                     (p)  make an order at any time.

             (2)  The making of an order of a kind referred to in paragraph (1)(c), or of any other order under this Act, in relation to a child does not prevent a court from making a subsequent order (whether under this Act or otherwise) in relation to the child.

             (3)  The applicable Rules of Court may make provision with respect to the making of orders under this Act (whether as to their form or otherwise) for the purpose of facilitating their enforcement and the collection of any child support payable under them.

### Division 2—Notional assessments

##### <a id="146B"></a>146B  Provisional notional assessments

             (1)  The Registrar must make a provisional notional assessment in accordance with this section if:

                     (a)  the Registrar makes an assessment under section 34B or section 93; or

                     (b)  a court makes a statement under section 125, in an order under section 124, that an annual rate of child support payable is to be reduced.

             (2)  The Registrar must make a provisional notional assessment of the annual rate of child support that would be payable for a child for a particular day in a child support period, by the liable parent to the carer entitled to child support, if that annual rate were payable under Part 5 (taking into account any relevant determination under Part 6A, or any relevant order under Division 4 of Part 7, and taking into account section 146BA) for the child for that day instead of under the agreement or order.

             (3)  The Registrar must serve notice in writing of the provisional notional assessment on the liable parent and the carer entitled to child support.

             (4)  The notice must specify in respect of the provisional notional assessment the matters that are required under section 69 and subsection 76(2) (disregarding subsection 76(2A)) in respect of an administrative assessment.

             (5)  The notice must include, or be accompanied by, a statement to the effect that:

                     (a)  the liable parent or the carer entitled to child support can seek a variation of the provisional notional assessment in accordance with section 146C within 14 days of receiving the notice; and

                     (b)  once the provisional notional assessment becomes a notional assessment under section 146E, the liable parent or the carer entitled to child support may, subject to the Registration and Collection Act, object to the particulars of the notional assessment; and

                     (c)  if aggrieved by a later decision on an objection to those particulars, the liable parent or the carer entitled to child support may, subject to that Act, apply to the SSAT for review of the later decision.

##### <a id="146BA"></a>146BA  Application of Part 5 to provisional notional assessments

             (1)  In making a provisional notional assessment, Part 5 applies as if:

                     (a)  subject to this section, a reference in the Part to an assessment, or an administrative assessment, were a reference to a provisional notional assessment; and

                     (b)  subsections 44(5) and (6), Subdivision C of Division 7, and sections 35C, 66C, 69 and 76 to 79 did not apply; and

                     (c)  in paragraph 54B(2)(a), the reference to the day on which an application referred to in subparagraph 49(1)(a)(i) or 50(1)(a)(i) is made were a reference to the particular day in respect of which the provisional notional assessment is made; and

                     (d)  subparagraph 65A(1)(b)(ii) were omitted and substituted with the following:

                           “(ii)  if the parent made an election under subsection 146G(1) relating to the child—the amount estimated by the parent under that subsection.”.

             (2)  Part 5 ceases to apply once a provisional notional assessment becomes a notional assessment.

##### <a id="146C"></a>146C  Variation of provisional notional assessments

             (1)  A liable parent or carer entitled to child support (the **_applicant_**) may seek a variation of a provisional notional assessment within 14 days of receiving a notice under section 146B in respect of the provisional notional assessment by doing one or more of the following:

                     (a)  by notifying the Registrar of a change to the percentage of care that the liable parent or the carer entitled to child support has for the child for the particular day in the child support period in respect of which the provisional notional assessment is made;

                    (aa)  by making an application under section 44 to amend the provisional notional assessment;

                   (ab)  by making an application under section 66A to reduce the annual rate of child support payable to nil;

                     (b)  by making an application under section 146D for a determination under Part 6A (departure determinations);

                     (c)  if the applicant is a parent of the relevant child—by making an election under subsection 146G(1) (estimate of adjusted taxable income).

Note:          A person who does not receive a notice that is served on the person is taken to have received the notice 14 days after the notice was served (see subsection 146E(2)).

             (2)  The Registrar may vary the provisional notional assessment of the annual rate of child support that would be payable for the child for the particular day if:

                     (a)  an applicant seeks a variation in accordance with subsection (1); and

                     (b)  any one or more of the following applies:

                              (i)  if paragraph (1)(a) applies—the Registrar determines a different percentage of care for the parent or the carer for the child for the particular day under Division 4 of Part 5;

                            (ia)  if paragraph (1)(ab) applies—the Registrar makes a determination under subsection 44(2);

                            (ib)  if paragraph (1)(aa) applies—the Registrar reduces the annual rate of child support payable to nil;

                             (ii)  if paragraph (1)(b) applies—the Registrar makes a determination in respect of the child under section 98S;

                            (iii)  if paragraph (1)(c) applies—the Registrar does not refuse to accept the election under section 146H.

             (3)  The Registrar may refuse to vary the provisional notional assessment if:

                     (a)  the liable parent or the carer entitled to child support seeks a variation to the provisional notional assessment in accordance with subsection (1); and

                     (b)  any of the following applies:

                              (i)  if paragraph (1)(a) applies—the Registrar does not determine a different percentage of care for the parent or carer for the child for the particular day under Division 4 of Part 5;

                            (ia)  if paragraph (1)(ab) applies—the Registrar refuses to make a determination under subsection 44(2);

                            (ib)  if paragraph (1)(aa) applies—the Registrar refuses to grant an application under section 66A;

                             (ii)  if paragraph (1)(b) applies—the Registrar refuses to make a determination in respect of the child under section 98S;

                            (iii)  if paragraph (1)(c) applies—the Registrar refuses to accept the election under section 146H; and

                     (c)  if the liable parent or carer entitled to child support seeks a variation by doing more than one of the things mentioned in subsection (1)—the Registrar has not already varied the provisional notional assessment under subsection (2).

             (4)  The liable parent and the carer entitled to child support are not entitled:

                     (a)  to make an application to the SSAT under section 89 of the Registration and Collection Act; or

                     (b)  to make an application to a court under section 116;

in respect of the making of, or refusal to make, a determination under Part 6A.

Note:          Instead, once the provisional notional assessment becomes a notional assessment, an objection can be made to the particulars of the notional assessment under section 80 or 80A of the Registration and Collection Act.

##### <a id="146D"></a>146D  Departure determinations in respect of provisional notional assessments

             (1)  A person may, by written application, ask the Registrar to make a determination under Part 6A (departure determinations) if:

                     (a)  a provisional notional assessment has not yet become a notional assessment under section 146E; and

                     (b)  the person is of the view that, because of special circumstances that exist, the provisions of this Act relating to administrative assessment of child support should be departed from for the purposes of making the provisional notional assessment; and

                     (c)  the person has not previously applied under this section in relation to the provisional notional assessment.

             (2)  If a person makes an application under subsection (1), Division 2 of Part 6A applies as if:

                     (a)  references in that Division to an administrative assessment were references to the provisional notional assessment; and

                     (b)  section 98JA did not apply.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  an application (the **_original application_**) is made under section 98B in relation to an administrative assessment; and

                     (b)  before the Registrar decides the application, the Registrar accepts an agreement under section 98U that is entered into by the parties to the proceedings concerned; and

                     (c)  a provisional notional assessment is made because of section 34B applying as mentioned in paragraph 98U(4)(a);

then the original application is taken to be an application made under subsection (1) of this section.

##### <a id="146E"></a>146E  Notional assessments

             (1)  A provisional notional assessment becomes a **_notional assessment_**:

                     (a)  14 days after the notice of the provisional notional assessment is received by all the parties under section 146B; or

                     (b)  if a liable parent or a carer entitled to child support seeks a variation to the provisional notional assessment in accordance with section 146C—on the day on which the Registrar varies, or refuses to vary, the provisional notional assessment under that section.

             (2)  For the purposes of this section and section 146C, if a person does not receive a notice served under section 146B before 14 days after the day on which the notice was served on the person by post at the person’s last known address, the person is taken to have received the notice on the 14th day.

             (3)  To avoid doubt, subsection (2) applies whether the person receives the notice after the time referred to in that subsection or does not receive the notice at all.

             (4)  After a provisional notional assessment becomes a notional assessment, the Registrar must serve notice in writing of the notional assessment on the liable parent and the carer entitled to child support.

             (5)  The notice must specify in respect of the notional assessment the matters that are required by section 69 and subsection 76(2) in respect of an administrative assessment.

             (6)  The notice must include, or be accompanied by, a statement to the effect that:

                     (a)  the party may, subject to the Registration and Collection Act, object to the particulars of the notional assessment; and

                     (b)  if aggrieved by a later decision on an objection to those particulars, may, subject to that Act, apply to the SSAT for review of the later decision.

             (7)  A contravention of subsection (5) or (6) does not affect the validity of the notional assessment.

##### <a id="146EA"></a>146EA  Amendment of notional assessment

             (1)  The Registrar must amend a notional assessment of the annual rate of child support that would be payable for a child (the **_first child_**) for a particular day in a child support period if:

                     (a)  another child in the child support case that relates to the first child is not covered by the relevant child support agreement or the order that was made in relation to the first child; and

                     (b)  the administrative assessment of the child support payable for the other child for any day (the **_changed assessment day_**) in any child support period changes.

             (2)  The Registrar must amend the notional assessment as if:

                     (a)  despite subsection 146BA(2), section 67A (offsetting) applied on the changed assessment day; and

                     (b)  the annual rate of child support that would be payable for the first child for the particular day were instead payable for the changed assessment day.

##### <a id="146F"></a>146F  Later provisional notional assessments

                   The Registrar must make a new provisional notional assessment under section 146B:

                     (a)  if the relevant child support agreement or court order continues in force for more than 3 years—at the end of the 3 year period after the most recent notional assessment relating to the agreement or order was made; or

                     (b)  if the relevant child support agreement was a limited child support agreement—on the request of a party to the agreement; or

                     (c)  in any case—if the amount of child support that is payable under the relevant child support agreement or court order for a day in the child support period changes by more than 15% from the previous day.

### Division 3—Estimating adjusted taxable income for notional assessments

##### <a id="146G"></a>146G  Estimating adjusted taxable income for purposes of notional assessments

             (1)  Before a provisional notional assessment relating to a child becomes a notional assessment under section 146E, a parent of the child may elect that, for the purposes of making the provisional notional assessment, the parent’s adjusted taxable income for the 12 month period beginning on the particular day in the child support period in respect of which the provisional notional assessment is made is the amount estimated by the parent.

             (2)  However, a parent may not make an election under this section in relation to a child if an order or determination referred to in paragraph (a) of the definition of **_income amount order_** is in force, or would be in force but for the existence of the relevant child support agreement, in relation to the parent and the particular day in the child support period in respect of which the provisional notional assessment is made.

Election must be for amount less than adjusted taxable income for last relevant year of income

             (3)  The parent may make an election relating to a child only if the amount that he or she estimates under subsection (1) is not more than 85% of the total of the parent’s adjusted taxable income for the last relevant year of income for the child support period.

How election is made

             (4)  The parent makes the election by giving notice of it to the Registrar in the manner specified by the Registrar. The notice must specify the amount the parent estimates to be his or her adjusted taxable income.

##### <a id="146H"></a>146H  Registrar may refuse to accept election

             (1)  The Registrar may refuse to accept the parent’s election if the Registrar is satisfied that the amount the parent estimated under subsection 146G(1) is likely to be less than the actual amount that would be the parent’s adjusted taxable income for that 12 month period.

Note:          If the Registrar refuses to accept the election, he or she may refuse to vary the provisional notional assessment under subsection 146C(3).

             (2)  In making the decision as to whether to refuse the election, the Registrar:

                     (a)  may act on the basis of information that the Registrar has received or obtained as to the financial circumstances of the parent; and

                     (b)  may, but is not required to, conduct an inquiry into the matter.

             (3)  Except for the purposes of Parts VII, VIIA and VIII of the Registration and Collection Act (dealing with objections and appeals), if the Registrar refuses to accept an election, the election is taken never to have been made.

##### <a id="146J"></a>146J  Effect of election

             (1)  If a parent makes an election under subsection 146G(1) relating to a child, then, for the purposes of making the provisional notional assessment, the parent’s adjusted taxable income is the amount the parent estimated.

             (2)  Subsection (1) has effect subject to any order or determination referred to in paragraph (a) of the definition of **_income amount order_** that is made after the making of the election that applies in relation to the parent and the particular day in the child support period in respect of which the provisional notional assessment is made.

             (3)  The Registrar must take such action as is necessary to give effect to subsection (1) in relation to the provisional notional assessment that has been made in relation to the parent and the child (whether by varying the provisional notional assessment or otherwise).

##### <a id="146K"></a>146K  Revocation of election

             (1)  Before a provisional notional assessment becomes a notional assessment under section 146E, a parent who has made an election under subsection 146G(1) in relation to a child may, by notice given to the Registrar, revoke the election.

             (2)  A notice given to the Registrar must be given in the manner specified by the Registrar.

Note:          Section 150A provides for the Registrar to specify the manner in which a notice may be given.

##### <a id="146L"></a>146L  Effect of revocation

             (1)  If a parent who made an election under section 146G relating to a child revokes the election and substitutes a new election before the provisional notional assessment becomes a notional assessment under section 146E, then, for the purposes of making the provisional notional assessment, the parent’s adjusted taxable income is the amount the parent elected in the new election.

             (2)  Subsection (1) has effect subject to any order or determination referred to in paragraph (a) of the definition of **_income amount order_** that is made after the making of the election that applies in relation to the parent and the particular day in the child support period in respect of which the provisional notional assessment is made.

             (3)  The Registrar must take such action as is necessary to give effect to subsection (1) in relation to the provisional notional assessment that has been made in relation to the parent and the child (whether by varying the provisional notional assessment or otherwise).

             (4)  This section does not prevent:

                     (a)  the Registrar making a determination under Part 6A; or

                     (b)  a court making any order under Division 4 of Part 7; or

                     (c)  the making, and acceptance by the Registrar, of a child support agreement that includes provisions that have effect, for the purposes of Part 5, as if they were such an order made by consent.

## Part 9—Miscellaneous

##### <a id="150E"></a>150E  Suspension of liability to pay child support where parents reconcile

Child support not payable if parents reconcile

             (1)  The Registrar must make a determination (a **_suspension determination_**) that child support is not payable for a child by a liable parent to the other parent of the child if:

                     (a)  the Registrar is notified, or otherwise becomes aware, that the parents have become members of the same couple; and

                     (b)  the Registrar is satisfied that the parents have become members of the same couple.

             (2)  If the Registrar makes a suspension determination, child support for the child is not payable by the liable parent to the other parent:

                     (a)  from the day the Registrar determines that the parents became members of the same couple; and

                     (b)  until the Registrar makes a determination under subsection (3) in relation to the parents.

Note:          Under section 12, there is a child support terminating event if the parents are members of the same couple for a period of 6 months or more.

Payment of child support to continue if reconciliation not successful

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  a child support terminating event has not happened in relation to a child and the child’s parents under subsection 12(5); and

                     (b)  the Register is satisfied that the parents have ceased being members of the same couple;

then the Registrar must make a determination under this subsection that child support is again payable by the liable parent to the other parent.

             (4)  If the Registrar makes a determination under subsection (3), child support is again payable by the liable parent to the other parent from the day that the Registrar is satisfied that the parents ceased to be members of the same couple.

Suspension determination not to prevent payment of child support to non‑parent carers

             (5)  To avoid doubt, child support is still payable by a liable parent for a child to a non‑parent carer of the child despite a suspension determination being made in respect of the parents of the child.

Parent taken not to be assessed in respect of the costs of the child

             (6)  For the purposes of this Act and the Registration and Collection Act, a parent of a child is taken not to be assessed in respect of the costs of the child during the period in which child support is not payable by or to the parent under subsection (2).

##### <a id="151"></a>151  Election by carer entitled to child support to end administrative assessment 

             (1)  A carer entitled to child support for a child may, by notice given to the Registrar, elect that the liability of a liable parent to pay or provide child support for the child to the carer entitled to child support is to end from a specified day.

             (2)  The notice must be given in the manner specified by the Registrar.

Note:          Section 150A provides for the Registrar to specify the manner in which a notice may be given.

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  a carer makes an election under subsection (1) in respect of a child; and

                     (b)  the carer is entitled to be paid, or is a claimant for, family tax benefit for the child, the Part A rate of which is higher than the base rate for the carer under clause 4 of Schedule 1 to the Family Assistance Act;

the election has no effect unless and until the Secretary approves the election under section 151A.

             (5)  If:

                     (a)  a person makes an election under subsection (1) in respect of a child; and

                     (b)  the application for administrative assessment under which the child support is payable was made, in accordance with paragraph 29B(1)(b), by an overseas authority of a reciprocating jurisdiction on behalf of the carer entitled to child support;

the election has no effect unless and until the overseas authority approves the election.

##### <a id="151A"></a>151A  Procedure where person making election is receiving more than the base rate of family tax benefit Part A

             (1)  As soon as practicable after a carer referred to in subsection 151(4) makes an election, the Registrar must inform:

                     (a)  the Secretary; or

                     (b)  if the Secretary has delegated his or her powers under this section to:

                              (i)  the Chief Executive Centrelink; or

                             (ii)  an officer or employee of the Department;

                            the Chief Executive Centrelink.

             (2)  The Secretary must, by applying clause 10 of Schedule 1 to the Family Assistance Act, decide whether the carer has taken reasonable action to obtain maintenance for the child if it were assumed that:

                     (a)  the election were to take effect; and

                     (b)  if the carer is a claimant for family tax benefit for the child—the carer were entitled to be paid the benefit.

             (3)  The Secretary is taken to approve the election if the Secretary decides that the carer has taken reasonable action to obtain maintenance for the child.

             (4)  The Secretary is taken not to approve the election if the Secretary decides that the carer has not taken reasonable action to obtain maintenance for the child.

             (5)  As soon as practicable after the Secretary makes a decision under this section, the Secretary must tell the Registrar about the decision.

             (6)  As soon as practicable after the Secretary decides not to approve the election, the Secretary must give the carer a written notice setting out the decision.

             (7)  The Secretary may, by writing, delegate all or any of his or her powers under this section to:

                     (a)  the Chief Executive Centrelink; or

                     (b)  an officer or employee of the Department.

##### <a id="151B"></a>151B  Application for assessment/agreement to continue beyond child’s 18th birthday

Note:          For **_full‑time secondary education_**,**_last day_** and **_secondary school_** see section 5.

          (1A)  If a relevant dependent child of a parent turns 18 during a year in which the child is in full‑time secondary education, the parent may apply for the relevant dependent child to be taken into account in any relevant administrative assessment until the last day of the secondary school year in which the child turns 18.

             (2)  The application must be:

                     (a)  made to the Registrar in the manner specified by the Registrar; and

                     (b)  in the case of an application under subsection (1) for a child support agreement to continue in force—signed by both the carer entitled to child support for the child and the liable parent in relation to the child.

Note:          Section 150A provides for the Registrar to specify the manner in which an application may be made.

##### <a id="151C"></a>151C  Application for assessment/agreement to continue—Registrar’s decision

             (1)  The Registrar must either accept or refuse to accept an application under section 151B.

             (2)  The Registrar must accept the application if, and only if, the Registrar is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the child has turned 17; and

                     (b)  either:

                              (i)  if the application is made under subsection 151B(1)—an administrative assessment, or a child support agreement, in relation to the child either is in force, or is likely to be in force, on the day before the child’s 18th birthday; or

                             (ii)  otherwise—an administrative assessment that takes the child into account is in force, or is likely to be in force, on the day before the child’s 18th birthday; and

                     (c)  the child is likely to be in full‑time secondary education on the child’s 18th birthday; and

                     (d)  the child’s 18th birthday will occur on or before the last day of the secondary school year; and

                     (e)  either:

                              (i)  the application is made before the child’s 18th birthday; or

                             (ii)  there are, in the Registrar’s opinion, exceptional circumstances justifying the making of the application after the child’s 18th birthday.

Note:          For **_full‑time secondary education_**, **_last day_** and **_secondary school_** see section 5.

Refusal of application

             (3)  If the Registrar refuses to accept the application, the Registrar must immediately notify the applicant in writing.

Acceptance of application

             (4)  If the Registrar accepts the application, the Registrar must immediately notify the applicant, and the liable parent concerned, in writing.

                     (a)  that the person may, subject to the Registration and Collection Act, object to the particulars of the assessment in relation to which the application under section 151B was made; and

                     (b)  that if the person is aggrieved by the decision on an objection to the particulars of the assessment (no matter who lodges the objection), he or she may, subject to that Act, apply to the SSAT for review of the decision.

             (6)  A contravention of subsection (5) in relation to a decision does not affect the validity of the decision.

             (7)  To avoid doubt, a reference in this section to an **_administrative assessment_** does not include a reference to an assessment made by the Registrar under subsection 93(2).

                     (b)  if the application is to continue a child support agreement in force—to take account of the change effected by subsection (1) to the meaning of **_child support terminating event_** in relation to the child (whether by accepting a subsequent child support agreement or otherwise).

Child to be regarded as aged 17 for purposes of Part 5

          (2A)  If the Registrar accepts the application, the child is to be taken to be aged 17 for the purposes of applying Part 5 to the child throughout the period:

##### <a id="2"></a>2  Child support income ranges—fraction of MTAWE row

             (1)  In each column of the Fraction of MTAWE row are specified 2 amounts. These amounts refer to:

                     (a)  the parents’ combined child support income; or

                     (b)  if only one parent’s income is to be used—the parent’s child support income.

             (2)  To work out the first dollar amount in each column (other than the first column), take the second amount in the previous column (worked under subclause (3)) and add one dollar.

Note:          The first dollar amount in each column is the lowest combined child support income, or child support income, covered by that column.

             (3)  To work out the second dollar amount in each column (other than the last column), multiply the second fraction specified in that column by the annualised MTAWE figure for the relevant September quarter.

Note:          The second dollar amount in each column is the highest combined child support income, or child support income, covered by that column.

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Costs of the children

             (1)  Each item in the Costs of the Children Table sets out a method of working out the costs of the children.

             (2)  If, under section 55G or 55HA, an item is identified in the first column of the table, the **_costs of the children_** is the amount that is the percentage specified in that item of the parents’ combined child support income, or the parent’s child support income, (as the case requires).

             (3)  If, under section 55G or 55HA, an item (the **_relevant item_**) is identified in a row in the second, third, fourth or fifth column (the **_relevant column_**), the **_costs of the children_** is the total of the following amounts:

                    (aa)  the amount worked out for the item in that row in the first column by multiplying the percentage specified in that item by the highest combined child support income, or child support income, covered by that column;

                     (a)  if the relevant column is the third, fourth or fifth column—the amounts worked out for each item in that row in each of the previous columns (other than the first column) by multiplying the percentage specified in that item by the difference between:

                              (i)  the highest combined child support income, or child support income, covered by that column; and

                             (ii)  the highest combined child support income or child support income in the previous column;

                     (b)  in any case—the amount worked out by multiplying the percentage specified in the relevant item by the difference between:

                              (i)  the parents’ combined child support income, or the parent’s child support income, (as the case requires); and

                             (ii)  the highest combined child support income or child support income in the previous column.

             (4)  If, under section 55G or 55HA, an item is identified in a row in the last column, the **_costs of the children_** is the total of the amounts worked out for the items in that row in each of the previous columns in accordance with paragraphs (3)(aa) and (a).

                     (d)  any action taken by the Registrar before the commencement day in respect of the application under section 98G or 98H of Part 6A as in force before the commencement day, is taken to have been made under section 98G or 98H of the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989_ as amended by this Schedule.

(2)       If:

                     (a)  the Registrar has made a determination in respect of an application under Part 6A before the commencement day that the provisions of the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989_ relating to an administrative assessment should be departed from; and

                     (b)  the Registrar has not, before the commencement day, amended the administrative assessment to give effect to the determination;

            the determination is taken to have been made under the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989_ as amended by this Schedule.

(3)       If:

                     (a)  the Registrar has refused to make a determination in respect of an application under Part 6A before the commencement day; and

                     (b)  after the commencement day, the applicant makes another application for a determination in respect of the same administrative assessment;

            then, for the purposes of section 98J of the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989_ as amended by this Schedule, the first application is to be treated as if it had been made under the _Child Support (Amendment) Act 1989_ as amended by this Schedule.

## Schedule 16  

## 79  Transitional provision—child support period starting on 1 July 1999

            Child support is payable by a liable parent to a carer entitled to child support for a child for a day in a child support period starting on 1 July 1999 if:

                     (a)  child support was payable by the liable parent to the carer for the child for 30 June 1999; and

                     (b)  child support would have been payable by the liable parent to the carer for the child for the first day of the 1999‑2000 child support year apart from the amendments made by this Schedule.

## 80  Transitional provision—new assessment when 1998‑99 taxable income figure becomes available

(1)       This item makes special provision relating to child support periods and assessment of child support for the situation where:

                     (a)  child support is payable by a liable parent to a carer entitled to child support for a child for a day in a child support period that starts on or after 1 July 1999 but before 1 June 2000; and

                     (b)  an assessment (the **_tax assessment_**) of the taxable income of the liable parent or carer for the 1998‑99 year of income is made under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ or the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ before 1 June 2000; and

                     (c)  the amount of the taxable income of the liable parent or carer as shown in the tax assessment was not used in making the assessment of child support payable for a day in the child support period.

(2)       Section 34A of the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989_ applies as if the child support period had started before the end of the 1998‑99 year of income.

(3)       However, that section (as applied by this item) does not require the Registrar to make an assessment of child support payable in June 2000 or a later named month.

## Schedule 19  

## 20  Transitional

If an application under section 25 of the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989_ (**_the Act_**) was made in relation to the 1998‑99 child support year, but not determined before the commencement of this Schedule, the application is taken to have been made under the Act as in force after the commencement of this Schedule.

## 8  Instalment periods

## 9  Claims for family benefit that are undetermined as at 1 July 2000

(1)       If:

                     (b)  that claim was not determined before that date; and

                     (c)  the person was, at the time of the claim, or becomes, before 1 July 2000, qualified for family benefit of that kind;

the claim is to be determined under the social security law as in force before 1 July 2000, as if:

                     (d)  the social security law as so in force had continued in force; and

                     (e)  the claim related only to the period preceding 1 July 2000.

(2)       If:

                     (a)  before 1 July 2000, a person lodged a claim for family benefit by way of family allowance or family tax payment in anticipation of becoming qualified for that benefit; and

                     (b)  the claim was not determined by that date; and

                     (c)  the person does not become qualified for the relevant family benefit before 1 July 2000;

the claim is to be taken to have lapsed on that date.

                     (b)  the claim has not been determined before that date; and

                     (c)  the person was, at the time of the claim, or becomes, before 1 July 2000, qualified for family benefit of that kind;

then:

                     (d)  the claim is to be determined under the social security law as in force before 1 July 2000 as if the law as so in force had continued: and

                     (e)  if parenting payment would be paid under the law as so in force at the rate applicable for non‑benefit PP (partnered)—the claim is to be determined as if it related only to the period preceding 1 July 2000.

(4)       If:

                     (a)  before 1 July 2000, a person lodged a claim for parenting payment in anticipation of becoming qualified for that payment; and

                     (b)  the claim was not determined by that date; and

                     (c)  the person does not become qualified for parenting payment before 1 July 2000; and

                     (d)  if the person were to become qualified for parenting payment on or after that date—it would be parenting payment in the nature of non‑benefit PP (partnered) and not some other form of parenting payment;

the claim is to be taken to have lapsed on that date.

## 10  Certain claims for family benefit will be admitted on or after 1 July 2000

(1)       In this item:

**_backdated claim period_** means a period after the occurrence of a particular event during which a claim for family benefit with effect from that event will be allowed.

(2)       If:

                     (a)  a person did not make a claim for family benefit before 1 July 2000; and

                     (b)  but for the amendment of the social security law with effect from 1 July 2000, if the person had made such a claim after that date, the backdated claim period would have extended back to the occurrence of a particular event before that date;

then:

                     (c)  the person may make such a claim on or after 1 July 2000 as if those amendments had not been made; and

                     (d)  the claim can be dealt with in so far as the backdated claim period would permit a claim in respect of a period before 1 July 2000.

## 11  Transfer of claims for maternity allowance or maternity immunisation allowance from social security law to family assistance law

(1)       If:

                     (a)  a person claims maternity allowance or maternity immunisation allowance under the social security law before 1 July 2000; and

                     (b)  the claim has not been determined as at that date;

the claim is to be treated as if it were a claim for MAT or MIA under Division 3 of Part 3 of the Family Assistance Administration Act as amended by this Act and not as such a claim for the corresponding allowance under the _Social Security Act 1991_.

(2)       If a person purports to claim maternity allowance or maternity immunisation allowance under the social security law on or after 1 July 2000, that claim is to be treated as if it were a claim for MAT or MIA, as the case requires, under Division 3 of Part 3 of the Family Assistance Administration Act as amended by this Act and not as such a claim for the corresponding allowance under the social security law.

(3)       A person who has been paid maternity allowance or maternity immunisation allowance under the social security law  in respect of a particular child cannot claim MAT or MIA for the same child under Division 3 of Part 3 of the Family Assistance Administration Act as amended by this Act.

## 12  Applications for family benefit, maternity allowance or maternity immunisation allowance made after 1 July 2000 on behalf of another person

(1)       If:

                     (a)  an amount of family benefit is payable to a person; and

                     (b)  the person dies before receiving that amount; and

                     (c)  another person applies, on or after 1 July 2000, to receive the amount; and

                     (d)  the application is made:

                              (i)  within 26 weeks after the first person’s death; or

                             (ii)  within such further period as is allowed by the Secretary in the special circumstances of the case;

the Secretary may pay the amount to the person who, in the Secretary’s opinion, is best entitled to it.

(2)       If:

                     (a)  an amount of maternity allowance or maternity immunisation allowance claimed under the social security law is payable to a person in respect of a particular child; and

                     (b)  the person dies before receiving that amount; and

                     (c)  another person applies, on or after 1 July 2000, to receive the amount; and

                     (d)  the application is made:

                              (i)  within 26 weeks after the first person’s death; or

                             (ii)  within such further period as is allowed by the Secretary in the special circumstances of the case;

the Secretary may pay the amount to the person who, in the Secretary’s opinion, is best entitled to it.

(3)       If the Secretary pays an amount under subitem (1) in respect of family benefit of a particular kind claimed under the social security law, the Commonwealth has no further liability to any person in respect of family benefit of that kind under the social security law or in respect of any family benefit of a like kind under the family assistance law.

(4)       If the Secretary pays an amount under subitem (2) in respect of a particular child, the Commonwealth has no further liability to any person in respect of maternity allowance or maternity immunisation allowance under the social security law, or in respect of MAT or MIA under the family assistance law, in respect of that child.

(5)       For the purpose of Part 5 of the Family Assistance Administration Act, a decision of the Secretary under subitem (1) or (2) has effect as if it were a decision of an officer under the family assistance law.

## 13  Claims for advance payment under Social Security Law

(1)       If:

                     (a)  an individual had, under section 864A of the _Social Security Act 1991_ as in force before 1 July 2000, requested a family allowance advance in respect of an advance period, within the meaning of that Act, that ended before 1 July 2000, and all subsequent advance periods; and

                     (b)  that request had been granted;

the grant has effect, in relation to the advance period commencing on 1 July 2000 and all subsequent advance periods as if:

                     (c)  it were a grant made under section 33 of the Family Assistance Administration Act as amended by this Act; and

                     (d)  it related not to qualification for family allowance advance but rather to an entitlement to family tax benefit advance in relation to the individual’s family tax benefit as determined by the Secretary in accordance with item 6.

(2)       For the avoidance of doubt, an individual who is treated, by virtue of the operation of subitem (1), as having made and been granted a request under section 33 of the Family Assistance Administration Act as amended by this Act, may on 1 July 2000, or at any time after that date, withdraw the request in so far as it is treated as relating to standard advance periods within the meaning of that Act as so amended for which the individual has not been paid a family tax benefit advance.

## 14  Saving provision relating to information collection

If:

                     (a)  family benefit, or maternity allowance or maternity immunisation allowance claimed under the social security law, is payable to a person; and

                     (b)  the Secretary decides, on or after  1 July 2000, to seek further information in relation to the benefit or allowance;

the Secretary may, under Division 1 of Part 5 of the _Social Security (Administration) Act 1999_, require the provision of information concerning that benefit or allowance, or concerning the person to whom it is payable, as if that benefit or allowance had continued, on and after 1 July 2000, to be a social security payment as defined for the purposes of the _Social Security (Administration) Act 1999_.

## 15  Portability

(1)       If:

                     (a)  immediately before 1 July 2000, an individual

                              (i)  is receiving family benefit in the nature of family allowance in respect of another individual; or

                             (ii)  is receiving family benefit in the nature of parenting payment because the individual has a PP child; and

                     (b)  the person in respect of whom, or because of whom, that benefit is received (the **_child_**) is absent from Australia immediately before that date because:

                              (i)  having left Australia, the child has not returned before that date; or

                             (ii)  having been born outside   Australia, the child has not subsequently come to Australia before that date;

the child is not, if that absence extends for a period of 3 years beginning on the first day of the absence, an FTB child at any time after the period of 3 years ends.

(2)       In determining whether the period of absence of the child extends for 3 years beginning on the first day of the child’s absence:

                     (a)  any return or coming to Australia before 1 July 2000 that would have been disregarded under the _Social Security Act 1991_ as in force before that date had that Act as so in force continued unamended after that date is to be disregarded for the purposes of subitem (1); and

                     (b)  any return or coming to Australia on or after 1 July 2000 that would have been disregarded under section 24 of the Family Assistance Act as amended by this Act if that section were to have applied to the person is also to be disregarded for the purposes of that subitem.

(3)       If:

                     (a)  the child referred to in paragraph (1)(b) is absent from Australia for a continuous period of more than 26 weeks (whether or not that 26 weeks ends before 1 July 2000); and

                     (b)  an individual having an entitlement to family tax benefit in respect of the child is not an absent overseas recipient within the meaning of subsection 62(2) of the Family Assistance Act as amended by this Act during any part of the child’s absence from Australia occurring after 26 weeks and after the individual becomes so entitled;

Schedule 1 to the Family Assistance Act as so amended applies in relation to that entitlement during that part of the child’s absence that is referred to in paragraph (b) with the modifications set out in the table included in subsection 63(4) of that Act as so amended.

(4)       If:

                     (a)  the child referred to in paragraph (1)(b) is absent from Australia for a continuous period of more than 26 weeks (whether or not that 26 weeks ends before 1 July 2000); and

                     (b)  the child comes to Australia; and

                     (c)  the child leaves Australia less than 26 weeks after coming to Australia; and

                     (d)  an individual having an entitlement to family tax benefit in respect of the child is not an absent overseas recipient within the meaning of subsection 62(2) of the Family Assistance Act as amended by this Act during any part of the child’s absence from Australia referred to in paragraph (c) after the individual becomes so entitled;

Schedule 1 to the Family Assistance Act as so amended applies in relation to that entitlement during that part of the child’s absence that is referred to in paragraph (d) from Australia with the modifications set out in the table included in subsection 63(4) of that Act as so amended.

                     (a)  a child died less than 4 weeks before 1 July 2000; and 

                     (b)  at the time of the child’s death, the child was the only PP child of a person; and

                     (c)  under section 512A of the _Social Security Act 1991_ as in force immediately before 1 July 2000, if that section had continued in force after that date, the person would, but for this item, have qualified to continue to receive that parenting payment for the period of 4 weeks that starts on the day following the day of the child’s death;

so much of the parenting payment as would have been payable in respect of each day in that 4 week period that occurs after 30 June 2000:

                     (d)  continues to be payable as if section 512A of that Act as so in force had not been repealed but had so provided; and

                     (e)  is payable as a single lump sum on, or as soon as practicable after, 1 July 2000.

(2)       For the purposes of Part 4 of the _Social Security (Administration) Act 1999_, a decision made for the purposes of section 512A of the _Social Security Act 1991_ as continued in force for the purposes of subitem (1) has effect as a decision of an officer under the social security law.

## 17  Lump sum bereavement payments for certain persons receiving family tax payment at death of child
