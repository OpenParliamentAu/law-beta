Authorising officers to exercise monitoring powers

             (3)  The CEO may authorise in writing an officer to enter premises and exercise monitoring powers:

                     (a)  generally; or

                     (b)  during a specified period; or

                     (c)  in or on specified premises; or

                     (d)  during a specified period in or on specified premises.

Availability of assistance and use of force in exercising monitoring powers

             (4)  In entering premises and exercising monitoring powers:

                     (a)  a monitoring officer may obtain such assistance; and

                     (b)  a monitoring officer or a person assisting a monitoring officer may use such force against things;

as is necessary and reasonable in the circumstances.

Monitoring powers to be used only as authorised

             (5)  This Subdivision does not allow:

                     (a)  an officer who is authorised to enter premises and exercise monitoring powers during a specified period to enter the premises or exercise the powers at a time outside that period; or

                     (b)  an officer who is authorised to enter, and exercise monitoring powers in or on, specified premises to enter, or to exercise the powers in or on, other premises.

214ACA  Monitoring officer to notify occupier of premises of the occupier’s rights and obligations

                   Before exercising monitoring powers in respect of premises, a monitoring officer must give to the occupier of the premises a written notice setting out the occupier’s rights and obligations under this Subdivision.

214AD  Notice of proposal to exercise monitoring powers

                   Before seeking consent under section 214AE to enter premises and exercise monitoring powers there, a monitoring officer may give to the occupier of the premises written notice stating that the officer wishes to enter the premises and exercise monitoring powers and specifying the period from the giving of the notice during which the officer wishes to exercise the powers.

Note:          If the occupier had, before a notice is given under section 214AD, made to Customs a statement that was false or misleading, a voluntary notification made by the occupier after the notice is given is not a defence to a prosecution for an offence against section 243T or 243U in respect of the statement.

214AE  Exercise of monitoring powers with consent

             (1)  A monitoring officer may enter, and exercise monitoring powers in or on, premises to the extent that it is reasonably necessary for the purpose of assessing:

                     (a)  whether a person is complying with a Customs-related law; or

                     (b)  whether a person’s record-keeping, accounting, computing or other operating systems of any kind accurately record and generate information to enable compliance with a Customs-related law; or

                     (c)  the correctness of information communicated by a person to Customs (whether in documentary or other form).

             (2)  However, a monitoring officer must not enter premises under this section unless the occupier of the premises has consented to monitoring officer entering, and exercising monitoring powers in or on, the premises.

             (3)  Before obtaining such a consent, a monitoring officer must tell the occupier of the premises that he or she can refuse consent.

             (4)  A consent may be expressed to be limited to entry to, and the exercise of monitoring powers in or on, the premises to which the consent relates during a particular period unless the consent is withdrawn before the end of that period.

             (5)  A consent that is not limited as mentioned in subsection (4) has effect in relation to any entry to, and any exercise of monitoring powers in or on, the premises to which the consent relates until the consent is withdrawn.

             (6)  Before a monitoring officer enters premises or exercises any monitoring powers, he or she must produce his or her identity card to the occupier.

             (7)  A monitoring officer must leave the premises if the occupier withdraws the consent.

             (8)  A consent, or a withdrawal of consent, does not have effect unless the consent or withdrawal is in writing.

214AF  Exercise of monitoring powers under a warrant

             (1)  A monitoring officer may apply to a magistrate for a warrant under this section in relation to particular premises.

             (2)  The magistrate must issue a warrant if satisfied, by information on oath or affirmation, that it is reasonably necessary that the monitoring officer should have access to the premises for the purpose of assessing:

                     (a)  whether a person is complying with a Customs-related law; or

                     (b)  whether a person’s record-keeping, accounting, computing or other operating systems of any kind accurately record and generate information to enable compliance with a Customs-related law; or

                     (c)  the correctness of information communicated by a person to Customs (whether in documentary or other form).

             (3)  If the magistrate requires further information about the grounds on which the issue of the warrant is applied for, he or she must not issue the warrant until the monitoring officer or someone else has given the magistrate the further information, either orally (on oath or affirmation) or by affidavit.

             (4)  The warrant must:

                     (a)  state the purpose for which the warrant is issued; and

                     (b)  identify the premises to which the warrant relates; and

                     (c)  name the monitoring officer who is responsible for executing the warrant; and

                     (d)  authorise any monitoring officer named in the warrant to enter the premises and exercise monitoring powers from time to time while the warrant remains in force, with such assistance, and using such force against things, as are necessary and reasonable; and

                     (e)  state the hours during which entry under the warrant is authorised to be made; and

                      (f)  specify the day (not more than 6 months after the day of issue of the warrant) on which the warrant ceases to have effect.

             (5)  A magistrate in a particular State or Territory may issue a warrant in respect of premises in another State or Territory.

214AG  Warrants may be granted by telephone or other electronic means

             (1)  A monitoring officer may apply to a magistrate for a warrant in relation to premises by telephone, telex, fax or other electronic means (of any kind):

                     (a)  in an urgent case; or

                     (b)  if the delay that would occur if an application were made in person would frustrate the effective execution of the warrant.

             (2)  The magistrate may require communication by voice to the extent that is practicable in the circumstances.

             (3)  An application under this section must include all information required to be provided in an application for a warrant under section 214AF but the application may, if necessary, be made before the information is sworn.

             (4)  The magistrate must complete and sign the same form of warrant used under section 214AF as soon as he or she:

                     (a)  has considered the information included in the application under this section, and the further information (if any) required by him or her; and

                     (b)  is satisfied that:

                              (i)  a warrant in the terms of the application should be issued urgently; or

                             (ii)  the delay that would occur if an application were made in person would frustrate the effective execution of the warrant.

             (5)  If the magistrate decides to issue the warrant, the magistrate is to tell the applicant, by telephone, telex, fax or other electronic means, of the terms of the warrant and the day and time when it was signed.

             (6)  The applicant must then complete a form of warrant in terms substantially corresponding to those given by the magistrate, stating on the form the name of the magistrate and the day and time when the warrant was signed.

             (7)  The applicant must give or send to the magistrate the form of warrant completed by the applicant and, if the information referred to in subsection (3) was not sworn, that information duly sworn. The applicant must do so not later than the day after the earlier of the following days:

                     (a)  the day of expiry of the warrant;

                     (b)  the day on which the warrant was first executed.

             (8)  The magistrate is to attach to the documents provided under subsection (7) the form of warrant completed by the magistrate.

             (9)  If:

                     (a)  it is material, in any proceedings, for a court to be satisfied that the exercise of a power under a warrant issued under this section was duly authorised; and

                     (b)  the form of warrant signed by the magistrate is not produced in evidence;

the court is to assume, unless the contrary is proved, that the exercise of the power was not duly authorised.

214AH  Monitoring officer may ask questions

             (1)  If a monitoring officer is in or on premises that he or she entered with the consent of the occupier of the premises, the officer may request the occupier to answer any questions put by the monitoring officer, but the occupier is not obliged to comply with the request.

             (2)  If a monitoring officer is in or on premises that he or she has entered under a warrant issued under section 214AF or 214AG, the officer may require any person on the premises to answer any questions put by the monitoring officer if the occupier of the premises, or a representative previously nominated to Customs by the occupier, is unavailable to do so or absent from the premises.

Note:          Failure to answer a question put under this subsection is an offence. See section 243SA.

214AI  Monitoring officer may ask for assistance

             (1)  If a monitoring officer is in or on premises that he or she entered with the consent of the occupier of the premises under section 214AE, the officer may request the occupier to provide reasonable assistance to the officer at any time while the officer is entitled to remain in or on the premises, but the occupier is not obliged to comply with the request.

             (2)  If a monitoring officer is in or on premises that he or she entered under a warrant issued under section 214AF or 214AG, the officer may require the occupier to provide reasonable assistance to the officer at any time while the officer is entitled to remain on the premises.

             (3)  The monitoring officer may request or require the assistance for the purpose of the exercise of monitoring powers by the officer in relation to the premises.

                     (b)  the data recorded on the equipment is damaged or programs associated with its use are damaged or corrupted;

because:

                     (c)  insufficient care was exercised in selecting the person who was to operate the equipment; or

                     (d)  insufficient care was exercised by the person operating the equipment.

             (2)  The Commonwealth must pay to the owner of the equipment, or the user of the data or programs, such reasonable compensation for the damage or corruption as they agree on.

             (3)  However, if the owner or user and the Commonwealth fail to agree, the owner or user may institute proceedings against the Commonwealth in the Federal Court of Australia for such reasonable amount of compensation as the Court determines.

             (4)  In determining the amount of compensation payable, regard is to be had to whether the occupier of the premises or the occupier’s employees and agents, if they were available at the time, provided any appropriate warning or guidance on the operation of the equipment.

             (5)  Compensation is payable out of money appropriated by the Parliament.

             (6)  For the purposes of subsection (1), **_damage to data_** includes damage by erasure of data or addition of other data.

             (7)  Customs must not authorise the delivery of goods referred to in subsection (4) or (5) unless the duty (if any) and any other charge (other than self-assessed clearance charge payable under an arrangement made under subsection 71AAB(2)) or tax (if any) payable on the importation of goods has been paid.

             (8)  If, after Customs has authorised delivery of goods into home consumption under paragraph (4)(a) or (5)(a) and before the goods are so dealt with, an officer has reasonable grounds to suspect that the goods were imported into Australia in contravention of a Customs-related law, the officer may suspend the authority for a specified period by:

                     (a)  signing a notice:

                              (i)  stating that the authority is so suspended; and

                             (ii)  setting out the reasons for the suspension;

                            and serving a copy of the notice on the owner of the goods or, if the owner does not have possession of the goods, on the person who has possession of the goods; or

                     (b)  by sending electronically to the person who made the self-assessed clearance declaration a message stating that the authority is so suspended and setting out the reasons for the suspension.

             (9)  If, during the suspension under subsection (8) of an authority, an officer becomes satisfied that there are no longer reasonable grounds to suspect that the goods were imported into Australia in contravention of a Customs-related law, the officer must revoke the suspension by:

                     (a)  signing a notice stating that the suspension is revoked and serving a copy of the notice on the owner of the goods or, if the owner does not have possession of the goods, on the person who has possession of the goods; or

                     (b)  by sending electronically to the person who made the self-assessed clearance declaration a message stating that the suspension is revoked.

           (10)  A suspension of an authority, or the revocation of a suspension of an authority, has effect from the time when the relevant notice was given or the relevant message was sent, as the case may be.

71AAA  Liability for self-assessed clearance declaration charge

             (1)  Subject to this section, when a self-assessed clearance declaration is communicated to Customs in accordance with subsection 71(2), the person who sent the communication becomes liable to pay self-assessed clearance declaration charge in respect of the declaration.

             (3)  Self-assessed clearance declaration charge is not payable in respect of a declaration relating to goods if:

                     (a)  the owner of the goods, or a person acting on behalf of the owner, communicated an abbreviated cargo report (as defined by section 63A) in respect of the goods; or

                     (b)  the owner of the goods is a person, or is a person included in a class of persons, declared by the regulations to be exempt from payment of self-assessed clearance declaration charge.

71AAB  Payment of self-assessed clearance declaration charge

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  the CEO has not made an arrangement with a person under subsection (2); or

                     (b)  an arrangement made under subsection (2) with a person is terminated in the circumstances set out in subsection (4);

the person must, within 21 days after the person is notified by Customs of the total amount of all the self-assessed clearance declaration charges for which the person becomes liable during each month, pay that amount to the Commonwealth.

             (2)  The CEO may make an arrangement with a person under which the person agrees to pay self-assessed clearance declaration charge to the Commonwealth in the manner provided in the arrangement.

Subdivision B—Import declarations

71A  Making an import declaration

             (1)  An import declaration is a communication to Customs in accordance with this section of information about:

                     (a)  goods to which section 68 applies; or

                     (b)  warehoused goods;

that are intended to be entered for home consumption.

             (2)  An import declaration can be communicated by document or electronically.

             (3)  A documentary import declaration must:

                     (a)  be made by the owner of the goods concerned; and

                     (b)  be communicated to Customs:

                              (i)  by giving or sending it to an officer doing duty in relation to import declarations; or

                             (ii)  by leaving it at a place that has been allocated for lodgment of import declarations in a Customs Office;

                            at the place at which the goods are to be delivered for home consumption.

             (4)  An electronic import declaration can be communicated only by the owner of the goods concerned.

             (5)  If the information communicated to Customs in an import declaration relating to goods adequately identifies any permission (however it is described) that has been given for the importation of those goods, the identification of the permission in that information is taken, for the purposes of any law of the Commonwealth (including this Act), to be the production of the permission to an officer.

             (6)  However, subsection (5) does not affect any power of an officer, under this Act, to require the production of a permission referred to in that subsection.

             (7)  If:

                     (a)  an import declaration is, or is taken under section 71L to have been, communicated to Customs; and

                     (b)  before the time when the declaration is, or is so taken to have been, communicated to Customs, the goods to which the declaration relates have been imported or have been brought to the first port or airport in Australia at which any goods are to be discharged;

the goods are taken to have been entered for home consumption.

             (8)  If:

                     (a)  an import declaration is, or is taken under section 71L to have been, communicated to Customs; and

                     (b)  at the time when the declaration is, or is so taken to have been, communicated to Customs, the goods to which the declaration relates have not been brought to the first port or airport in Australia at which any goods are to be discharged;

the goods are taken to be entered for home consumption only when they are brought to that port or airport.

71B  Liability for import declaration processing charge

             (1)  When an import declaration (including an altered import declaration) in respect of goods to which section 68 applies (other than warehoused goods) is, or is taken to have been, communicated to Customs under section 71A, the owner of the goods becomes liable to pay import declaration processing charge in respect of the declaration.

             (2)  If a person who is an owner of goods pays import declaration processing charge in respect of an import declaration relating to particular goods, any other person who is an owner of those goods ceases to be liable to pay charge in respect of that declaration.

             (3)  If an import declaration is withdrawn under subsection 71F(1), or is taken, under subsection 71F(2) or (7), to have been withdrawn, before the issue of an authority to deal in respect of goods covered by the declaration, then, despite subsection (1), the owner of the goods is not liable to pay import declaration processing charge in respect of the declaration.

71BA  Warehoused goods declaration fee

             (1)  An owner of warehoused goods who makes an import declaration in respect of the goods is liable to pay a fee (the **_warehoused goods declaration fee_**) for the processing by Customs of the declaration.

             (2)  The amount of the warehoused goods declaration fee is:

                     (a)  if the import declaration is made electronically—$23.20 or, if another amount (not exceeding $34.80) is prescribed by the regulations, the amount so prescribed; or

                     (b)  if the import declaration is made by document—$60.00 or, if another amount (not exceeding $90.00) is prescribed by the regulations, the amount so prescribed.

             (3)  If a person who is an owner of warehoused goods pays the warehoused goods declaration fee for the processing of an import declaration in respect of the goods, any other person who is an owner of the goods ceases to be liable to pay the fee for the processing of the import declaration.

             (4)  In this section:

                    <a name="wareh-good"></a>**_warehoused goods_** includes goods that, under section 100, may be dealt with as warehoused goods.

71C  Authority to deal with goods in respect of which an import declaration has been made

             (1)  If an import declaration in respect of goods has been communicated to Customs, Customs must give an import declaration advice, by document or electronically, in accordance with this section.

             (2)  An import declaration advice relating to goods entered by documentary import declaration:

                     (a)  must be given to the owner of the goods or be made available for collection by leaving it at a place in a Customs office that has been allocated for collection of such advices; and

                     (b)  must contain:

                              (i)  a statement to the effect that the goods are cleared for home consumption; or

                             (ii)  a statement that the goods are directed to be held in their current location or are directed for further examination.

             (3)  An import declaration advice relating to goods entered by an electronic import declaration:

                     (a)  must refer to the number given by Customs to identify the particular import declaration; and

                     (b)  must be communicated electronically to the person who made the declaration; and

                     (c)  must contain:

                              (i)  a statement to the effect that the goods are cleared for home consumption; or

                             (ii)  a statement that the goods are directed to be held in their current location or are directed for further examination.

             (4)  Subject to subsection (5), if:

                     (a)  an import declaration advice is given or communicated under this section; and

                     (b)  a payment is made of any duty, GST, luxury car tax, wine tax, import declaration processing charge or other charge or fee payable at the time of entry of, or in respect of, the goods covered by the import declaration advice;

Customs must:

                     (c)  if the advice was given under subsection (2)—give the person to whom the advice was given an authority, in writing, to take the goods into home consumption; and

                     (d)  if the advice was communicated electronically under subsection (3)—communicate electronically, to the person to whom the advice was communicated, an authority to take the goods into home consumption.

             (5)  Customs is not required to give or communicate an authority under subsection (4) while the goods concerned are subject to a direction referred to in subparagraph (2)(b)(ii) or (3)(c)(ii).

             (6)  Customs must give an authority under subsection (4) in relation to goods covered by item 2 of the table in subsection 132AA(1) if subsection (4) would require Customs to do so apart from paragraph (4)(b).

Note:          Subsection 132AA(1) provides that import duty on goods covered by item 2 of the table in that subsection must be paid by a time worked out under the regulations.

             (7)  Customs must give an authority under subsection (4) in relation to goods if:

                     (a)  that subsection would require Customs to do so apart from the fact that any or all of the following were not paid when duty on the goods was paid (or would have been payable if the goods had been subject to duty):

                              (i)  the GST payable on the taxable importation (as defined in the GST Act), if any, that is associated with the import of the goods;

                             (ii)  if a taxable importation of a luxury car (as defined in the Luxury Car Tax Act) is associated with the import of the goods—the luxury car tax payable on that taxable importation;

                            (iii)  if a taxable dealing (as defined in the Wine Tax Act) is associated with the import of the goods—the wine tax payable on that dealing; and

                     (b)  because of the following provisions, the unpaid GST, luxury car tax or wine tax (as appropriate) was not payable until after duty on the goods was payable (or would have been payable if the goods had been subject to duty):

                              (i)  paragraph 33-15(b) of the GST Act;

                             (ii)  paragraph 13-20(b) of the Luxury Car Tax Act;

                            (iii)  paragraph 23-5(b) of the Wine Tax Act.

             (8)  If goods are authorised to be taken into home consumption, the authority to deal, whether given by a document or electronically, must set out:

                     (a)  any condition of the kind referred to in subsection (9) to which the authority is subject; and

                     (b)  the date on which the authority is given; and

                     (c)  such other information as is prescribed.

             (9)  An authority to deal with goods may be expressed to be subject to a condition that a specified permission for the goods to be dealt with (however it is described) be obtained under another law of the Commonwealth.

           (10)  If an authority to deal with goods is expressed to be subject to the condition that a specified permission be obtained, the authority is taken not to have been given until the permission has been obtained.

           (11)  An officer may, at any time before goods authorised to be taken into home consumption are so dealt with, cancel the authority:

                     (a)  if the authority was given in respect of a documentary declaration, by:

                              (i)  signing a notice stating that the authority is cancelled and setting out the reasons for the cancellation; and

                             (ii)  serving a copy of the notice on the person who made the declaration or, if that person does not have possession of the goods, on the person who has possession of the goods; or

                     (b)  if the authority was given in respect of an electronic declaration—by sending electronically, to the person who made the declaration, a message stating that the authority is cancelled and setting out the reasons for the cancellation.

           (12)  If, at any time before goods authorised to be taken into home consumption are so dealt with, an officer has reasonable grounds to suspect that the goods were imported into Australia in contravention of any Customs-related law, the officer may suspend the authority for a specified period:

                     (a)  if the authority was given in respect of a documentary declaration, by:

                              (i)  signing a notice stating that the authority is so suspended and setting out the reasons for the suspension; and

                             (ii)  serving a copy of the notice on the person who made the declaration or, if that person does not have possession of the goods, on the person who has possession of the goods; or

                     (b)  if the authority was given in respect of an electronic declaration—by sending electronically, to the person who made the declaration, a message stating that the authority is so suspended and setting out the reasons for the suspension.

           (13)  If, during the suspension under subsection (12) of an authority, an officer becomes satisfied that there are no longer reasonable grounds to suspect that the goods were imported into Australia in contravention of a Customs-related law, the officer must revoke the suspension:

                     (a)  if the authority was given in respect of a documentary declaration, by:

                              (i)  signing a notice stating that the suspension is revoked; and

                             (ii)  serving a copy of the notice on the person to whom the notice of the suspension was given; or

                     (b)  if the authority was given in respect of an electronic declaration—by sending electronically, to the person to whom the message notifying the suspension was sent, a message stating that the suspension is revoked.

           (14)  A cancellation or suspension of an authority, or a revocation of a suspension of an authority, has effect from the time when the relevant notice is served or the relevant message is sent, as the case may be.

71D  Visual examination in presence of officer

             (1)  If a person who is permitted or required to make an import declaration in respect of goods to which section 68 applies does not have the information to complete the declaration, the person may apply to Customs, by document or electronically, for permission to examine the goods in the presence of an officer.

             (2)  A documentary application must be communicated to Customs by giving it to an officer doing duty in relation to import declarations.

             (3)  When an application is given to an officer under subsection (2) or is sent electronically, an officer must, by writing or by message sent electronically, give the applicant permission to examine the goods on a day and at a place specified in the notice.

             (4)  A person who has received a permission may examine the goods in accordance with the permission in the presence of an officer.

71DA  An officer may seek additional information

             (1)  Without limiting the information that may be required to be included in an import declaration, if an import declaration has been made in respect of goods, authority to deal with the goods may be refused until an officer doing duty in relation to import declarations:

                     (a)  has verified particulars of the goods shown in the import declaration; or

                     (b)  is satisfied of any other matter that may be relevant to the granting of an authority to deal.

             (2)  If an officer doing duty in relation to import declarations believes, on reasonable grounds, that the owner of goods to which an import declaration relates has custody or control of commercial documents, or has, or can obtain, information, relating to the goods that will assist the officer to determine whether this Act has been or is being complied with in respect of the goods, the officer may require the owner:

                     (a)  to deliver to the officer the commercial documents in respect of the goods that are in the owner’s custody or control (including any such documents that had previously been delivered to an officer and had been returned to the owner); or

                     (b)  to deliver to the officer such information, in writing, relating to the goods (being information of a kind specified in the notice) as is within the knowledge of the owner or as the owner is reasonably able to obtain.

             (3)  A documentary requirement for the delivery of documents or information in respect of an import declaration must:

                     (a)  be communicated to the person by whom, or on whose behalf, the declaration was communicated; and

                     (b)  be in an approved form and contain such particulars as the form requires.

             (4)  An electronic requirement for the delivery of documents or information in respect of an import declaration must:

                     (a)  be communicated electronically to the person who made the declaration; and

                     (b)  contain such particulars as are set out in an approved statement.

             (5)  An officer doing duty in relation to import declarations may ask:

                     (a)  the owner of goods in respect of which an import declaration has been made; and

                     (b)  if another person made the declaration on behalf of the owner—that other person;

any questions relating to the goods.

             (6)  If an officer doing duty in relation to import declarations believes, on reasonable grounds, that the owner of goods to which an import declaration relates has custody or control of documents, or has, or can obtain, information, relating to the goods that will assist the officer to verify the particulars shown in the import declaration, the officer may require the owner to produce the documents or supply the information to the officer.

             (7)  If:

                     (a)  the owner of goods has been required to deliver documents or information in relation to the goods under subsection (2); or

                     (b)  the owner of, or the person making an import declaration in respect of, goods has been asked a question in respect of the goods under subsection (5); or

                     (c)  the owner of goods has been required to verify a matter in respect of the goods under subsection (6);

authority to deal with the relevant goods in accordance with the declaration must not be granted unless:

                     (d)  the requirement referred to in paragraph (a) has been complied with or withdrawn; or

                     (e)  the question referred to in paragraph (b) has been answered or withdrawn; or

                      (f)  the requirement referred to in paragraph (c) has been complied with or withdrawn, or a security has been taken for compliance with the requirement;

as the case requires.

             (8)  Subject to section 215, if a person delivers a commercial document to an officer doing duty in relation to import declarations under this section, the officer must deal with the document and then return it to the person.

Subdivision C—Requests for cargo release

71DB  Making a request for cargo release

             (1)  A request for cargo release (an **_RCR_**) in respect of goods is a communication to Customs in accordance with this section of a request for the release of goods to which section 68 applies that are intended to be entered for home consumption.

             (2)  An RCR must be communicated electronically.

             (3)  An RCR can be made only:

                     (a)  by a person who has entered into an import information contract or by a customs broker nominated in the contract to make communications to Customs on behalf of the person; and

                     (b)  while the contract is in force.

             (4)  An RCR must contain the information contained in an approved statement.

             (5)  If the information communicated to Customs in an RCR in respect of goods adequately identifies any permission (however it is described) that has been given for the importation of those goods, the identification of the permission in that information is taken, for the purposes of any law of the Commonwealth (including this Act), to be the production of the permission to an officer.

             (6)  However, subsection (5) does not affect any power of an officer, under this Act, to require the production of a permission referred to in that subsection.

             (7)  If:

                     (a)  an RCR in respect of goods is, or is taken under section 71L to have been, communicated to Customs; and

                     (b)  before the time when the RCR is, or is so taken to have been, communicated to Customs, the goods to which the RCR relates have been imported or have been brought to the first port or airport in Australia at which any goods are to be discharged;

the goods are taken to have been entered for home consumption.

             (8)  If:

                     (a)  an RCR in respect of goods is, or is taken under section 71L to have been, communicated to Customs; and

                     (b)  at the time when the RCR is, or is so taken to have been, communicated to Customs, the goods have not been brought to the first port or airport in Australia at which any goods are to be discharged;

the goods are taken to be entered for home consumption only when they are brought to that port or airport.

71DC  Liability for an RCR processing charge

             (1)  When a person who has entered into an import information contract sends an RCR to Customs, the person becomes liable to pay an RCR processing charge in respect of the RCR.

             (2)  The charge is payable when the person is taken to have sent to Customs a periodic declaration in respect of goods to which the RCR relates.

             (3)  If an RCR is withdrawn under subsection 71F(1), or is taken to be withdrawn under subsection 71F(2) or (7), before the issue of an authority to deal in respect of goods covered by the RCR, then, despite subsection (1), the person is not liable to pay an RCR processing charge in respect of the RCR.

71DD  Making of import information contracts

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), the CEO may enter into a contract (an **_import information contract_**) with a person for the purpose of enabling the person to make RCRs in respect of goods.

             (2)  A warehouse declaration may be communicated by document or electronically.

             (3)  A documentary warehouse declaration must:

                     (a)  be made by the owner of the goods concerned; and

                     (b)  be communicated to Customs:

                              (i)  by giving or sending it to an officer doing duty in relation to warehouse declarations; or

                             (ii)  by leaving it at a place that has been allocated for lodgment of warehouse declarations in a Customs Office;

             (4)  A warehouse declaration in respect of particular goods can be communicated electronically only by the owner of the goods.

             (5)  If the information communicated to Customs in a warehouse declaration relating to goods adequately identifies any permission (however it is described) that has been given for the importation of those goods, the identification of the permission in that information is taken, for the purposes of any law of the Commonwealth (including this Act), to be the production of the permission to an officer.

             (6)  However, subsection (5) does not affect any power of an officer, under this Act, to require the production of a permission referred to in that subsection.

             (7)  If:

                     (a)  a warehouse declaration is, or is taken under section 71L to have been, communicated to Customs; and

                     (b)  before the time when the declaration is, or is so taken to have been, communicated to Customs, the goods to which the declaration relates have been imported or have been brought to the first port or airport in Australia at which any goods are to be discharged;

the goods are taken to have been entered for warehousing.

             (8)  If:

                     (a)  a warehouse declaration is, or is taken under section 71L to have been, communicated to Customs; and

                     (b)  at the time when the warehouse declaration is, or is so taken to have been, communicated to Customs, the goods to which the declaration relates have not been brought to the first port or airport in Australia at which any goods are to be discharged;

the goods are taken to be entered for warehousing only when they are brought to that port or airport.

71DI  Liability for warehouse declaration processing charge

             (1)  When a warehouse declaration (including an altered warehouse declaration) in respect of goods is, or is taken to have been, communicated to Customs under section 71DH, the owner of the goods becomes liable to pay warehouse declaration processing charge in respect of the declaration.

             (2)  If a person who is an owner of goods pays warehouse declaration processing charge in respect of a warehouse declaration relating to particular goods, any other person who is an owner of those goods ceases to be liable to pay charge in respect of that declaration.

             (3)  If a warehouse declaration is withdrawn under subsection 71F(1), or is taken, under subsection 71F(2) or (7), to have been withdrawn, before the issue of an authority to deal in respect of goods covered by the declaration, then, despite subsection (1), the owner of the goods is not liable to pay warehouse declaration processing charge in respect of the declaration.

71DJ  Authority to deal with goods in respect of which a warehouse declaration has been made

             (1)  If a warehouse declaration in respect of goods has been communicated to Customs, Customs must give a warehouse declaration advice, by document or electronically, in accordance with this section.

                     (a)  must refer to the number given by Customs to identify the particular warehouse declaration; and

                     (b)  must be communicated electronically to the person who made the declaration; and

                     (c)  must contain:

                              (i)  a statement to the effect that the goods are cleared for warehousing; or

                             (ii)  a statement that the goods are directed to be held in their current location or are directed for further examination.

             (4)  Subject to subsection (5), if:

                     (a)  a warehouse declaration advice is given or communicated under this section; and

                     (b)  a payment is made of any warehouse declaration processing charge or other charge or fee payable at the time of entry of, or in respect of, the goods covered by the warehouse declaration advice;

Customs must:

             (6)  If goods are authorised to be taken into warehousing, the authority to deal, whether given by a document or electronically, must set out:

                     (a)  any condition of the kind referred to in subsection (7) to which the authority is subject; and

                     (b)  the date on which the authority is given; and

                     (c)  such other information as is prescribed.

             (7)  An authority to deal with goods may be expressed to be subject to a condition that a specified permission for the goods to be dealt with (however it is described) be obtained under another law of the Commonwealth.

             (8)  If an authority to deal with goods is expressed to be subject to the condition that a specified permission be obtained, the authority is taken not to have been given until the permission has been obtained.

             (9)  An officer may, at any time before goods authorised to be taken into warehousing are so dealt with, cancel the authority:

                     (a)  if the authority was given in respect of a documentary declaration, by:

                             (ii)  serving a copy of the notice on the person who made the declaration or, if that person does not have possession of the goods, on the person who has possession of the goods; or

                     (b)  if the authority was given in respect of an electronic declaration—by sending electronically, to the person who made the declaration, a message stating that the authority is cancelled and setting out the reasons for the cancellation.

           (10)  If, at any time before goods authorised to be taken into warehousing are so dealt with, an officer has reasonable grounds to suspect that the goods were imported into Australia in contravention of any Customs-related law, the officer may suspend the authority for a specified period:

                     (a)  if the authority was given in respect of a documentary declaration, by:

                              (i)  signing a notice stating that the authority is so suspended and setting out the reasons for the suspension; and

                             (ii)  serving a copy of the notice on the person who made the declaration or, if that person does not have possession of the goods, on the person who has possession of the goods; or

                     (b)  if the authority was given in respect of an electronic declaration—by sending electronically, to the person who made the declaration, a message stating that the authority is so suspended and setting out the reasons for the suspension.

           (11)  If, during the suspension under subsection (10) of an authority, an officer becomes satisfied that there are no longer reasonable grounds to suspect that the goods were imported into Australia in contravention of a Customs-related law, the officer must revoke the suspension:

                     (a)  if the authority was given in respect of a documentary declaration, by:

                              (i)  signing a notice stating that the suspension is revoked; and

71DL  An officer may seek additional information

             (1)  Without limiting the information that may be required to be included in a warehouse declaration, if a warehouse declaration has been made in respect of goods, authority to deal with the goods may be refused until an officer doing duty in relation to warehouse declarations:

                     (b)  is satisfied of any other matter that may be relevant to the granting of an authority to deal.

                     (a)  to deliver to the officer the commercial documents in respect of the goods that are in the owner’s custody or control (including any such documents that had previously been delivered to an officer and had been returned to the owner); or

             (6)  However, subsection (5) does not affect any power of an officer, under this Act, to require the production of a permission referred to in that subsection.

                     (a)  to deliver to the officer the commercial documents in respect of the goods that are in the owner’s possession or under the owner’s control (including any such documents that had previously been delivered to an officer and had been returned to the owner); or
