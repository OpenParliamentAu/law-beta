                    **RC**Refused Classification.

             (4)  In subsections (1) to (3), text that is not in bold is included by way of explanation and does not form part of the classification.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Markings for classifications

             (1)  The Minister may, by legislative instrument, determine:

                     (a)  markings for each type of classification giving information about the classification; and

             (3)  A publication, film or computer game does not advocate the doing of a terrorist act if it depicts or describes a terrorist act, but the depiction or description could reasonably be considered to be done merely as part of public discussion or debate or as entertainment or satire.

             (4)  In this section:

                    <a name="terrorist-act"></a>**_terrorist act_** has the meaning given by section 100.1 of the _Criminal Code_(no matter where the action occurs, the threat of action is made or the action, if carried out, would occur).

                   The matters to be taken into account in making a decision on the classification of a publication, a film or a computer game include:

                     (a)  the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults; and

                     (b)  the literary, artistic or educational merit (if any) of the publication, film or computer game; and

                     (c)  the general character of the publication, film or computer game, including whether it is of a medical, legal or scientific character; and

                     (d)  the persons or class of persons to or amongst whom it is published or is intended or likely to be published.

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Classification guidelines

             (1)  The Minister may, with the agreement of each participating Minister, determine guidelines to assist the Board in applying the criteria in the Code.

             (2)  The Minister must cause a copy of the guidelines to be published in the _Gazette_.

             (4)  If the guidelines are amended, the Minister must cause a copy of the amended guidelines to be published in the _Gazette_.

##### <a id="13"></a>13  Applications for classification of publications

             (1)  An application for classification of a publication (other than an enforcement application—see section 22A) must be:

                     (a)  in writing; and

                     (b)  made in a form approved by the Director in writing; and

Note:          For an applicant that is the Commonwealth, or a Commonwealth authority or agency: see section 91A.

             (2)  If an application is made for classification of a publication that is an issue of a periodical (the **_original issue_**), the applicant may request that the classification granted for the original issue apply also to all or some future issues.

             (3)  The Board may, if the applicant pays the prescribed fee (if any), declare that the classification granted for the original issue applies also to:

                     (a)  all future issues; or

                     (b)  a specified number of future issues; or

                     (c)  all future issues published within a specified period.

             (4)  In deciding whether to make a declaration under subsection (3), the Board must have regard to written principles determined by the Director and agreed to by the Minister.

                     (a)  contains material that, if the issue were being classified separately, would cause it to be classified with a higher classification than the original issue; or

                     (b)  contains an advertisement that has been refused approval;

the Board must revoke the declaration so far as it affects that issue and any future issues. The Board must also revoke approval of any approved advertisement for those issues of the publication.

##### <a id="13A"></a>13A  Conditions of certain classifications for publications

             (1)  The Board may, if it classifies a publication Unrestricted, impose a condition that it not be sold, displayed for sale or delivered unless it is contained in a sealed package.

                              (i)  provides a description or translation of the audio or visual content of the film; and

                             (ii)  would not be likely to cause the film to be given a higher classification.

Example:    A film which has been classified has captions added for the hearing impaired. This addition would not cause the film to become unclassified under subsection 21(1).

##### <a id="21A"></a>21A  Revocation of classification of films or computer games that are found to contain contentious material

                   If the Board is of the opinion that:

                     (a)  the additional content contains any classifiable elements that:

                              (i)  were not brought to the Board’s attention in accordance with paragraph 14(6)(a), (b) or (c) before the classification was made; or

                             (ii)  were brought to the Board’s attention in accordance with paragraph 14(6)(a), (b) or (c) before the classification was made but the assessment of the elements was misleading, incorrect or grossly inadequate; and

                     (b)  if the Board had been aware of the matters mentioned in subparagraph (a)(i) or (ii) before the classification was made, it would have given the film a different classification.

Note:          The regulations may prescribe circumstances in which an assessment is taken to be misleading, incorrect or grossly inadequate: see subsection 93(2).

##### <a id="21AB"></a>21AB  Revocation of classification of television series films

                   The Board must revoke the classification of a film that has been classified taking into account an assessment prepared by an authorised television series assessor under section 14B if the Board is satisfied that:

                     (a)  for a film or computer game with a higher classification than the classification the first film or first game would be given if it did not contain the advertisement; or

                     (b)  for an unclassified film or unclassified computer game:

                              (i)  that has been assessed in accordance with section 31 or under section 33 as being likely to have a higher classification than the classification the first film or first game would be given if it did not contain the advertisement; or

                             (ii)  the likely classification of which has not been assessed in accordance with section 31 or under section 33; or

                     (c)  that has been refused approval.

             (2)  Subsection (1A) or (1) does not prevent a publication, film or computer game from being classified if the application for the classification was an enforcement application.

Note:          For an applicant that is the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority: see section 91A.

             (3)  An enforcement application for classification of a computer game does not have to be accompanied by a copy of the game if the game is an amusement or circuit board game that, in the opinion of the Board, is physically impracticable to submit to the Board’s premises for classification.

##### <a id="22B"></a>22B  Classification of a publication, film or computer game that may be the same as or similar to a classified item

             (1)  The Board may proceed to classify a publication, film or computer game (the **_new item_**) if:

                     (a)  an application is made for its classification; and

                     (b)  the Board is of the opinion that the new item may be the same as or similar to another publication, film or game that has already been classified (the **_classified item_**); and

                     (d)  the Board is not able to ascertain from its records whether the items are identical.

             (2)  A classification by the Board of the new item is valid even though the Board may discover, after the classification of the new item, that it is the same as the classified item.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  the Board obtains a copy of the classified item; and

                     (b)  the Board decides that it is the same as the new item but:

                              (i)  the classifications for the classified item and the new item are different; or

the Board must revoke the classification or consumer advice for the classified item.

##### <a id="22C"></a>22C  Validation of Board decisions etc. on applications by law enforcement agencies

             (1)  A decision (the **_original decision_**) made by the Board (whether before or after the commencement of this section) on an application:

                     (a)  made by or on behalf of a law enforcement agency of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; and

                     (b)  that did not satisfy the requirements of this Act for the making of the application;

is as valid, and is taken always to have been as valid, as it would have been if the application had satisfied those requirements.

             (2)  Any later decision made, or any later action taken by, the Board, the Review Board, the Director or the Convenor under this Act (whether before or after the commencement of this section) on the basis of the original decision is as valid, and is taken always to have been as valid, as it would have been if the original decision had been made on an application that satisfied the requirements of this Act for the making of the application.

             (4)  A failure to comply with subsection (3) does not affect the validity of a determination under subsection (1) or (2).

Criteria for making a determination
