                    <a name="commonwealth-entiti"></a>**_Commonwealth entity_** means:

                     (a)  an agency (within the meaning of the _Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997_); or

                    <a name="design-commonwealth-entiti"></a>**_designated Commonwealth entity_** means a Commonwealth entity that is specified in an instrument under section 2A.

                    <a name="entiti"></a><a name="foreign-govern"></a>**_foreign government_** **_entity_** means:

##### <a id="2A"></a>2A  Meaning of _designated Commonwealth entity_

                   The Minister may, by legislative instrument, specify a Commonwealth entity as a **_designated Commonwealth entity_**.

##### <a id="2B"></a>2B  Meaning of _UN sanction enforcement law_

             (1)  The Minister may, by legislative instrument, specify a provision of a law of the Commonwealth as a **_UN sanction enforcement law_**.

             (2)  The Minister may specify a provision in relation to particular circumstances.

             (3)  The Minister may only specify a provision to the extent that it gives effect to  a decision that:

                     (a)  the Security Council has made under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations; and

                     (b)  Article 25 of the Charter requires   Australia to carry out;

in so far as that decision requires Australia to apply measures not involving the use of armed force.

Note:          Articles 39 and 41 of the Charter provide for the Security Council to decide what measures not involving the use of armed force are to be taken to maintain or restore international peace and security.

             (4)  A provision may be specified whether or not the provision is made for the sole purpose of giving effect to a decision of the Security Council.

             (5)  A provision ceases to be a **_UN sanction enforcement law_** to a particular extent if:

                     (a)  Article 25 of the Charter of the United Nations ceases to require Australia to carry out a decision referred to in subsection (3); and

                     (b)  the provision gave effect to that decision to that extent; and

## Part 2—Approval of Charter

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Approval

                   The Charter of the United Nations (a copy of which is set out in the Schedule) is approved.

## Part 3—Regulations to Apply Security Council Sanctions

### Division 1—Making and effect of regulations

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Regulations may apply sanctions

             (1)  The Governor-General may make regulations for and in relation to giving effect to decisions that:

                     (a)  the Security Council makes under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations; and

                     (b)  Article 25 of the Charter requires Australia to carry out;

in so far as those decisions require Australia to apply measures not involving the use of armed force.

Note:          Articles 39 and 41 of the Charter provide for the Security Council to decide what measures not involving the use of armed force are to be taken to maintain or restore international peace and security.

             (2)  Without limiting subsection (1), the regulations may give effect to a decision of the Security Council by any or all of the following means:

                     (a)  proscribing persons or entities;

                     (b)  restricting or preventing uses of, dealings with, and making available, assets;

                     (c)  restricting or preventing the supply, sale or transfer of goods or services;

                     (d)  restricting or preventing the procurement of goods or services;

                     (e)  providing for indemnities for acting in compliance or purported compliance with those regulations;

                      (f)  providing for compensation for owners of assets;

                     (g)  authorising the making of legislative instruments.

             (3)  Despite subsection 14(2) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_, regulations made for the purposes of subsection (1) may make provision in relation to a matter by applying, adopting or incorporating any matter contained in an instrument or other writing as in force or existing from time to time.

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Regulations may have extra-territorial effect

             (1)  The regulations may be expressed to have extra-territorial effect.

             (2)  If they are so expressed, they have effect accordingly, and so does Division 2 of this Part.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Regulations expire when sanctions resolution ceases to bind Australia

             (1)  In so far as the regulations provide for or in relation to giving effect to a particular decision of the Security Council:

                     (a)  they cease to have effect when Article 25 of the Charter of the United Nations ceases to require Australia to carry out that decision; and

                     (b)  they do not revive, even if Australia again becomes required to carry out the decision.

             (2)  However, to avoid doubt, nothing in this section prevents the repeal of regulations, or the making of regulations that are the same in substance as regulations that have ceased to have effect because of this section.

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Effect of regulations on earlier Commonwealth Acts and on State and Territory laws

                   The regulations have effect despite:

                     (a)  an Act enacted before the commencement of this section; or

                     (b)  an instrument made under such an Act (including such an instrument made at or after that commencement); or

                     (c)  a law of a State or Territory; or

                     (d)  an instrument made under such a law; or

                     (e)  any provision of the _Corporations Act 2001_ or the _Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001_, or of regulations made under those Acts; or

                      (f)  an instrument made under such a provision.

##### <a id="10"></a>10  Later Acts not to be interpreted as overriding this Part or the regulations

             (1)  An Act enacted at or after the commencement of this section is not to be interpreted as:

                     (a)  amending or repealing, or otherwise altering the effect or operation of, a provision of this Part or of the regulations; or

                     (b)  authorising the making of an instrument amending or repealing, or otherwise altering the effect or operation of, a provision of this Part or of the regulations.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not affect the interpretation of an Act so far as that Act provides expressly for that Act, or for an instrument made under that Act, to have effect despite this Act, despite the regulations, or despite a specified provision of this Act or of the regulations.

##### <a id="11"></a>11  Other instruments giving effect to Security Council decisions

                   To avoid doubt, the validity or operation of an instrument made under another Act is not affected merely because the instrument was made in connection with giving effect to a decision of the Security Council.

### Division 2—Enforcing the regulations

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Offences

             (1)  The regulations may prescribe penalties of not more than 50 penalty units for offences against the regulations.

             (2)  The limitation on penalties in subsection (1) does not prevent the regulations from requiring someone to make a statutory declaration.

##### <a id="13"></a>13  Injunctions

             (1)  If a person has engaged, is engaging, or proposes to engage, in conduct involving a contravention of the regulations, a superior court may by order grant an injunction restraining the person from engaging in conduct specified in the order.

             (2)  An injunction may only be granted on application by the Attorney-General.

             (3)  On an application, the court may, if it thinks it appropriate, grant an injunction by consent of all parties to the proceedings, whether or not the court is satisfied that subsection (1) applies.

             (4)  A superior court may, if it thinks it desirable, grant an interim injunction pending its determination of an application.

             (5)  A court is not to require the Attorney-General or anyone else, as a condition of granting an interim injunction, to give an undertaking as to damages.

             (6)  A court may discharge or vary an injunction it has granted.

             (7)  The power to grant or vary an injunction restraining a person from engaging in conduct may be exercised:

                     (a)  whether or not it appears to the court that the person intends to engage again, or to continue to engage, in such conduct; and

                     (b)  whether or not the person has previously engaged in such conduct.

             (8)  In this section:

                    <a name="superior-court"></a>**_superior court_** means the Federal Court of Australia or the Supreme Court of a State or Territory.

##### <a id="13A"></a>13A  Invalidation of permission, authorisations etc.

                   A licence, permission, consent, approval or authorisation granted under the regulations (a **_relevant authorisation_**) is taken never to have been granted if information contained in, or information or a document accompanying, the application for the relevant authorisation:

                     (a)  is false or misleading in a material particular; or

                     (b)  omits any matter or thing without which the information or document is misleading in a material particular.

## Part 4—Security Council decisions that relate to terrorism and dealings with assets

##### <a id="14"></a>14  Definitions

                   In this Part:

                    <a name="freezabl-asset"></a>**_freezable asset_** means an asset that:

                     (a)  is owned or controlled by a proscribed person or entity; or

                     (b)  is a listed asset; or

                     (c)  is derived or generated from assets mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b).

                    <a name="list-asset"></a>**_listed asset_** means an asset listed by the Minister under section 15.

                    <a name="proscrib-person-entiti"></a>**_proscribed person or entity_** means:

                     (a)  a person or entity listed by the Minister under section 15; or

                     (b)  a person or entity proscribed by regulation under section 18.

                    <a name="superior-court"></a>**_superior court_** means the Federal Court of Australia or the Supreme Court of a State or Territory.

##### <a id="15"></a>15  Listing persons, entities and assets

             (1)  The Minister must list a person or entity under this section if the Minister is satisfied of the prescribed matters.

             (2)  The Governor-General may make regulations prescribing the matters of which the Minister must be satisfied before listing a person or entity under subsection (1).

             (3)  The Minister may list an asset, or class of asset, under this section if the Minister is satisfied of the prescribed matters.

             (4)  The Governor-General may make regulations prescribing the matters of which the Minister must be satisfied before listing an asset under subsection (3).

             (5)  A matter must not be prescribed under subsection (2) or (4) unless the prescription of the matter would give effect to a decision that:

                     (a)  the Security Council has made under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations; and

                     (b)  Article 25 of the Charter requires   Australia to carry out; and

                     (c)  relates to terrorism and dealings with assets.

             (6)  A person or entity is listed by notice in the _Gazette_.

             (7)  An asset or class of asset is listed by notice in the _Gazette_.

##### <a id="16"></a>16  Minister may revoke the listing

             (1)  The Minister may revoke a listing under section 15 if the Minister is satisfied that the listing is no longer necessary to give effect to a decision that:

                     (a)  the Security Council has made under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations; and

                     (b)  Article 25 of the Charter requires   Australia to carry out; and

                     (c)  relates to terrorism and dealings with assets.

             (2)  The Minister may revoke the listing either at the Minister’s own instigation or on application by the listed person or entity.

             (3)  The listing is revoked by notice in the _Gazette_.

             (4)  The listing is revoked at the start of the day immediately after the day on which notice is published in the _Gazette_.

##### <a id="17"></a>17  Listed person or entity may apply to have the listing revoked

             (1)  A listed person or entity may apply to the Minister to have the listing revoked.

             (2)  The application must:

                     (a)  be in writing; and

                     (b)  set out the circumstances relied upon to justify the application.

             (3)  The Minister is not required to consider an application (the **_current application_**) by a listed person or entity under this section if the listed person or entity has made an application under this section within one year before the current application _._

##### <a id="18"></a>18  Proscription by regulation

             (1)  The Governor-General may make regulations proscribing persons or entities under this section.

             (2)  A person or entity must not be proscribed under subsection (1) unless the proscription would give effect to a decision:

                     (a)  that the Security Council has made under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations; and

                     (b)  that Article 25 of the Charter requires   Australia to carry out; and

                     (c)  that relates to terrorism and dealings with assets; and

                     (d)  under which the person or entity is identified (whether in the decision or using a mechanism established under the decision) as a person or entity to which the decision relates.

             (3)  The regulations may proscribe persons or entities under this section by incorporating a list of persons or entities identified, either in the decision itself or using a mechanism established under the decision, as persons or entities to which the decision relates. The list may be incorporated by the regulations as it exists from time to time.

##### <a id="19"></a>19  Effect of resolution ceasing to bind Australia

             (1)  In so far as a listing under section 15 gives effect to a particular decision of the Security Council, the listing is revoked when Article 25 of the Charter of the United Nations ceases to require Australia to carry out that decision.

             (2)  In so far as regulations proscribing a person or entity under section 18 give effect to a particular decision of the Security Council:

                     (a)  the regulations cease to have effect when Article 25 of the Charter of the United Nations ceases to require Australia to carry out that decision; and

                     (b)  they do not revive, even if Australia again becomes required to carry out the decision.

             (3)  However, to avoid doubt, nothing in this section prevents:

                     (a)  the revocation, under section 16, of a listing; or

                     (b)  the repeal of regulations; or

                     (c)  the making of regulations that are the same in substance as regulations that have ceased to have effect because of this section.

##### <a id="20"></a>20  Offence—dealing with freezable assets

                     (d)  the use or dealing is not in accordance with a notice under section 22.

          (3D)  An offence under subsection (3C) is an offence of strict liability.

Note:          For **_strict liability_**, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

           (3E)  It is a defence if the body corporate proves that:

                     (b)  otherwise—10,000 penalty units.

             (4)  Section 15.1 of the _Criminal Code_ (extended geographical jurisdiction—category A) applies to an offence against subsection (1) or (3C).

##### <a id="21"></a>21  Offence—giving an asset to a proscribed person or entity

Offence for individuals

             (1)  An individual commits an offence if:

to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained, and

to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom,

AND FOR THESE ENDS

to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours, and to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security, and

2.     To develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace;

1.     Whenever the construction of a convention to which states other than those concerned in the case are parties is in question, the Registrar shall notify all such states forthwith.

3.     Should any such state entitled to appear before the Court have failed to receive the special communication referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, such state may express a desire to submit a written statement or to be heard; and the Court will decide.

4.     States and organizations having presented written or oral statements or both shall be permitted to comment on the statements made by other states or organizations in the form, to the extent, and within the time limits which the Court, or, should it not be sitting, the President, shall decide in each particular case.
