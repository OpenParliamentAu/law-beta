**</center>

 WE THE PEOPLES OF THE UNITED NATIONS
 DETERMINED
 to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind, and
 to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small, and
 to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained, and
 to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom,
 AND FOR THESE ENDS
 to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours, and to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security, and
 to ensure, by the acceptance of principles and the institution of methods, that armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest, and
 to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples,
 HAVE RESOLVED TO COMBINE OUR EFFORTS TO ACCOMPLISH THESE AIMS.
 Accordingly, our respective Governments, through representatives assembled in the city of San Francisco, who have exhibited their full powers found to be in good and due form, have agreed to the present Charter of the United Nations and do hereby establish an international organization to be known as the United Nations.
 <center>CHAPTER&#160;1</center>
 <center>PURPOSES AND PRINCIPLES</center>
 <center>_Article 1_</center>
 The Purposes of the United Nations are:
 1.	To maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace;
 2.	To develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace;
 3.	To achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character, and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion; and
 4.	To be a center for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends.
 <center>_Article 2_</center>
 The Organization and its Members, in pursuit of the Purposes stated in Article 1, shall act in accordance with the following Principles.
 1.	The Organization is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members.
 2.	All Members, in order to ensure to all of them the rights and benefits resulting from membership, shall fulfil in good faith the obligations assumed by them in accordance with the present Charter.
 3.	All Members shall settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security, and justice, are not endangered.
 4.	All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.
 5.	All Members shall give the United Nations every assistance in any action it takes in accordance with the present Charter, and shall refrain from giving assistance to any State against which the United Nations is taking preventive or enforcement action.
 6.	The Organization shall ensure that states which are not members of the United Nations act in accordance with these Principles so far as may be necessary for the maintenance of international peace and security.
 7.	Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction 
<center>Back to Top</center>
 of any state or shall require the Members to submit such matters to settlement under the present Charter; but this principle shall not prejudice the application of enforcement measures under Chapter VII.
 <center>CHAPTER II</center>
 <center>MEMBERSHIP</center>
 <center>_Article 3_</center>
 The original Members of the United Nations shall be the states which having participated in the United Nations Conference on International Organization at San Francisco, or having previously signed the Declaration by United Nations of January 1, 1942, sign the present Charter and ratify it in accordance with Article 110.
 <center>_Article 4_</center>
