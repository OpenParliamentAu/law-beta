## An Act to give effect to a cooperative scheme for dealing with crimes at sea, and for other purposes

Preamble

                   The Commonwealth and the States have agreed to a cooperative scheme to apply the criminal law of the States extraterritorially in the areas adjacent to the coast of Australia.

                   Under the scheme, the criminal law of each State is to apply in the area adjacent to the State:

                     (a)  for a distance of 12 nautical miles from the baseline for the State—by force of the law of the State; and

                     (b)  beyond 12 nautical miles up to a distance of 200 nautical miles from the baseline for the State or the outer limit of the continental shelf (whichever is the greater distance)—by force of the law of the Commonwealth.

                   Responsibility for administering criminal justice in the area covered by the scheme will be divided between the Commonwealth and the States under the scheme and an intergovernmental agreement.

                   The purposes of this Act are:

                     (a)  to give legal force to the scheme (so far as it depends on the legislative power of the Commonwealth) and to provide for consequential vesting of judicial and other powers; and

                     (b)  to provide for the application of Australian criminal law in certain cases beyond the area covered by the scheme.

The Parliament of Australia therefore enacts:

## Part 2—The cooperative scheme

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Ratification of cooperative scheme

                   To the extent that it lies within the legislative competence of the Commonwealth to give the cooperative scheme the force of law, it has the force of law.

## Part 3—Application of criminal law outside adjacent area

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Application of Australian criminal law outside the adjacent area

             (1)  The substantive criminal law of the Jervis Bay Territory, as in force from time to time, applies at sea outside the adjacent area to a criminal act:

                     (a)  on an Australian ship; or

                     (b)  in the course of activities controlled from an Australian ship; or

                     (c)  of a person who has abandoned, or temporarily left, an Australian ship and has not returned to land.

             (2)  The substantive criminal law of the Jervis Bay Territory, as in force from time to time, applies at sea outside the adjacent area to a criminal act:

                     (a)  of an Australian citizen (other than a member of the crew) on a foreign ship; or

                     (b)  of an Australian citizen (other than a member of the crew) in the course of activities controlled from a foreign ship; or

                     (c)  of an Australian citizen who has abandoned, or temporarily left, a foreign ship and has not returned to land.

             (3)  The substantive criminal law of the Jervis Bay Territory, as in force from time to time, is taken to have applied at sea outside the adjacent area to a criminal act:

                     (a)  on a foreign ship; or

                     (b)  in the course of activities controlled from a foreign ship; or

                     (c)  of a person who has abandoned, or temporarily left, a foreign ship and has not returned to land;

if the first country at which the ship calls, or the person lands, after the criminal act, is Australia or an external territory of Australia.

             (4)  A charge of an offence that arises under this section cannot proceed to hearing or determination or, if the offence is an indictable offence, to preliminary examination in committal proceedings, unless the Attorney‑General consents in writing to the hearing and determination of the charge.

             (5)  Before granting such a consent, the Attorney‑General must take into account any views expressed by the government of a country other than Australia whose jurisdiction over the alleged offence is recognised under principles of international law.

             (6)  Even though the Attorney‑General has not granted such a consent, the absence of consent is not to prevent or delay:

                     (a)  the arrest of the suspected offender or proceedings related to arrest (such as proceedings for the issue and execution of a warrant); or

                     (b)  the laying of a charge against the suspected offender; or

                     (c)  proceedings for the extradition to   Australia of the suspected offender; or

                     (d)  proceedings for remanding the suspected offender in custody or on bail.

             (7)  If the Attorney‑General declines to grant consent, the court in which the suspected offender has been charged with the offence must permanently stay proceedings on the charge.

             (8)  In any proceedings, an apparently genuine document purporting to be a copy of a written consent granted by the Attorney‑General in accordance with this section will be accepted, in the absence of proof to the contrary, as proof of such consent.

             (9)  If:

                     (a)  a person is charged with an offence that arises under this section; but

                     (b)  there is a country other than Australia whose jurisdiction over the alleged offence is recognised under principles of international law;

it is a defence to prove:

                     (c)  that no corresponding offence exists under the law of the other country; or 

                     (d)  that such a corresponding offence does exist but a defence to a charge of the corresponding offence could be made out under the law of the other country.

           (10)  This section does not apply to an act that takes place in:

                     (a)  the territorial waters of Norfolk Island (within the meaning of the _Territorial Waters Act 1926_ of Norfolk Island); or

                     (b)  the coastal sea (within the meaning of subsection 15B(4) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ of the Commonwealth) of any of the following Territories:

                              (i)  the Territory of Christmas Island;

                             (ii)  the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands;

                            (iii)  the Australian  Antarctic Territory;

                            (iv)  the Territory of Heard Island and McDonald Islands;

                             (v)  the Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands;

                            (vi)  the Coral Sea Islands Territory.

           (11)  In this section:

                    <a name="crimin-act"></a>**_criminal act_** means an act that would, if done in the Jervis Bay Territory, contravene the substantive criminal law of the Jervis Bay Territory.

## Part 3A—Cooperation between Australia and East Timor in the enforcement of criminal law

##### <a id="6A"></a>6A  Criminal laws applicable in the Joint Petroleum Development Area

             (1)  The provisions of the substantive criminal law of the Northern Territory from time to time apply to a criminal act done in the Joint Petroleum Development Area that is connected with, or arises out of, the exploration for, or exploitation of, petroleum resources as if the act had been done in the Northern Territory.

             (2)  However, the relevant substantive criminal law does not apply to:

                     (a)  an act done on or from a ship or aircraft; or

                     (b)  an act done by a national of East Timor who is not also a national of Australia; or

                     (c)  an act done by a permanent resident of East Timor who is not also a national of Australia.

             (3)  Proceedings for an offence against a substantive criminal law as applied under this section may not be instituted against a person if:

                     (a)  the person has been acquitted or discharged without penalty in proceedings for an offence against a law in force in East Timor arising out of the same act; or

                     (b)  the person has incurred a penalty under a law in force in East Timor for such an offence; or

                     (c)  a competent authority of East Timor has decided not to prosecute the person for such an offence.

             (4)  A prosecution for an offence against a law applied by subsection (1) may only be heard and determined if the Attorney‑General consents in writing to the prosecution.

             (5)  Although the Attorney‑General has not consented to a prosecution under subsection (4):

                     (a)  a person may be arrested for the offence, and a warrant for the arrest of a person for the offence may be issued and executed; and

                     (b)  a person may be charged with the offence; and

                     (c)  a person charged with the offence may be remanded in custody or on bail.

             (6)  The provisions of the laws of criminal investigation, procedure and evidence in force in the Commonwealth and the States from time to time apply to a criminal act done in the Joint Petroleum Development Area that is connected with, or arises out of, the exploration for, or exploitation of, petroleum resources in the same way as those provisions apply to maritime offences under clause 3 of Schedule 1.

             (7)  In this section:

                    <a name="crimin-act"></a>**_criminal act_** means an act that would, if done in the Northern Territory, contravene the substantive criminal law of the Northern Territory.

                    <a name="state"></a>**_State_** includes the Northern Territory.

##### <a id="6B"></a>6B  Transit of persons accused of offences against the laws of East Timor

             (1)  If East Timor wishes to transport in custody through Australia a person (the **_accused_**) who has been arrested for an offence against a criminal law in force in East Timor that applies in the Joint Petroleum Development Area, the following provisions apply:

                     (a)  the accused may be transported in custody through Australia; and

                     (b)  if an aircraft or ship transporting the accused makes a landing or calls at a place in Australia:

                              (i)  the person holding the accused in custody before the landing or call is made may hold the accused in custody for not more than 24 hours; and

                             (ii)  a police officer may provide reasonable and necessary assistance to facilitate the transport of the accused in custody; and

                            (iii)  a magistrate to whom application is made, according to the regulations, on behalf of East Timor is required to issue a warrant ordering a person specified in the warrant to hold the accused in custody for a period or periods the magistrate considers necessary to facilitate the transport of the accused in custody; and

                            (iv)  the Attorney‑General may, on application on behalf of East Timor, authorise, in writing, a magistrate to issue a warrant ordering a person specified in the warrant to hold the accused in custody for a further specified period in order to facilitate the transport of the accused in custody; and

                             (v)  the Attorney‑General may at any time direct a person having custody of the accused under this paragraph to release the accused; and

                            (vi)  the total period of custody under subparagraphs (i) and (iii) must not exceed 96 hours.

             (2)  A police officer may, without warrant, arrest a person if the officer has reasonable grounds for believing that the person has escaped from custody authorised by subsection (1).

             (3)  A person arrested under subsection (2) must be returned to custody.

             (4)  For the purposes of this section, a place at which an aircraft or ship begins its journey or voyage is to be treated as a place at which the aircraft has landed, or the ship has called, as the case requires.

##### <a id="6C"></a>6C  Agreements relating to enforcement of criminal laws in the Joint Petroleum Development Area

             (1)  The regulations may give effect to an agreement or arrangement between Australia and East Timor about the enforcement of criminal laws applying in the Joint Petroleum Development Area.

             (2)  The regulations may, for example:

                     (a)  provide for the production of documents, the summoning of witnesses and the taking of evidence by authorities of East Timor for use in proceedings in Australia; and

                     (b)  provide for:

                              (i)  the apprehension and detention in the Joint Petroleum Development Area, by authorities of East Timor, of persons accused of offences against criminal laws of Australia applied under this Part; and

                             (ii)  the transport and surrender, in the Joint Petroleum Development Area or elsewhere, of the persons to Australian authorities; and

                     (c)  provide for:

                              (i)  the apprehension and detention in the Joint Petroleum Development Area, by Australian authorities, of persons accused of offences against criminal laws in force in East Timor; and

                             (ii)  the transport and surrender, in the Joint Petroleum Development Area or elsewhere, of the persons to authorities of East Timor; and

                     (d)  prescribe the practice and procedure of magistrates in performing functions under regulations made for the purposes of this section.

             (3)  A provision for detention of a person under this section may only authorise detention until the time it first becomes practicable to surrender the person to an appropriate authority of Australia or East Timor.

             (4)  A provision made under paragraph (2)(c) excludes the application of the _Extradition Act 1988_ from offences to which the provision applies.

## Part 4—Miscellaneous

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Publication of intergovernmental agreement

                   The Minister must have the intergovernmental agreement, and any amendment to the intergovernmental agreement, published in the _Gazette_.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  No effect on _Crimes (Aviation) Act 1991_

                   This Act and the cooperative scheme do not apply to an act to which section 15 of the _Crimes (Aviation) Act 1991_ applies.

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Regulations

             (1)  The Governor‑General may make regulations prescribing matters:

                     (a)  required or permitted by this Act to be prescribed; or

                     (b)  necessary or convenient to be prescribed for carrying out or giving effect to this Act.

             (2)  However, this section does not authorise the making of regulations for the purposes of the cooperative scheme.

Note:          The Governor‑General has power to make regulations for the purposes of the cooperative scheme under clause 12 of the scheme.

# Schedule 1—The cooperative scheme

_Note:       See section 5_

                    <a name="substant-crimin-law"></a>**_substantive criminal law_** means law (including unwritten law):

                     (a)  creating offences or imposing criminal liability for offences; or

                     (b)  dealing with capacity to incur criminal liability; or

                     (c)  providing a defence or for reduction of the degree of criminal liability; or

## Part 2—Application of State criminal law to adjacent area

##### <a id="2"></a>2  Application of State criminal law in adjacent area

             (1)  The substantive criminal law of a State, as in force from time to time, applies, by force of the law of the State, throughout the inner adjacent area for the State.

             (2)  The provisions of the substantive criminal law of a State, as in force from time to time, apply, by force of the law of the Commonwealth, throughout the outer adjacent area for the State.

             (3)  However, this clause does not:

                     (a)  apply to a substantive criminal law that is incapable of applying in an adjacent area or is limited by its express terms to a place within the area of a State; or

Example: A law making it an offence to drive a motor vehicle at a speed exceeding a prescribed limit on a road could not apply in an adjacent area because of the inherent localising elements of the offence. The scheme does not therefore purport to extend the application of such a law to the adjacent area. 

                     (b)  give a legal effect to a provision of a substantive criminal law that the provision does not have within the area of the State.

Example: If the effect of a provision of the substantive criminal law of a State is limited under section 109 of the Constitution within the area of the State, the effect is similarly limited in the outer adjacent area for the State even though the provision applies in the outer adjacent area under the legislative authority of the Commonwealth.

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Application of laws of criminal investigation, procedure and evidence

             (1)  In this clause:

                    <a name="act"></a>**_act_** includes an omission.

                    <a name="area-administr-respons"></a>**_area of administrative responsibility_** for a particular State is:

                     (a)  the area of the State; and

                     (b)  the inner adjacent area for the State; and

                     (c)  other parts of the adjacent area in which the State has, under the intergovernmental agreement, responsibility (which may be either exclusive or concurrent) for administering criminal justice.

                    <a name="author"></a>**_authority_** includes an agent or official.

                    <a name="commonwealth-judici-proceing"></a>**_Commonwealth judicial proceeding_** means:

                     (a)  a judicial proceeding related to a maritime offence:

                              (i)  initiated by an authority of the Commonwealth; or

                             (ii)  for the conduct of which an authority of the Commonwealth has assumed responsibility; or

                     (b)  a judicial proceeding about an investigation, procedure or act by an authority of the Commonwealth in relation to a maritime offence.

                    <a name="judici-proceing"></a>**_judicial proceeding_** means:

                     (a)  a proceeding in a court (whether between parties or not) or a proceeding incidental to or connected with a proceeding in a court; or

                     (b)  the laying of a charge; or

                     (c)  the preliminary examination of a charge of an indictable offence or a proceeding incidental to or connected with the preliminary examination of a charge of an indictable offence.

                    <a name="preliminari-examin"></a>**_preliminary examination_** of a charge of an indictable offence means a proceeding to decide whether the defendant should be committed for trial or, if the defendant pleads guilty to the charge, to commit the defendant for sentence or trial.

                    <a name="state-judici-proceing"></a>**_State judicial proceeding_** means:

                     (a)  a judicial proceeding related to a maritime offence:

                              (i)  initiated by an authority of a State; or

                             (ii)  for the conduct of which an authority of a State has assumed responsibility; or

                     (b)  a judicial proceeding about an investigation, procedure or act by an authority of a State in relation to a maritime offence.

             (2)  The laws of criminal investigation, procedure and evidence of the Commonwealth and the States apply to maritime offences as follows:

                     (a)  the law of the Commonwealth applies to investigations, procedures and acts (other than judicial proceedings) by authorities of the Commonwealth; and

                     (b)  the law of a State applies to investigations, procedures and acts (other than judicial proceedings) by authorities of the State operating within the area of administrative responsibility for the relevant State; and

                     (c)  in a Commonwealth judicial proceeding the law of the Commonwealth applies and in a State judicial proceeding the law of the State in which the proceeding was commenced applies (subject to the Constitution) irrespective of whether:

                              (i)  the maritime offence arises under the law of the State in which the proceeding was commenced or another State; or

                             (ii)  the substantive criminal law against which the offence was committed applies in the relevant part of the adjacent area under the law of the State in which the proceeding was commenced, another State or the Commonwealth.

Example 1: Suppose that a person is charged by a State authority with a maritime offence on the assumption that the offence was committed in the inner adjacent area for the State but the court is satisfied in the course of the proceedings that the acts alleged against the defendant took place in the outer adjacent area for the State. In this case, the court could continue with the proceedings under the procedural laws of the State. However, the court could not (for example) convict the defendant on the basis of a majority verdict of a jury (because to do so would be contrary to the Commonwealth Constitution—see _Cheatle,_ 177 CLR 541).

Example 2: Suppose that a person is charged by a State authority in a South Australian court with a maritime offence alleged to have been committed in the adjacent area for Western Australia. For the purposes of the proceedings, the offence would be classified as a major indictable, minor indictable or summary offence according to the South Australian rules and not by reference to its classification under the law of Western Australia or the Commonwealth.

             (3)  This clause operates to the exclusion of any Commonwealth or State law that is inconsistent with it.

             (4)  A Commonwealth or State law enacted or made after the commencement of this clause is to be construed as having effect subject to this clause, unless the law expressly overrides this clause.

             (5)  The _Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977_ (Commonwealth) does not apply to a decision taken under a State law that applies to investigations, procedures and acts by authorities of the State under paragraph (b) of subclause (2).

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Evidentiary presumption about the locus of an offence

                   If, in proceedings for a maritime offence, an alleged act, omission or state of affairs, that is an element of the offence, is proved, an allegation in the information or complaint that the act, omission or state of affairs happened in the adjacent area, inner adjacent area, or outer adjacent area for a particular State is taken to be proved in the absence of proof to the contrary.

## Part 3—The intergovernmental agreement

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Intergovernmental agreement

             (1)  The Commonwealth Attorney‑General, on behalf of the Commonwealth, and the participating State Ministers may enter into an agreement providing for the division of responsibility for administering and enforcing the law relating to maritime offences.

             (2)  The intergovernmental agreement may provide for concurrent responsibility in specified parts of the adjacent area.

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Effect of the agreement

             (1)  A charge of a maritime offence must not be brought in a court contrary to the intergovernmental agreement.

             (2)  If a charge of a maritime offence is brought in a court in contravention of subclause (1), the court must, on application by the Commonwealth Attorney‑General or a participating State Minister, permanently stay the proceedings in that court.

             (3)  However:

                     (a)  a contravention of subclause (1) does not affect a court’s jurisdiction; and

                     (b)  if a charge of a maritime offence is brought in a court, the court will not (except on an application under subclause (2)) be concerned to enquire into whether the intergovernmental agreement has been complied with.

## Part 4—Limitations and exclusions

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Commonwealth Attorney‑General’s consent required for certain prosecutions

             (1)  The Commonwealth Attorney‑General’s written consent is required before a charge of a maritime offence can proceed to hearing or determination or, if the offence is an indictable offence, to a preliminary examination in committal proceedings, if:

                     (a)  the offence is alleged to have been committed on or from a foreign ship; and

                     (b)  the ship is registered under the law of a country other than Australia; and

                     (c)  the country of registration has, under international law, jurisdiction over the alleged offence.

             (2)  Before granting such a consent, the Commonwealth Attorney‑General must take into account any views expressed by the government of the country of registration.

             (3)  Even though the Commonwealth Attorney‑General has not granted such a consent, the absence of consent is not to prevent or delay:

                     (a)  the arrest of the suspected offender or proceedings related to arrest (such as proceedings for the issue and execution of a warrant); or

                     (b)  the laying of a charge against the suspected offender; or

                     (c)  proceedings for the extradition to   Australia of the suspected offender; or

                     (d)  proceedings for remanding the suspected offender in custody or on bail.

             (4)  If the Commonwealth Attorney‑General declines to grant consent, the court in which the suspected offender has been charged with the offence must permanently stay the proceedings.

             (5)  In any proceedings, an apparently genuine document purporting to be a copy of a written consent granted by the Commonwealth Attorney‑General in accordance with this clause will be accepted, in the absence of proof to the contrary, as proof of such consent.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Non‑exclusion of consistent extraterritorial legislative schemes

                   This scheme does not exclude the extraterritorial operation of State law to the extent that the State law is capable of operating extraterritorially consistently with the scheme.

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Exclusion of certain laws from ambit of this scheme

                   This scheme does not apply to State and Commonwealth laws excluded by regulation from the ambit of the scheme.

##### <a id="10"></a>10  Non‑application of scheme to the Joint Petroleum Development Area

                   This scheme does not apply to the Joint Petroleum Development Area.

## Part 5—Miscellaneous

##### <a id="11"></a>11  Interpretation

                   The _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ (Commonwealth) applies to this scheme in the same way as to a Commonwealth Act.

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Regulations

             (1)  The Governor‑General may make regulations prescribing matters:

                     (a)  required or permitted by this scheme to be prescribed; or

                     (b)  necessary or convenient to be prescribed for carrying out or giving effect to this scheme.

             (2)  However, a regulation affecting the operation of this scheme in relation to the inner adjacent area for a State may only be made with the agreement of the participating State Minister for the relevant State.

## Part 6—Adjacent areas

##### <a id="13"></a>13  Definitions

                   In this Part:

                    <a name="baselin-australia-territori-sea"></a>**_baseline of Australia’s territorial sea_** means the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is to be measured under section 7 of the _Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973_ (Commonwealth).
