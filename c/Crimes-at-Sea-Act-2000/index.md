	(a)	apply to a substantive criminal law that is incapable of applying in an adjacent area or is limited by its express terms to a place within the area of a State; or
 Example:	A law making it an offence to drive a motor vehicle at a speed exceeding a prescribed limit on a road could not apply in an adjacent area because of the inherent localising elements of the offence. The scheme does not therefore purport to extend the application of such a law to the adjacent area. 
 	(b)	give a legal effect to a provision of a substantive criminal law that the provision does not have within the area of the State.
 Example:	If the effect of a provision of the substantive criminal law of a State is limited under section&#160;109 of the Constitution within the area of the State, the effect is similarly limited in the outer adjacent area for the State even though the provision applies in the outer adjacent area under the legislative authority of the Commonwealth.

	(a)	a judicial proceeding related to a maritime offence:

	(a)	the law of the Commonwealth applies to investigations, procedures and acts (other than judicial proceedings) by authorities of the Commonwealth; and
 	(b)	the law of a State applies to investigations, procedures and acts (other than judicial proceedings) by authorities of the State operating within the area of administrative responsibility for the relevant State; and
 	(c)	in a Commonwealth judicial proceeding the law of the Commonwealth applies and in a State judicial proceeding the law of the State in which the proceeding was commenced applies (subject to the Constitution) irrespective of whether:
 	(i)	the maritime offence arises under the law of the State in which the proceeding was commenced or another State; or
 	(ii)	the substantive criminal law against which the offence was committed applies in the relevant part of the adjacent area under the law of the State in which the proceeding was commenced, another State or the Commonwealth.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Example 1:	Suppose that a person is charged by a State authority

with a maritime offence on the assumption that the offence was committed in the

inner adjacent area for the State but the court is satisfied in the course of

the proceedings that the acts alleged against the defendant took place in the

outer adjacent area for the State. In this case, the court could continue with

the proceedings under the procedural laws of the State. However, the court

could not (for example) convict the defendant on the basis of a majority

verdict of a jury (because to do so would be contrary to the Commonwealth

Constitution&#151;see _Cheatle,_ 177 CLR 541). Example 2:	Suppose that a person is charged by a State authority in a South Australian court with a maritime offence alleged to have been committed in the adjacent area for Western Australia. For the purposes of the proceedings, the offence would be classified as a major indictable, minor indictable or summary offence according to the South Australian rules and not by reference to its classification under the law of Western Australia or the Commonwealth.  </dl></dl>

<dt>(3)</dt><dd>This clause operates to the exclusion of any Commonwealth or State law

<center>Back to Top</center>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

		If, in proceedings for a maritime offence, an alleged act, omission or state

of affairs, that is an element of the offence, is proved, an allegation in the

information or complaint that the act, omission or state of affairs happened in

the adjacent area, inner adjacent area, or outer adjacent area for a particular

State is taken to be proved in the absence of proof to the contrary.
