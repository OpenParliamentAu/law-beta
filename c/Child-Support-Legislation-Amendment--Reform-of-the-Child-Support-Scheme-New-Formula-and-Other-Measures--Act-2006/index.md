                   The following is a simplified outline of this Part:

* * *

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      This Part includes the

formulas used for assessing the annual rate of child support payable by a

parent for a child for a day in a child support period (other than in cases

where that rate is worked out in accordance with a child support agreement, a

Registrar’s determination under Part 6A or a court order).</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      The Costs of the Children

Table published by the Secretary each year (based on the table in

Schedule 1 to this Act) sets out the costs to parents of raising children

in various age ranges.</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      Those costs are to be met

by both parents (by paying child support or by caring for their children)

according to each parent’s capacity to meet the costs.</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      To determine each parent’s

capacity to meet those costs, the parents are assessed in respect of the costs

of the child.</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      Generally, both parents’

income is taken into account in determining each parent’s capacity to meet the

costs of their children.</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      The formulas also allow

child support payable to non‑parent carers of children to be worked out.</li>

#### Subdivision B—Working out annual rates of child support using incomes of both parents in single child support case

##### <a id="35D"></a>35D  Application of Subdivision

                   The annual rate of child support payable for a child for a day in a child support period is assessed under this Subdivision if:

                     (a)  both parents of the child are to be assessed in respect of the costs of the child; and

                     (b)  both parents are to be assessed only in respect of the costs of:

                              (i)  that child; and

                             (ii)  any other child in the child support case that relates to that child.

##### <a id="35"></a>35  Formula 1: Method statement using incomes of both parents in single child support case with no non‑parent carer

                   This is how to work out the annual rate of child support payable for a child for a day in a child support period if no non‑parent carer has a percentage of care for the child for the day.

* * *

_Method statement_

_Step 1_.   Work out each parent’s child support income for the child for the day (see section 41).

_Step 2_.   Work out the parents’ combined child support income for the child for the day (see section 42).

_Step 3_.   Work out each parent’s income percentage for the child  for the day (see section 55B).

_Step 4._ Work out each parent’s percentage of care for the child for the day (see section 48).

_Step 5_.   Work out each parent’s cost percentage for the child for the day (see section 55C).

_Step 6_.   Work out each parent’s child support percentage for the child for the day (see section 55D).

_Step 7_.   Work out the costs of the child for the day (see sections 55G and 55H).

_Step 8_.   If a parent has a positive child support percentage under step 6, the **_annual rate of child support_** payable by the parent for the child for the day is worked out using the formula:

* * *

Note:          If a parent’s percentage of care for a child is more than 65%, the parent’s annual rate of child support for the child is nil (see section 40C).

##### <a id="36"></a>36  Formula 2: Working out annual rates of child support using incomes of both parents in single child support case with a non‑parent carer

             (1)  This is how to work out the annual rate of child support payable for a child for a day in a child support period if one or more non‑parent carers have a percentage of care for the child for the day.

             (2)  Follow steps 1 to 8 of the method statement in section 35 for each parent (disregarding subsection 55D(2) (negative child support percentages)).

Annual rate payable by parent

             (3)  If a parent’s (the **_first parent’s_**) child support percentage under step 6 of the method statement in section 35 is positive, then the **_annual rate of child support_** payable by the first parent for the child for the day is the annual rate of child support for the child worked out under step 8 of the method statement.

Annual rate payable only to non‑parent carers

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  the second parent’s child support percentage is also positive; or

                     (b)  the second parent’s child support percentage is nil or negative, and the second parent does not have at least shared care of the child during the relevant care period;

then, subject to section 40B, the first parent must pay the annual rate of child support that is payable by the first parent for the child under subsection (3) to the non‑parent carer or carers in accordance with section 40A.

Note 1:       If both parents have a positive child support percentage, then the non‑parent carer or carers are entitled to be paid the total of the 2 annual rates of child support that are payable by the parents for the child.

Note 2:       Under section 40B, a non‑parent carer of a child is not entitled to be paid child support unless he or she applies under section 25A in relation to the child.

Annual rate payable to parent and non‑parent carer

             (5)  If the second parent’s child support percentage is negative, and the second parent has at least shared care of the child during the relevant care period, then:

                     (a)  the first parent must pay to the second parent the annual rate of child support for the child worked out under step 8 of the method statement using the second parent’s negative child support percentage (expressed as a positive); and

                     (b)  subject to section 40B, the first parent must pay to the non‑parent carer an annual rate of child support for the child that is the difference between:

                              (i)  the annual rate of child support payable by the first parent for the child under subsection (3); and

                             (ii)  the rate referred to in paragraph (a) of this subsection.

_Step 1_.   Follow steps 1 to 8 in the method statement in section 35 for each parent.

_Step 2_.   Work out each parent’s multi‑case cap (if any) for the child for the day (see section 55E).

_Step 3_.   If a parent has a positive child support percentage under step 6 of the method statement in section 35, the **_annual rate of child support_** payable by the parent for the child for the day is the lower of:

               (a)     the annual rate of child support for the child worked out under step 8 of the method statement; and

              (b)     the parent’s multi‑case cap (if any) for the child for the day.

             (3)  Work out each parent’s multi‑case cap (if any) for the child for the day (see section 55E).

Annual rate payable by parent

             (4)  If a parent’s (the **_first parent’s_**) child support percentage under step 6 of the method statement in section 35 is positive, then the **_annual rate of child support_** payable by the first parent for the child for the day is the lower of:

                     (a)  the annual rate of child support for the child worked out under step 8 of the method statement; and

                     (b)  the first parent’s multi‑case cap (if any) for the child for the day.

Annual rate payable only to non‑parent carers

             (5)  If:

                     (a)  the second parent’s child support percentage is also positive; or

                     (b)  the second parent’s child support percentage is nil or negative, and the second parent does not have at least shared care of the child during the relevant care period;

then, subject to section 40B, the first parent must pay the annual rate of child support that is payable by the first parent for the child under subsection (4) to the non‑parent carer or carers in accordance with section 40A.

Note 1:       If both parents have a positive child support percentage, then the non‑parent carer or carers are entitled to be paid the total of the 2 annual rates of child support that are payable by the parents for the child.

#### Subdivision D—Working out annual rates of child support using income of one parent

##### <a id="38A"></a>38A  Application of Subdivision

                   The annual rate of child support payable for a child for a day in a child support period is assessed under this Subdivision if only one parent of the child is to be assessed in respect of the costs of the child.

##### <a id="39"></a>39  Formula 5: Method statement using income of one parent where other parent not a resident of Australia or in special circumstances

                   This is how to work out the annual rate of child support payable for a child for a day in a child support period if a non‑parent carer of the child has applied for a parent of the child to be assessed in respect of the costs of the child because of subparagraph 25A(b)(ii) or (iii) (non‑resident of Australia or special circumstances).

* * *

_Method statement_

_Step 1_.   Work out the parent’s child support income for the day (see section 41) and double that income.

_Step 2._ Work out the parent’s percentage of care for the child for the day (see section 48).

_Step 3_.   Work out the parent’s cost percentage for the child for the day (see section 55C).

_Step 4_.   Work out the costs of the child for the day (see sections 55G and 55H), assuming, in applying section 55G and Schedule 1, that the reference to the child support income of the parent in the Costs of the Children Table is a reference to the amount worked out under step 1.

_Step 5_.   Work out the following rate:

              ![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00151/Html/89f5afe0-4b58-4895-a496-d15deaf6ec1e_files/image003.gif)

_Step 6._ If the parent is not assessed in respect of the costs of another child who is in another child support case, the **_annual rate of child support_** payable by the parent for the child for the day is the rate worked out under step 5.

_Step 7_.   If the parent is assessed in respect of the costs of another child who is in another child support case, work out the parent’s multi‑case cap for the child for the day (see section 55E).

_Step 8._   The **_annual rate of child support_** payable by the parent for the child for the day is the lower of:

               (a)     the rate worked out under step 5; and

              (b)     the parent’s multi‑case cap for the child for the day.

_Step 9_.   If there is only one non‑parent carer who has a percentage of care for the child for the day, the parent must pay the annual rate of child support that is payable for the child under step 5 or 8 to the non‑parent carer. If there are 2 non‑parent carers who have a percentage of care for the child for the day, then, subject to section 40B, the parent must pay the annual rate of child support that is payable for the child under step 5 or 8 to the non‑parent carers in accordance with section 40A.

* * *

Note:          Under section 40B, a non‑parent carer of a child is not entitled to be paid child support unless he or she applies under section 25A in relation to the child.

##### <a id="40"></a>40  Formula 6: Method statement using income of one parent where other parent deceased

                   This is how to work out the annual rate of child support payable for a child for a day in a child support period if a non‑parent carer of the child has applied for a parent of the child to be assessed in respect of the costs of the child because of subparagraph 25A(b)(iv) (deceased parent).

* * *

_Method statement_

_Step 1_.   Work out the parent’s child support income for the day (see section 41).

              ![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00151/Html/89f5afe0-4b58-4895-a496-d15deaf6ec1e_files/image004.gif)

_Step 6_.   If the parent is not assessed in respect of the costs of another child who is in another child support case, the **_annual rate of child support_** payable by the parent for the child for the day is the rate worked out under step 5.

_Step 7_.   If the parent is assessed in respect of the costs of another child who is in another child support case, work out the parent’s multi‑case cap for the child for the day (see section 55E).

_Step 8._   The **_annual rate of child support_** payable by the parent for the child for the day is the lower of:

               (a)     the rate worked out under step 5; and

              (b)     the parent’s multi‑case cap for the child for the day.

_Step 9_.   If there is only one non‑parent carer who has a percentage of care for the child for the day, the parent must pay the annual rate of child support that is payable for the child under step 5 or 8 to the non‑parent carer. If there are 2 non‑parent carers who have a percentage of care for the child for the day, then, subject to section 40B, the parent must pay the annual rate of child support that is payable for the child under step 5 or 8 to the non‑parent carers in accordance with section 40A.

#### Subdivision C—Working out the components of child support income

##### <a id="43"></a>43  Working out parent’s adjusted taxable income

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), a parent’s **_adjusted taxable income_** for a child for a day in a child support period is the total of the following components:

                     (e)  the total of the tax free pensions or benefits received by that parent in that year of income.

Note 1:       Other provisions that relate to a person’s adjusted taxable income are section 34A and Subdivisions B and C of Division 7.

Note 2:       The components of the definition of **_adjusted taxable income_** are defined in section 5.

             (2)  If the Registrar amends an assessment under section 44, then for the purposes of the assessment, the person’s **_adjusted taxable income_** for a child to whom the assessment relates, for a day in the child support period, is the amount determined by the Registrar.

##### <a id="44"></a>44  Post‑separation costs

Application for post‑separation income to be excluded

             (1)  A parent (the **_applicant_**) of a child may apply to the Registrar to amend an administrative assessment of child support payable by or to the parent for the child for part of a child support period if:

                     (a)  the applicant and the other parent of the child lived together on a genuine domestic basis for at least 6 months; and

                     (b)  the last separation of the applicant from the other parent before the application for administrative assessment of child support for the child was made under section 25 or 25A occurred within the last 3 years; and

                     (c)  at the time of the application under this section, the applicant and the other parent remain separated; and

                     (d)  in the last relevant year of income the applicant earned, derived or received income:

                              (i)  in accordance with a pattern of earnings, derivation or receipt that was established after the applicant and the other parent first separated; and

                             (ii)  that is of a kind that it is reasonable to expect would not have been earned, derived or received in the ordinary course of events.

             (2)  If the applicant makes an application under this section, the Registrar may determine that the applicant’s adjusted taxable income for the child for a day in the child support period is a specified amount that excludes the income referred to in paragraph (1)(d).

             (3)  However, the Registrar may make a determination under subsection (2) only if the determination:

                     (a)  reduces the applicant’s adjusted taxable income for the child for a day in the child support period by 30% or less; and

                     (b)  applies in respect of a day in the child support period, being a day that is less than 3 years after the last separation referred to in paragraph (1)(b).

Registrar to implement determinations

             (4)  The Registrar is to take such action as is necessary to give effect to the determination by amending any administrative assessment that has been made in relation to the child support period.

Notice to be served if Registrar refuses application

             (5)  If the Registrar refuses to make a determination under subsection (2), the Registrar must serve written notice of the decision on the applicant.

             (6)  The notice must include, or be accompanied by, a statement to the effect:

                     (a)  that the applicant may, subject to the Registration and Collection Act, object to the particulars of the assessment in relation to which the applicant sought to make the application; and

                     (b)  that if the applicant is aggrieved by the decision on the objection, he or she may, subject to that Act, apply to the SSAT for review of the decision.

             (7)  This section does not prevent the Registrar from making a new assessment for part of the child support period.

Note:          This section does not limit the power under section 75 to amend assessments (see subsection 75(5)).

##### <a id="45"></a>45  Working out the self‑support amount

                   A parent’s **_self‑support amount_** for a day in a child support period is:

Note:          A parent’s self‑support amount can be varied by a determination or order under section 98S or 118.

##### <a id="46"></a>46  Working out parent’s relevant dependent child amount

                   A parent’s **_relevant dependent child amount_** for a day in a child support period is the total  of the amounts worked out for each relevant dependent child of the parent using this method statement.

* * *

_Method statement_

_Step 1_.   Work out the difference between the parent’s adjusted taxable income for the child for the day and the parent’s self‑support amount for the day (see sections 43 and 45).

_Step 2_.   Work out the parent’s percentage of care for the child for the day (see section 48).

_Step 3_.   Work out the parent’s cost percentage for the child for the day (see section 55C).

_Step 4_.   Work out the costs of the child for the day (see sections 55G and 55H) as if:

               (a)     the parent’s annual rate of child support were assessed under Subdivision D of Division 2; and

              (b)     the reference in subsection 55G(2) to the parent’s child support income were a reference to the amount worked out under step 1; and

               (c)     references in sections 55G and 55H to children in the child support case that relates to the child were references to all of the parent’s relevant dependent children.

_Step 5_.   Work out the following amount for the child for a day in the child support period:

              ![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00151/Html/89f5afe0-4b58-4895-a496-d15deaf6ec1e_files/image011.gif)

* * *

Note:          Section 73A deals with the Registrar discovering, after making an administrative assessment, that a parent has a relevant dependent child.

##### <a id="47"></a>47  Working out multi‑case allowances

                   A parent’s **_multi‑case allowance_** for a child (the **_particular child_**) for a day in a child support period is worked out using this method statement.

* * *

_Method statement_

_Step 1_.   Work out the following amount:

              ![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00151/Html/89f5afe0-4b58-4895-a496-d15deaf6ec1e_files/image012.gif)

_Step 2_.   If the parent has a relevant dependent child, take the parent’s relevant dependent child amount (see section 46) for the day from the amount worked out under step 1.

_Step 3_.   Work out the costs of the children for the day for all children (the **_multi‑case children_**) for whom the parent is assessed in respect of the costs of the child, as if:

               (a)     the parent’s annual rate of child support were assessed under Subdivision D of Division 2; and

              (b)     the reference in subsection 55G(2) to the parent’s child support income were a reference to the amount worked out under step 1 or 2 (as the case requires); and

               (c)     references in section 55G to children in the child support case that relates to the child were references to all of the parent’s multi‑case children.

_Step 4._ Work out the parent’s **_multi‑case child costs_** for the particular child for the day using the formula:

              ![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00151/Html/89f5afe0-4b58-4895-a496-d15deaf6ec1e_files/image013.gif)

_Step 5_.   The parent’s **_multi‑case allowance_** for the particular child for the day is the following amount:

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      A person’s (whether the

person is a parent or a non‑parent carer of a child) percentage of care for the

child for a day in a child support period is the percentage of care of the

child that the person is likely to have during a 12 month period.</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      A percentage of care for a

##### <a id="47B"></a>47B  Meaning of _court order_

                   In this Division:

                    <a name="court-order"></a>**_court order_** means:

                     (a)  a family violence order within the meaning of section 4 of the _Family Law Act 1975_; or

                     (d)  an overseas child order registered in accordance with section 70G of the _Family Law Act 1975_.

#### Subdivision B—Determining percentages of care

##### <a id="48"></a>48  Working out percentage of care

             (1)  A person’s **_percentage of care_** for a child for a day in a child support period is the percentage of care of the child that the person is likely to have during the period (the **_care period_**) of 12 months from:

                     (a)  the day on which an application is made under section 25 or 25A for a parent to be assessed in respect of the costs of the child; or

                     (b)  the day on which the Registrar becomes aware of the following:

                              (i)  a change of at least 7.1% in the percentage of care of the child that the person has;

                             (ii)  that the person’s percentage of care for the child has fallen below 14%;

                            (iii)  that the person’s percentage of care for the child has increased to 14%, or above 14%.

Note:          The Registrar is not entitled to amend an administrative assessment in respect of a person’s percentage of care unless the Registrar becomes aware of an event mentioned in paragraph (1)(b) (see subsection 75(2)).

             (2)  The percentage of care is to be worked out in accordance with this Subdivision.

Note:          Generally, a person’s percentage of care for a child is worked out based on the number of nights that the child is likely to be in the care of the person during the care period.

             (3)  If a person’s percentage of care worked out in accordance with this Subdivision is not a whole percentage:

                     (a)  if the percentage is greater than 50%—the percentage is rounded up to the nearest whole percentage; and

                     (b)  if the percentage is less than 50%—the percentage is rounded down to the nearest whole percentage.

##### <a id="49"></a>49  Agreements, parenting plans and court orders may determine percentage of care

                   The percentage (if any) of care of a child that a parent or non‑parent carer is likely to have during a care period is determined in accordance with the following agreement, plan or order if the Registrar is satisfied that the agreement, plan or order allows such a percentage to be determined:

                     (a)  if the relevant application for administrative assessment for child support for the child is made under subparagraphs 25A(b)(ii) to (iv) (application by non‑parent carer in relation to one parent):

                              (i)  an oral or written agreement, or parenting plan, between the parent and a non‑parent carer of the child that the Registrar is satisfied has been made; or

                             (ii)  a court order that relates to the parent and a non‑parent carer of the child, or that relates to the child;

                     (b)  otherwise:

                              (i)  an oral agreement between the parents of the child that the Registrar is satisfied has been made; or

                             (ii)  a parenting plan for the child that has been entered into by the parents; or

                            (iii)  a court order that relates to the parents, or that relates to the child.

##### <a id="50"></a>50  Registrar determinations where no agreement, plan or order

             (1)  The Registrar must determine the percentage (if any) of care of a child that a parent or non‑parent carer of the child is likely to have during the relevant care period if there is no agreement, plan or order that allows such a percentage to be determined under section 49.

             (2)  In making the determination, the Registrar must take into account such period as is required in order for the Registrar to be satisfied that there is, has been, or will be, a pattern of care for the child.

             (3)  The Registrar may revoke or vary a determination made under this section.

#### Subdivision C—Changes to percentages of care

##### <a id="51"></a>51  Person no longer agrees with oral agreement

                   If:

                     (a)  an oral agreement determines, under section 49, a percentage of care of a child that a parent or non‑parent carer is likely to have during a care period; and

                     (b)  the Registrar becomes aware that a parent or non‑parent carer of the child no longer agrees with that percentage of care; and

                     (c)  immediately before the oral agreement was made, a parenting plan or court order  determined the percentage of care of the child that each parent or non‑parent carer would have during the care period;

the percentage of care of the child that a parent or non‑parent carer is likely to have during the care period is as determined in accordance with the parenting plan or court order.

##### <a id="52"></a>52  Interim Registrar determinations where parent or non‑parent carer does not agree with percentages of care

             (1)  The Registrar may determine the percentage (if any) of care of a child that a parent or non‑parent carer of the child is likely to have during the relevant care period if:

                     (a)  there is an agreement, plan or order that allows such a percentage to be determined under section 49; and

                     (b)  a parent or non‑parent carer of the child does not agree that the care of the child that is actually taking place is in accordance with the percentage so determined; and

                     (c)  in the circumstances of the case, the percentage so determined would result in an unjust and inequitable determination of the level of financial support to be provided by a parent for the child; and

                     (d)  a parent or non‑parent carer of the child has taken reasonable action:

                              (i)  to seek to reach agreement; or

                             (ii)  to seek a court order; or

                            (iii)  to enforce a court order;

                            about the care of the child; and

                     (e)  a parent or non‑parent carer of the child applies for the determination.

Note:          If the Registrar refuses to make a determination under this section, the Registrar must give the applicant a notice under section 54.

             (2)  In making the determination, the Registrar must take into account such period as is required in order for the Registrar to be satisfied that there is, has been, or will be, a pattern of care for the child.

             (3)  The Registrar may revoke or vary a determination made under this section.

             (4)  Before the end of 6 months after a determination is made under this section, the Registrar:

                     (a)  must review the determination; and

                     (b)  may make another determination under this section.

##### <a id="53"></a>53  Registrar determination where parent’s care falls below 14%

Making a determination

             (1)  The Registrar may determine the percentage (if any) of care of a child that a parent or non‑parent carer is likely to have during a care period if:

                     (a)  a parent (the **_first parent_**) was to have at least regular care of the child during the relevant care period under an oral agreement, parenting plan or court order; and

                     (b)  the first parent has no care, or has a pattern of care that is less than regular care, of the child despite the other parent or a non‑parent carer making the child available to the first parent; and

                     (c)  the other parent or a non‑parent carer of the child applies for the determination.

Note:          If the Registrar refuses to make a determination under this section, the Registrar must give the applicant a notice under section 54.

Day on which determination commences

             (2)  The determination must specify, in accordance with subsections (4) and (5), the first day in the child support period to which the determination is to apply.

             (3)  The determination applies to the day specified, and later days in the child support period.

             (4)  If the Registrar is satisfied that the other parent or the non‑parent carer who applied for the determination failed, within a reasonable period, to notify the Registrar that the first parent had no care, or less than regular care, of the child during the relevant care period, the day specified must be the day on which the determination is made.

             (5)  Otherwise, the day specified must be:

                     (a)  if the first parent never established a pattern of care in accordance with the oral agreement, parenting plan or court order—the day on which the plan or court order was entered into or made; or

                     (b)  if the first parent established a pattern of care in accordance with the oral agreement, parenting plan or court order, but later ceased the established pattern of care—the day on which the parent ceased the previously established pattern.

             (6)  To avoid doubt, a parent never establishes a pattern of care if:

                     (a)  the parent could not have established the pattern of care until a particular period that occurs later in the child support period; and

                     (b)  the parent does not establish that pattern during that particular period.

             (7)  The Registrar may revoke or vary a determination made under this section.

Registrar to make determination under this section (and not interim determination)

             (8)  If the Registrar could make a determination under section 52 and this section in respect of the percentage of care for a child, the Registrar must make a determination under this section and not section 52.

##### <a id="54"></a>54  Notice to be served if Registrar refuses application

             (1)  If the Registrar refuses to make a determination under section 52 or 53, the Registrar must serve written notice of the decision on the person who made the application.

             (2)  The notice must include, or be accompanied by, a statement to the effect:

                     (a)  that the person may, subject to the Registration and Collection Act, object to the particulars of the assessment in relation to which the person sought to make the application; and

                     (b)  that if the person is aggrieved by the decision on the objection, he or she may, subject to that Act, apply to the SSAT for review of the decision.

#### Subdivision D—Where there is more than one agreement, plan, order or determination

##### <a id="55"></a>55  Where there is more than one agreement, plan, order or determination

             (1)  If more than one agreement, plan, order or determination applies, under section 49, 50, 52 or 53, to a day in a child support period, then the percentage of care of a child that a parent or non‑parent carer is likely to have during the care period is as determined by the most recent agreement, plan, order or determination.

             (2)  However, the most recent agreement, plan or determination is subject to any court order made in respect of the percentage of care of a child that specifies that the order cannot be altered by agreement between the persons in respect of whom the order is made.

### Division 5—Working out other elements for the formulas

#### Subdivision A—Preliminary

##### <a id="55A"></a>55A  Simplified outline

percentage represents the parent’s capacity to meet the costs of the child.</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      A parent’s cost percentage

represents the extent to which the parent is taken to have met the costs of the

child through care.</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      A parent’s child support

percentage is the difference between the parent’s income percentage and his or

her cost percentage. Generally, if the parent has a positive child support

percentage, the annual rate of child support payable by the parent is that

percentage of the costs of the child.</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      If a parent has multiple

child support cases, the annual rate of child support payable by the parent for

a child is capped by the parent’s multi‑case cap for the child.</li>

##### <a id="55C"></a>55C  Working out cost percentages

                   A parent’s or non‑parent carer’s **_cost percentage_** for a child for a day in a child support period is the percentage worked out using the table based on the parent’s or non‑parent carer’s (as the case requires) percentage of care for the child for the day.

* * *

#### Subdivision B—The costs of the child

##### <a id="55G"></a>55G  Working out the costs of the children

             (1)  If an annual rate of child support for a day in a child support period is assessed for a child under section 35, 36, 37 or 38 (Formulas 1 to 4), identify the column in the Costs of the Children Table for that child support period that covers the combined child support income of the parents of the child.

Note:          The Secretary publishes the updated Costs of the Children Table in the _Gazette_ each year for child support periods that begin in the next year (see section 155).

             (2)  If an annual rate of child support for a day in a child support period is assessed for a child under Subdivision D of Division 2 (Formulas 5 and 6), identify the column in the Costs of the Children Table for that child support period that covers the child support income of the parent of the child.

Note:          This subsection also applies in working out the relevant dependent child amount and the multi‑case allowance (see step 4 of the method statement in section 46 and step 3 of the method statement in section 47).

             (3)  Identify the number of children (the **_child support children_**) in the child support case that relates to the child.

             (4)  Identify the ages of the child support children at the time the administrative assessment is made. If there are more than 3 child support children, use the ages of the 3 oldest children.

             (5)  Identify the item in the relevant column in the Costs of the Children Table that covers that number of child support children of those ages.

             (6)  The amount worked out for the item in accordance with Schedule 1 to this Act is the **_costs of the children_**.

##### <a id="55H"></a>55H  Working out the costs of the child

                   The **_costs of a child_** for a day in a child support period is:

                     (a)  if there is only one child support child—the costs of the children; and

                     (b)  otherwise—the costs of the children divided by the number of child support children.

#### Subdivision B—Adjusted taxable income determined by reference to taxable income for last relevant year of income

##### <a id="56"></a>56  Taxable income is as assessed under Income Tax Assessment Act

Meaning of **taxable income**

             (1)  For the purposes of assessing a parent in respect of the costs of a child in relation to a child support period, if the parent’s taxable income has been assessed under an Income Tax Assessment Act for the last relevant year of income in relation to the child support period, the parent’s **_taxable income_** for that year is the amount as so assessed.

Note:          Sections 34A and 57 are also relevant to a person’s taxable income.

When amended tax assessment may be taken into account

             (2)  If, after an administrative assessment of child support is made, the assessment (the **_tax assessment_**) of a parent’s taxable income is amended (whether or not because of an objection, appeal or review), the Registrar must not amend the administrative assessment to take account of the amendment to the tax assessment unless one of the following applies:

                     (a)  the amendment to the tax assessment is made under item 5 of the table in subsection 170(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (amendment due to fraud or evasion);

                     (b)  the amendment to the tax assessment is made under provisions of an Income Tax Assessment Act that are prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph;

                     (c)  the amendment is made in circumstances prescribed for the purposes of this paragraph;

                     (d)  the amendment is made solely for the purposes of working out the parent’s adjusted taxable income for the last relevant year of income for the purposes of subsection 60(3) of this Act (first estimate must be lower than adjusted taxable income).

Date of assessment of a parent’s taxable income taken to be date of notice of the assessment

             (3)  For the purposes of this section, if:

                     (a)  notice of an assessment (including an amended assessment) of a parent’s taxable income under an Income Tax Assessment Act has been served on the parent under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; and

                     (b)  the notice is dated;

then the assessment is taken to have been made on the date of the notice.

Section not to affect determinations, court orders or consent orders

             (4)  This section does not prevent:

                     (a)  the Registrar from making any determination under Part 6A (departure determinations); or

                     (b)  a court from making any order under Division 4 of Part 7 (departure orders); or

                     (c)  the making, and acceptance by the Registrar, of a child support agreement that includes provisions that have effect for the purposes of this Part as if they were such an order made by consent.

##### <a id="57"></a>57  Taxable income for child support purposes where taxable income determined to be nil under Income Tax Assessment Act

             (1)  This section does not apply to a parent for a year of income if the parent has a component of adjusted taxable income mentioned in paragraphs 43(1)(b) to (e) for the year of income.

Determinations that taxable income nil or no tax payable

             (2)  A parent’s **_taxable income_** for a year of income is nil if the parent’s taxable income for that year has been determined to be nil under an Income Tax Assessment Act.

             (3)  A parent’s **_taxable income_** for a year of income is also nil if:

                     (a)  the Commissioner has determined under an Income Tax Assessment Act that no tax was payable (before the allowance of any rebate or credit) under that Act on the parent’s taxable income for the year of income; and

                     (b)  either of the following subparagraphs applies in relation to the person:

                              (i)  Part 1 of Schedule 7 to the _Income Tax Rates Act 1986_(or any other law prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph in relation to the year of income) applied in relation to the parent for the year of income;

                             (ii)  no tax would have been payable (before the allowance of any rebate or credit) under that Act by the person on his or her taxable income if Part 1 of Schedule 7 to the _Income Tax Rates Act 1986_(or any other law prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph in relation to the year of income) had applied in relation to the parent for the year of income.

             (4)  Subsections (2) and (3) do not apply in relation to an administrative assessment made in relation to a parent if:

                     (a)  before the administrative assessment is made; but

                     (b)  after the most relevant notice mentioned in subsection (5) or (6) is made;

an assessment is issued under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ of the person’s taxable income for the year of income under an Income Tax Assessment Act.

Notices issued under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936

             (5)  If a parent has been served a notice under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ to the effect that the taxable income of the parent under an Income Tax Assessment Act for a year of income is nil, then:

                     (a)  the parent’s taxable income for that year is taken to have been determined to be nil under an Income Tax Assessment Act; and

                     (b)  if the notice was dated—the determination is taken to have been made on the date of the notice.

             (6)  If a parent has been served a notice under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ to the effect that no tax is payable (before the allowance of any rebate or credit) under an Income Tax Assessment Act on the taxable income of the parent for a year of income, then:

                     (a)  the Commissioner is taken to have determined under the Income Tax Assessment Act that no tax was payable (before the allowance of any rebate or credit) under that Act on the parent’s taxable income for the year of income; and

                     (b)  if the notice was dated—the determination is taken to have been made on the date of the notice.

When amended tax assessment may be taken into account

             (7)  If, after an administrative assessment of child support is made, the assessment (the **_tax assessment_**) of the parent’s taxable income is amended (whether or not because of an objection, appeal or review), the Registrar must not amend the administrative assessment to take account of the amendment to the tax assessment unless either of the following applies:

                     (a)  the subsequent assessment was made because the parent had not made to the Commissioner a full and true disclosure of all the material facts necessary for the Commissioner’s assessment, or in other circumstances prescribed for the purposes of this subsection;

                     (b)  the amendment is made solely for the purposes of working out the parent’s adjusted taxable income for the last relevant year of income for the purposes of subsection 60(3) (first estimate must be lower than adjusted taxable income).

Date of assessment of a parent’s taxable income taken to be date of notice of the assessment

             (8)  For the purposes of this section, if:

                     (a)  notice of an assessment (including an amended assessment) of a parent’s taxable income under an Income Tax Assessment Act has been served on the parent under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; and

                     (b)  the notice is dated;

then the assessment is taken to have been made on the date of the notice.

Section not to affect determinations, court orders or consent orders

             (9)  This section does not prevent:

                     (a)  the Registrar from making any determination under Part 6A (departure determinations); or

                     (b)  a court from making any order under Division 4 of Part 7 (departure orders); or

                     (c)  the making, and acceptance by the Registrar, of a child support agreement that includes provisions that have effect for the purposes of this Part as if they were such an order made by consent.

##### <a id="58"></a>58  Registrar determination of adjusted taxable income

             (1)  For the purposes of assessing a parent in respect of the costs of a child in relation to a child support period, the Registrar may determine, in accordance with this section, that an amount that he or she considers appropriate is the parent’s adjusted taxable income for a year of income.

Note:          The Registrar is required to amend an administrative assessment made on the basis of such a determination if the parent’s adjusted taxable income is subsequently ascertained or the Registrar makes a later determination under this section (see section 58A).

Determinations where parent fails to comply with requirement

             (2)  The Registrar may make a determination if:

                     (a)  a parent has not, under an Income Tax Assessment Act, lodged a tax return for the year of income; and

                     (b)  the Registrar or the Commissioner of Taxation is unable to readily ascertain the parent’s adjusted taxable income for the year of income on the basis of the documents and information in his or her possession; and

                     (c)  the Registrar or the Commissioner has, for the purposes of ascertaining that adjusted taxable income, required the parent:

                              (i)  to give a return; or

                             (ii)  to give information (whether orally or in writing); or

                            (iii)  to produce a document; and

                     (d)  the parent has refused or failed to comply with the requirement.

             (3)  If the parent also has not lodged a tax return for the year of income before the year of income referred to in subsection (1), the amount determined for the parent’s adjusted taxable income for the year of income must be determined to be two‑thirds of the annualised MTAWE figure for the relevant September quarter.

Determination if Registrar given taxable income or total

             (4)  The Registrar may make a determination if:

                     (a)  a parent has not, under an Income Tax Assessment Act, lodged a tax return for the year of income; and

                     (b)  the Registrar or the Commissioner is unable to readily ascertain the parent’s adjusted taxable income for the year of income on the basis of the documents and information in his or her possession; and

                     (c)  the Registrar or the Commissioner has, for the purposes of ascertaining that adjusted taxable income, been given:

                              (i)  information (whether orally or in writing); or

                             (ii)  a document; and

                     (d)  either:

                              (i)  an amount was specified in that information or document as the parent’s adjusted taxable income for the last relevant year of income; or

                             (ii)  that information or document allowed the parent’s adjusted taxable income for the last relevant year of income to be worked out; and

                     (e)  the amount determined by the Registrar under subsection (1) was the amount specified or worked out under paragraph (d) of this subsection.

##### <a id="58A"></a>58A  Subsequently ascertaining components of a parent’s adjusted taxable income

             (1)  The Registrar must immediately amend an administrative assessment of child support payable by or to a parent in relation to a child support period if:

                     (a)  the assessment was made on the basis of a determination under section 58; and

                     (b)  either:

                              (i)  the Registrar subsequently ascertains the amount of the parent’s adjusted taxable income for the last relevant year of income; or

                             (ii)  the Registrar makes a later determination under section 58; and

                     (c)  either:

                              (i)  if subparagraph (b)(i) applies—the amount that was subsequently ascertained is different from the amount that was determined under section 58; or

                             (ii)  if subparagraph (b)(ii) applies—the later amount that the Registrar determines is different from the earlier amount determined under section 58.

Retrospective determinations

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  at the time the Registrar is to amend the administrative assessment under this section, the parent could lodge his or her tax return by the date required under Part IV of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_(taking into account any deferral under section 388‑55 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_); or

                     (b)  paragraph (a) of this subsection does not apply and:

                              (i)  the amount subsequently ascertained, as mentioned in subparagraph (1)(b)(i), is higher than the amount that was determined under section 58; or

                             (ii)  the later amount that the Registrar determines, as mentioned in subparagraph (1)(b)(ii), is higher than the earlier amount determined under section 58;

then the Registrar must immediately amend the administrative assessment for the child support period on the basis that the parent’s adjusted taxable income for that year of income is, and has always been, the amount that was subsequently ascertained or later determined (as the case requires).

Prospective determinations

             (3)  If subsection (2) does not apply, then the Registrar must immediately amend the administrative assessment for the child support period on the basis that for each later day in the period the parent’s adjusted taxable income for that year of income is the amount that was subsequently ascertained or later determined (as the case requires).

No taxation assessment required

             (4)  This section applies whether or not the Commissioner of Taxation has made an assessment under an Income Tax Assessment Act of the parent’s taxable income for that year of income.

#### Subdivision C—Child support income determined by reference to estimate of adjusted taxable income for rest of current child support period

##### <a id="60"></a>60  Choosing adjusted taxable income for remainder of child support period

Election that adjusted taxable income is estimated amount

             (1)  Before or during a child support period, a parent may elect that the parent’s adjusted taxable income for assessing the parent in respect of the costs of a child of the parent for the remaining days in a child support period is to be the amount the parent works out using the method in subsection (5) (with the modification in subsection (6), if appropriate).

Election prohibited if income amount order in force

             (2)  However, a parent may not make an election relating to a child support period if an income amount order is in force in relation to the parent and any part of the period.

First election must be for amount less than adjusted taxable income for last relevant year of income

             (3)  The parent may make a first election relating to a child support period only if the amount that he or she works out under this section is not more than 85% of the total of the parent’s adjusted taxable income for the last relevant year of income for the child support period.

Other elections may be made at intervals of at least 2 months

             (4)  The parent may make one or more later elections relating to the child support period at intervals of at least 2 months if:

                     (a)  the parent revokes the immediately preceding election under section 62 when making each later election; and

                     (b)  the amount worked out under this section for each later election is greater or less than the amount of the first election relating to the period.

Method of estimation of adjusted taxable income

             (5)  The method is as follows:

* * *

_Method statement_

_Step 1_.   Work out the length of the period (the **_remaining period_**):

               (a)     starting on the day the parent makes the estimate or the day the child support period starts, whichever is later (or either day if they are the same); and

              (b)     ending 15 months after the start of the child support period.

_Step 2_.   Estimate the amount that would be the parent’s adjusted taxable income for the remaining period if that period were a year of income.

_Step 3_.   If the remaining period is shorter or longer than 12 months:

               (a)     divide the total from step 2 by the number of days in the remaining period; and

              (b)     multiply the quotient by 365.

* * *

Parent may treat remaining period as 12 months even if it is longer

             (6)  If the remaining period is more than 12 months, the parent may apply the method in subsection (5) as if the remaining period were exactly 12 months, starting on the day worked out under paragraph (a) of step 1 of the method statement in subsection (5).

How election is made

             (7)  The parent makes the election by giving notice of it to the Registrar in the manner specified by the Registrar. The notice must specify:

                     (a)  the amount that the parent elects is to be his or her adjusted taxable income; and

                     (b)  the amount the parent estimated at step 2 of the method statement in subsection (5); and

                     (c)  that the remaining period was treated as being 12 months, if the parent chose to do so under subsection (6).

##### <a id="60A"></a>60A  Registrar may refuse to accept election

             (1)  The Registrar may refuse to accept the parent’s election if the Registrar is satisfied that the amount the parent estimated at step 2 of the method statement in subsection 60(5) is likely to be less than the actual amount that would be the parent’s adjusted taxable income for the remaining period if that period were a year of income.

             (2)  In making the decision as to whether to refuse the election, the Registrar:

                     (a)  may act on the basis of information that the Registrar has received or obtained as to the financial circumstances of the parent; and

                     (b)  may, but is not required to, conduct an inquiry into the matter.

             (3)  Except for the purposes of Parts VII, VIIA and VIII of the Registration and Collection Act (dealing with objections and appeals), if the Registrar refuses to accept an election, the election is taken never to have been made.

##### <a id="60B"></a>60B  Notice to be given if Registrar refuses to accept election

             (1)  If the Registrar refuses to accept an election under section 60A, the Registrar must serve written notice of the decision on the parent who sought to make the election.

             (2)  The notice must include, or be accompanied by, a statement to the effect:

                     (a)  that the parent may, subject to the Registration and Collection Act, object to the particulars of the assessment in relation to which the parent sought to make the election; and

                     (b)  that if the parent is aggrieved by the decision on the objection, he or she may, subject to that Act, apply to the SSAT for review of the decision.

             (3)  A contravention of subsection (2) in relation to a decision does not affect the validity of the decision.

##### <a id="61"></a>61  Effect of election

             (1)  If a parent makes an election under section 60 relating to a child support period, then for the purposes of assessing the parent in respect of the costs of a child of the parent for each later day in the child support period, the parent’s adjusted taxable income is the amount the parent elected.

             (2)  Subsection (1) has effect subject to an income amount order that is made after the making of the election that applies in relation to the parent and any part of the child support period.

             (3)  The Registrar must immediately take such action as is necessary to give effect to subsection (1) in relation to any administrative assessment that has been made in relation to the parent and the child support period (whether by amending the assessment or otherwise).

             (4)  Subject to section 63, in subsequently making any administrative assessment in relation to the parent and the child support period, the Registrar must act in accordance with this section.

             (5)  This section does not prevent:

                     (a)  the Registrar making any determination under Part 6A (departure determinations); or

                     (b)  a court making any order under Division 4 of Part 7 (departure orders); or

                     (c)  the making, and acceptance by the Registrar, of a child support agreement that includes provisions that have effect for the purposes of this Part as if they were such an order made by consent.

##### <a id="62"></a>62  Revocation of election

             (1)  Subject to subsection (3), a parent who has made an election under section 60 in relation to a child support period may, by notice given to the Registrar, revoke the election, but the revocation has no effect unless, at the same time, the parent substitutes a new election for that period under section 60.

             (2)  The notice must be given in the manner specified by the Registrar.

Note:          Section 150A provides for the Registrar to specify the manner in which a notice may be given.

             (3)  The parent may not revoke the election if an income amount order made after the making of the election is in force in relation to the parent and the child support period.

##### <a id="63"></a>63  Effect of revocation

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a parent makes an election under section 60 relating to a child support period; and

                     (b)  the parent revokes the election and substitutes a new election;

then for the purposes of assessing the parent in respect of the costs of a child of the parent for each later day in the child support period, the parent’s adjusted taxable income is the amount the parent elected in the new election.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to any day in the child support period in relation to which an income amount order made after the making, but before the revocation, of the election applies in relation to the parent.

             (3)  The Registrar must immediately take such action as is necessary to give effect to subsection (1) in relation to any administrative assessment that has been made in relation to the parent and any part of the child support period (whether by amending the assessment or otherwise).

             (4)  Subject to any further election made under section 60, in subsequently making any administrative assessment in relation to the parent and the child support period, the Registrar must act in accordance with subsection (1).

             (5)  This section does not prevent:

                     (a)  the Registrar making any determination under Part 6A (departure determinations); or

                     (b)  a court making any order under Division 4 of Part 7 (departure orders); or

                     (c)  the making, and acceptance by the Registrar, of a child support agreement that includes provisions that have effect for the purposes of this Part as if they were such an order made by consent.

##### <a id="63A"></a>63A  Amendment of assessment based on election if event affecting accuracy of estimate occurs

             (1)  This section allows the Registrar to amend an assessment of child support payable by or to a parent for some days in a child support period if:

                     (a)  the parent has made an election under section 60 relating to the period; and

                     (b)  the Registrar has given the parent a notice under section 160 requiring the parent to notify the Registrar of the occurrence of an event that may affect the accuracy of an estimate on which the election is based.

             (2)  If the parent gives notice of the event as required by section 160, the Registrar may amend the assessment to affect the annual rate of child support payable by or to the parent for the days in the child support period on or after the day the parent gives notice.

             (3)  If the parent does not give notice of the event as required by section 160, the Registrar may amend the assessment to affect the annual rate of child support payable by or to the parent for the days in the child support period on or after the day the event occurred.

             (4)  This section does not:

                     (a)  affect the operation of section 160; or

                     (b)  prevent the Registrar from making a new assessment for part of the child support period.

Note:          This section does not limit the power under section 75 to amend assessments (see subsection 75(5)).

##### <a id="63B"></a>63B  Amendment of assessment based on election if Registrar asks for information supporting estimate

             (1)  This section allows the Registrar to amend an assessment of child support payable by or to a parent for some days in a child support period if:

                     (a)  the parent has made an election under section 60 relating to the period; and

                     (b)  the Registrar has given the parent a notice under section 161 requiring the parent to:

                            (iii)  produce documents containing information;

                            relevant to determining the accuracy of an estimate on which the election is based.

             (2)  If the parent complies with section 161 (in relation to the notice), the Registrar may amend the assessment to affect the annual rate of child support payable by or to the parent for the days in the child support period on or after the day the parent complies.

             (3)  If the parent does not comply with section 161 (in relation to the notice), the Registrar may amend the assessment to affect the annual rate of child support payable by or to the parent for the days in the child support period on or after:

                     (a)  the day the election was made; or

                     (b)  if:

                              (i)  before the Registrar gave the notice but after the election was made, the Registrar had given the parent another notice (the **_earlier notice_**) of the kind described in paragraph (1)(b); and

                             (ii)  the parent complied with section 161 in relation to the earlier notice;

##### <a id="63C"></a>63C  Amendment of assessment in minimum rate cases

             (1)  This section allows the Registrar to amend an assessment of child support payable by a parent for all the children in a child support case for some days in a child support period if:

                     (b)  the period has ended; and

                     (c)  the annual rate of child support payable  by the parent for all the children in the child support case for the days in the period was the minimum annual rate for the period or lower.

             (2)  The Registrar may amend the assessment to affect the annual rate of child support payable by the parent for the days in the child support period.

             (3)  This section does not prevent the Registrar from making a new assessment for part of the child support period.

Note:          This section does not limit the power under section 75 to amend assessments (see subsection 75(5)).

##### <a id="64"></a>64  Reconciliation of estimated and actual adjusted taxable income after end of child support period

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  an election made by a parent under section 60 in relation to a child support period has not been revoked at the end of the period; and

                     (b)  the parent’s real remaining period adjusted taxable income is more than the amount the parent estimated at step 2 of the method statement in subsection 60(5) for the purposes of making the election; and

                     (c)  the annual rate of child support payable  by the parent for all the children in a child support case for a day in the child support period is greater than the minimum annual rate for the period.

             (2)  For the purposes of assessing the parent in respect of the costs of a child of the parent for days on or after the election was made but before the end of the child support period, the parent’s adjusted taxable income is taken to be (and always to have been):

                     (a)  if the remaining period was 12 months—the parent’s real remaining period adjusted taxable income; and

                     (b)  otherwise, the amount worked out by:

                              (i)  dividing the parent’s remaining period adjusted taxable income by the number of days in the remaining period; and

                             (ii)  multiplying the quotient by 365.

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not apply in relation to any day in the child support period in relation to which an income amount order made before the making of the election applies in relation to the parent.

             (4)  Where an income amount order made after the making of the election applies in relation to the parent and any part of the child support period, subsection (2) has effect subject to the order.

             (5)  The Registrar is to take such action as is necessary to give effect to this section in relation to the parent (whether by amending any administrative assessment that has been made in relation to the child support period or otherwise).

             (6)  In this section:

                    <a name="real-remain-period-adjusted-taxabl-incom"></a>**_real remaining period adjusted taxable income_** of a parent who made an election under section 60 is the amount that would have been the parent’s adjusted taxable income for the remaining period had the remaining period been a year of income.

##### <a id="64A"></a>64A  Penalty for underestimating adjusted taxable income

             (1)  A parent is liable to pay the Registrar a penalty of the amount worked out under subsection (2) if:

                     (a)  the parent made an election under section 60 relating to a child support period; and

                     (b)  the total of the parent’s real remaining period adjusted taxable income is at least 110% of the amount the parent estimated at step 2 of the method statement in subsection 60(5) for the purposes of making the election.

             (2)  The amount of the penalty is 10% of the difference between:

                     (a)  the administrative assessment of child support that would have been made if it were based entirely on the amount of adjusted taxable income in the election; and

                     (b)  the administrative assessment of child support made under section 64.

             (3)  The penalty is due and payable upon the issue of the administrative assessment under section 64 and is a debt due to the Commonwealth.

             (4)  The Registrar may remit the whole or a part of the penalty if:

                     (a)  paragraph (1)(b) applies because of an amendment of an Income Tax Assessment Act, or because of a ruling or determination under an Income Tax Assessment Act; or

                     (b)  paragraph (1)(b) applies for some other reason, and the Registrar is satisfied that it would be fair and reasonable in the circumstances to remit the whole or that part of the penalty.

             (5)  If the Registrar makes a decision to remit only part of a penalty payable under this section, or not to remit any part of the penalty, the Registrar must serve written notice of the decision on the parent by whom the penalty is, or but for the remission would be, payable.

             (6)  The notice must include, or be accompanied by, a statement to the effect:

                     (a)  that the parent may, subject to the Registration and Collection Act, object to the decision (the **_original decision_**); and

                     (b)  that if the parent is aggrieved by a later decision on an objection to the original decision, he or she may, subject to that Act, apply to the SSAT for review of the later decision.

             (7)  A contravention of subsection (6) in relation to a decision does not affect the validity of the decision.

             (8)  In this section:

                    <a name="real-remain-period-adjusted-taxabl-incom"></a>**_real remaining period adjusted taxable income_** of a parent who made an election under section 60 has the meaning given by subsection 64(6).

#### Subdivision B—Annual rates of child support for low income parents and minimum annual rates of child support

##### <a id="65A"></a>65A  Annual rate of child support for low income parents not on income support

Assessment of annual rate

             (1)  The Registrar must assess an annual rate of child support payable by a parent for a child for a day in a child support period as the rate specified in subsection (2) if:

                     (a)  the parent did not receive an income support payment during the last relevant year of income; and

                     (b)  the following amount is less than the pension PP (single) maximum basic amount:

                              (i)  the parent’s adjusted taxable income for the last relevant year of income;

                             (ii)  if an election by the parent under section 60 is in force for the day—the amount worked out for the parent under step 2 of the method statement in subsection 60(5) using the parent’s estimate; and

                     (c)  the parent does not have at least shared care of the child during the relevant care period.

How much is the annual rate

             (2)  The annual rate of child support payable is $1060.

Note:          The annual rate of child support specified in subsection (2) is indexed under section 153A.

             (3)  The Registrar must not assess the total annual rate of child support payable by a parent under subsection (1) (including any child support that is not actually payable because of subsection 40B(1)) for a day in a child support period as more than 3 times the rate specified in subsection (2).

             (4)  If an annual rate of child support is payable by a parent under subsection (1) (including any child support that is not actually payable because of subsection 40B(1)) for more than 3 children for a day in a child support period, then the annual rate of child support payable by the parent for each child for a day in the child support period is:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00151/Html/89f5afe0-4b58-4895-a496-d15deaf6ec1e_files/image018.gif)

Paying the annual rate to more than one person

             (5)  If, (disregarding section 40B) the rate under subsection (2) or (4) would be payable for a child to:

                     (a)  a parent and a non‑parent carer of the child; or

                     (b)  2 non‑parent carers of the child;

then, subject to section 40B, the annual rate of child support for the child worked out under this section is payable in accordance with section 40A.

Note:          Under section 40B, a non‑parent carer of a child is not entitled to be paid child support unless he or she applies under section 25A in relation to the child.

##### <a id="65B"></a>65B  Application for section 65A not to apply

             (1)  If the Registrar makes an assessment of an annual rate of child support payable by a parent for a day in a child support period under section 65A:

                     (a)  the parent may apply to the Registrar for the section not to apply; or

                     (b)  the parent is taken to have applied to the Registrar for the section not to apply if, immediately before the end of the previous child support period, the section did not apply because of a determination under this section.

             (2)  The parent making the application must provide evidence to the Registrar concerning the parent’s income (within the meaning of subsection 66A(4)) to demonstrate that his or her current income is:

                     (a)  less than the pension PP (single) maximum basic amount; and

                     (b)  that it would be unjust and inequitable to expect him or her to pay the amount assessed under this section.

             (3)  An assessment issued by the Commissioner of Taxation for the last relevant year of income shall not be sufficient evidence of the income of the parent for the purposes of this section. 

             (4)  If the parent makes an application, the Registrar may determine in writing that the section not apply to the parent if the parent’s current income (within the meaning of subsection 66A(4)) is less than the pension PP (single) maximum basic amount and it would be unjust and inequitable to expect him or her to pay the amount assessed under this section.

Note:          If the Registrar refuses to grant an application under this section, the Registrar must serve a notice on the applicant under section 66C.

             (3)  The Registrar must specify the day in the child support period on which the section ceases to apply to the parent. The day may be any day from the first day of the child support period on which an annual rate of child support under section 65A became payable by the parent.

##### <a id="66"></a>66  Minimum annual rate of child support

Assessment of annual rate

             (1)  The Registrar must assess the total of the annual rates of child support payable by a parent for all the children in a child support case for a day in a child support period as the minimum annual rate of child support for the child support period if:

                     (a)  the parent does not have at least regular care of at least one of the children in the child support case for the day; and

                     (b)  either of the following applies:

                              (i)  the parent receives an income support payment at the maximum basic rate during the child support period;

                             (ii)  if subparagraph (i) does not apply—the total payable by the parent for all the children in the child support case would (apart from this section) be assessed as less than the minimum annual rate of child support for the child support period.

Note:          The Registrar must not make an assessment under this subsection in certain cases (see subsections (2) and (8)).

             (2)  To avoid doubt, the Registrar must not make an assessment in respect of a parent whose annual rate of child support could be assessed under section 65A (low income parents not on income support) unless the Registrar has determined under section 65B that section 65A does not apply.

When assessment applies

             (3)  An assessment in respect of a parent covered by subparagraph (1)(b)(i) applies to each day in the period:

                     (a)  beginning on the first day in the child support period on which the parent receives the income support payment at the maximum basic rate; and

                     (b)  ending:

                              (i)  if the parent continues to receive the income support payment at the maximum basic rate until the end of the child support period—at the end of the child support period; or

                             (ii)  if the parent ceases to receive the income support payment at the maximum basic rate before the end of the child support period—28 days after the day on which the parent ceases to receive the payment at that rate (even if that day is after the end of the child support period).

             (4)  An assessment in respect of a parent covered by subparagraph (1)(b)(ii) applies to each day in the period:

                     (a)  beginning on the first day in the child support period on which the total payable by the parent in respect of the child support case would (apart from this section) be assessed as less than the minimum annual rate of child support for the child support period; and

                     (b)  ending:

                              (i)  if the parent would be so assessed until the end of the child support period—at the end of the child support period; or

                             (ii)  otherwise—28 days after the day on which the person would cease to be so assessed (even if that day is after the end of the child support period).

How much is the minimum annual rate

             (5)  The **_minimum annual rate_** **_of child support_** is $320.

Note:          The minimum annual rate of child support specified in subsection (5) is indexed under section 153A.

             (6)  If:

                     (a)  the Registrar makes an assessment in respect of a parent under subsection (1); and

                     (b)  the parent is assessed (whether under subsection (1) or otherwise) for a day in a child support period in respect of the costs of children in more than 3 child support cases;

then the **_annual rate of child support_** payable by the parent for a day in the child support period for a particular child support case is:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00151/Html/89f5afe0-4b58-4895-a496-d15deaf6ec1e_files/image019.gif)

Paying the minimum annual rate to more than one person for a single child support case

             (7)  If the rate worked out under subsection (5) or (6) is payable by a parent for a child support case to:

                     (a)  the parent of the children to whom the case relates and to one or more non‑parent carers of those children; or

                     (b)  2 or more non‑parent carers of those children;

then:

                     (c)  if 2 or more persons have equal percentages of care of the children, and those percentages are the highest percentages—each of those persons is entitled to be paid an equal proportion of the annual rate of child support that is payable by the parent; and

                     (d)  otherwise—only the person who has the highest percentage of care of the children is entitled to be paid the annual rate of child support that is payable by the parent.

Registrar not to make minimum rate assessment in certain cases

             (8)  The Registrar must not make an assessment under subsection (1) in relation to the child support payable by a parent:

                     (a)  in accordance with a determination made under Part 6A (departure determinations); or

                     (b)  in accordance with an order made under Division 4 of Part 7 (departure orders); or

                     (c)  in accordance with provisions of a child support agreement that have effect, for the purposes of this Part, as if they were such an order made by consent.

Definition of **income support payment**

             (9)  In this Act:

                    <a name="incom-support-payment"></a>**_income support payment_**:

                     (a)  has the meaning given by subsection 23(1) of the _Social Security Act 1991_; and

                     (b)  includes a payment under the ABSTUDY scheme that includes an amount identified as living allowance, being an allowance that is paid at the maximum basic rate.

##### <a id="66A"></a>66A  Registrar may reduce an assessment to nil in certain cases

             (1)  If the Registrar has made an assessment under section 66 in respect of the annual rate of child support payable by a parent for all the children in a child support case, the Registrar may, on application made by the parent in accordance with the regulations, reduce the annual rate of child support payable by the parent for those children for a day in the child support period to nil.

Note:          If the Registrar refuses to grant an application under this section, the Registrar must serve a notice on the applicant under section 66C.

             (2)  The Registrar must not grant an application under subsection (1) unless the Registrar is satisfied that the parent’s income (as defined in subsection (4)) for the 12 month period starting on the day on which the parent applies is less than the total of the number of the parent’s child support cases multiplied by the minimum annual rate of child support for the child support period.

             (3)  An assessment in respect of a parent under this section applies to each day in the period to which the assessment under section 66 would have applied (see subsections 66(3) and (4)).

             (4)  In this section:

                    <a name="incom"></a>**_income_**, in relation to a person, means:

                     (a)  any money earned, derived or received by the parent for his or her own use or benefit, other than money earned, derived or received in a manner, or from a source, prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph; or

                     (b)  a periodical payment by way of a gift or allowance, other than a payment of a kind prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph.

##### <a id="66C"></a>66C  Notice to be given to unsuccessful applicant

             (1)  If the Registrar refuses to grant an application under section 65B or 66A, the Registrar must serve written notice of the decision on the parent.

             (2)  The notice must include, or be accompanied by, a statement to the effect:

                     (a)  that the parent may, subject to the Registration and Collection Act, object to the particulars of the assessment in relation to which the unsuccessful application was made; and

                     (b)  that if the parent is aggrieved by the decision on the objection, he or she may, subject to that Act, apply to the SSAT for review of the decision.

             (3)  A contravention of subsection (2) in relation to a decision does not affect the validity of the decision.

#### Subdivision C—Making administrative assessments

##### <a id="66D"></a>66D  How assessment is to be made

                   In making an administrative assessment, the Registrar may act on the basis of the documents and information in his or her possession, and is not required to conduct any inquiries or investigations into the matter or to require (whether under this Act  or otherwise) the giving of any information or the production of any document.

##### <a id="67"></a>67  Assessment to relate to all children for whom child support is payable by parent

             (1)  If child support is payable by a parent to a person for 2 or more children for a day in a child support period, any administrative assessment of the child support payable by the parent in relation to the day is to relate to all of the children and not to any of the children separately.

             (2)  Subsection (1) applies whether or not the child support is payable because of:

                     (a)  the acceptance by the Registrar of 2 or more separate applications for administrative assessment made otherwise than in the same form; or

                     (b)  the acceptance by the Registrar of 2 or more child support agreements made otherwise than in the same document; or

                     (c)  the acceptance by the Registrar of an application for administrative assessment and of an application for acceptance of a child support agreement.

             (3)  Subsection (1) does not require a single administrative assessment to be made of the child support payable by a parent to 2 or more other persons.

##### <a id="67A"></a>67A  Offsetting of child support liabilities

                   The annual rate of child support that would, apart from this section, be payable for a child or children in a child support case, for a day in a child support period, by one parent to the other parent is to be reduced (but not below nil) by the annual rate of child support that would, apart from this section, be payable to that parent in relation to that day by the other parent for the child or the children in the child support case.

##### <a id="68"></a>68  Assessment to relate to whole or part of single child support period

             (1)  An administrative assessment of child support is to relate to all the days, or some of the days, of a single child support period.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not prevent a single notice of assessment under section 76 dealing with more than one administrative assessment.

##### <a id="69"></a>69  Conversion of annual rates into daily rates of payment

                   If the Registrar assesses the annual rate of child support payable by a parent for a child or children in a child support case, for a day in a child support period, the Registrar must, in accordance with the regulations, convert that annual rate into a daily rate and specify both the annual and daily rates in the notice of assessment given under section 76 in relation to the assessment.

##### <a id="70"></a>70  Evidence relating to assessments

             (1)  The production of a notice of administrative assessment, or of a document signed by the Registrar that appears to be a copy of a notice of administrative assessment, is prima facie evidence of:

                     (a)  the proper making of the assessment; and

                     (b)  except in proceedings under Part VIIA, or under Subdivision B of Division 3 of Part VIII, of the Registration and Collection Act on an appeal relating to the assessment, that all the particulars of the notice of assessment are correct.

             (2)  The production of a document signed by the Registrar that appears to be a copy of, or an extract from, any return or notice of administrative assessment is evidence of the matters in the document to the same extent as the original would be if it were produced.

##### <a id="71"></a>71  Assessment for part of a child support period

                   In making an administrative assessment of the annual rate of child support payable for days in a period (the **_part period_**) that is not a whole child support period, the Registrar may apply this Act as if the beginning and end of the part period were the beginning and end respectively of a child support period.

##### <a id="72"></a>72  Validity of assessments

                   Except in an appeal under Part VIIA, or under Subdivision B of Division 3 of Part VIII, of the Registration and Collection Act, the validity of an assessment is not affected because any of the provisions of this Act have not been complied with.

##### <a id="73"></a>73  Assumptions as to future events

                   In assessing the annual rate at which child support is payable for a day in the future, the Registrar may act on the assumption that the state of affairs known to the Registrar at the time the assessment is made will remain unchanged on that day.

##### <a id="73A"></a>73A  Registrar becoming aware of relevant dependent child

                   If:

                     (a)  an administrative assessment of child support is in force in relation to a parent; and

                     (b)  the Registrar is later notified, or otherwise becomes aware, of the fact that the parent has a relevant dependent child who was not taken into account for the purposes of making the assessment;

then, for the purposes of working out the parent’s relevant dependent child amount under section 46, the parent is taken to have the relevant dependent child:

                     (c)  if the Registrar was notified, or otherwise became aware, of the fact that the child is a relevant dependent child of the parent within 28 days after the day on which the child became such a child—on and from the day the child became such a child; or

                     (d)  if the Registrar was notified, or otherwise became aware, of the fact within 28 days after the notice of the assessment was given—on and from the day the notice was given; or

                     (e)  if neither paragraph (c) nor (d) applies—on and from the day the Registrar was notified, or otherwise became aware, of the fact that the child is a relevant dependent child of the parent.

##### <a id="74"></a>74   Registrar to give effect to happening of child support terminating events etc.

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  child support is payable for a child; and

                     (b)  the Registrar is notified of, or otherwise becomes aware of:

                              (i)  the happening of a child support terminating event in relation to the child, a liable parent, or a carer entitled to child support, or all 3; or

                             (ii)  the happening of an event or change of circumstances that affects the annual rate at which the child support is payable under this Act;

the Registrar must immediately take such action as is necessary to take account of the happening of the event or change of circumstances (whether by amending any administrative assessment or otherwise).

             (2)  Nothing in subsection (1) is to be taken to prevent the Registrar from taking such action as the Registrar considers appropriate to take account of the likely happening of an event or change of circumstances of which the Registrar is notified or otherwise becomes aware (whether by amending any administrative assessment or otherwise).

##### <a id="74A"></a>74A  Date of effect of change in care

                   If:

                     (a)  child support is payable for a child; and

                     (b)  the Registrar is notified, or otherwise becomes aware, that:

                              (i)  a person’s percentage of care for the child has changed by at least 7.1%; or

                             (ii)  a person’s percentage of care for the child has fallen below 14%; or

                            (iii)  a person’s percentage of care for the child has increased to 14%, or above 14%; and

                     (c)  as a result, the Registrar amends an administrative assessment under section 75 to alter the annual rate at which the child support is payable for the child;

the altered annual rate is to apply on and from the day the Registrar was notified, or otherwise became aware, of the change of percentage referred to in paragraph (b).

Note:          7.1% is one night per fortnight.

##### <a id="75"></a>75  Amendment of assessments

             (1)  The Registrar may, at any time, amend any administrative assessment by making such alterations and additions as the Registrar considers necessary to give effect to this Act.

             (2)  However, if the amendment relates to a person’s percentage of care for a child, the Registrar must not amend an administrative assessment unless:

                     (a)  the change to the person’s percentage of care is at least 7.1%; or

                     (b)  the person’s percentage of care falls below 14%; or

                     (c)  the person’s percentage of care increases to 14%, or above 14%.

Note:          7.1% is one night per fortnight.

             (3)  Subsection (1) has effect despite the fact that:

                      (f)  giving effect to a decision or order of a court having jurisdiction under this Act.

             (5)  Where a provision of this Act expressly authorises the Registrar to amend an administrative assessment, that provision does not by implication limit the power of the Registrar (whether under this section or otherwise) to amend the assessment.

             (6)  Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Act, every amended administrative assessment is to be taken to be an administrative assessment for all the purposes of this Act.

##### <a id="76"></a>76  Notice of assessment to be given

                              (i)  to object, subject to the Registration and Collection Act, to particulars of the assessment; and

                             (ii)  if aggrieved by the decision on an objection to particulars of the assessment (no matter who lodges the objection but subject to that Act), to apply to the SSAT for review of the decision;

                     (b)  a statement that specifically draws the attention of the liable parent and the carer entitled to child support to the right, if aggrieved by a decision of the SSAT in relation to the percentage of care of the liable parent or the carer entitled to child support, to apply to the AAT for review of the decision;

                     (c)  a statement that specifically draws the attention of the liable parent and the carer entitled to child support to the right to apply to the Registrar for a determination under Part 6A having the effect that the provisions of this Act relating to administrative assessment of child support will be departed from in relation to a child in the special circumstances of the case;

                     (d)  a statement that specifically draws the attention of the liable parent and the carer entitled to child support to the right, subject to the _Family Law Act 1975_, to apply to a court having jurisdiction under this Act for an order under section 124 that a parent provide child support for the child otherwise than in the form of periodic amounts.

                     (a)  assesses the annual rate of child support payable for a child or children in a child support case, for a day in a child support period, by a liable parent to a carer entitled to child support; and

                     (b)  converts the annual rate into a daily rate and specifies both rates in a notice of assessment given under section 76 in relation to the assessment.

             (2)  Child support is payable for the child or children  by the liable parent to the carer entitled to child support for each day in the child support period.

             (3)  The amount of child support payable for the child or children for the day by the liable parent to the carer entitled to child support is the amount of the daily rate specified in the notice of assessment.

##### <a id="78"></a>78  When amounts of child support due and payable

                   An amount of child support payable by a liable parent in relation to a day in any month is due and payable on the later of the following days:

##### <a id="79"></a>79  Recovery of amounts of child support

                   An amount of child support due and payable by a liable parent to a carer entitled to child support is a debt due and payable by the liable parent to the carer, and may be sued for and recovered in:

##### <a id="2"></a>2  Child support income ranges—fraction of MTAWE row

             (1)  In each column of the Fraction of MTAWE row are specified 2 amounts. These amounts refer to:

                     (a)  the parents’ combined child support income; or

                     (b)  if only one parent’s income is to be used—the parent’s child support income.

             (2)  To work out the first dollar amount in each column (other than the first column), take the second amount in the previous column (worked under subclause (3)) and add one dollar.

Note:          The first dollar amount in each column is the lowest combined child support income, or child support income, covered by that column.

             (3)  To work out the second dollar amount in each column (other than the last column), multiply the second fraction specified in that column by the annualised MTAWE figure for the relevant September quarter.

Note:          The second dollar amount in each column is the highest combined child support income, or child support income, covered by that column.

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Costs of the children

             (1)  Each item in the Costs of the Children Table sets out a method of working out the costs of the children.

             (2)  If, under section 55G, an item is identified in the first column of the table, the **_costs of the children_** is the amount that is the percentage specified in that item of the parents’ combined child support income, or the parent’s child support income, (as the case requires).

             (3)  If, under section 55G, an item (the **_relevant item_**) is identified in a row in the second, third, fourth or fifth column (the **_relevant column_**), the **_costs of the children_** is the total of the following amounts:

                     (a)  the total of the amounts worked out for each item in that row in each of the previous columns by multiplying the percentage specified in that item by the highest combined child support income, or child support income, covered by that column;

                     (b)  the amount worked out by multiplying the percentage specified in the relevant item by the difference between:

                              (i)  the parents’ combined child support income, or the parent’s child support income, (as the case requires); and

                             (ii)  the highest combined child support income or child support income in the previous column.

             (4)  If, under section 55G, an item is identified in a row in the last column, the **_costs of the children_** is the total of the amounts worked out for the items in that row in each of the previous columns in accordance with paragraph (3)(a).

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Target foreign income

                     (a)  the amount of the individual’s foreign income (as defined in section 10A of the _Social Security Act 1991_) for the income year that is neither:

                              (i)  taxable income; nor

                             (ii)  received in the form of a fringe benefit (as defined in the _Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986_, as it applies of its own force or because of the _Fringe Benefits Tax (Application to the Commonwealth) Act 1986_) in relation to the individual as an employee (as defined in the _Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986_) and a year of tax; and

                     (b)  any amount of income that is not covered by paragraph (a) that is exempt from tax under section 23AF or 23AG of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, reduced (but not below nil) by the total amount of losses and outgoings (except capital losses and outgoings) incurred by the individual in deriving that exempt income.

             (2)  If it is necessary, for the purposes of this Act, to work out an amount of foreign income expressed in a foreign currency received in an income year, the amount in Australian currency is to be worked out using the market exchange rate for 1 July in that income year.

             (3)  If there is no market exchange rate for 1 July in the income year (for example, because of a national public holiday), the market exchange rate to be used is the market exchange rate that applied on the last working day immediately before that 1 July.

             (4)  For the purposes of this clause, the appropriate market exchange rate on a particular day for a foreign currency is:

                     (a)  if there is an on‑demand airmail buying rate for the currency available at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia at the start of business in Sydney on that day and the Secretary determines that it is appropriate to use that rate—that rate; or

                     (b)  in any other case:

                              (i)  if there is another rate of exchange for the currency, or there are other rates of exchange for the currency, available at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia at the start of business in Sydney on that day and the Secretary determines that it is appropriate to use the other rate or one of the other rates—the rate so determined; or

                             (ii)  otherwise—a rate of exchange for the currency available from another source at the start of business in Sydney on that day that the Secretary determines it is appropriate to use.

Registrar must make assessment using new tax figures

                     (b)  the annual rate of child support payable for the child for the first day of the next named month is to be worked out without reference to the actual taxable income of the parent mentioned in paragraph (1)(b) because of:

                     (b)  if the reason referred to in paragraph (1)(b) was one of the reasons for the Registrar refusing to accept the application—the applicant is entitled to have the Registrar reconsider the application under Division 2 of Part 4 because the person from whom the application sought payment of child support is a parent of the child.

             (6)  If the court grants the declaration:

##### <a id="79A"></a>79A  Suspension determinations—pending declarations that parent not entitled to administrative assessment

Suspension determinations

             (1)  The Registrar must make a determination (a **_suspension determination_**) that a payee of a registered maintenance liability in relation to a child is not entitled under subsection 76(1) to be paid an amount that is payable for the child by a payer of the liability if:

                     (a)  the Registrar has notice that the payer has made an application under section 107 of the Assessment Act for a declaration that the payee was not entitled to administrative assessment of child support for the child because the payer is not the parent of the child; and

                     (b)  the application is pending.

Payee not entitled to be paid amounts until resumption determination made

             (2)  If the Registrar makes a suspension determination on a day, the payee is not entitled to be paid an amount from that payer for the child on that or any later day mentioned in subsection 76(1) unless and until the Registrar makes a determination under subsection (3) of this section in relation to the payee and an amount payable by that payer for the child.

Note 1:       If the court grants the declaration under section 107 of the Assessment Act, the application for administrative assessment of child support is taken to have never been accepted by the Registrar, and the payee was never entitled to be paid amounts under subsection 76(1) of this Act from that payer for that child.

Note 2:       The Registrar must vary the Child Support Register after making the suspension determination (see section 79C).

Resumption determinations

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  the Registrar has made a suspension determination under subsection (1) in relation to the payee of a registered maintenance liability; and

                     (b)  the Registrar is satisfied that the application referred to in paragraph (1)(a) has been:

                              (i)  finally refused by the court (within the meaning of section 144 of the Assessment Act); or

                             (ii)  dismissed or withdrawn; or

                            (iii)  struck out by the court;

the Registrar must make a determination (a **_resumption determination_**) that:

                     (c)  the payee is again entitled under subsection 76(1) to be paid an amount from that payer for the child; and

                     (d)  if the payee has not, because of the suspension determination, been paid an amount which the payee would otherwise have been paid under subsection 76(1)—the payee is entitled to be paid that amount.

Note:          The Registrar must vary the Child Support Register after making the resumption determination (see section 79C).

##### <a id="79B"></a>79B  Suspension determinations—pending SSAT and court reviews

Suspension determinations

             (1)  The Registrar may make a determination (a **_suspension determination_**) that a payee of a registered maintenance liability in relation to a child is not entitled under subsection 76(1) to be paid an amount that is payable for the child by the payer of the liability if:

                     (a)  any of the following proceedings has been brought by the payer under item 9 of the table in subsection 80(1) and the proceeding is pending:

                              (i)  a proceeding that the child was not a child in relation to whom the application for administrative assessment of child support was entitled to be made;

                             (ii)  a proceeding that the applicant was not a person entitled to make the application for the child;

                            (iii)  a proceeding that the person from whom the application sought payment was not a resident of Australia; or

                     (b)  a proceeding has been brought by the payer under Subdivision B of Division 3 of Part VIII (court review) in relation to the payee’s entitlement to administrative assessment of child support for the child and the proceeding is pending under that Subdivision.

Payee not entitled to be paid amounts until resumption determination made

             (2)  If the Registrar makes a suspension determination on a day, the payee is not entitled to be paid an amount from that payer for the child on that or any later day mentioned in subsection 76(1) unless and until the Registrar makes a determination under subsection (3) of this section in relation to the payee and an amount payable by that payer for the child.

Note:          The Registrar must vary the Child Support Register after making the suspension determination (see section 79C).

Resumption determinations

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  the Registrar has made a suspension determination under subsection (1) in relation to the payee of a registered maintenance liability; and

                     (b)  the Registrar is satisfied that the proceeding referred to in subsection (1) has been:

                              (i)  finally refused by the court (within the meaning of section 110W); or

                             (ii)  dismissed or withdrawn; or

                            (iii)  struck out by the court;

the Registrar must make a determination (a **_resumption determination_**) that:

                     (c)  the payee is again entitled under subsection 76(1) to be paid an amount from that payer for the child; and

                     (d)  if the payee has not, because of the suspension determination, been paid an amount which the payee would otherwise have been paid under subsection 76(1)—the payee is entitled to be paid that amount.

Note:          The Registrar must vary the Child Support Register after making the resumption determination (see section 79C).

##### <a id="79C"></a>79C  Varying particulars after suspension or resumption determination is made

             (1)  Immediately after making a suspension determination in relation to an amount payable under a registered maintenance liability, the Registrar must vary the particulars entered in the Child Support Register in relation to the liability in whatever way the Registrar considers necessary or desirable to give effect to the determination.

Note:          As soon as practicable after varying particulars under this subsection, the Registrar must serve a notice under section 42C.

             (2)  Immediately after making a resumption determination in relation to an amount payable under a registered maintenance liability, the Registrar must vary the particulars entered in the Child Support Register in relation to the liability in whatever way the Registrar considers necessary or desirable to give effect to the determination.

Note:          As soon as practicable after varying particulars under this subsection, the Registrar must serve a notice under section 42C.

Objections to particulars in the Child Support Register

             (2)  An objection to a decision of the Registrar as to particulars entered in the Child Support Register in relation to a registrable maintenance liability may be lodged:

                     (a)  on the ground that the relevant entry does not relate to a registrable maintenance liability; or

                     (b)  on any other ground.

             (3)  An objection to a decision of the Registrar as to particulars varied in the Child Support Register in relation to a registrable maintenance liability may only be made against:

                     (a)  the particulars varied; and

                     (b)  any other particulars affected by the variation.

Objections to administrative assessments—parentage

             (4)  An objection to a decision of the Registrar to accept an application for administrative assessment under subsection 30(1) of the Assessment Act may not be lodged on the ground that the person is not the parent of the child concerned.

Note:          In that case, the person may be able to apply to a court under section 107 of the Assessment Act for a declaration that the applicant for the administrative assessment in question was not entitled to it.

             (5)  An objection may not be lodged to a decision of the Registrar to refuse to accept a carer application for administrative assessment if one of the reasons for the Registrar so refusing was that the Registrar was not satisfied under section 29 that the person from whom the application sought payment of child support is a parent of the child concerned.

Note:          In that case, the applicant may be able to apply to a court under section 106A of the Assessment Act for a declaration that the applicant is entitled to administrative assessment of child support for the child.

##### <a id="111"></a>111  Application for amendment of administrative assessment that is more than 18 months old

Parent or carer applications

             (1)  A liable parent, or a carer entitled to child support, (the **_applicant_**) may apply to a court having jurisdiction under this Act for leave for:

                     (a)  the Registrar to make a determination under section 98S; or

                     (b)  the court to make an order under section 118;

in respect of a day in a child support period, being a day that is more than 18 months, and less than 7 years, earlier than the day on which the application under this section is made.

             (2)  Subject to section 145 (Registrar may intervene in proceedings), the parties to the proceeding under subsection (1) are:

                     (a)  the applicant; and

                     (b)  either:

             (3)  The Registrar (the **_applicant_**) may apply to a court having jurisdiction under this Act for leave for the Registrar to make a determination under section 98S in respect of a day in a child support period, being a day that is more than 18 months, and less than 7 years, earlier than the day on which the application under this section is made.

             (4)  The parties to the proceeding under subsection (3) are:

##### <a id="112"></a>112  Court may grant leave to amend administrative assessment that is more than 18 months old

             (1)  If an application is made to a court under section 111, the court may grant leave for:

                     (a)  the Registrar to make a determination under section 98S; or

                     (b)  the court to make an order under section 118.

             (2)  The court may grant leave for an order to be made under section 118 if the court is satisfied that it would be in the interest of the parties to the proceeding for the court to consider, at the same time as it hears the application under section 111, whether an order should be made under section 118\. If the court does so, the applicant is taken to have made an application to the court under section 116 for such an order.

             (3)  Otherwise, the court may grant leave for the Registrar to make a determination under section 98S.

Matters to be considered

             (4)  In considering whether to grant leave under subsection (1), the court must have regard to:

                     (a)  any responsibility, and reason, for the delay in:

                              (i)  making an application under section 98B or 116; or

                             (ii)  making a determination under section 98S;

                            as the case requires; and

                     (b)  the hardship to the applicant (other than the Registrar) if leave is not granted; and

                     (c)  the hardship to the other party or parties (other than the Registrar) if leave is granted.

             (5)  The court may have regard to any other relevant matter.

Orders granting leave to specify period

             (6)  An order granting leave under this section must specify the period in respect of which the Registrar may make a determination or the court may make an order.

             (7)  The period specified under subsection (6):

                     (a)  must not include a day in a child support period if the day is more than 7 years earlier than the day on which the application under section 111 was made; and

                     (b)  is not limited by the terms of that application.

No requirement to make determination or order

             (8)  The granting of leave under subsection (1) does not imply that:

                     (a)  the Registrar is required to make a determination under section 98S; or

                     (b)  the court is required to make an order under section 118.

##### <a id="113"></a>113  Implementation of decisions

                   When a decision of a court under this Division is made, the Registrar must immediately take such action (if any) as is necessary to give effect to the decision.

##### <a id="113A"></a>113A  Pending application not to affect assessment

                   Subject to section 140 (stay orders), the fact that a proceeding is pending under this Division in relation to a person does not, in the meantime, interfere with, or affect, any administrative assessment made in relation to the person, and any such assessment may be registered under the Registration and Collection Act, and amounts of child support and other amounts recovered in relation to the assessment, as if no proceeding were pending.

### Division 1—Preliminary

##### <a id="80A"></a>80A  Simplified outline

                   The following is a simplified outline of this Part:

* * *

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      Parents (and non‑parent

carers) of a child can, using a child support agreement, agree between

themselves the child support that is to be payable for the child.</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      There are 2 sorts of

agreements. The first is a binding child support agreement. Each party to the

agreement must have received legal advice before entering the agreement, and

must also receive legal advice before terminating the agreement.</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      The second sort of

agreement is a limited child support agreement. An administrative assessment

must be in place before a limited child support agreement can be accepted by

the Registrar. The annual rate of child support payable under the agreement

must be at least the annual rate of child support otherwise payable under this

Act.</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      Agreements may include

provisions that state that child support is to be payable otherwise than in the

form of periodic amounts. There are 2 main kinds of such provisions:</li>

               (a)     non‑periodic payment provisions, under which lump sum payments and other non‑periodic payments (such as school fees) may be made; and

              (b)     lump sum payment provisions, under which lump sum payments may be made.

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      Payments made under non‑periodic

payment provisions reduce the annual rate of child support payable.</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      Payments made under lump

sum payment provisions are credited against the liability of a party to the

agreement (rather than reducing the annual rate of child support payable).</li>

* * *

##### <a id="80B"></a>80B  Cases in relation to which Part applies

                   This Part applies where the parents of an eligible child, or a parent or the parents of an eligible child and a non‑parent carer of the child, want to give effect to an agreement between themselves in relation to child support payable for the child.

### Division 1A—Binding and limited child support agreements

                     (b)  the agreement is signed by the parties to the agreement; and

                     (c)  the agreement contains, in relation to each party to the agreement, a statement to the effect that the party to whom the statement relates has been provided, before the agreement was signed by him or her, as certified in an annexure to the agreement, with independent legal advice from a legal practitioner as to the following matters:

                              (i)  the effect of the agreement on the rights of that party;

                             (ii)  the advantages and disadvantages, at the time that the advice was provided, to the party of making the agreement; and

                     (d)  the annexure to the agreement contains a certificate signed by the person providing the independent legal advice stating that the advice was provided; and

                              (i)  the effect of the agreement on the rights of that party;

                             (ii)  the advantages and disadvantages, at the time that the advice was provided, to the party of making the agreement; and

                     (e)  the agreement has not been set aside by a court under section 136; and

                      (f)  after the agreement is signed, either the original agreement or a copy of the agreement is given to each party.

                            to such an extent that it would be unjust not to set aside the agreement; or

                     (c)  that because of a significant change in the circumstances of one of the parties to the agreement, or a child in respect of whom the agreement is made, it would be unjust not to set aside the agreement; or

                     (d)  in the case of a child support agreement—that the agreement provides for an annual rate of child support that is not proper or adequate, taking into account all the circumstances of the case (including the financial circumstances of the parties to the agreement).

             (3)  Subject to section 145 (Registrar may intervene in proceedings), the parties to a proceeding under subsection (1) are the parties to the agreement.

##### <a id="84"></a>84  Provisions that may be included in agreements

Provisions that may be included

             (1)  An agreement is a child support agreement only if it includes one or more of the following kinds of provisions:

                     (a)  provisions under which a party is to pay child support for a child to another party in the form of periodic amounts paid to the other party;

                     (b)  provisions under which the rate at which a party is already liable to pay child support for a child to another party in the form of periodic amounts paid to the other party is varied;

                     (c)  provisions agreeing between parties any other matter that may be included in an order made by a court under Division 4 of Part 7 (departure orders);

                     (d)  provisions (the **_non‑periodic payment provisions_**) that state:

                              (i)  that a party (the **_liable party_**) is to provide child support for a child to another party otherwise than in the form of periodic amounts; and

                             (ii)  that the annual rate of child support payable for the child by the liable party under any relevant administrative assessment is to be reduced, in the manner specified under subsection (6), by the amount of child support to be provided by the liable party;

                     (e)  provisions (the **_lump sum payment provisions_**) that meet the requirements of subsection (7) and that state:

                              (i)  that a party (the **_liable party_**) is to provide child support for a child to another party in the form of a lump sum payment (including by way of transfer or settlement of property); and

                             (ii)  that the lump sum payment is to be credited against the liable party’s liability under the relevant administrative assessment in relation to amounts payable under the liability;

                      (f)  provisions under which a party is to provide child support for a child to another party otherwise than in the form of periodic amounts and that are not non‑periodic payment provisions or lump sum payment provisions;

                     (g)  provisions under which the liability of a party to pay or provide child support for a child to another party is to end from a specified day.

             (2)  The agreement may include more than one kind of provision in relation to different parts of a child support period and different child support periods.

Other kinds of provisions not to have effect

             (3)  If the agreement also includes provisions of a kind not referred to in subsection (1), those provisions do not have effect for the purposes of this Act.

             (4)  Subsection (3) does not affect the operation of provisions of the kind referred to in that subsection for any other purpose.

Agreement may also be parenting plan, maintenance agreement or financial agreement

             (5)  Without limiting subsection (4), nothing in this Part is to be taken to prevent the same document being both a child support agreement and:

                     (a)  a parenting plan; or

                     (b)  a maintenance agreement or financial agreement under the _Family Law Act 1975_.

Additional requirements of agreements with non‑periodic payment provisions

             (6)  If an agreement includes provisions of the kind referred to in paragraph (1)(d), the statement referred to in subparagraph (1)(d)(ii) must specify either:

                     (a)  that the annual rate of child support payable under the administrative assessment is to be reduced by a specified amount that represents an annual value of the child support payable; or

                     (b)  that the annual rate of child support payable under the administrative assessment is to be reduced by 100% or another specified percentage that is less than 100%.

Note:          Non‑periodic payment provisions are taken to have effect as if they were a statement made by a court under section 125 in an order made under section 124 (see subsection 95(3)).

Additional requirements etc. of agreements with lump sum payment provisions

             (7)  If an agreement includes provisions of the kind referred to in paragraph (1)(e), the provisions meet the requirements of this subsection if:

                     (a)  the agreement is a binding child support agreement; and

                     (b)  an administrative assessment, in relation to the child in respect of whom the agreement is made, is in force immediately before the application for acceptance of the agreement is made; and

                     (c)  the amount of the lump sum payment:

                              (i)  is specified in the agreement; and

                             (ii)  equals or exceeds the annual rate of child support payable for the child under the administrative assessment.

Note:          If an agreement includes provisions of the kind referred to in paragraph (1)(e) (lump sum payment provisions), the lump sum payment is credited under section 69A of the Registration and Collection Act against the liable party’s liability (rather than reducing the annual rate of child support payable under the administrative assessment).

             (8)  An agreement that includes lump sum payment provisions may also state that the lump sum payment is to be credited against the liability under the administrative assessment in relation to 100%, or another specified percentage that is less than 100%, of the child support payable under the liability.

Note:          If an agreement does not specify a percentage, the lump sum payment is credited against the liability in relation to 100% of the amounts payable under the liability (see section 69A of the Registration and Collection Act).

## 39  Subsections 95(3) and (4)

Repeal the subsections, substitute:

             (3)  If the agreement includes non‑periodic payment provisions:

                     (a)  the provisions have effect, for the purposes of this Act, as if they were a statement made by a court under section 125 in an order made under section 124; and

                     (b)  if the provisions or the agreement is registered in a court having jurisdiction under Part VII of the _Family Law Act 1975_—Division 13A of Part VII, and Parts XIII and XIIIB, of that Act apply in relation to the provisions as if the provisions were an order made by the court under Part VII of that Act.

Note 1:       The effect of paragraph (3)(a) is that the Registrar must make any subsequent administrative assessment on the basis of the annual rate of child support as reduced by the amount or percentage specified in the child support agreement (see section 127).

Note 2:       This section does not deal with lump sum payment provisions (see paragraph 84(1)(e) of this Act and section 69A of the Registration and Collection Act).

## 40  At the end of section 96

Add:

             (4)  If a child support agreement includes lump sum payment provisions, the notice must specify:

                     (a)  the amount of the lump sum payment specified in the agreement; and

## 41  Subsection 123(1)

Repeal the subsection, substitute:

             (1)  An application may be made to a court having jurisdiction under this Act for:

                     (a)  an order that a liable parent provide child support otherwise than in the form of periodic amounts paid to the carer entitled to child support; or

                     (b)  an order that a liable parent provide child support in the form of a lump sum payment to be credited against the liability under the relevant administrative assessment in relation to amounts payable under the liability.

                     (b)  the court is satisfied that it would be:

                     (c)  the amount of the lump sum payment equals or exceeds the annual rate of child support payable for the child under the administrative assessment.

Note:          If the court makes such an order, the lump sum payment is credited under section 69A of the Registration and Collection Act against the liable parent’s liability (rather than reducing the annual rate of child support payable under the administrative assessment).

             (2)  A lump sum payment may include a payment by way of transfer or settlement of property.

             (3)  An order under subsection (1):

                     (e)  if the carer entitled to child support is not in receipt of such a pension, allowance or benefit—whether the circumstances of the carer are such that, taking into account the effect of the order proposed to be made by the court, the carer would be unable to support himself or herself without an income tested pension, allowance or benefit.

             (5)  In determining whether it would be just and equitable as regards the child, the carer entitled to child support and the liable parent to make an order under subsection (1), the court must have regard to the matters mentioned in subsections 117(4), (6), (7), (7A) and (8).

             (6)  In having regard to the earning capacity of a parent of the child under paragraph 117(4)(da), the court may determine that the parent’s earning capacity is greater than is reflected in his or her income for the purposes of this Act only if the court is satisfied as mentioned in subsection 117(7B).

             (7)  In determining whether it would be otherwise proper to make an order under subsection (1), the court must have regard to the matters mentioned in subsection 117(5).

             (2)  The court may state that the annual rate of child support payable by the liable parent is not to be so reduced only if it is satisfied that, in the special circumstances of the case, it would be:

                     (a)  just and equitable as regards the child, the carer entitled to child support and the liable parent; and

                     (b)  otherwise proper;

that the annual rate of child support not be reduced by the child support ordered to be provided.

             (3)  If the court states in the order that the annual rate of child support is to be reduced by the child support ordered to be provided, the court must also state in the order either:

                     (a)  that the annual rate of child support payable is to be reduced by a specified amount that represents an annual value of the child support to be provided; or

             (2)  The Registrar must, in accordance with subsection (3):

             (7)  Subject to subsection (8), if at any time (whether before or after the commencement of this subsection), the Australian Statistician publishes an index number for a quarter in substitution for an index number previously published by the Australian Statistician for that quarter, the publication of the later index number is to be disregarded for the purposes of subsection (5).

             (8)  If at any time the Australian Statistician changes the reference base for the Consumer Price Index, regard is to be had, for the purposes of applying subsection (5) after the change takes place, only to index numbers published in terms of the new reference base.

Note:          This subclause only applies in respect of enforceable maintenance liabilities (see subclause (7)).

Arrears

             (4)  If the amount received in an income year by the individual under the agreement or order for the child for the period exceeds the amount that is payable to the individual under the agreement or order for the child for the period, then, for the purposes of this Act, the amount of child maintenance that the individual is taken to have received under the agreement or order for the child for the period is:

Note:          This subclause only applies in respect of enforceable maintenance liabilities (see subclause (7)).

             (5)  The **_notional arrears amount_**, in respect of a debt arising for a previous period under the agreement or order, is:

             (6)  For the purposes of subclause (5), if:

                     (a)  an individual has more than one debt that arose under an agreement or order for previous periods; and

                     (b)  the amount received in an income year by the individual under the agreement or order for a child for a period exceeds the amount that is payable to the individual under the agreement or order for the child for the period;

then:

                     (c)  the individual is taken to have received the excess to pay off each debt in the order in which the debts arose; and

                     (d)  each debt is reduced by the amount of the debt that is paid off.

             (7)  Subclauses (3) and (4) only apply in respect of enforceable maintenance liabilities (within the meaning of the _Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988_).

##### <a id="20C"></a>20C  Working out amounts of child maintenance in relation to lump sum payments

             (1)  This clause applies if an individual receives in an income year child maintenance for an FTB child of the individual under:

                     (a)  a child support agreement, containing lump sum payment provisions (within the meaning of paragraph 84(1)(e) of the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989_), to which clause 20B does not apply; or

                     (b)  a court order made under section 123A of that Act;

in the form of a lump sum payment that is to be credited under section 69A of the _Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988_ against a liability under an administrative assessment.

### Division 2—Notional assessments

##### <a id="146B"></a>146B  Provisional notional assessments

             (1)  The Registrar must make a provisional notional assessment in accordance with this section if:

                     (a)  the Registrar makes an assessment under section 34B or section 93; or

                     (b)  a court makes a statement under section 125, in an order under section 124, that an annual rate of child support payable is to be reduced.

             (2)  The Registrar must make a provisional notional assessment of the annual rate of child support that would be payable for a child for a particular day in a child support period, by the liable parent to the carer entitled to child support, if that annual rate were payable under Part 5 (taking into account any relevant determination under Part 6A, or any relevant order under Division 4 of Part 7) for the child for that day instead of under the agreement or order.

             (3)  The Registrar must serve notice in writing of the provisional notional assessment on the liable parent and the carer entitled to child support.

             (4)  The notice must specify in respect of the provisional notional assessment the matters that are required under section 69 and subsection 76(2) in respect of an administrative assessment.

             (5)  The notice must include, or be accompanied by, a statement to the effect that:

                     (a)  the liable parent or the carer entitled to child support can seek a variation of the provisional notional assessment in accordance with section 146C within 14 days of receiving the notice; and

                     (b)  once the provisional notional assessment becomes a notional assessment under section 146E, the liable parent or the carer entitled to child support may, subject to the Registration and Collection Act, object to the particulars of the notional assessment; and

                     (c)  if aggrieved by a later decision on an objection to those particulars, the liable parent or the carer entitled to child support may, subject to that Act, apply to the SSAT for review of the later decision.

##### <a id="146C"></a>146C  Variation of provisional notional assessments

             (1)  A liable parent or carer entitled to child support (the **_applicant_**) may seek a variation of a provisional notional assessment within 14 days of receiving a notice under section 146B in respect of the provisional notional assessment by doing one or more of the following:

                     (a)  by notifying the Registrar of a change to the percentage of care that the liable parent or the carer entitled to child support has for the child for the particular day in the child support period in respect of which the provisional notional assessment is made;

                     (b)  by making an application under section 146D for a determination under Part 6A (departure determinations);

                     (c)  if the applicant is a parent of the relevant child—by making an election under subsection 146G(1) (estimate of adjusted taxable income).

Note:          A person who does not receive a notice that is served on the person is taken to have received the notice 14 days after the notice was served (see subsection 146E(2)).

             (2)  The Registrar may vary the provisional notional assessment of the annual rate of child support that would be payable for the child for the particular day if:

                     (a)  an applicant seeks a variation in accordance with subsection (1); and

                     (b)  any one or more of the following applies:

                              (i)  if paragraph (1)(a) applies—the Registrar determines a different percentage of care for the parent or the carer for the child for the particular day under Division 4 of Part 5;

                             (ii)  if paragraph (1)(b) applies—the Registrar makes a determination in respect of the child under section 98S;

                            (iii)  if paragraph (1)(c) applies—the Registrar does not refuse to accept the election under section 146H.

             (3)  The Registrar may refuse to vary the provisional notional assessment if:

                     (a)  the liable parent or the carer entitled to child support seeks a variation to the provisional notional assessment in accordance with subsection (1); and

                     (b)  any of the following applies:

                              (i)  if paragraph (1)(a) applies—the Registrar does not determine a different percentage of care for the parent or carer for the child for the particular day under Division 4 of Part 5;

                             (ii)  if paragraph (1)(b) applies—the Registrar refuses to make a determination in respect of the child under section 98S;

                            (iii)  if paragraph (1)(c) applies—the Registrar refuses to accept the election under section 146H; and

                     (c)  if the liable parent or carer entitled to child support seeks a variation by doing more than one of the things mentioned in subsection (1)—the Registrar has not already varied the provisional notional assessment under subsection (2).

             (4)  The liable parent and the carer entitled to child support are not entitled:

                     (a)  to make an application to the SSAT under section 80 of the Registration and Collection Act; or

                     (b)  to make an application to a court under section 116;

in respect of the making of, or refusal to make, a determination under Part 6A.

Note:          Instead, once the provisional notional assessment becomes a notional assessment, an objection can be made to the particulars of the notional assessment under section 80 of the Registration and Collection Act.

##### <a id="146D"></a>146D  Departure determinations in respect of provisional notional assessments

             (1)  A person may, by written application, ask the Registrar to make a determination under Part 6A (departure determinations) if:

                     (a)  a provisional notional assessment has not yet become a notional assessment under section 146E; and

                     (b)  the person is of the view that, because of special circumstances that exist, the provisions of this Act relating to administrative assessment of child support should be departed from for the purposes of making the provisional notional assessment; and

                     (c)  the person has not previously applied under this section in relation to the provisional notional assessment.

             (2)  If a person makes an application under subsection (1), Division 2 of Part 6A applies as if:

                     (a)  references in that Division to an administrative assessment were references to the provisional notional assessment; and

                     (b)  section 98JA did not apply.

##### <a id="146E"></a>146E  Notional assessments

             (1)  A provisional notional assessment becomes a **_notional assessment_**:

                     (a)  14 days after the notice of the provisional notional assessment is received by all the parties under section 146B; or

                     (b)  if a liable parent or a carer entitled to child support seeks a variation to the provisional notional assessment in accordance with section 146C—on the day on which the Registrar varies, or refuses to vary, the provisional notional assessment under that section.

             (2)  For the purposes of this section and section 146C, if a person does not receive a notice served under section 146B before 14 days after the day on which the notice was served on the person by post at the person’s last known address, the person is taken to have received the notice on the 14th day.

             (3)  To avoid doubt, subsection (2) applies whether the person receives the notice after the time referred to in that subsection or does not receive the notice at all.

             (4)  After a provisional notional assessment becomes a notional assessment, the Registrar must serve notice in writing of the notional assessment on the liable parent and the carer entitled to child support.

             (5)  The notice must specify in respect of the notional assessment the matters that are required by section 69 and subsection 76(2) in respect of an administrative assessment.

             (6)  The notice must include, or be accompanied by, a statement to the effect that:

                     (a)  the party may, subject to the Registration and Collection Act, object to the particulars of the notional assessment; and

                     (b)  if aggrieved by a later decision on an objection to those particulars, may, subject to that Act, apply to the SSAT for review of the later decision.

             (7)  A contravention of subsection (5) or (6) does not affect the validity of the notional assessment.

##### <a id="146F"></a>146F  Later provisional notional assessments

                   The Registrar must make a new provisional notional assessment under section 146B:

                     (a)  if the relevant child support agreement or court order continues in force for more than 3 years—at the end of the 3 year period after the most recent notional assessment relating to the agreement or order was made; or

                     (b)  if the relevant child support agreement was a limited child support agreement—on the request of a party to the agreement; or

                     (c)  in any case—if the amount of child support that is payable under the relevant child support agreement or court order for a day in the child support period changes by more than 15% from the previous day.

### Division 3—Estimating adjusted taxable income for notional assessments

##### <a id="146G"></a>146G  Estimating adjusted taxable income for purposes of notional assessments

             (1)  Before a provisional notional assessment relating to a child becomes a notional assessment under section 146E, a parent of the child may elect that, for the purposes of making the provisional notional assessment, the parent’s adjusted taxable income for the 12 month period beginning on the particular day in the child support period in respect of which the provisional notional assessment is made is the amount estimated by the parent.

             (2)  However, a parent may not make an election under this section in relation to a child if an order or determination referred to in paragraph (a) of the definition of **_income amount order_** is in force in relation to the parent and the particular day in the child support period in respect of which the provisional notional assessment is made.

Election must be for amount less than adjusted taxable income for last relevant year of income

             (3)  The parent may make an election relating to a child only if the amount that he or she estimates under subsection (1) is not more than 85% of the total of the parent’s adjusted taxable income for the last relevant year of income for the child support period.

How election is made

             (4)  The parent makes the election by giving notice of it to the Registrar in the manner specified by the Registrar. The notice must specify the amount the parent estimates to be his or her adjusted taxable income.

##### <a id="146H"></a>146H  Registrar may refuse to accept election

             (1)  The Registrar may refuse to accept the parent’s election if the Registrar is satisfied that the amount the parent estimated under subsection 146G(1) is likely to be less than the actual amount that would be the parent’s adjusted taxable income for that 12 month period.

Note:          If the Registrar refuses to accept the election, he or she may refuse to vary the provisional notional assessment under subsection 146C(3).

             (2)  In making the decision as to whether to refuse the election, the Registrar:

                     (a)  may act on the basis of information that the Registrar has received or obtained as to the financial circumstances of the parent; and

                     (b)  may, but is not required to, conduct an inquiry into the matter.

             (3)  Except for the purposes of Parts VII, VIIA and VIII of the Registration and Collection Act (dealing with objections and appeals), if the Registrar refuses to accept an election, the election is taken never to have been made.

##### <a id="146J"></a>146J  Effect of election

             (1)  If a parent makes an election under subsection 146G(1) relating to a child, then, for the purposes of making the provisional notional assessment, the parent’s adjusted taxable income is the amount the parent estimated.

             (2)  Subsection (1) has effect subject to any order or determination referred to in paragraph (a) of the definition of **_income amount order_** that is made after the making of the election that applies in relation to the parent and the particular day in the child support period in respect of which the provisional notional assessment is made.

             (3)  The Registrar must take such action as is necessary to give effect to subsection (1) in relation to the provisional notional assessment that has been made in relation to the parent and the child (whether by varying the provisional notional assessment or otherwise).

##### <a id="146K"></a>146K  Revocation of election

             (1)  Before a provisional notional assessment becomes a notional assessment under section 146E, a parent who has made an election under subsection 146G(1) in relation to a child may, by notice given to the Registrar, revoke the election.

             (2)  A notice given to the Registrar must be given in the manner specified by the Registrar.

Note:          Section 150A provides for the Registrar to specify the manner in which a notice may be given.

##### <a id="146L"></a>146L  Effect of revocation

             (1)  If a parent who made an election under section 146G relating to a child revokes the election and substitutes a new election before the provisional notional assessment becomes a notional assessment under section 146E, then, for the purposes of making the provisional notional assessment, the parent’s adjusted taxable income is the amount the parent elected in the new election.

             (2)  Subsection (1) has effect subject to any order or determination referred to in paragraph (a) of the definition of **_income amount order_** that is made after the making of the election that applies in relation to the parent and the particular day in the child support period in respect of which the provisional notional assessment is made.

             (3)  The Registrar must take such action as is necessary to give effect to subsection (1) in relation to the provisional notional assessment that has been made in relation to the parent and the child (whether by varying the provisional notional assessment or otherwise).

             (4)  This section does not prevent:

                     (a)  the Registrar making a determination under Part 6A; or

                     (b)  a court making any order under Division 4 of Part 7; or

                     (c)  the making, and acceptance by the Registrar, of a child support agreement that includes provisions that have effect, for the purposes of Part 5, as if they were such an order made by consent.

#### Subdivision B—Offsetting for duplicate rent assistance

##### <a id="38J"></a>38J  Offsetting for duplicate rent assistance under family assistance and social security law

When this clause applies

             (1)  This clause applies if:

                     (a)  a decision (the **_social security decision_**) was made that rent assistance was to be included when calculating an individual’s, or an individual’s eligible partner’s, rate of social security payment for a day; and

                     (b)  when the social security decision was made, no decision (the **_family assistance decision_**) to make a determination that includes, or to vary a determination to include, rent assistance when calculating the individual’s Part A rate of family tax benefit for that day had been made; and

                     (c)  after the social security decision was made, the family assistance decision was made; and

                     (d)  the day mentioned in paragraphs (a) and (b) comes before the day on which the family assistance decision was made.

Note:          For the definition of **_eligible partner_** see subclause (5).

Part A rate to be reduced

             (2)  The individual’s Part A rate for that day (as calculated or recalculated because of the making of the family assistance decision) is to be reduced:

                     (a)  first, by the individual’s annual social security RA amount for that day (see subclause (3)); and

                     (b)  then, by the individual’s eligible partner’s annual social security RA amount for that day (see subclause (4)).

However, it is not to be reduced to less than:

                     (c)  if it has been calculated for the first time under clause 3 or 28A because of the making of the family assistance decision—nil; and

                     (d)  if it has been recalculated under clause 3 or 28A because of the making of the family assistance decision—the Part A rate as it was immediately before the recalculation.

             (3)  The **_individual’s annual social security RA amount_** for that day is the amount worked out as follows:

* * *

_Method statement_

_Step 1_.   Work out the rate (if any) of social security payment (the **_actual payment_**) that was payable to the individual for that day.

_Step 2_.   Work out the rate (if any) of social security payment (the **_notional payment_**) that would have been payable to the individual for that day if rent assistance were not included when calculating the rate of the individual’s social security payment for that day.

_Step 3._   Subtract the notional payment from the actual payment. The difference is the **_individual’s daily social security RA amount_** for that day.

_Step 4._   Multiply the individual’s daily social security RA amount for that day by 365\. The result is the **_individual’s annual social security RA amount_** for that day.

* * *

             (4)  The **_individual’s eligible partner’s annual social security RA amount_** for that day is the amount worked out as follows:

* * *

_Method statement_

_Step 1_.   Work out the rate (if any) of social security payment (the **_actual payment_**) that was payable to the individual’s eligible partner for that day.

_Step 2_.   Work out the rate (if any) of social security payment (the **_notional payment_**) that would have been payable to the eligible partner for that day if rent assistance were not included when calculating the rate of the eligible partner’s social security payment for that day.

_Step 3._   Subtract the notional payment from the actual payment. The difference is the **_eligible partner’s daily social security RA amount_** for that day.

_Step 4._   Multiply the eligible partner’s daily social security RA amount for that day by 365\. The result is the **_individual’s eligible partner’s annual social security RA amount_** for that day.

* * *

             (5)  For the purposes of this clause, an individual is the **_eligible partner_** of another individual if both individuals are members of a couple (other than an illness separated couple, a respite care couple or a temporarily separated couple).

##### <a id="38K"></a>38K  Offsetting for duplicate rent assistance under family assistance and veterans’ entitlements law

When this clause applies

             (1)  This clause applies if:

                     (a)  a decision (the **_veterans’ entitlements decision_**) was made that rent assistance was to be included when calculating an individual’s, or an individual’s eligible partner’s, rate of service pension or income support supplement for a day; and

                     (b)  when the veterans’ entitlements decision was made, no decision (the **_family assistance decision_**) to make a determination that includes, or to vary a determination to include, rent assistance when calculating the individual’s Part A rate of family tax benefit for that day had been made; and

                     (c)  after the veterans’ entitlements decision was made, the family assistance decision was made; and

                     (d)  the day mentioned in paragraphs (a) and (b) comes before the day on which the family assistance decision was made.

Note:          For the definition of **_eligible partner_** see subclause (5).

Part A rate to be reduced

             (2)  The individual’s Part A rate for that day (as calculated or recalculated because of the making of the family assistance decision and as reduced (if at all) under clause 38J) is to be reduced:

                     (a)  first, by the individual’s annual veterans’ entitlements RA amount for that day (see subclause (3)); and

                     (b)  then, by the individual’s eligible partner’s annual veterans’ entitlements RA amount for that day (see subclause (4)).

However, it is not to be reduced to less than:

                     (c)  if it has been calculated for the first time under clause 3 or 28A because of the making of the family assistance decision—nil; and

                     (d)  if it has been recalculated under clause 3 or 28A because of the making of the family assistance decision—the Part A rate as it was immediately before the recalculation.

             (3)  The **_individual’s annual veterans’ entitlements RA amount_** for that day is the amount worked out as follows:

* * *

_Method statement_

_Step 1_.   Work out the rate (if any) of service pension or income support supplement (the **_actual payment_**) that was payable to the individual for that day.

_Step 2_.   Work out the rate (if any) of service pension or income support supplement (the **_notional payment_**) that would have been payable to the individual for that day if rent assistance were not included when calculating the rate of the individual’s service pension or income support supplement for that day.

_Step 3._   Subtract the notional payment from the actual payment. The difference is the **_individual’s provisional veterans’ entitlements RA amount_** for that day.

_Step 4._   Divide the individual’s provisional veterans’ entitlements RA amount for that day by 364, then multiply it by 365\. The result is the **_individual’s annual veterans’ entitlements RA amount_** for that day.

_Method statement_

_Step 1_.   Work out the rate (if any) of service pension or income support supplement (the **_actual payment_**) that was payable to the individual’s eligible partner for that day.

_Step 2_.   Work out the rate (if any) of service pension or income support supplement (the **_notional payment_**) that would have been payable to the eligible partner for that day if rent assistance were not included when calculating the amount of the eligible partner’s service pension or income support supplement for that day.

_Step 3._   Subtract the notional payment from the actual payment. The difference is the **_eligible partner’s provisional veterans’ entitlements RA amount_** for that day.

_Step 4._   Divide the eligible partner’s provisional veterans’ entitlements RA amount for that day by 364, then multiply it by 365\. The result is the **_individual’s eligible partner’s annual veterans’ entitlements RA amount_** for that day.

                   This is how to work out an individual’s reduction for adjusted taxable income if clause 38L does not apply to the individual:

* * *

_Method statement_

_Step 1._ Work out the individual’s **_income free area_** using clause 38N.

_Step 2._ Work out whether the individual’s adjusted taxable income exceeds the individual’s income free area.

_Step 3._ If the individual’s adjusted taxable income does not exceed the individual’s income free area, the individual’s **_income excess_** is nil.

_Step 4._ If the individual’s adjusted taxable income exceeds the individual’s income free area, the individual’s **_income excess_** is the individual’s adjusted taxable income less the individual’s income free area.

_Step 5._ The individual’s **_reduction for adjusted taxable income_** is 20% of the income excess.

## 147  Saving qualification and rates for double orphan pension

(1)       This item applies if:

                     (a)  immediately before 1 July 2008, a person is receiving a double orphan pension for a young person under the _Social Security Act 1991_; and

                     (b)  on 1 July 2008:

Continuation of qualification

(2)       If subparagraph (1)(b)(i) applies, then, on and after 1 July 2008, the person continues to qualify for a double orphan pension for the young person, despite the amendments to the _A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999_ made by this Schedule.

(3)       However, the person ceases to qualify under subitem (2) for a double orphan pension for the young person if:

                     (a)  the person would cease to qualify for a double orphan pension for the young person under the _Social Security Act 1991_ for a reason other than because of the amendments to the _A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999_ made by this Schedule; or

Continuation of rate

(4)       On and after 1 July 2008, while the person continues to qualify for a double orphan pension for the young person (whether under subitem (2) or, if subparagraph (1)(b)(ii) applies, under the _Social Security Act 1991_), the double orphan pension is payable to the person for the young person at the lower of the following rates (the **_saved rate_**):

                     (a)  the rate at which the double orphan pension was payable to the person for the young person immediately before 1 July 2008, despite:

                              (i)  the amendments to the _Social Security Act 1991_ made by items 122, 123 and 124 of this Schedule; and

                             (ii)  section 1190 of that Act (indexation);

                     (b)  if the young person is an FTB child of the person on or after 1 July 2008—the rate that would be payable to the person for the young person under section 1010 of the _Social Security Act 1991_ as in force immediately before 1 July 2008.

(5)       However, the double orphan pension ceases to be payable to the person for the young person at the saved rate if the rate at which the double orphan pension would otherwise be payable to the person for the young person under the _Social Security Act 1991_ becomes equal to or greater than the saved rate.
