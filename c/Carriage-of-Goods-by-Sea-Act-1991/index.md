Section&#160;7

<center>ARTICLE 1</center>

In this convention the following words are employed, with the meanings set out below:&#151;

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>"Carrier" includes the owner or the charterer who enters into a contract

of carriage with a shipper.</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>"Contract of carriage" applies only to contracts of carriage covered by a bill of lading or any similar document of title, in so far as such document relates to the carriage of goods by sea, including any bill of lading or any similar document as aforesaid issued under or pursuant to a charter party from the moment at which such bill of lading or similar document of title regulates the relations between a carrier and a holder of the same.</dd> <dt>(c)</dt><dd>"Goods" includes goods, wares, merchandise, and articles of every kind whatsoever except live animals and cargo which by the contract of carriage is stated as being carried on deck and is so carried.</dd> <dt>(d)</dt><dd>"Ship" means any vessel used for the carriage of goods by sea.</dd> <dt>(e)</dt><dd>"Carriage of goods" covers the period from the time when the goods are loaded on to the time they are discharged from the ship. </dd> </dl></dl>

<center>ARTICLE 2</center>

Subject to the provisions of Article 6, under every contract of carriage of goods by sea the carrier, in relation to the loading, handling, stowage, carriage, custody, care and discharge of such goods, shall be subject to the responsibilities and liabilities, and entitled to the rights and immunities hereinafter set forth.

<center>ARTICLE 3</center>

1.	The carrier shall be bound before and at the beginning of the voyage to exercise due diligence to&#151;

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>Make the ship seaworthy.</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>Properly man, equip and supply the ship.</dd> <dt>(c)</dt><dd>Make the holds, refrigerating and cool chambers, and all other parts of the ship in which goods are carried, fit and safe for their reception, carriage and preservation. </dd> </dl></dl>

2.	Subject to the provisions of Article 4, the carrier shall properly and carefully load, handle, stow, carry, keep, care for, and discharge the goods carried.
 3.	After receiving the goods into his charge the carrier or the master or agent of the carrier shall, on demand of the shipper, issue to the shipper a bill of lading showing among other things&#151;

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>The leading marks necessary for identification of the goods as the same

are furnished in writing by the shipper before the loading of such goods

starts, provided such marks are stamped or otherwise shown clearly upon the

goods if uncovered, or on the cases or coverings in which such goods are

contained, in such a manner as should ordinarily remain legible until the end

of the voyage.</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>Either the number of packages or pieces, or the quantity, or weight, as the case may be, as furnished in writing by the shipper.</dd> <dt>(c)</dt><dd>The apparent order and condition of the goods. </dd> </dl></dl>

<center>Back to Top</center>

Provided that no carrier, master or agent of the carrier shall be bound to state or show in the bill of lading any marks, number, quantity, or weight which he has reasonable ground for suspecting not accurately to represent the goods actually received, or which he has had no reasonable means of checking.
 4.	Such a bill of lading shall be _prima facie_ evidence of the receipt by the carrier of the goods as therein described in accordance with paragraph 3(a), (b) and (c). However, proof to the contrary shall not be admissible when the bill of lading has been transferred to a third party acting in good faith.
 5.	The shipper shall be deemed to have guaranteed to the carrier the accuracy at the time of shipment of the marks, number, quantity and weight, as furnished by him, and the shipper shall indemnify the carrier against all loss, damages and expenses arising or resulting from inaccuracies in such particulars. The right of the carrier to such indemnity shall in no way limit his responsibility and liability under the contract of carriage to any person other than the shipper.
 6.	Unless notice of loss or damage and the general nature of such loss or damage be given in writing to the carrier or his agent at the port of discharge before or at the time of the removal of the goods into the custody of the person entitled to delivery thereof under the contract of carriage, or, if the loss or damage be not apparent, within three days, such removal shall be _prima facie_ evidence of the delivery by the carrier of the goods as described in the bill of lading.
 The notice in writing need not be given if the state of the goods has, at the time of their receipt, been the subject of joint survey or inspection.
 Subject to paragraph 6 _bis_ the carrier and the ship shall in any event be discharged from all liability whatsoever in respect of the goods, unless suit is brought within one year of their delivery or of the date when they should have been delivered. This period may, however, be extended if the parties so agree after the cause of action has arisen.
 In the case of any actual or apprehended loss or damage the carrier and the receiver shall give all reasonable facilities to each other for inspecting and tallying the goods.
 6 _bis_.	An action for indemnity against a third person may be brought even after the expiration of the year provided for in the preceding paragraph if brought within the time allowed by the law of the court seized of the case. However, the time allowed shall be not less than three months, commencing from the day when the person bringing such action for indemnity has settled the claim or has been served with process in the action against himself.
 7.	After the goods are loaded the bill of lading to be issued by the carrier, master, or agent of the carrier, to the shipper shall, if the shipper so demands, be a "shipped" bill of lading, provided that if the shipper shall have previously taken up any document of title to such goods, he shall surrender the same as against the issue of the "shipped" bill of lading, but at the option of the carrier such document of title may be noted at the port of shipment by the carrier, master, or agent with the name or names of the ship or ships upon which the goods have been shipped and the date or dates of shipment, and when so noted, if it shows the particulars mentioned in paragraph 3 of Article 3, shall for the purpose of this article be deemed to constitute a "shipped" bill of lading.
 8.	Any clause, covenant, or agreement in a contract of carriage relieving the carrier or the ship from liability for loss or damage to, or in connexion with, goods arising from negligence, fault, or failure in the duties and obligations provided in this article or lessening such liability otherwise than as provided in this convention, shall be null and void and of no effect. A benefit of insurance in favour of the carrier or similar clause shall be deemed to be a clause relieving the carrier from liability.

1.	Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be liable for loss or damage arising or resulting from unseaworthiness unless caused by want of due diligence on the part of the carrier to make the ship seaworthy, and to secure that the ship is properly manned, equipped and supplied, and to make the holds, refrigerating and cool chambers and all other parts of the ship in which goods are carried fit and safe for their reception, carriage and preservation in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 3\. Whenever loss or damage has resulted from unseaworthiness the burden of proving the exercise of due diligence shall be on the carrier or other person claiming exemption under this article.

3.	The shipper shall not be responsible for loss or damage sustained by the carrier or the ship arising or resulting from any cause without the act, fault or neglect of the shipper, his agents or his servants.
 4.	Any deviation in saving or attempting to save life or property at sea or any reasonable deviation shall not be deemed to be an infringement or breach of this convention or of the contract of carriage, and the carrier shall not be liable for any loss or damage resulting therefrom.
 5.(a)	Unless the nature and value of such goods have been declared by the shipper before shipment and inserted in the bill of lading, neither the carrier nor the ship shall in any event be or become liable for any loss or damage to or in connection with the goods in an amount exceeding 666.67 units of account per package or unit or 2 units of account per kilogramme of gross weight of the goods lost or damaged, whichever is the higher.
 (b)	The total amount recoverable shall be calculated by reference to the value of such goods at the place and time at which the goods are discharged from the ship in accordance with the contract or should have been so discharged.
 The value of the goods shall be fixed according to the commodity exchange price, or, if there be no such price, according to the current market price, or, if there be no commodity exchange price or current market price, by reference to the normal value of goods of the same kind and quality.
 (c)	Where a container, pallet or similar article of transport is used to consolidate goods, the number of packages or units enumerated in the Bill of Lading as packed in such article of transport shall be deemed the number of packages or units for the purpose of this paragraph as far as these packages or units are concerned. Except as aforesaid such article of transport shall be considered the package or unit.
 (d)	The unit of account mentioned in this Article is the Special Drawing Right as defined by the International Monetary Fund. The amounts mentioned in sub-paragraph&#160;(a) of this paragraph shall be converted into national currency on the basis of the value of that currency on a date to be determined by the law of the court seized of the case.
 The value of the national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a State which is a member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in accordance with the method of valuation applied by the International Monetary Fund in effect at the date in question for its operations and transactions. The value of the national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a State which is not a member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in a manner determined by that State.
 Nevertheless, a State which is not a member of the International Monetary Fund and whose law does not permit the application of the provisions of the preceding sentences may, at the time of ratification of the Protocol of 1979 or accession thereto or at any time thereafter, declare that the limits of liability provided for in this Convention to be applied in its territory shall be fixed as follows:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(i)</dt><dd>in respect of the amount of 666.67 units of account mentioned in

sub-paragraph&#160;(a) of paragraph 5 of this Article, 10,000 monetary units;</dd> <dt>(ii)</dt><dd>in respect of the amount of 2 units of account mentioned in sub-paragraph&#160;(a) of paragraph 5 of this Article, 30 monetary units. </dd> </dl></dl>

The monetary unit referred to in the preceding sentence corresponds to 65.5 milligrammes of gold of millesimal fineness 900'. The conversion of the amounts specified in that sentence into the national currency shall be made according to the law of the State concerned.
 The calculation and the conversion mentioned in the preceding sentences shall be made in such a manner as to express in the national currency of the State as far as possible the same real value for the amounts in sub-paragraph&#160;(a) of paragraph 5 of this Article as is expressed there in units of account.
 States shall communicate to the depositary the manner of calculation or the result of the conversion as the case may be, when depositing an instrument of ratification of the Protocol of 1979 or of accession thereto and whenever there is a change in either.
 (e)	Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be entitled to the benefit of the limitation of liability provided for in this paragraph if it is proved that the damage resulted from an act or omission of the carrier done with intent to cause damage, or recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result.
 (f)	The declaration mentioned in sub-paragraph&#160;(a) of this paragraph, if embodied in the Bill of Lading, shall be _prima facie_ evidence, but shall not be binding or conclusive on the carrier.
 (g)	By agreement between the carrier, master or agent of the carrier and the shipper other maximum amounts than those mentioned in sub-paragraph&#160;(a) of this paragraph may be fixed, provided that no maximum amount so fixed shall be less than the appropriate maximum mentioned in that sub-paragraph.
 (h)	Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be responsible in any event for loss or damage to, or in connection with, goods if the nature or value thereof has been knowingly mis-stated by the shipper in the Bill of Lading.
 6.	Goods of an inflammable, explosive or dangerous nature to the shipment whereof the carrier, master or agent of the carrier has not consented with 
<center>Back to Top</center>
 knowledge of their nature and character, may at any time before discharge be landed at any place, or destroyed or rendered innocuous by the carrier without compensation and the shipper of such goods shall be liable for all damages and expenses directly or indirectly arising out of or resulting from such shipment. If any such goods shipped with such knowledge and consent shall become a danger to the ship or cargo, they may in like manner be landed at any place, or destroyed or rendered innocuous by the carrier without liability on the part of the carrier except to general average, if any.

<center>ARTICLE 4 _bis_</center>

1.	The defences and limits of liability provided for in this Convention shall apply in any action against the carrier in respect of loss or damage to goods covered by a contract of carriage whether the action be founded in contract or in tort.
 2.	If such an action is brought against a servant or agent of the carrier (such servant or agent not being an independent contractor), such servant or agent shall be entitled to avail himself of the defences and limits of liability which the carrier is entitled to invoke under this Convention.
 3.	The aggregate of the amounts recoverable from the carrier, and such servants and agents, shall in no case exceed the limit provided for in this Convention.
 4.	Nevertheless, a servant or agent of the carrier shall not be entitled to avail himself of the provisions of this Article, if it is proved that the damage resulted from an act or omission of the servant or agent done with intent to cause damage or recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result.

<center>ARTICLE 5</center>

A carrier shall be at liberty to surrender in whole or in part all or any of his rights and immunities or to increase any of his responsibilities and obligations under this convention, provided such surrender or increase shall be embodied in the Bill of Lading issued to the shipper. The provisions of this convention shall not be applicable to charter parties, but if bills of lading are issued in the case of a ship under a charter party they shall comply with the terms of this convention. Nothing in these rules shall be held to prevent the insertion in a Bill of Lading of any lawful provision regarding general average.

<center>ARTICLE 6</center>

Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding articles, a carrier, master or agent of the carrier and a shipper shall in regard to any particular goods be at liberty to enter into any agreement in any terms as to the responsibility and liability of the carrier for such goods, and as to the rights and immunities of the carrier in respect of such goods, or his obligation as to seaworthiness, so far as this stipulation is not contrary to public policy, or the care or diligence of his servants or agents in regard to the loading, handling, stowage, carriage, custody, care and discharge of the goods carried by sea, provided that in this case no bill of lading has been or shall be issued and that the terms agreed shall be embodied in a receipt which shall be a non-negotiable document and shall be marked as such.
 Any agreement so entered into shall have full legal effect.
 Provided that this article shall not apply to ordinary commercial shipments made in the ordinary course of trade, but only to other shipments where the character or condition of the property to be carried or the circumstances, terms and conditions under which the carriage is to be performed are such as reasonably to justify a special agreement.

<center>ARTICLE 7</center>

Nothing herein contained shall prevent a carrier or a shipper from entering into any agreement, stipulation, condition, reservation or exemption as to the responsibility and liability of the carrier or the ship for the loss or damage to, or in connexion with, the custody and care and handling of goods prior to the loading on, and subsequent to the discharge from the ship on which the goods are carried by sea.

<center>ARTICLE 8</center>

The provisions of this convention shall not affect the rights and obligations of the carrier under any statute for the time being in force relating to the limitation of the liability of owners of sea-going vessels.

<center>ARTICLE 9</center>

This Convention shall not affect the provisions of any international Convention or national law governing liability for nuclear damage.

<center>ARTICLE 10</center>

The provisions of this Convention shall apply to every Bill of Lading relating to the carriage of goods between ports in two different States if:

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>the Bill of Lading is issued in a Contracting State, or</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>the carriage is from a port in a Contracting State, or</dd> <dt>(c)</dt><dd>the contract contained in or evidenced by the Bill of Lading provides that the rules of this Convention or legislation of any State giving effect to them are to govern the contract </dd> </dl></dl>

whatever may be the nationality of the ship, the carrier, the shipper, the consignee, or any other interested person.

<center>Back to Top</center>
 Each Contracting State shall apply the provisions of this Convention to the Bills of Lading mentioned above.
 This Article shall not prevent a Contracting State from applying the rules of this Convention to Bills of Lading not included in the preceding paragraphs.

After receiving the goods into his charge the carrier or the master or agent of the carrier shall, on demand of the shipper, issue to the shipper a<strike>bill of lading</strike> _sea carriage document_ showing among other things&#151; <dt>(a)</dt><dd>The leading marks necessary for identification of the goods as the same are furnished in writing by the shipper before the loading of such goods starts, provided such marks are stamped or otherwise shown clearly upon the goods if uncovered, or on the cases or coverings in which such goods are contained, in such a manner as should ordinarily remain legible until the end of the voyage.</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>Either the number of packages or pieces, or the quantity, or weight, as the case may be, as furnished in writing by the shipper.</dd> <dt>(c)</dt><dd>The apparent order and condition of the goods.</dd> Provided that no carrier, master or agent of the carrier shall be bound to state or show in the <strike>bill of lading </strike>_sea carriage document_ any marks, number, quantity, or weight which he has reasonable ground for suspecting not accurately to represent the goods actually received, or which he has had no reasonable means of checking. 	4.	Such a <strike>bill of lading</strike> _sea carriage document_ shall be prima facie evidence of the receipt by the carrier of the goods as therein described in accordance with paragraph 3 (a), (b) and (c). However, proof to the contrary shall not be admissible <strike>when the bill of lading </strike>_in the case of a negotiable sea carriage document that_ has been transferred to a third party acting in good faith. 	5.	The shipper shall be deemed to have guaranteed to the carrier the accuracy at the time of shipment of the marks, number, quantity and weight, as furnished by him, and the shipper shall indemnify the carrier against all loss, damages and expenses arising or resulting from inaccuracies in such particulars. The right of the carrier to such indemnity shall in no way limit his responsibility and liability under the contract of carriage to any person other than the shipper. 	6.	Unless notice of loss or damage and the general nature of such loss or damage be given in writing to the carrier or his agent at the port of discharge before or at the time of the removal of the goods into the custody of the person entitled to delivery thereof under the contract of carriage, or, if the loss or damage be not apparent, within three days, such removal shall be prima facie evidence of the delivery by the carrier of the goods as described in the <strike>bill of lading</strike>_sea carriage document_. The notice in writing need not be given if the state of the goods has, at the time of their receipt, been the subject of joint survey or inspection. Subject to paragraph 6<sup>bis</sup> the carrier and the ship shall in any event be discharged from all liability whatsoever in respect of the goods, unless suit is brought within one year of their delivery or of the date when they should have been delivered. This period may, however, be extended if the parties so agree after the cause of action has arisen. In the case of any actual or apprehended loss or damage the carrier and the receiver shall give all reasonable facilities to each other for inspecting and tallying the goods. 6<sup>bis</sup>. An action for indemnity against a third person may be brought even after the expiration of the year provided for in the preceding paragraph if brought within the time allowed by the law of the court seized of the case. However, the time allowed shall be not less than three months, commencing from the day when the person bringing such action for indemnity has settled the claim or has been served with process in the action against himself. 	7.	After the goods are loaded the _sea-carriage document_ <strike>bill of lading </strike>to be issued by the carrier, master, or agent of the carrier, to the shipper shall, if the shipper so demands, be a "shipped" _negotiable sea carriage document_<strike>bill of lading</strike>, provided that if the shipper shall have previously taken up any _sea carriage document for_<strike>document of title to</strike> such goods, he shall surrender the same as against the issue of the "shipped" _negotiable sea carriage document_<strike>bill of lading</strike>, but at the option of the carrier _a negotiable sea carriage document_ <strike>such document of title</strike> may be noted at the port of shipment by the carrier, master, or agent with the name or names of the ship or ships upon which the goods have been shipped and the date or dates of shipment, and when so noted, if it shows the particulars mentioned in paragraph 3 of Article 3, shall for the purpose of this article be deemed to constitute a "shipped" _negotiable sea carriage document_<strike>bill of lading</strike>. 	8.	Any clause, covenant, or agreement in a contract of carriage relieving the carrier or the ship from liability for loss or damage to, or in connexion with, goods arising from negligence, fault, or failure in the duties and obligations provided in this article or lessening such liability otherwise than as provided in _these Rules_<strike>this convention</strike>, shall be null and void and of no effect.

_1_._Despite Article 4, a carrier is liable to a shipper for loss (including but not limited to, pure economic loss, loss of markets or deterioration) caused to the shipper by the shipper&apos;s goods being delayed while the carrier is in charge of the goods unless the carrier establishes, on the balance of probabilities, that:_ _(a)	the delay was excusable; and_ _(b)	the carrier (or, if at the time of the delay, the goods were under the control of servants or agents of the carrier, those servants or agents) took all measures that were reasonably required to avoid the delay and its consequences._ _\[NOTE: For the meaning of &quot;in charge of the goods&quot;, see paragraph 2 of Article 1_._]_ _2_._For this Article, goods have been delayed if they are not delivered at the port of discharge specified in the relevant contract for carriage of goods:_ _(a)	within the time allowed in the contract for that purpose; or_ _(b)	if the contract does not specify a time for that purposewithin a reasonable time for delivery, at that port, of similar goods carried by a diligent carrier (having regard to any particular circumstances of the case and the intentions of the shipper and the carrier)._ _\[NOTE: For the meaning of &quot;delivered&quot;, see paragraph 1A of Article 1_._]_ _3_._For paragraph 1 (a) of this Article, a delay is excusable only if:_ _(a)	it is caused by a deviation authorised by the shipper, or by a term in the contract of carriage; or_ _(b)	it is caused by circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the carrier or its servants or agents; or_ _(c)	it is reasonably necessary to comply with an express or implied warranty; or_ _(d)	it is reasonably necessary for the safety of the ship or its cargo; or_ _(e)	it is for the purposes of saving human life or aiding a ship in distress; or_ _(f)	it is reasonably necessary for the purpose of obtaining medical or surgical aid for a person on board; or_ _(g)	it is caused by barratrous conduct of the master or crew; or_ _(h)	paragraph 4 of this Article applies._ _4_._For paragraph 1 (a) of this Article, a delay caused by industrial action is excusable if the industrial action was not substantially caused, or substantially contributed to, by unreasonable conduct of the carrier._ _5_._For paragraph 4, conduct of servants or agents of the carrier is not taken to be conduct of the carrier if the servants or agents engaged in the conduct without the carrier&apos;s express or implied authority._ _6_._The quantum of the carrier&apos;s liability for loss caused by the delay is limited to whichever is the lesser of:_ _(a)	the actual amount of the loss; or_ _(b)	two and a half times the sea freight payable for the goods delayed; or_ _(c)	the total amount payable as sea freight for all of the goods shipped by the shipper concerned under the contract of carriage concerned._ _7_._To avoid doubt, nothing in Article 4 or this Article prevents a carrier being liable to a shipper under both Article 4 and this Article._  </dl></dl>

###  CARRIAGE OF GOODS BY SEA ACT 1991Schedule&#160;2&#151;The Hamburg Rules 
**</center>

 Section&#160;12

<center>PART I. GENERAL PROVISIONS</center>
 <center><u>Article 1.	Definitions</u></center>

<center>Back to Top</center>

In this Convention: 
 1.	"Carrier" means any person by whom or in whose name a contract of carriage of goods by sea has been concluded with a shipper.
 2.	"Actual carrier" means any person to whom the performance of the carriage of the goods, or of part of the carriage, has been entrusted by the carrier, and includes any other person to whom such performance has been entrusted. 
 3.	"Shipper" means any person by whom or in whose name or on whose behalf a contract of carriage of goods by sea has been concluded with a carrier, or any person by whom or in whose name or on whose behalf the goods are actually delivered to the carrier in relation to the contract of carriage by sea.
 4.	"Consignee" means the person entitled to take delivery of the goods.
 5.	"Goods" includes live animals; where the goods are consolidated in a container, pallet or similar article of transport or where they are packed, "goods" includes such article of transport or packaging if supplied by the shipper. 
 6.	"Contract of carriage by sea" means any contract whereby the carrier undertakes against payment of freight to carry goods by sea from one port to another; however, a contract which involves carriage by sea and also carriage by some other means is deemed to be a contract of carriage by sea for the purposes of this Convention only in so far as it relates to the carriage by sea.
 7.	"Bill of lading" means a document which evidences a contract of carriage by sea and the taking over or loading of the goods by the carrier, and by which the carrier undertakes to deliver the goods against surrender of the document. A provision in the document that the goods are to be delivered to the order of a named person, or to order, or to bearer, constitutes such an undertaking.
 8.	"Writing" includes, <u>inter alia</u>, telegram and telex.

<center><u>Article 2.	Scope of application</u></center>

1.	The provisions of this Convention are applicable to all contracts of carriage by sea between two different States, if: 

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>the port of loading as provided for in the contract of carriage by sea is

located in a Contracting State, or </dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>the port of discharge as provided for in the contract of carriage by sea is located in a Contracting State, or </dd> <dt>(c)</dt><dd>one of the optional ports of discharge provided for in the contract of carriage by sea is the actual port of discharge and such port is located in a Contracting State, or </dd> <dt>(d)</dt><dd>the bill of lading or other document evidencing the contract of carriage by sea is issued in a Contracting State, or </dd> <dt>(e)</dt><dd>the bill of lading or other document evidencing the contract of carriage by sea provides that the provisions of this Convention or the legislation of any State giving effect to them are to govern the contract. </dd> </dl></dl>

2.	The provisions of this Convention are applicable without regard to the nationality of the ship, the carrier, the actual carrier, the shipper, the consignee or any other interested person.
 3.	The provisions of this Convention are not applicable to charter-parties. However, where a bill of lading is issued pursuant to a charter-party, the provisions of the Convention apply to such a bill of lading if it governs the relation between the carrier and the holder of the bill of lading, not being the charterer.
 4.	If a contract provides for future carriage of goods in a series of shipments during an agreed period, the provisions of this Convention apply to each shipment. However, where a shipment is made under a charter-party, the provisions of paragraph 3 of this article apply.

<center><u>Article 3.	Interpretation of the Convention</u></center>

In the interpretation and application of the provisions of this Convention regard shall be had to its international character and to the need to promote uniformity. 

<center>PART II. LIABILITY OF THE CARRIER</center>
 <center><u>Article 4.	Period of responsibility </u></center>

1.	The responsibility of the carrier for the goods under this Convention covers the period during which the carrier is in charge of the goods at the port of loading, during the carriage and at the port of discharge.
 2.	For the purpose of paragraph 1 of this article, the carrier is deemed to be in charge of the goods

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>from the time he has taken over the goods from:</dd> <dt>(i)</dt><dd>the shipper, or a person acting on his behalf; or</dd> <dt>(ii)</dt><dd>an authority or other third party to whom, pursuant to law or regulations applicable at the port of loading, the goods must be handed over for shipment;</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>until the time he has delivered the goods:</dd> <dt>(i)</dt><dd>by handing over the goods to the consignee; or </dd> <dt>(ii)</dt><dd>in cases where the consignee does not receive the goods from the carrier, by placing them at the disposal of the consignee in accordance with the contract or with the law or with the usage of the particular trade, applicable at the port of discharge; or </dd> <dt>(iii)</dt><dd>by handing over the goods to an authority or other third party to whom, pursuant to law or regulations applicable at the port of discharge, the goods must be handed over. </dd> </dl></dl>

<center>Back to Top</center>

3.	In paragraphs 1 and 2 of this article, reference to the carrier or to the consignee means, in addition to the carrier or the consignee, the servants or agents, respectively of the carrier or the consignee.

<center><u>Article 5.	Basis of liability</u></center>

1.	The carrier is liable for loss resulting from loss of or damage to the goods, as well as from delay in delivery, if the occurrence which caused the loss, damage or delay took place while the goods were in his charge as defined in article 4, unless the carrier proves that he, his servants or agents took all measures that could reasonably be required to avoid the occurrence and its consequences. 
 2.	Delay in delivery occurs when the goods have not been delivered at the port of discharge provided for in the contract of carriage by sea within the time expressly agreed upon or, in the absence of such agreement, within the time which it would be reasonable to require of a diligent carrier, having regard to the circumstances of the case. 
 3.	The person entitled to make a claim for the loss of goods may treat the goods as lost if they have not been delivered as required by article 4 within 60 consecutive days following the expiry of the time for delivery according to paragraph 2 of this article. 
 4.(a)	The carrier is liable 

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(i)</dt><dd>for loss of or damage to the goods or delay in delivery caused by fire, if

the claimant proves that the fire arose from fault or neglect on the part of

the carrier, his servants or agents; </dd> <dt>(ii)</dt><dd>for such loss, damage or delay in delivery which is proved by the claimant to have resulted from the fault or neglect of the carrier, his servants or agents, in taking all measures that could reasonably be required to put out the fire and avoid or mitigate its consequences. </dd> </dl></dl>

(b)	In case of fire on board the ship affecting the goods, if the claimant or the carrier so desires, a survey in accordance with shipping practices must be held into the cause and circumstances of the fire, and a copy of the surveyor's report shall be made available on demand to the carrier and the claimant. 
 5.	With respect to live animals, the carrier is not liable for loss, damage or delay in delivery resulting from any special risks inherent in that kind of carriage. If the carrier proves that he has complied with any special instructions given to him by the shipper respecting the animals and that, in the circumstances of the case, the loss, damage or delay in delivery could be attributed to such risks, it is presumed that the loss, damage or delay in delivery was so caused, unless there is proof that all or a part of the loss, damage or delay in delivery resulted from fault or neglect on the part of the carrier, his servants or agents.
 6.	The carrier is not liable, except in general average, where loss, damage or delay in delivery resulted from measures to save life or from reasonable measures to save property at sea. 
 7.	Where fault or neglect on the part of the carrier, his servants or agents combines with another cause to produce loss, damage or delay in delivery the carrier is liable only to the extent that the loss, damage or delay in delivery is attributable to such fault or neglect, provided that the carrier proves the amount of the loss, damage or delay in delivery not attributable thereto. 

<center><u>Article 6.	Limits of liability </u></center>

1.(a)	The liability of the carrier for loss resulting from loss of or damage to goods according to the provisions of article 5 is limited to an amount equivalent to 835 units of account per package or other shipping unit or 2.5 units of account per kilogramme of gross weight of the goods lost or damaged, whichever is the higher.
 (b)	The liability of the carrier for delay in delivery according to the provisions of article 5 is limited to an amount equivalent to two and a half times the freight payable for the goods delayed, but not exceeding the total freight payable under the contract of carriage of goods by sea. 
 (c)	In no case shall the aggregate liability of the carrier, under both subparagraphs&#160;(a) and (b) of this paragraph, exceed the limitation which would be established under subparagraph&#160;(a) of this paragraph for total loss of the goods with respect to which such liability was incurred. 
 2.	For the purpose of calculating which amount is the higher in accordance with paragraph 1(a) of this article, the following rules apply: 
 (a)	Where a container, pallet or similar article of transport is used to consolidate goods, the package or other shipping units enumerated in the bill of lading, if issued, or otherwise in any other document evidencing the contract of carriage by sea, as packed in such article of transport are deemed packages or shipping units. Except as aforesaid the goods in such article of transport are deemed one shipping unit. 
 (b)	In cases where the article of transport itself has been lost or damaged, that article of transport, if not owned or otherwise supplied by the carrier, is considered one separate shipping unit. 
 3.	Unit of account means the unit of account mentioned in article 26\. 
 4.	By agreement between the carrier and the shipper, limits of liability exceeding those provided for in paragraph 1&#160;may be fixed. 

<center>Back to Top</center>

<center><u>Article 7.	Application to non-contractual claims </u></center>

1.	The defences and limits of liability provided for in this Convention apply in any action against the carrier in respect of loss or damage to the goods covered by the contract of carriage by sea, as well as of delay in delivery whether the action is founded in contract, in tort or otherwise. 
 2.	If such an action is brought against a servant or agent of the carrier, such servant or agent, if he proves that he acted within the scope of his employment, is entitled to avail himself of the defences and limits of liability which the carrier is entitled to invoke under this Convention. 
 3.	Except as provided in article 8, the aggregate of the amounts recoverable from the carrier and from any persons referred to in paragraph 2 of this article shall not exceed the limits of liability provided for in this Convention. 

<center><u>Article 8.	Loss of right to limit responsibility </u></center>

1.	The carrier is not entitled to the benefit of the limitation of liability provided for in article 6 if it is proved that the loss, damage or delay in delivery resulted from an act or omission of the carrier done with the intent to cause such loss, damage or delay, or recklessly and with knowledge that such loss, damage or delay would probably result. 
 2.	Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 of article 7, a servant or agent of the carrier is not entitled to the benefit of the limitation of liability provided for in article 6 if it is proved that the loss, damage or delay in delivery resulted from an act or omission of such servant or agent, done with the intent to cause such loss, damage or delay, or recklessly and with knowledge that such loss, damage or delay would probably result. 

<center><u>Article 9.	Deck cargo </u></center>

1.	The carrier is entitled to carry the goods on deck only if such carriage is in accordance with an agreement with the shipper or with the usage of the particular trade or is required by statutory rules or regulations. 
 2.	If the carrier and the shipper have agreed that the goods shall or may be carried on deck, the carrier must insert in the bill of lading or other document evidencing the contract of carriage by sea a statement to that effect. In the absence of such a statement the carrier has the burden of proving that an agreement for carriage on deck has been entered into; however, the carrier is not entitled to invoke such an agreement against a third party, including a consignee, who has acquired the bill of lading in good faith. 
 3.	Where the goods have been carried on deck contrary to the provisions of paragraph 1 of this article or where the carrier may not under paragraph 2 of this article invoke an agreement for carriage on deck, the carrier, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of article 5, is liable for loss of or damage to the goods, as well as for delay in delivery, resulting solely from the carriage on deck, and the extent of his liability is to be determined in accordance with the provisions of article 6 or article 8 of this Convention, as the case may be. 
 4.	Carriage of goods on deck contrary to express agreement for carriage under deck is deemed to be an act or omission of the carrier within the meaning of article 8.

<center><u>Article 10.	Liability of the carrier and actual carrier </u></center>

1.	Where the performance of the carriage or part thereof has been entrusted to an actual carrier, whether or not in pursuance of a liberty under the contract of carriage by sea to do so, the carrier nevertheless remains responsible for the entire carriage according to the provisions of this Convention. The carrier is responsible, in relation to the carriage performed by the actual carrier, for the acts and omissions of the actual carrier and of his servants and agents acting within the scope of their employment.
 2.	All the provisions of this Convention governing the responsibility of the carrier also apply to the responsibility of the actual carrier for the carriage performed by him. The provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 of article 7 and of paragraph 2 of article 8 apply if an action is brought against a servant or agent of the actual carrier. 
 3.	Any special agreement under which the carrier assumes obligations not imposed by this Convention or waives rights conferred by this Convention affects the actual carrier only if agreed to by him expressly and in writing. Whether or not the actual carrier has so agreed, the carrier nevertheless remains bound by the obligations or waivers resulting from such special agreement. 
 4.	Where and to the extent that both the carrier and the actual carrier are liable, their liability is joint and several. 
 5.	The aggregate of the amounts recoverable from the carrier, the actual carrier and their servants and agents shall not exceed the limits of liability provided for in this Convention. 
 6.	Nothing in this article shall prejudice any right of recourse as between the carrier and the actual carrier. 

<center><u>Article 11.	Through carriage </u></center>

1.	Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of article 10, where a contract of carriage by sea provides explicitly that a specified part of the carriage covered by the said contract is to be performed by a named person other than the carrier, the contract may also provide that the carrier is not liable for loss, damage or delay in delivery caused by an occurrence which 
<center>Back to Top</center>
 takes place while the goods are in the charge of the actual carrier during such part of the carriage. Nevertheless, any stipulation limiting or excluding such liability is without effect if no judicial proceedings can be instituted against the actual carrier in a court competent under paragraph 1 or 2 of article 21\. The burden of proving that any loss, damage or delay in delivery has been caused by such an occurrence rests upon the carrier. 
 2.	The actual carrier is responsible in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2 of article 10 for loss, damage or delay in delivery caused by an occurrence which takes place while the goods are in his charge. 

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<center>PART III. LIABILITY OF THE SHIPPER</center>

 </dl></dl>

<center><u>Article 12.	General rule </u></center>

The shipper is not liable for loss sustained by the carrier or the actual carrier, or for damage sustained by the ship, unless such loss or damage was caused by the fault or neglect of the shipper, his servants or agents. Nor is any servant or agent of the shipper liable for such loss or damage unless the loss or damage was caused by fault or neglect on his part. 

<center><u>Article 13.	Special rules on dangerous goods </u></center>

1.	The shipper must mark or label in a suitable manner dangerous goods as dangerous. 
 2.	Where the shipper hands over dangerous goods to the carrier or an actual carrier, as the case may be, the shipper must inform him of the dangerous character of the goods and, if necessary, of the precautions to be taken. If the shipper fails to do so and such carrier or actual carrier does not otherwise have knowledge of their dangerous character: 
 (a)	the shipper is liable to the carrier and any actual carrier for the loss resulting from the shipment of such goods, and 
 (b)	the goods may at any time be unloaded, destroyed or rendered innocuous, as the circumstances may require, without payment of compensation. 
 3.	The provisions of paragraph 2 of this article may not be invoked by any person if during the carriage he has taken the goods in his charge with knowledge of their dangerous character. 
 4.	If, in cases where the provisions of paragraph 2, subparagraph&#160;(b), of this article do not apply or may not be invoked, dangerous goods become an actual danger to life or property, they may be unloaded, destroyed or rendered innocuous, as the circumstances may require, without payment of compensation except where there is an obligation to contribute in general average or where the carrier is liable in accordance with the provisions of article 5.

<center>PART IV. TRANSPORT DOCUMENTS</center>
 <center><u>Article 14.	Issue of bill of lading </u></center>

1.	When the carrier or the actual carrier takes the goods in his charge, the carrier must, on demand of the shipper, issue to the shipper a bill of lading. 
 2.	The bill of lading may be signed by a person having authority from the carrier. A bill of lading signed by the master of the ship carrying the goods is deemed to have been signed on behalf of the carrier. 
 3.	The signature on the bill of lading may be in handwriting, printed in facsimile, perforated, stamped, in symbols, or made by any other mechanical or electronic means, if not inconsistent with the law of the country where the bill of lading is issued. 

<center><u>Article 15.	Contents of bill of lading </u></center>

1.	The bill of lading must include, <u>inter alia</u>, the following particulars: 
 (a)	the general nature of the goods, the leading marks necessary for identification of the goods, an express statement, if applicable, as to the dangerous character of the goods, the number of packages or pieces, and the weight of the goods or their quantity otherwise expressed, all such particulars as furnished by the shipper; 
 (b)	the apparent condition of the goods; 
 (c)	the name and principal place of business of the carrier; 
 (d)	the name of the shipper; 
 (e)	the consignee if named by the shipper; 
 (f)	the port of loading under the contract of carriage by sea and the date on which the goods were taken over by the carrier at the port of loading; 
 (g)	the port of discharge under the contract of carriage by sea;
 (h)	the number of originals of the bill of lading, if more than one; 
 (i)	the place of issuance of the bill of lading; 
 (j)	the signature of the carrier or a person acting on his behalf; 
 (k)	the freight to the extent payable by the consignee or other indication that freight is payable by him; 
 (l)	the statement referred to in paragraph 3 of article 23; 
 (m)	the statement, if applicable, that the goods shall or may be carried on deck; 
 (n)	the date or the period of delivery of the goods at the port of discharge if expressly agreed upon between the parties; and 
 (o)	any increased limit or limits of liability where agreed in accordance with paragraph 4 of article 6\. 
 2.	After the goods have been loaded on board, if the shipper so demands, the 
<center>Back to Top</center>
 carrier must issue to the shipper a "shipped" bill of lading which, in addition to the particulars required under paragraph 1 of this article, must state that the goods are on board a named ship or ships, and the date or dates of loading. If the carrier has previously issued to the shipper a bill of lading or other document of title with respect to any of such goods, on request of the carrier, the shipper must surrender such document in exchange for a "shipped" bill of lading. The carrier may amend any previously issued document in order to meet the shipper's demand for a "shipped" bill of lading if, as amended, such document includes all the information required to be contained in a "shipped" bill of lading.
 3.	The absence in the bill of lading of one or more particulars referred to in this article does not affect the legal character of the document as a bill of lading provided that it nevertheless meets the requirements set out in paragraph 7 of article 1.

<center><u>Article 16.	Bills of lading: reservations and evidentiary effect</u></center>

1.	If the bill of lading contains particulars concerning the general nature, leading marks, number of packages or pieces, weight or quantity of the goods which the carrier or other person issuing the bill of lading on his behalf knows or has reasonable grounds to suspect do not accurately represent the goods actually taken over or, where a "shipped" bill of lading is issued, loaded, or if he had no reasonable means of checking such particulars, the carrier or such other person must insert in the bill of lading a reservation specifying these inaccuracies, grounds of suspicion or the absence of reasonable means of checking.
 2.	If the carrier or other person issuing the bill of lading on his behalf fails to note on the bill of lading the apparent condition of the goods, he is deemed to have noted on the bill of lading that the goods were in apparent good condition.
 3.	Except for particulars in respect of which and to the extent to which a reservation permitted under paragraph 1 of this article has been entered:
 (a)	the bill of lading is <u>prima facie</u> evidence of the taking over or, where a "shipped" bill of lading is issued, loading, by the carrier of the goods as described in the bill of lading; and
 (b)	proof to the contrary by the carrier is not admissible if the bill of lading has been transferred to a third party, including a consignee, who in good faith has acted in reliance on the description of the goods therein.
 4.	A bill of lading which does not, as provided in paragraph 1, subparagraph&#160;(k) of article 15, set forth the freight or otherwise indicate that freight is payable by the consignee or does not set forth demurrage incurred at the port of loading payable by the consignee, is <u>prima facie</u> evidence that no freight or such demurrage is payable by him. However, proof to the contrary by the carrier is not admissible when the bill of lading has been transferred to a third party, including a consignee, who in good faith has acted in reliance on the absence in the bill of lading of any such indication. 

<center><u>Article 17.	Guarantees by the shipper</u><cite> </cite></center>

1.	The shipper is deemed to have guaranteed to the carrier the accuracy of particulars relating to the general nature of the goods, their marks, number, weight and quantity as furnished by him for insertion in the bill of lading. The shipper must indemnify the carrier against the loss resulting from inaccuracies in such particulars. The shipper remains liable even if the bill of lading has been transferred by him. The right of the carrier to such indemnity in no way limits his liability under the contract of carriage by sea to any person other than the shipper. 
 2.	Any letter of guarantee or agreement by which the shipper undertakes to indemnify the carrier against loss resulting from the issuance of the bill of lading by the carrier, or by a person acting on his behalf, without entering a reservation relating to particulars furnished by the shipper for insertion in the bill of lading, or to the apparent condition of the goods, is void and of no effect as against any third party, including a consignee, to whom the bill of lading has been transferred. 
 3.	Such letter of guarantee or agreement is valid as against the shipper unless the carrier or the person acting on his behalf, by omitting the reservation referred to in paragraph 2 of this article, intends to defraud a third party, including a consignee, who acts in reliance on the description of the goods in the bill of lading. In the latter case, if the reservation omitted relates to particulars furnished by the shipper for insertion in the bill of lading, the carrier has no right of indemnity from the shipper pursuant to paragraph 1 of this article. 
 4.	In the case of intended fraud referred to in paragraph 3 of this article the carrier is liable, without the benefit of the limitation of liability provided for in this Convention, for the loss incurred by a third party, including a consignee, because he has acted in reliance on the description of the goods in the bill of lading. 

<center><u>Article 18.	Documents other than bills of lading </u></center>

Where a carrier issues a document other than a bill of lading to evidence the receipt of the goods to be carried, such a document is <u>prima facie</u> evidence of the conclusion of the contract of carriage by sea and the taking 
<center>Back to Top</center>
 over by the carrier of the goods as therein described. 

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<center>PART V. CLAIMS AND ACTIONS</center>

 </dl></dl>

<center><u>Article 19.	Notice of loss, damage or delay </u></center>

1.	Unless notice of loss or damage, specifying the general nature of such loss or damage, is given in writing by the consignee to the carrier not later than the working day after the day when the goods were handed over to the consignee, such handing over is <u>prima facie</u> evidence of the delivery by the carrier of the goods as described in the document of transport or, if no such document has been issued, in good condition. 
 2.	Where the loss or damage is not apparent, the provisions of paragraph 1 of this article apply correspondingly if notice in writing is not given within 15 consecutive days after the day when the goods were handed over to the consignee. 
 3.	If the state of the goods at the time they were handed over to the consignee has been the subject of a joint survey or inspection by the parties, notice in writing need not be given of loss or damage ascertained during such survey or inspection. 
 4.	In the case of any actual or apprehended loss or damage the carrier and the consignee must give all reasonable facilities to each other for inspecting and tallying the goods. 
 5.	No compensation shall be payable for loss resulting from delay in delivery unless a notice has been given in writing to the carrier within 60 consecutive days after the day when the goods were handed over to the consignee. 
 6.	If the goods have been delivered by an actual carrier, any notice given under this article to him shall have the same effect as if it had been given to the carrier, and any notice given to the carrier shall have effect as if given to such actual carrier. 
 7.	Unless notice of loss or damage, specifying the general nature of the loss or damage, is given in writing by the carrier or actual carrier to the shipper not later than 90 consecutive days after the occurrence of such loss or damage or after the delivery of the goods in accordance with paragraph 2 of article 4, whichever is later, the failure to give such notice is <u>prima facie</u> evidence that the carrier or the actual carrier has sustained no loss or damage due to the fault or neglect of the shipper, his servants or agents. 
 8.	For the purpose of this article, notice given to a person acting on the carrier's or the actual carrier's behalf, including the master or the officer in charge of the ship, or to a person acting on the shipper's behalf is deemed to have been given to the carrier, to the actual carrier or to the shipper, respectively. 

<center><u>Article 20.	Limitation of actions </u></center>

1.	Any action relating to carriage of goods under this Convention is time-barred if judicial or arbitral proceedings have not been instituted within a period of two years. 
 2.	The limitation period commences on the day on which the carrier has delivered the goods or part thereof or, in cases where no goods have been delivered, on the last day on which the goods should have been delivered. 
 3.	The day on which the limitation period commences is not included in the period. 
 4.	The person against whom a claim is made may at any time during the running of the limitation period extend that period by a declaration in writing to the claimant. This period may be further extended by another declaration or declarations. 
 5.	An action for indemnity by a person held liable may be instituted even after the expiration of the limitation period provided for in the preceding paragraphs if instituted within the time allowed by the law of the State where proceedings are instituted. However, the time allowed shall not be less than 90 days commencing from the day when the person instituting such action for indemnity has settled the claim or has been served with process in the action against himself. 

<center><u>Article 21.	Jurisdiction </u></center>

1.	In judicial proceedings relating to carriage of goods under this Convention the plaintiff, at his option, may institute an action in a court which, according to the law of the State where the court is situated, is competent and within the jurisdiction of which is situated one of the following places: 
 (a)	the principal place of business or, in the absence thereof, the habitual residence of the defendant; or 
 (b)	the place where the contract was made provided that the defendant has there a place of business, branch or agency through which the contract was made; or 
 (c)	the port of loading or the port of discharge; or 
 (d)	any additional place designated for that purpose in the contract of carriage by sea.
 2.(a)	Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this article, an action may be instituted in the courts of any port or place in a Contracting State at which the carrying vessel or any other vessel of the same ownership may have been arrested in accordance with applicable rules of the law of that State and 
<center>Back to Top</center>
 of international law. However, in such a case, at the petition of the defendant, the claimant must remove the action, at his choice, to one of the jurisdictions referred to in paragraph 1 of this article for the determination of the claim, but before such removal the defendant must furnish security sufficient to ensure payment of any judgement that may subsequently be awarded to the claimant in the action. 
 (b)	All questions relating to the sufficiency or otherwise of the security shall be determined by the court of the port or place of the arrest. 
 3.	No judicial proceedings relating to carriage of goods under this Convention may be instituted in a place not specified in paragraph 1 or 2 of this article. The provisions of this paragraph do not constitute an obstacle to the jurisdiction of the Contracting States for provisional or protective measures. 
 4.(a)	Where an action has been instituted in a court competent under paragraph 1 or 2 of this article or where judgement has been delivered by such a court, no new action may be started between the same parties on the same grounds unless the judgement of the court before which the first action was instituted is not enforceable in the country in which the new proceedings are instituted; 
 (b)	for the purpose of this article the institution of measures with a view to obtaining enforcement of a judgement is not to be considered as the starting of a new action; 
 (c)	for the purpose of this article, the removal of an action to a different court within the same country, or to a court in another country, in accordance with paragraph 2(a) of this article, is not to be considered as the starting of a new action. 
 5.	Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding paragraphs, an agreement made by the parties, after a claim under the contract of carriage by sea has arisen, which designates the place where the claimant may institute an action, is effective. 

<center><u>Article 22	Arbitration </u></center>

1.	Subject to the provisions of this article, parties may provide by agreement evidenced in writing that any dispute that may arise relating to carriage of goods under this Convention shall be referred to arbitration. 
 2.	Where a charter-party contains a provision that disputes arising thereunder shall be referred to arbitration and a bill of lading issued pursuant to the charter-party does not contain a special annotation providing that such provision shall be binding upon the holder of the bill of lading, the carrier may not invoke such provision as against a holder having acquired the bill of lading in good faith. 
 3.	The arbitration proceedings shall, at the option of the claimant, be instituted at one of the following places: 

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>a place in a State within whose territory is situated: </dd> <dt>(i)</dt><dd>the principal place of business of the defendant or, in the absence thereof, the habitual residence of the defendant; or </dd> <dt>(ii)</dt><dd>the place where the contract was made, provided that the defendant has there a place of business, branch or agency through which the contract was made; or </dd> <dt>(iii)</dt><dd>the port of loading or the port of discharge; or </dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>any place designated for that purpose in the arbitration clause or agreement. </dd> </dl></dl>

4.	The arbitrator or arbitration tribunal shall apply the rules of this Convention. 
 5.	The provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 of this article are deemed to be part of every arbitration clause or agreement, and any term of such clause or agreement which is inconsistent therewith is null and void. 
 6.	Nothing in this article affects the validity of an agreement relating to arbitration made by the parties after the claim under the contract of carriage by sea has arisen. 

<center>PART VI. SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISIONS</center>
 <center><u>Article 23	Contractual stipulations </u></center>

1.	Any stipulation in a contract of carriage by sea, in a bill of lading, or in any other document evidencing the contract of carriage by sea is null and void to the extent that it derogates, directly or indirectly, from the provisions of this Convention. The nullity of such a stipulation does not affect the validity of the other provisions of the contract or document of which it forms a part. A clause assigning benefit of insurance of the goods in favour of the carrier, or any similar clause, is null and void. 
 2.	Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of this article, a carrier may increase his responsibilities and obligations under this Convention. 
 3.	Where a bill of lading or any other document evidencing the contract of carriage by sea is issued, it must contain a statement that the carriage is subject to the provisions of this Convention which nullify any stipulation derogating therefrom to the detriment of the shipper or the consignee. 
 4.	Where the claimant in respect of the goods has incurred loss as a result of a stipulation which is null and void by virtue of the present article, or as a result of the omission of the statement referred to in paragraph 3 of this 
<center>Back to Top</center>
 article, the carrier must pay compensation to the extent required in order to give the claimant compensation in accordance with the provisions of this Convention for any loss of or damage to the goods as well as for the delay in delivery. The carrier must, in addition, pay compensation for costs incurred by the claimant for the purpose of exercising his right, provided that costs incurred in the action where the foregoing provision is invoked are to be determined in accordance with the law of the State where proceedings are instituted. 

<center><u>Article 24.	General average</u><cite> </cite></center>

1.	Nothing in this Convention shall prevent the application of provisions in the contract of carriage by sea or national law regarding the adjustment of general average. 
 2.	With the exception of article 20, the provisions of this Convention relating to the liability of the carrier for loss of or damage to the goods also determine whether the consignee may refuse contribution in general average and the liability of the carrier to indemnify the consignee in respect of any such contribution made or any salvage paid. 

<center><u>Article 25.	Other conventions </u></center>

1.	This Convention does not modify the rights or duties of the carrier, the actual carrier and their servants and agents, provided for in international conventions or national law relating to the limitation of liability of owners of seagoing ships. 
 2.	The provisions of articles 21 and 22 of this Convention do not prevent the application of the mandatory provisions of any other multilateral convention already in force at the date of this Convention relating to matters dealt with in the said articles, provided that the dispute arises exclusively between parties having their principal place of business in States members of such other convention. However, this paragraph does not affect the application of paragraph 4 of article 22 of this Convention. 
 3.	No liability shall arise under the provisions of this Convention for damage caused by a nuclear incident if the operator of a nuclear installation is liable for such damage: 
 (a)	under either the Paris Convention of 29&#160;July 1960 on Third Party Liability in the Field of Nuclear Energy as amended by the Additional Protocol of 28&#160;January 1964 or the Vienna Convention of 21&#160;May 1963 on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage, or 
 (b)	by virtue of national law governing the liability for such damage, provided that such law is in all respects as favourable to persons who may suffer damage as either the Paris or Vienna Conventions. 
 4.	No liability shall arise under the provisions of this Convention for any loss of or damage to or delay in delivery of luggage for which the carrier is responsible under any international convention or national law relating to the carriage of passengers and their luggage by sea. 
 5.	Nothing contained in this Convention prevents a Contracting State from applying any other international convention which is already in force at the date of this Convention and which applies mandatorily to contracts of carriage of goods primarily by a mode of transport other than transport by sea. This provision also applies to any subsequent revision or amendment of such international convention. 

<center><u>Article 26.	Unit of account</u><cite> </cite></center>

1.	The unit of account referred to in article 6 of this Convention is the Special Drawing Right as defined by the International Monetary Fund. The amounts mentioned in article 6 are to be converted into the national currency of a State according to the value of such currency at the date of judgement or the date agreed upon by the parties. The value of a national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a Contracting State which is a member of the International Monetary Fund is to be calculated in accordance with the method of valuation applied by the International Monetary Fund in effect at the date in question for its operations and transactions. The value of a national currency in terms of the Special Drawing Right of a Contracting State which is not a member of the International Monetary Fund is to be calculated in a manner determined by that State. 
 2.	Nevertheless, those States which are not members of the International Monetary Fund and whose law does not permit the application of the provisions of paragraph 1 of this article may, at the time of signature, or at the time of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession or at any time thereafter, declare that the limits of liability provided for in this Convention to be applied in their territories shall be fixed as:
 12,500 monetary units per package or other shipping unit or 37.5 monetary units per kilogramme of gross weight of the goods. 
 3.	The monetary unit referred to in paragraph 2 of this article corresponds to sixty-five and a half milligrammes of gold of millesimal fineness nine hundred. The conversion of the amounts referred to in paragraph 2 into the national currency is to be made according to the law of the State concerned. 
 4.	The calculation mentioned in the last sentence of paragraph 1 and the conversion mentioned in paragraph 3 of this article is to be made in such a manner as to express in the national currency of the Contracting State as far as possible the same real value for the amounts in article 6 as is expressed there in units of account. Contracting States must communicate to the depositary the manner of calculation pursuant to paragraph 1 of this article, 
<center>Back to Top</center>
 or the result of the conversion mentioned in paragraph 3 of this article, as the case may be, at the time of signature or when depositing their instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, or when availing themselves of the option provided for in paragraph 2 of this article and whenever there is a change in the manner of such calculation or in the result of such conversion.

<center>ANNEX II</center>
 <center>COMMON UNDERSTANDING ADOPTED BY THE UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE ON THE CARRIAGE OF GOODS BY SEA</center>

It is the common understanding that the liability of the carrier under this Convention is based on the principle of presumed fault or neglect. This means that, as a rule, the burden of proof rests on the carrier but, with respect to certain cases, the provisions of the Convention modify this rule.
