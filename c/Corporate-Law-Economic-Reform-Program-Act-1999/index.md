_Acquisition of relevant interests in voting shares through transaction entered into by or on behalf of person acquiring relevant interest_

However, the person may acquire the relevant interest under one of the exceptions set out in section 611 without contravening this subsection.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note 1:	Section 9 defines _company_ as meaning a

company incorporated, or taken to have been incorporated, in this

jurisdiction. Note 2:	Section 607 deals with the effect of a contravention of this section on transactions. Sections 608 and 609 deal with the meaning of _relevant_ _interest_. Section 610 deals with the calculation of a person's voting power in a company. Note 3:	If the acquisition of relevant interests in an unlisted company with 50 or fewer members leads to the acquisition of a relevant interest in another company that is an unlisted company with more than 50 members, or a listed company, the acquisition is caught by this section because of its effect on that other company.  </dl></dl>

_Acquisition of legal or equitable interest giving rise to relevant interest for someone else_

<dl compact="">

However, if the acquisition of the relevant interest is covered by one of the exceptions set out in section 611, the person may acquire the legal or equitable interest without contravening this subsection.

_50 member threshold_

<dl compact="">

<dt>(3)</dt><dd>In determining whether the company has more than 50 members for the

purposes of subsection (1) or (2), count joint holders of a particular parcel

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>because the person was not aware of a relevant fact or occurrence.

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

<center>Back to Top</center>

In determining whether the defence is available, disregard the person's ignorance of, or a mistake on the person's part concerning, a matter of law.

_Extended meaning of acquiring relevant interestsconversions and increases in voting rights_

<dl compact="">

<dt>(6)</dt><dd>A person is taken for the purposes of subsection (1) or (2) to acquire a

relevant interest in voting shares in a company if:

</dd> </dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>securities in which the person already had a relevant interest become

voting shares in the company; or</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>there is an increase in the number of votes that may be cast on a poll

attached to voting shares that the person already had a relevant interest in.

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

The acquisition occurs when the securities become voting shares or the number of votes increases.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note:	Some examples of cases to which this subsection applies are:

 </dl></dl>

*	A person exercises a right to convert a non-voting preference share into an ordinary share that carries votes.
 *	A person pays up partly-paid shares with limited votes and this leads to an increase in the number of votes attached to the shares.

607  Effect on transactions

<dl compact="">

		A transaction is not invalid merely because it involves a contravention of

section 606.

 </dl>

608  Relevant interests in securities

_Basic rulerelevant interest is holding, or controlling voting or disposal of, securities_

<dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>A person has a relevant interest in securities if they:

</dd> </dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>are the holder of the securities; or</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>have power to exercise, or control the exercise of, a right to vote

attached to the securities; or</dd>

<dt>(c)</dt><dd>have power to dispose of, or control the exercise of a power to dispose

of, the securities.

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

It does not matter how remote the relevant interest is or how it arises. If 2 or more people can jointly exercise one of these powers, each of them is taken to have that power. 

_Extension to control exercisable through a trust, agreement or practice_

<dl compact="">

<dt>(2)</dt><dd>In this section, power or control includes:

</dd> </dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

</dl></dl></dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

		whether or not they are enforceable; and

<dt>(c)</dt><dd>power or control that is, or can be made, subject to restraint or

restriction.

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

It does not matter whether the power or control is express or implied, formal or informal, exercisable alone or jointly with someone else. It does not matter that the power or control cannot be related to a particular security.

_Extension to relevant interests held through bodies corporate_

_Nominees and other trustees_

<dl compact="">

<dt>(2)</dt><dd>A person who would otherwise have a relevant interest in securities as a

bare trustee does not have a relevant interest in the securities if a

where:

<def><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

_person&apos;s and associates&apos; votes_ is the total number of votes

attached to all the voting shares in the body corporate (if any) that the

person or an associate has a relevant interest in. _total votes in body corporate_ is the total number of votes attached to all voting shares in the body corporate.  </dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note:	Even if a person's relevant interest in voting shares is

based on control over disposal of the shares (rather than control over voting

rights attached to the shares), their voting power in the body corporate is

calculated on the basis of the number of votes attached to those shares.

 </dl></dl>

_Counting votes_

<dl compact="">

<dt>(2)</dt><dd>For the purposes of this section, the number of votes attached to a voting

share in a body corporate is the maximum number of votes that can be cast in

respect of the share on a poll:

</dd> </dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>if the election of directors is determined by the casting of votes

attached to voting shares&#151;on the election of a director of the body corporate;

or</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>if the election of directors is not determined by the casting of votes

attached to voting shares&#151;on the adoption of a constitution for the body

corporate or the amendment of the body corporate's constitution.

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note:	The Corporations and Securities Panel may decide that the

setting or varying of voting rights in a way that affects control of a body

corporate is unacceptable circumstances under section 657A.

<dl compact="">

<dt>(3)</dt><dd>If:

</dd> </dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>a transaction in relation to, or an acquisition of an interest in,

securities occurs; and</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>before the transaction or acquisition, a person did not have a relevant

interest in particular voting shares but an associate of the person did have a

relevant interest in those shares; and</dd>

<dt>(c)</dt><dd>because of the transaction or acquisition, the person acquires a relevant

interest in those shares;

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

then, for the purposes of applying section 606 to the transaction or acquisition, the person's voting power is taken to have increased because of the transaction or acquisition from what it would have been before the transaction or acquisition if the votes attached to those shares were disregarded to what it was after the transaction or acquisition (taking the votes attached to those shares into account).

Part 6.3&#151;The different types of takeover bid
