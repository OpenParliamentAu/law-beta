             (6)  A constable or Commonwealth officer may use a returnable item for any other use that is required or authorised by or under a law of a State or a Territory.

Section does not limit any other law of the Commonwealth

             (7)  To avoid doubt, this section does not limit any other law of the Commonwealth that:

                     (a)  requires or authorises the use of a document or other thing; or

                     (b)  requires or authorises the making available (however described) of a document or other thing.

Sharing returnable item for use by State, Territory or foreign agency

             (8)  The CEO may make a returnable item available to:

                     (a)  the making available to a State or Territory law enforcement agency of that State or Territory, for purposes mentioned in subsections (1), (6) and (8), of returnable items; and

                     (b)  the disposal by the agency of such items when they are no longer of use to that agency for those purposes.

Note:          This subsection does not empower the Minister to make such an arrangement.

##### <a id="24AB"></a>24AB  When returnable items must be returned

             (1)  If the CEO is satisfied that a returnable item is not required (or is no longer required) for a purpose mentioned in section 24AA or for other judicial or administrative review proceedings, the CEO must take reasonable steps to return the item to:

                     (b)  the owner, if the person mentioned in paragraph (a) is not entitled to possess it.

             (2)  However, the CEO does not have to take those steps if:

                     (a)  either:

                              (i)  the returnable item may be retained because of an order under subsection 24AC(2), or any other order under that subsection has been made in relation to the item; or

                             (ii)  the CEO has applied for such an order and the application has not been determined; or

                     (b)  the returnable item may otherwise be retained, destroyed or disposed of under a law, or an order of a court or tribunal, of the Commonwealth or of a State or a Territory; or

                     (c)  the returnable item is forfeited or forfeitable to the Commonwealth or is the subject of a dispute as to ownership.

             (3)  To avoid doubt, if the returnable item is a document, the CEO is required to take reasonable steps to return the document only if the ACC took possession of that document.

##### <a id="24AC"></a>24AC  Issuing officer may permit a returnable item to be retained, forfeited etc.

             (1)  An issuing officer may, on application by the CEO, make an order under subsection (2) in relation to a returnable item.

Preventing use in committing terrorist act, terrorism offence or serious offence

             (2)  The issuing officer may make any of the orders referred to in subsection (3) if the issuing officer is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that, if the returnable item is returned to either of the following persons, the item is likely to be used by that person or another person in the commission of a terrorist act, a terrorism offence or a serious offence:

                     (a)  the owner of the item;

                     (b)  the person from whom the item was seized, or the person who produced the item.

             (3)  The orders are as follows:

                     (a)  an order that the item may be retained for the period specified in the order;

                     (b)  an order that the item is forfeited to the Commonwealth;

                     (c)  if the item is not a document—an order that:

                              (i)  the item be sold and the proceeds given to the owner of the item; or

                             (ii)  the item be sold in some other way;

                     (d)  an order that the item is to be destroyed or otherwise disposed of.

Item must be returned if issuing officer not satisfied

             (4)  The issuing officer must order that the returnable item be returned to the following person if the issuing officer is not satisfied as mentioned in subsection (2):

                     (a)  the person from whom the item was seized, or the person who produced the item;

                     (b)  if the person referred to in paragraph (a) is not entitled to possess the item—the owner of the item.

CEO to notify persons with an interest in returnable item

             (5)  Before making the application, the CEO must:

                     (a)  take reasonable steps to discover who has an interest in the returnable item; and

                     (b)  if it is practicable to do so, notify each person who the CEO believes to have such an interest of the proposed application.

Person with interest may appear and be heard

             (6)  The issuing officer must allow a person who has an interest in the returnable item to appear and be heard in determining the application.

Function conferred in personal capacity

             (7)  A function of making an order under this section is conferred on an issuing officer in a personal capacity and not as a court or a member of a court.

             (8)  An issuing officer performing a function of, or connected with, making an order under this section has the same protection and immunity as if he or she were performing that function as, or as a member of, a court (being the court of which the issuing officer is a member).

                     (a)  the Federal Court;

                     (b)  the Supreme Court of the State or Territory in which the hearing is held.

             (2)  Before making the application, the Integrity Commissioner must inform the person that the Integrity Commissioner proposes to make the application.

             (3)  The application must be accompanied by a certificate that states:

                     (a)  the grounds for making the application; and

                     (b)  evidence in support of the application.

             (4)  A copy of the certificate must be given to the person before, or at the same time as, the application is made.

             (5)  To avoid doubt, if the Integrity Commissioner makes an application under this section, the Integrity Commissioner need not give the evidence to the relevant person or authority under section 142.

                     (a)  considering the matters specified in the certificate; and

                     (b)  hearing or receiving any evidence or statements by or in support of ACLEI; and

                     (c)  hearing or receiving any evidence or statements by or in support of the person;

the court to which the application was made finds that the person was in contempt of ACLEI, the court may deal with the person as if the acts or omissions involved constituted a contempt of that court.

             (7)  For the purposes of determining whether a person is in contempt of ACLEI under subsection (1), Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ applies as if:

                     (a)  being in contempt of ACLEI were an offence; and

                     (b)  references to a person being criminally responsible for an offence were references to a person being responsible for being in contempt of ACLEI.

##### <a id="96C"></a>96C  Conduct of contempt proceedings

             (1)  This section applies if an application is made to the Federal Court or to the Supreme Court of a State or Territory under section 96B.

             (3)  In proceedings relating to the application, a certificate under subsection 96B(3) is prima facie evidence of the matters specified in the certificate.

##### <a id="96D"></a>96D  Person in contempt may be detained

             (1)  If the Integrity Commissioner proposes to make an application under subsection 96B(1) in respect of a person, the Integrity Commissioner may, during the hearing concerned, direct a constable or an authorised officer to detain the person for the purpose of bringing the person before the relevant court for the hearing of the application.

             (2)  If the person is so detained:

                     (a)  the Integrity Commissioner must apply to the court as soon as practicable under subsection 96B(1) in respect of the person; and

                     (b)  the person must, subject to subsection (3) of this section, be brought before the court as soon as practicable.

             (3)  The court may:

                     (b)  order that the person continue to be detained until the application is determined.

                     (a)  that the person surrender his or her passport; or

                     (b)  that the person give an undertaking as to his or her living arrangements; or

                            (iii)  any other authority or person responsible for the enforcement of the laws of the Commonwealth or of the States.

the person must be released from detention immediately.

##### <a id="96F"></a>96F  Double jeopardy

             (1)  If an act or omission by a person is an offence against this Act and is also an offence against a law of a State, the person may be prosecuted and convicted under this Act or under that law of that State in respect of the act or omission, but nothing in this Act renders a person liable to be punished twice in respect of the same act or omission.

the person is not liable to be prosecuted for an offence in respect of that act or omission.

## 6  Sections 19AL and 19AM

Repeal the sections, substitute:

##### <a id="19AL"></a>19AL  Release on parole—making of parole order

             (1)  The Attorney‑General must, before the end of a non‑parole period fixed for one or more federal sentences imposed on a person, either make, or refuse to make, an order directing that the person be released from prison on parole (a **_parole order_**).

Note 1:       For when a person is released on parole in accordance with a parole order, see section 19AM.

Note 2:       A person released on parole must comply with any conditions of the parole order during the parole period (see sections 19AMA, 19AN and 19AU).

Note 3:       Subsection (4) of this section affects the operation of subsection (1) if the person will be serving a State or Territory sentence at the end of the non‑parole period.

             (2)  If the Attorney‑General refuses to make a parole order for a person under subsection (1) or paragraph (b) of this subsection, the Attorney‑General must:

                     (a)  give the person a written notice, within 14 days after the refusal, that:

                              (i)  informs the person of the refusal; and

                             (ii)  includes a statement of reasons for the refusal; and

                            (iii)  sets out the effect of paragraph (b) of this subsection; and

                     (b)  reconsider the making of a parole order for the person and either make, or refuse to make, such an order, within 12 months after the refusal.

             (3)  A parole order must:

                     (a)  be in writing; and

                     (b)  specify whether or not the person is to be released subject to supervision; and

                     (c)  if it is proposed that the supervision period for a person released on parole subject to supervision should end before the end of the person’s parole period—specify the day on which the supervision period ends.

             (4)  Despite subsection (1), if the person will be serving a State or Territory sentence on the day after the end of the non‑parole period, the requirement under that subsection to make, or refuse to make, a parole order does not apply:

                     (a)  for a federal sentence, or federal sentences, that do not include a life sentence—if the parole period would end while the person would still be imprisoned for the State or Territory offence; and

                     (b)  for a federal sentence, or federal sentences, that include a life sentence—until the release of the person from prison for the State or Territory offence (but a decision may be made under that subsection at any time during the 3 month period before the person’s expected release); and

                     (c)  in any case—if the State or Territory sentence is a life sentence for which a non‑parole period has not been fixed.

Note:          The effect of this subsection and subsection 19AM(2) is that a parole order may sometimes still be made for a person while the person is serving a State or Territory sentence, but the person will not be released in accordance with the parole order until the person is released from prison for the State or Territory sentence.

##### <a id="19AM"></a>19AM  Release on parole—when is a person released

             (1)  A person must be released from prison on parole in accordance with a parole order on whichever of the following days is applicable (subject to subsections (2) and (3) and 19AZD(2)):

                     (a)  for a parole order made before the end of the non‑parole period—the earlier of the following days:

                              (i)  the last day of the non‑parole period;

                             (ii)  an earlier day (if any) specified in the parole order for the purposes of this subparagraph (not being earlier than 30 days before the end of the non‑parole period);

                     (b)  for a parole order made after the end of the non‑parole period—the later of the following days:

                              (i)  the day after the parole order is made;

                             (ii)  a later day (if any) specified in the parole order for the purposes of this subparagraph (not being later than 30 days after the order is made).

Note 1:       Subsection (2) of this section provides a different release day if the person is imprisoned for a State or Territory offence on the release day that would otherwise apply under this subsection.

Note 2:       Subsection (3) requires the person to certify his or her acceptance of the parole order conditions before he or she may be released.

Note 3:       Subsection 19AZD(2) may allow a person to be released slightly earlier than the day that would otherwise apply under this subsection (for example if the release day would otherwise fall on a weekend or public holiday).

             (2)  However, if the person is imprisoned for a State or Territory offence on the day he or she would otherwise be eligible for release under subsection (1), the person must be released from prison on parole in accordance with the parole order on the same day he or she is released from prison (including on parole) for the State or Territory offence.

             (3)  Despite subsections (1) and (2), the person must not be released from prison on parole in accordance with the parole order unless, before, on or after the release day provided by subsection (1) or (2), the person certifies on the parole order (or a copy of the order) that he or she accepts the conditions to which the order is subject.

Note:          A person released on parole must comply with any conditions of the parole order during the parole period (see sections 19AN and 19AU).

##### <a id="19AMA"></a>19AMA  Release on parole—parole period

             (1)  For the purposes of this Part, the **_parole period_** for a person for whom a parole order has been made is the period starting in accordance with subsection (2) and ending in accordance with subsection (3).

Note:          A person released on parole must comply with any conditions of the parole order during the parole period (see sections 19AN and 19AU).

             (2)  The person’s parole period starts at the earlier of the following times:

                     (a)  when the person is released from prison on parole;

                     (b)  if the person is serving a State or Territory sentence at the time the parole order is made—when the person certifies on the parole order (or a copy of the order) that he or she accepts the conditions to which the order is subject.

             (3)  The person’s parole period ends:

                     (a)  at the end of the last day of any federal sentence that is, on the day of the release, being served or to be served (after deducting any remission or reduction that is applicable); or

                     (b)  if the person has been given a federal life sentence—at the later of the following times:

                              (i)  5 years after the person is released from prison on parole in accordance with section 19AM;

                             (ii)  the end of a later day (if any) specified in the parole order for the purposes of this subparagraph (not being a day earlier than 5 years after the person’s expected release from prison in accordance with the order).
