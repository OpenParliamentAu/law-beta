                     (b)  the payee elected in the relevant application for assessment of child support or the relevant application for acceptance of a child support agreement, as the case requires, not to have the liability enforced under this Act; or

                     (c)  the application giving rise to the child support assessment was made by the parent by whom child support is payable.

Note:          Section 25 allows a payee in this situation to apply for the liability to be registered.

##### <a id="25"></a>25  Application for registration of registrable maintenance liability

             (1)  The payee of a registrable maintenance liability that is not registered under this Act may apply to the Registrar, in the manner specified by the Registrar, for the registration of the liability under this Act.

          (1A)  If:

                     (a)  the payee is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction; and

                     (b)  the registrable maintenance liability is a registrable overseas maintenance liability that arises under an order made by, or registered in, a court of the reciprocating jurisdiction;

an application for the registration of the liability:

                     (c)  made by the payee and given to the Registrar by an overseas authority of the reciprocating jurisdiction; or

                     (d)  made by such an overseas authority on behalf of the payee;

is taken to be an application under subsection (1) if the Registrar is satisfied that it is appropriate to do so.

          (1B)  If:

                     (a)  the payee is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction; and

                     (b)  the registrable maintenance liability is a registrable overseas maintenance liability that does not arise under an order made by, or registered in, a court of the reciprocating jurisdiction;

an application for the registration of the liability is not taken to be an application under subsection (1) unless it is:

                     (c)  made by the payee and given to the Registrar by an overseas authority of the reciprocating jurisdiction; or

                     (d)  made by such an overseas authority on behalf of the payee.

          (1C)  If either the payer or the payee of a registrable maintenance liability that is not registered under this Act is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction, the payer may apply to the Registrar, in a manner specified by the Registrar, for the registration of the liability under this Act.

          (1D)  If the payer is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction, the application mentioned in subsection (1C) must be either:

                     (a)  made by the payer and given to the Registrar by an overseas authority of the reciprocating jurisdiction; or

                     (b)  made directly to the Registrar.

             (2)  Subject to subsection (3), if the Registrar receives an application from the payee or payer the Registrar must, within 28 days after receiving the application, register the liability under this Act by entering particulars of the liability in the Child Support Register.

          (2A)  However, if either the payer or the payee is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction, the Registrar has 90 days to register the liability, instead of 28 days.

          (2B)  The Registrar may refuse to register a registrable overseas maintenance liability if the Registrar is satisfied that the liability arises in a manner that is inconsistent with the international maintenance arrangement on which the payee relies.

          (2C)  If:

                     (a)  a registered maintenance liability relates to a particular child, a particular payer and a particular payee; and

                     (b)  a registrable maintenance liability:

                              (i)  that relates to the same child, payer and payee; and

                             (ii)  that arose before the registered maintenance liability arose;

                            first comes to the notice of the Registrar after the registration of the registered maintenance liability;

the Registrar must not register the registrable maintenance liability except for the purpose of facilitating the recovery of arrears under it.

          (2D)  A registrable maintenance liability that is registered to facilitate the recovery of arrears under it is to be treated for all other purposes as if it had not been registered.

             (3)  The Registrar must not register the liability if the payee has given notice, or is required to give notice, under subsection 23(2) in relation to the liability.

             (4)  The regulations may provide that this section applies in relation to collection agency maintenance liabilities only if specified conditions or restrictions are complied with or only in specified circumstances.

Note:          In relation to applications made under subsection (1) or (1C), section 16A provides for the Registrar to specify the manner in which the application may be made.

##### <a id="25A"></a>25A  Inclusion of certain liabilities in the Child Support Register

             (1)  A payee may apply to the Registrar for entry, in the Child Support Register, of the particulars of an overseas maintenance liability that is not a registrable overseas maintenance liability.

             (2)  An application must be made in the manner specified by the Registrar.

             (3)  In the absence of an application made in accordance with subsection (2), a document or documents given by the payee may be taken to be an application for entry of the particulars of an overseas maintenance liability if the Registrar is satisfied that it is appropriate to do so.

             (4)  The Registrar must, within 90 days after receiving an application, enter the particulars of the liability in the Child Support Register if the Registrar is satisfied that to do so would be consistent with the international maintenance arrangement on which the payee relies.

             (5)  The Registrar may refuse to register a maintenance assessment, order or agreement issued, made or registered in a foreign country that is a party to an international treaty and that is prescribed by the regulations if the payee is habitually resident in that country.

             (6)  For the purposes of this Act, a decision under this section is taken to be a decision in relation to a registrable maintenance liability.

##### <a id="25B"></a>25B  Effect of inclusion

             (1)  If the particulars of an overseas maintenance liability are entered in the Child Support Register under section 25A, an amount payable under the maintenance assessment, order or agreement that gives rise to the liability is a debt due to the payee.

             (2)  A debt due under this section is recoverable in a court of competent jurisdiction by the payee from the person who is liable to make payments under the liability.

##### <a id="25C"></a>25C  Limitation on inclusion of liabilities in Register

                   Despite anything else in this Division, the Registrar must not register a liability if neither the payee nor the payer is a resident of Australia.

Application of section

             (1)  This section applies to a registrable maintenance liability or an enforceable maintenance liability if the Registrar is to collect amounts due to the Commonwealth under, or in relation to, the liability by deduction from the salary or wages of the payer of the liability.

Object of section

             (2)  This section deals with the determination, in relation to a liability, of:

                     (a)  the payment period the Registrar must enter in the Child Support Register under paragraph 26(2)(b) as the period at which amounts are payable in respect of the liability (see subsection (3)); and

                     (b)  the day that the Registrar must enter in the Register under paragraph 26(2)(b) as the day from which a payment period (see subsection (4)) starts.

             (3)  If the Registrar is going to collect amounts due to the Commonwealth under a liability, or in relation to the liability, by deduction from the salary or wages of the payer, the period that the Registrar must enter in the Register is the payment period that reflects the payer’s pay cycle.

Example:    If a payer is paid weekly, the payment period the Registrar must enter in the Child Support Register will be a week. Similarly, if the payer is paid monthly, the payment period the Registrar must enter in the Register will be a calendar month or a month.

Note:          Part IV deals with collection by deduction from salary or wages.

Day from which a payment period starts

             (4)  The start day of the payment period referred to in subsection (3) in respect of the liability, is a day specified by the Registrar. The day that the Registrar must specify is the first day of the first of the payment periods in which deduction from the salary or wages of the payer will occur.

##### <a id="26B"></a>26B  Payment period to be entered in Register under paragraph 26(2)(b) if payer makes voluntary payments

Note:          For **_payment period_** see subsection 4(1).

Period that must be registered when liability to be paid voluntarily and election made

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  the Registrar is not going to collect amounts due to the Commonwealth under, or in relation to, a liability by deduction from the salary or wages of the payer of the liability; and

                     (b)  the payer makes an election that a payment period be entered in the Register as the period at which amounts are payable in respect of the liability; and

                     (c)  the Registrar is satisfied that the payment period elected by the payer will be a convenient payment period for the payer to accrue debts;

the Registrar must enter in the Register the elected period as the period at which amounts are payable in respect of the liability.

Day from which elected period starts

             (4)  In making an election under subsection (3), the payer must specify the day from which the payment period starts. The Registrar must enter in the Register the specified day as the day from which the elected period starts.

Example 1: The payer elects a 4 week period as the payment period. The payer elects that the start day of the period will be 8 July which is a Wednesday. Therefore the period will end 4 weeks later on a Tuesday.

Example 2: The payer elects a period of a month as the payment period. The payer elects that the start day will be 16 October. Therefore the period will end on 15 November. If the payer elects that the start day will be 31 January the period will end on 28 February.

Period that must be registered when liability to be paid voluntarily and no election is made or election is rejected

             (5)  If:

                     (a)  the Registrar is not going to collect amounts due to the Commonwealth under, or in relation to, a liability by deduction from the salary or wages of the payer of the liability; and

                     (b)  either:

                              (i)  the payer does not make an election under subsection (3); or

                             (ii)  the Registrar is not satisfied that the payment period elected by the payer will be a convenient payment period for the payer to accrue debts;

the Registrar must enter in the Register any payment period determined by the Registrar to be a convenient payment period for the payer to accrue debts as the period at which amounts are payable in respect of the liability.

Manner in which election is to be made

             (6)  An election made under subsection (3) must be made in the manner specified by the Registrar.

Note:          Section 16A provides for the Registrar to specify the manner in which an election may be made.

##### <a id="26C"></a>26C  Initial period that may be registered under paragraph 26(2)(a)

             (1)  If the Registrar is about to enter a period in the Child Support Register under subsection 26A(3) or 26B(3) in respect of a registrable maintenance liability or an enforceable maintenance liability, the Registrar may also enter in the Register an initial period under paragraph 26(2)(a) in respect of the liability.

When will the initial period start and end—Registrar about to enter liability

             (2)  If the Registrar is about to register the liability, the initial period starts on the day on which the liability first becomes enforceable under this Act and ends:

                     (a)  in the case of the Registrar entering in the Register a payment period under subsection 26A(3)—on the day before the start day specified by the Registrar under subsection 26A(4) in respect of the liability; or

                     (b)  in the case of the Registrar entering in the Register a payment period under subsection 26B(3)—on the day before the start day specified by the payer of the  liability under subsection 26B(4).

                     (a)  a low‑income non‑enforcement period in relation to a registered maintenance liability ends; and

                     (b)  the Registrar has varied the particulars of the Register as required by paragraph 37B(7)(1)(a) by specifying the end of the low‑income non‑enforcement period as the time at which the liability again becomes enforceable under this Act;

the initial period, in respect of the liability, starts on the day the Registrar has entered in the Register as the time at which the liability again becomes enforceable under this Act and ends:

                     (c)  in the case of the Registrar entering in the Register a payment period under subsection 26A(3)—on the day before the start day specified by the Registrar under subsection 26A(4) in respect of the liability; or

                     (d)  in the case of the Registrar entering in the Register a payment period under subsection 26B(3)—on the day before the start day specified by the payer of the liability  under subsection 26B(4).

                     (d)  in the case of the Registrar entering in the Register a payment period under subsection 26B(3)—on the day before the start day specified by the payer of the liability  under subsection 26B(4).

##### <a id="27"></a>27  Single entry in relation to all liabilities with same payer and payee

                   Where the payer and payee of a registrable maintenance liability are the same as the payer and payee of another registrable maintenance liability (whether or not the liabilities arise under the same child support assessment, court order or maintenance agreement and whether or not the liabilities are in relation to the maintenance of the same person), the Registrar may include particulars of the liabilities in the same entry in the Child Support Register.

##### <a id="28"></a>28  Day on which liability first becomes enforceable under Act

             (1)  A registered maintenance liability first becomes enforceable under this Act on whichever of the following days is applicable in relation to the liability:

                  (baa)  if the liability is registered under subsection 24(2)—such day as is determined, in writing, by the Registrar (being a day not earlier than the day on which the liability arose under, or was varied or otherwise affected by, the court order or maintenance agreement by virtue of which the liability is registered under that subsection);

                   (ba)  if the liability arose under a child support assessment and is registered under subsection 24A(1)—the day on and from which child support is payable under the assessment;

                     (c)  if the liability is registered under subsection 25(2)—such day as is determined, in writing, by the Registrar (being a day not later than 60 days after the day on which the Registrar receives, under subsection 25(1), the relevant duly completed form from the payee of the liability);

                     (e)  if the liability is an amount in arrears under a liability mentioned in subsection 18A(1) or (2) or paragraph 18A(3)(a)—the day on which the Registrar received the application for registration under this Act of the liability to which the arrears relate.

             (2)  If the Registrar registers a liability referred to in paragraph (1)(e), this Act has effect as if the amounts in arrears were payable under the liability in relation to the child support enforcement period that began on the day on which the liability first became enforceable under this Act as a result of the operation of that paragraph.

##### <a id="28A"></a>28A  Reversal of subsection 23(3) or 24A(2) election—collection of arrears

When section applies

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a payee applies under subsection 25(1) for registration of a registrable maintenance liability; and

                     (b)  the payee has, at any time before the making of the application, made an election under subsection 23(3) or 24A(2) in relation to the liability.

          (1A)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a payee applies under subsection 25(1) for registration of a registrable maintenance liability; and

                     (b)  the registrable maintenance liability arises under a child support assessment made because of an application by the payer.

Maximum arrears period

                     (a)  beginning at whichever is latest of the following times:

                              (i)  9 months before the liability first becomes enforceable under this Act as a result of the operation of paragraph 28(c);

                             (ii)  the beginning of the period to which the liability relates;

                            (iii)  the commencement of this section; and

                     (b)  ending at the time when the liability first becomes enforceable under this Act as a result of the operation of paragraph 28(c).

Application by payee for enforcement of arrears

             (3)  The payee may apply to the Registrar, in the manner specified by the Registrar, for any unpaid amounts payable under the liability in relation to a specified period to be treated as arrears amounts for the purposes of this section. The specified period must:

                     (a)  consist of, or be included in, the maximum arrears period; and

                     (b)  end at the end of the maximum arrears period.

Note:          Section 16A provides for the Registrar to specify the manner in which an application may be made.

Registrar’s decision—arrears for 3 months or less

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  the specified period does not exceed 3 months; and

                     (b)  the Registrar registers the liability under subsection 25(2);

the Registrar must grant the payee’s application.

Registrar’s decision—arrears for more than 3 months

             (5)  If:

                     (a)  the specified period exceeds 3 months; and

                     (b)  the Registrar registers the liability under subsection 25(2);

then:

                     (c)  if the Registrar is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances—the Registrar must grant the payee’s application; or

                     (d)  if:

                              (i)  the Registrar is not satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances; and

                             (ii)  unpaid amounts are payable under the liability in relation to the period of 3 months that ended at the end of the maximum arrears period;

                            the Registrar must:

                            (iii)  treat the payee’s application as if the specified period were the period of 3 months that ended at the end of the maximum arrears period; and

                            (iv)  grant the payee’s application; or

                     (e)  if:

                              (i)  the Registrar is not satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances; and

                             (ii)  no unpaid amounts are payable under the liability in relation to the period of 3 months that ended at the end of the maximum arrears period;

Consequences of successful application

             (6)  If the Registrar grants the payee’s application:

                     (a)  this Act has effect as if:

                              (i)  the unpaid amounts were payable under the liability in relation to the child support enforcement period that began on the day on which the liability first became enforceable under this Act as a result of the operation of paragraph 28(c); and

                             (ii)  the unpaid amounts became child support debts at the time when the liability became enforceable as a result of the operation of paragraph 28(c); and

                     (b)  the Registrar must make such variations to the particulars entered in the Child Support Register in relation to the liability as the Registrar considers necessary or desirable to give effect to this subsection.

Amounts that would have been credited under section 71C

             (7)  To avoid doubt, a reference in this section to an unpaid amount payable under a liability does not include a reference to any amount that would have been credited against that unpaid amount under section 71C if the liability had been an enforceable maintenance liability at all relevant times.

##### <a id="28B"></a>28B  Conversion of periodic amounts into payment rates in respect of payment periods

             (1)  The Registrar must convert a periodic amount payable under a registered maintenance liability arising under a court order or a maintenance agreement to:

                     (a)  a daily rate of payment; and

                     (b)  one of the following rates of payment:

                              (i)  weekly;

                             (ii)  fortnightly;

                            (iii)  4 weekly;

                            (iv)  monthly.

Note:          An amount payable under a registrable maintenance liability is entered on the Child Support Register under paragraph 26(1)(f).

             (2)  The Registrar must convert an amount payable under a registered maintenance liability arising under a child support assessment in respect of a day into one of the rates of payment set out in paragraph (1)(b).

             (3)  If the Registrar is to collect amounts due to the Commonwealth under, or in relation to, a liability by deduction from the salary or wages of the payer of the liability, the Registrar must convert the periodic amount or daily amount (as the case may be) to a weekly rate of payment.

             (4)  The rate of payment to which the Registrar must convert a periodic amount payable under a registered maintenance liability, is the rate that reflects the payment period entered in the Register under paragraph 26(2)(b) in respect of the liability.

Note 1:       For **_payment period_** see subsection 4(1).

Note 2:       Sections 26A, 26B and 42A and Part IVA deal with the determination of the period, and the start day for the period, that may be entered in the Child Support Register under paragraph 26(2)(b).

Note 3:       The particulars entered in the Child Support Register in respect of a liability must include the rates of payment provided for in this section (see paragraphs 26(2)(c) and (d)).

##### <a id="29"></a>29  Conversion of amounts payable under registrable maintenance liability into daily rates etc.

                   The regulations may make provision with respect to the conversion of amounts payable under registrable maintenance liabilities into daily, weekly, fortnightly, 4 weekly and monthly rates of payment.

##### <a id="30"></a>30  Effect of registration

             (1)  If a registrable maintenance liability is registered under this Act, amounts payable under the child support assessment, court order, maintenance agreement, maintenance order or maintenance assessment under which the liability arises are debts due to the Commonwealth by the payer in accordance with the particulars of the liability entered in the Child Support Register.

             (2)  In particular, the amounts are payable by the payer at the payment rate entered in the Register under paragraph 26(2)(d) in respect of the periods entered in the Register under paragraphs 26(2)(a) and (b).

Note:          Section 28B requires the Registrar to convert the periodic amount payable in respect of a registrable maintenance liability to a rate of payment depending upon the payment period determined in respect of the liability.

             (3)  If a registrable maintenance liability is registered under this Act, the payee of the liability is not entitled to, and may not enforce payment of, amounts payable under the liability other than by instituting a proceeding under section 113A to recover a debt due in relation to the liability.

##### <a id="30AA"></a>30AA  Rule to avoid dual liabilities

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a registrable maintenance liability (the **_first liability_**) relating, in whole or in part, to a particular child, and also relating to a particular payer and a particular payee, is registered; and

                     (b)  at any time after the registration of the first liability, a subsequent registrable maintenance liability relating, in whole or in part, to the same child, and also relating to the same payer and the same payee, is registered;

the first liability ceases, at the time the subsequent liability is registered, to have effect to the extent only that it relates to the particular child.

             (2)  Despite subsection (1), the first liability is treated, for the sole purpose of facilitating the recovery of arrears in respect of any period ending on or before it ceases to have effect, as if it had not ceased to have effect as provided in subsection (1).

##### <a id="30A"></a>30A  Enforcement of Australian liabilities overseas

             (1)  A payee may apply to the Registrar to have a maintenance order or agreement, or a child support assessment, enforced in a reciprocating jurisdiction (other than an excepted reciprocating jurisdiction in relation to such an order, agreement or assessment).

             (2)  For the purpose of having a maintenance order or agreement, or a child support assessment, enforced in a reciprocating jurisdiction (other than an excepted reciprocating jurisdiction in relation to such an order, agreement or assessment) the Registrar may, at any time, and must, as soon as practicable after a payee makes an application under subsection (1):

                     (a)  request, in writing, a judicial or administrative authority in the reciprocating jurisdiction to enforce the liability; and

                     (b)  in a case where there is an application by a payee under subsection (1)—give the application to the authority; and

                     (c)  give the authority such other documentation and information as is required by the authority for enforcement proceedings in that jurisdiction.

             (5)  For the purposes of subsection (4), a jurisdiction may be declared to be an excepted reciprocating jurisdiction, in relation to a maintenance order or agreement, or a child support assessment, only if the enforcement in the jurisdiction of such an order, agreement or assessment would not be permitted by the law of the jurisdiction.

             (6)  A request under subsection (2) is not a legislative instrument.

##### <a id="31"></a>31  Effect of registration on existing garnishment and attachment of earnings orders

                   Where, on the day on which a registered maintenance liability first becomes enforceable under this Act or again becomes enforceable under this Act, a garnishment or attachment of earnings order made by a court under the _Family Law Act 1975_, the _Matrimonial Causes Act 1959_ or the law of a State or Territory is in force in relation to the liability, the order ceases to have effect in so far as it relates to amounts payable under the liability in relation to the child support enforcement period.

                     (a)  enable the relevant order or maintenance agreement to be given effect to under this Act; or

                     (b)  take account of the happening of the relevant affecting event;

                   Where the Registrar amends a child support assessment under which a registrable maintenance liability arose, the Registrar must immediately make such variations (if any) to the particulars entered in the Child Support Register in relation to the liability as the Registrar considers necessary or desirable to enable the amendment to be given effect to under this Act.

##### <a id="37B"></a>37B  Registered maintenance liability not to be enforced if payer is a low‑income recipient of a social security pension or a social security benefit

Object

             (1)  The object of this section is to provide for the non‑enforcement of certain registered maintenance liabilities during the subsistence of a **_low‑income non‑enforcement period_**.

Payer may apply to have liability no longer enforced under Act

             (2)  If the payer of an enforceable maintenance liability covered by subsection 17(1) or arising under a maintenance order made by, or a maintenance agreement registered by, a judicial authority of a reciprocating jurisdiction:

                     (a)  is in receipt of a social security pension or a social security benefit; or

                     (b)  has made a claim for a social security pension or a social security benefit;

the payer may apply to the Registrar, in the manner specified by the Registrar, to have the liability no longer enforced under this Act.

Note:          Section 16A provides for the Registrar to specify the manner in which an application may be made.

Court orders etc. dealing with unemployment etc.

             (3)  The payer is not entitled to make an application under subsection (2) if:

                     (a)  the liability is covered by subparagraph 17(1)(b)(i); and

                     (b)  the court order or court registered maintenance agreement concerned provides, either directly or indirectly, for the reduction of amounts payable under the liability during periods when:

                              (i)  the payer is unemployed; or

                             (ii)  the payer’s income is substantially reduced.

Start of low‑income non‑enforcement period

             (4)  For the purposes of this section, if the payer of a registered maintenance liability:

                     (a)  makes an application under subsection (2); and

                     (b)  is taken, under the regulations, to satisfy the prescribed income test in relation to the first instalment of a social security pension or a social security benefit paid to the payer after the day on which the application was made;

a **_low‑income non‑enforcement period_** in relation to the liability:

                     (c)  begins on whichever of the following days is applicable:

                              (i)  the day on which the application was made;

                             (ii)  an earlier day determined by the Registrar, being a day that is on or after the day on which the payer commences to receive a social security pension or a social security benefit; and

                     (d)  continues until the time worked out under subsection (5).

End of low‑income non‑enforcement period

             (5)  For the purposes of this section, a **_low‑income non‑enforcement period_** in relation to a registered maintenance liability ends at whichever is the earliest of the following:

                     (a)  when the payer of the liability ceases to receive a social security pension or a social security benefit;

                     (b)  if the payer of the liability is taken, under the regulations, not to satisfy the prescribed income test in relation to an instalment of a social security pension or a social security benefit paid to the payer for a particular fortnight—the beginning of that fortnight;

                     (c)  when the liability ends.

Non‑enforcement of liability—variation of Child Support Register

             (6)  If a low‑income non‑enforcement period in relation to a registered maintenance liability begins, the Registrar must, as soon as practicable, vary the particulars entered in the Child Support Register in relation to the liability by specifying the beginning of the low‑income non‑enforcement period as the time at which the liability ceases to be enforceable under this Act. However, this rule does not apply if, immediately before the low‑income non‑enforcement period, the liability had already ceased to be enforceable under this Act because of section 38A, 38B or 39B.

Resumption of enforcement of liability—variation of Child Support Register

             (7)  If a low‑income non‑enforcement period in relation to a registered maintenance liability ends, the Registrar:

                     (a)  must, as soon as practicable, vary the particulars entered in the Child Support Register in relation to the liability by specifying the end of the low‑income non‑enforcement period as the time at which the liability again becomes enforceable under this Act; and

                     (b)  may make such variations (if any) to those particulars as the Registrar considers necessary or desirable:

                              (i)  to enable a court order or court registered maintenance agreement that varies or otherwise affects the liability to be given effect to under this Act; or

                             (ii)  to take account of the happening of an affecting event in relation to the liability.

However, these rules do not apply if, immediately before the low‑income non‑enforcement period, the liability had ceased to be enforceable under this Act because of section 38A, 38B or 39B.

Section not to prevent payee recovery of a debt

          (7A)  This section does not prevent a payee of a registered maintenance liability from instituting a proceeding under section 113A during a low‑income non‑enforcement period to recover a debt due in relation to the liability.

Definitions

             (8)  In this section:

                    <a name="social-secur-benefit"></a>**_social security benefit_** has the same meaning as in the _Social Security Act 1991_.

                    <a name="social-secur-pension"></a>**_social security pension_** has the same meaning as in the _Social Security Act 1991_.

##### <a id="38"></a>38  Variation of Register to have enforceable maintenance liability no longer enforced under Act

                     (b)  the payee and payer of the liability jointly make an election under section 38A; or

Note:          Section 16A provides for the Registrar to specify the manner in which an election may be made.

             (3)  Within 28 days after receiving the election, the Registrar must:

                     (a)  vary the particulars relating to the liability in the Child Support Register by specifying a day (not later than 60 days after the day on which the Registrar received the election) as the day on which the liability ceases to be enforceable under this Act (the **_terminating day_**); and

                     (b)  if the payee, or the payee and payer jointly, have elected to have amounts payable under the liability in  relation to the child support enforcement period  that are unpaid on the terminating day also no longer enforced under this 
 Act—vary the particulars so as to ensure that, in spite of section 30, those amounts cease to be debts due by the payer to the Commonwealth.

          (3A)  However, if either the payer or the payee is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction, the Registrar has 90 days to vary the relevant particulars, instead of 28 days.

             (4)  The Registrar must not make a variation under paragraph (3)(a) by specifying a day that is included in a period that is a low‑income non‑enforcement period under section 37B in relation to the liability. If that day is included in that period, the Registrar must not take action under paragraph (3)(b) in relation to that day.

##### <a id="38B"></a>38B  Decision by Registrar based on payment record and other factors

             (1)  The Registrar may decide that an enforceable maintenance liability should no longer be enforced under this Act if all the following conditions are met:

             (3)  If, before the day specified in a variation under subsection (2), the Registrar decides to revoke the decision that gave rise to the variation, the Registrar must vary the particulars concerned in the Child Support Register to give effect to the revocation.

             (4)  The revocation takes effect on the day the Registrar varies the particulars concerned.

##### <a id="38C"></a>38C  Election not to enforce—registered maintenance liability

             (1)  If a registered maintenance liability of a kind mentioned in section 18A is not enforceable because of an election under section 38A, an amount unpaid under the relevant maintenance assessment, order or agreement is a debt due and payable by the payer to the payee.

             (2)  A debt due under this section is recoverable by the payee from the payer in a court of competent jurisdiction.

##### <a id="39"></a>39  Application for variation to enable liability to again become enforceable under Act

             (1)  If a registered maintenance liability is not enforceable under this Act because of an election made under section 38A or a decision by the Registrar under section 38B, the payee may apply to the Registrar for the liability to again become enforceable under this Act.

             (3)  An application cannot be made in relation to a liability during a period that is a low‑income non‑enforcement period under section 37B in relation to the liability.

             (4)  Within 28 days after receiving an application under subsection (1), the Registrar must grant or refuse the application.

          (4A)  However, if either the payer or the payee is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction, the Registrar has 90 days to grant or refuse the application, instead of 28 days.

             (5)  The Registrar must grant the application unless the Registrar is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the payer of the liability has been complying with his or her child support obligations in relation to the payee; or

                     (b)  the payer of the liability has satisfactorily explained and rectified a failure to comply with his or her child support obligations in relation to a payee; or

                     (c)  there are special circumstances that exist in relation to the liability that make it appropriate to refuse the application.

             (6)  If the Registrar grants the application, the Registrar must:

                     (a)  vary the particulars relating to the liability in the Child Support Register by specifying a day (not later than 60 days after the day on which the Registrar received the application) as the day on which the liability again becomes enforceable under this Act; and

                     (b)  may make any variations to those particulars that the Registrar considers necessary or desirable:

                             (ii)  to take account of the happening of an affecting event in relation to the liability.

             (7)  The Registrar must not make a variation under subsection (6) by specifying a day that is included in a period that is a low‑income non‑enforcement period under section 37B in relation to the liability. If that day is included in that period, the Registrar must not take action under paragraph (6)(b) in relation to that day.

Application by payee for enforcement of arrears

             (4)  The payee may apply to the Registrar, in the manner specified by the Registrar, for any unpaid amounts payable under the liability in relation to a specified period to be treated as arrears amounts for the purposes of this section. The specified period must:

Registrar’s decision—arrears for more than 3 months

                     (a)  if the Registrar is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances—the Registrar must grant the payee’s application; or

                     (b)  if:

                              (i)  the Registrar is not satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances; and

                             (ii)  unpaid amounts are payable under the liability in relation to the period of 3 months that ended at the end of the maximum arrears period;

                     (b)  the Registrar must make such variations to the particulars entered in the Child Support Register in relation to the liability as the Registrar considers necessary or desirable to give effect to this subsection.

Amounts that would have been credited under section 71C

Overall non‑care period

             (2)  For the purposes of this section, the **_overall non‑care period_** is the period:

Joint election by payer and payee

             (3)  During the overall non‑care period, the payer and payee may jointly elect, by applying to the Registrar in the manner specified by the Registrar, to have so much of the liability as is attributable to the child no longer enforced under this Act. The election takes effect at whichever of the following times is applicable:

                     (a)  if the election is made within 28 days after the start of the overall non‑care period—the start of the overall non‑care period;

                     (b)  in any other case—when the election is made.

However, the election does not take effect if the applicable time is included in a period that is a low‑income non‑enforcement period in relation to the liability for the purposes of section 37B.

Note:          Section 16A provides for the Registrar to specify the manner in which an application may be made.

Consequences of election under subsection (3)

             (4)  If an election is made under subsection (3):

                     (a)  if the child is the only child covered by the liability—the liability ceases to be enforceable under this Act after the applicable time; or

                     (b)  in any other case—this Act has effect in relation to the liability, after the applicable time, as if a reference in this Act to amounts payable under the liability did not include a reference to an amount attributable to the child.

Note:          Paragraph (4)(b) could result in the liability becoming partially unenforceable under this Act.

Reversal of election

             (5)  If:

                     (b)  in any other case—when the election is made.

However, the election does not take effect if the applicable time is included in a period that is a low‑income non‑enforcement period in relation to the liability for the purposes of section 37B.

Consequences of reversal of election

             (7)  An election under subsection (5) has effect accordingly.

Registrar to vary Register

             (6)  Where the Registrar is satisfied that, in the special circumstances of a particular case, the collection of payments due under an enforceable maintenance liability by deduction from the salary or wages of the payer under this Part would not be an efficient method of collecting those payments, the Registrar may include in the particulars of the entry in the Child Support Register in relation to the liability a statement that employer withholding does not apply in relation to the liability or may vary those particulars so that they contain such a statement, as the case requires.

                     (b)  the Registrar is of the opinion that the revocation or variation of a notice in force under subsection (1) in relation to the liability is necessary or desirable to take account of the variations made to those particulars;

the Registrar shall forthwith give a notice in writing to the employer to whom the notice was given varying or revoking accordingly the earlier notice given to the employer.

          (2A)  Where the Registrar thinks that the variation of a notice in force under subsection (1) in relation to an enforceable maintenance liability is necessary or desirable for the purpose of collecting amounts already due to the Commonwealth under or in relation to the liability by deduction from the salary or wages of the payer under this Part, the Registrar must immediately give a written notice to the employer to whom the notice was given varying the notice accordingly.

             (3)  Where the Registrar gives a notice under subsection (1), (2) or (2A) to an employer in relation to the payer of an enforceable maintenance liability, the Registrar shall forthwith give a copy of the notice to the payer.

             (1)  Subject to this section, where an employer pays salary or wages to an employee in relation to whom a notice given to the employer under subsection 45(1) is in force, the employer shall, at the time of paying the salary or wages, make a deduction from the salary or wages in accordance with this section.

             (2)  Subject to subsection (4), the amount of the deduction is the amount ascertained by applying the weekly deduction rate specified in the notice to the period in relation to which the salary or wages are paid.

             (4)  Where the amount of the salary or wages exceeds the amount of the deduction that would, but for this subsection, be required to be made from the salary or wages by less than the amount (the **_protected earnings amount_**) ascertained by applying the protected earnings rate to the period in relation to which the salary or wages are paid, the amount of the deduction is the amount by which the amount of the salary or wages exceeds the protected earnings amount.

          (4A)  An employer commits an offence if:

                     (a)  the employer is required to make a deduction under subsection (1) in relation to an employee; and

                     (b)  the employer refuses or fails to make the deduction.

                    Penalty:  10 penalty units.

          (4B)  Subsection (4A) does not apply if the amount of the employee’s salary or wages is less than the protected earnings amount.

Note:          A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in subsection (4B) (see subsection 13.3(3) of the _Criminal Code_).

          (4C)  An offence against subsection (4A) is an offence of strict liability.

Note:          For strict liability, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

             (6)  For the purposes of this section, where an employer pays an amount of salary or wages to an employee, then:

                     (a)  if the amount is paid in relation to piece‑work performed by the employee or in relation to services rendered under a contract that is wholly or principally for the labour of the employee—the amount shall be taken to be paid in relation to the period:

                              (i)  that began when the work or services began; and

                             (ii)  that ended when the work or services ended;

                     (b)  if the amount is paid in relation to any other work performed or services rendered, but not in relation to a particular period—the amount shall be taken to be paid in relation to the period of 52 weeks preceding the day on which the amount is paid; and

                     (c)  if the employee is entitled to be paid the amount in relation to a period of longer than one week—the employer shall be deemed to have paid an amount of salary or wages to the employee in relation to each week or part of a week in the period, being the amount ascertained by dividing the amount of salary or wages in fact paid by the number of days in the period and multiplying the resultant amount:

                              (i)  in the case of each week—by 7; and

                             (ii)  in the case of a part of a week—by the number of days in the part of the week.

             (7)  Where salary or wages for a week or part of a week is or are paid by an employer in 2 or more separate amounts, all the amounts shall, for the purposes of this section, be aggregated, and the employer may make the deduction wholly from one amount or partly from 2 or more amounts.

             (8)  For the purposes of subsections (4) and (4B), the amount of any salary or wages shall be taken to be the amount of the salary or wages after amounts (if any) that are required to be withheld from the salary or wages under Part 2‑5 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ have been withheld.

             (9)  Subsection (1) has, and is taken to have had, no effect to the extent (if any) that it is inconsistent with paragraph 72(iii) or 103(iii) of the Constitution.

                     (a)  treat any one of the employers as the only employer for the purposes of this Part; or

                     (b)  apply sections 46 and 47 in relation to any 2 or more of the employers with such modifications as the Registrar considers appropriate, being modifications made for the purpose of ensuring that the amounts collected under this Part in relation to the liability are, in the aggregate, the same as those that would be collected in relation to the liability if the payer had only one employer.

                     (a)  to remit only part of a penalty; or

                     (b)  not to remit any part of a penalty;

the Registrar must serve written notice of the decision on the person by whom the penalty is, or but for the remission would be, payable.

             (3)  The notice must include, or be accompanied by, a statement to the effect that:

                     (a)  the person may, subject to this Act, object to the decision (the **_original decision_**); and

                     (b)  if the person is dissatisfied by a later decision of the Registrar on an objection to the original decision, the person may, subject to this Act, apply to the SSAT for review of the later decision.

             (4)  A contravention of subsection (3) in relation to a decision does not affect the validity of the decision.

##### <a id="69"></a>69  Reduction of late payment penalty where judgment debt carries interest

                   Where judgment is given by, or entered in, a court for payment of:

                     (a)  a child support debt; or

                     (b)  an amount that includes a child support debt;

then:

                     (c)  the debt shall not be taken, for the purposes of subsection 67(1), to have ceased to be due and payable merely because of the giving or entering of the judgment; and

                     (d)  if the judgment debt carries interest, the amount that would, but for this paragraph, be payable under that subsection in relation to the debt shall, by force of this paragraph, be reduced by:

                              (i)  in a case to which paragraph (a) applies—the amount of the interest; or

                             (ii)  in a case to which paragraph (b) applies—an amount that bears the same proportion to the amount of the interest as the amount of the debt bears to the amount of the judgment debt.

##### <a id="69A"></a>69A  Crediting of lump sum payments

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  either:

                              (i)  a child support agreement accepted by the Registrar includes lump sum payment provisions in accordance with paragraph 84(1)(e) of the Assessment Act; or

                             (ii)  a court has made an order under section 123A of that Act in relation to the provision of child support in the form of a lump sum payment; and

                     (b)  the Registrar has been notified that the lump sum payment has been paid in accordance with the agreement or order.

             (2)  The Registrar must, in accordance with subsection (3):

                     (a)  in respect of a day in an initial period, or in respect of a day in a payment period, in a year of income, for a registered maintenance liability, credit the remaining lump sum payment against:

                              (i)  if the agreement or order states that the lump sum payment is to be credited against a specified percentage of the amount payable under the liability—that percentage of the amount payable under the liability; and

                             (ii)  if subparagraph (i) does not apply—100% of the amount payable under the liability; and

                     (b)  reduce, but not below nil, the remaining lump sum payment by the amount so credited.

             (3)  The Registrar must credit a remaining lump sum payment and reduce the remaining lump sum payment at the end of each year of income.

             (4)  The **_remaining lump sum payment_**, in relation to the lump sum payment paid under the agreement or order, means:

                     (a)  for the first day after the agreement is accepted or the order is made—the lump sum payment; and

                     (b)  for 1 July in a year of income (except if that 1 July is covered by paragraph (a))—the remaining lump sum payment for the previous day as indexed under subsection (5); and

                     (c)  otherwise—so much of the remaining lump sum payment as remains after crediting under the previous application of this section.

             (5)  The remaining lump sum payment, for 1 July in a year of income, is indexed as follows:

where:

                    <a name="base-quarter"></a>**_base quarter_** means the March quarter (before the March quarter for the previous year of income, but after the agreement is accepted or the order is made) with the highest index number.

                    <a name="index-number"></a>**_index number_** for a quarter is the All Groups Consumer Price Index number that is the weighted average of the 8 capital cities and is published by the Australian Statistician in respect of that quarter.

                    <a name="march-quarter"></a>**_March quarter_** means the quarter ending on 31 March.

             (6)  If an indexation factor worked out under subsection (5) would be less than 1, the indexation factor is to be increased to 1.

             (7)  Subject to subsection (8), if at any time (whether before or after the commencement of this subsection), the Australian Statistician publishes an index number for a quarter in substitution for an index number previously published by the Australian Statistician for that quarter, the publication of the later index number is to be disregarded for the purposes of subsection (5).

             (8)  If at any time the Australian Statistician changes the reference base for the Consumer Price Index, regard is to be had, for the purposes of applying subsection (5) after the change takes place, only to index numbers published in terms of the new reference base.

##### <a id="70"></a>70  Apportionment of payment between payees

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  2 or more child support debts are owing by a person; and

                     (b)  the debts relate to 2 or more enforceable maintenance liabilities with different payees; and

                     (c)  an amount is paid to the Registrar in relation to all or any of the debts; and

                     (d)  the total amount of the debts exceeds the amount paid to the Registrar;

the Registrar must, despite any direction given by or on behalf of the person, apportion the amount of the payment between the payees in proportion to the amount of the debt owing in relation to each payee, and apply the amounts so apportioned in partial discharge of each of those debts.

             (2)  This section does not apply to amounts paid to the Registrar in accordance with a court order made in relation to a proceeding instituted by a payee of a registered maintenance liability under section 113A to recover a debt due in relation to the liability.

##### <a id="71"></a>71  Direct payments to payee

             (1)  Subject to section 71D, if:

                     (a)  the payee of an enforceable maintenance liability receives from the payer an amount intended by both the payer and the payee to be paid in complete or partial satisfaction of an amount payable under the liability in relation to the child support enforcement period; and

                     (b)  the payer or the payee applies to the Registrar to have the amount received by the payee treated as having been paid to the Registrar;

the Registrar shall, in spite of section 30, credit the amount received by the payee against the amount payable under the enforceable maintenance liability.

             (2)  An application must be made in the manner specified by the Registrar.

Note:          Section 16A provides for the Registrar to specify the manner in which an application may be made.

             (3)  This section does not apply to an enforceable maintenance liability of a kind referred to in paragraph 18A(3)(a).

##### <a id="71AA"></a>71AA  Registrar may offset child support debts between payer and payee

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  2 persons each have a child support debt arising from a liability referred to in section 17 or 17A; and

                     (b)  in respect of each debt, the Commonwealth would be required, under section 76, to pay the amount paid by one of the persons to the other person; and

                     (c)  for a debt that arose from a liability referred to in section 17—the liability provided for child support for a child of the 2 persons;

the Registrar may offset the debts by deducting the amount, or part of the amount, of the debt of the person who owes the lesser amount from the amount of the debt of the person who owes the greater amount.

             (2)  If the amount of the debts is the same, the Registrar may offset one debt against the other. In this case, the Commonwealth is taken to have recovered both of the debts.

             (3)  If the amount of the debts is not the same, the Commonwealth is taken to have recovered:

                     (a)  so much of the amount of the smaller debt as is offset against the larger debt; and

                     (b)  so much of the amount of the larger debt that equals the amount of the smaller debt as is offset.

             (4)  Any amounts recovered by the Commonwealth by way of offset are taken to be:

                     (a)  paid by the payer to the Registrar under the registered maintenance liability concerned; and

                     (b)  paid by the Commonwealth to the payee as provided for in this Act.

Example:    Offset of part of a debt

                   Helena was previously the payer of a registrable maintenance liability. Helena’s children have now come to live with her. Helena has the greater debt of $3,000 from the period when she was a child support payer. Even though the children are no longer living with Theo, he is entitled to $3,000 in child support when Helena pays it.

                   Theo has now been assessed as having a child support liability. Under that liability, Theo has a debt of $150 in respect of a calendar month.

                   The Registrar offsets $100 of the debt (part of it only) that became due and payable by Theo against the amount owed by Helena. The effect of the offset is that Helena is taken to have paid $100 per calendar month. Theo is taken to have paid $100 of his liability to pay $150\. Under the liability, Theo must pay $50 for that calendar month.

                   Each time a debt incurred by Theo under the liability becomes due and payable it may be offset against the remainder of   Helena’s debt.

##### <a id="71A"></a>71A  Payments to third persons by payer

             (1)  Subject to section 71D, if:

                     (a)  the payer of an enforceable maintenance liability pays a third party an amount that partially or completely satisfies a debt owed by:

                              (i)  the payee of the enforceable maintenance liability; or

                             (ii)  the payer; or

                            (iii)  both the payer and payee; and

                     (b)  the payer or the payee applies to the Registrar, in the manner specified by the Registrar, to have the amount, or part of the amount, received by the third party treated as having been paid to the Registrar; and

                     (c)  the amount paid, or a part of the amount paid, was intended by both the payer and the payee to be paid in complete or partial satisfaction of an amount payable under the enforceable maintenance liability in relation to the child support enforcement period;

the Registrar must, in spite of section 30 and in accordance with subsections (2) and (3), credit the amount, or part of the amount, received by the third party against the amount payable under the enforceable maintenance liability.

Note:          Section 16A provides for the Registrar to specify the manner in which an application may be made.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  the application referred to in paragraph (1)(b) specifies that the amount, or part of the amount, received by the third party is to be credited against a specified percentage (that is less than 100%) of the amount payable under the liability; and

                     (b)  the Registrar is satisfied that the payer and the payee agree that the amount received is to be so credited;

then the Registrar must credit the amount, or the part of the amount, received against that percentage of the amount payable under the liability.

             (3)  Otherwise, the Registrar must credit the amount, or the part of the amount, received against all of the amount payable under the liability.

             (4)  This section does not apply to an enforceable maintenance liability of a kind referred to in paragraph 18A(3)(a).

##### <a id="71B"></a>71B  Payments not in money

             (1)  For the purposes of sections 71 and 71A, if both the payer and the payee of an enforceable maintenance liability so intend:

                     (a)  a payment in a form, other than money, by the payer; or

                     (b)  a transfer of any property or right by the payer;

is taken to be an amount paid in complete or partial satisfaction of an amount payable under an enforceable maintenance liability.

             (2)  For the purpose of determining the amount to be credited under section 71 or 71A, in relation to the payment or transfer, against the amount payable under the liability of the payer to the Commonwealth, the amount of the payment or transfer is taken to be:

                     (a)  the amount agreed by the payer and the payee; or

                     (b)  if no amount is agreed, the amount determined by the Registrar.

##### <a id="71C"></a>71C  Other payments of up to 30% of child support liability

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  the payer of an enforceable maintenance liability in relation to a payment period or initial period has made one or more payments to the payee of the liability, or to another person; and

                     (b)  the payment is a payment of the kind specified in the regulations; and

                   (ba)  at the time the payment is made, the payer does not have at least regular care of any of the children to whom the relevant administrative assessment relates; and

                     (c)  the sum of those payments exceeds the sum of all such payments previously credited under this section against the amount payable under the liability for all past periods; and

                     (d)  the payer does not, at the time at which the Registrar applies this section, have at least regular care of any of the children to whom the relevant administrative assessment relates;

then the Registrar must, despite section 30, credit the excess amount mentioned in paragraph (c) against the amount payable under the payer’s liability for the period, up to a maximum of 30% of the amount payable.

Note:          Subsection (1) is subject to section 71D.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to a payment (the **_prescribed payment_**) mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) if:

                     (a)  before the prescribed payment is made, the payer has provided child support to the payee in the form of a lump sum payment; and

                     (b)  the lump sum payment has been credited, or will be credited, under section 69A against all or part of the amount payable under the enforceable maintenance liability in relation to the day the prescribed payment is made.

             (3)  Subject to subsection (4), the Registrar must not credit an amount under this section in relation to a period for which the payer has not paid to the Commonwealth an amount equal to the difference between:

                     (a)  the amount payable by the payer to the Commonwealth under the enforceable maintenance liability in relation to that period; and

                     (b)  the amount that is to be credited under subsection (1), or that would be so credited but for this subsection, in relation to that period.

             (4)  If the payer:

                     (a)  did not pay that difference to the Commonwealth within the time required under section 66; and

                     (b)  subsequently pays the amount of that difference to the Commonwealth;

the Registrar may credit against the amount payable under the enforceable maintenance liability in relation to that period the amount that, but for subsection (3), would have been credited under subsection (1).

             (5)  This section does not apply in relation to an enforceable maintenance liability in relation to a payment period or an initial period if:

                     (a)  the liability is covered by section 17A or 18; or

                     (b)  both of the following apply:

                              (i)  the payer of the liability has provided child support to the payee of the liability in the form of a lump sum payment;

                             (ii)  the lump sum payment will be credited, under section 69A, against all or part of the amount payable under the liability in relation to the days in the payment period or the initial period.

             (6)  This section does not apply in relation to an enforceable maintenance liability of a kind mentioned in section 18A.

##### <a id="71D"></a>71D  Registrar may refuse to credit amounts in special circumstances

                   The Registrar may refuse to credit an amount under section 71, 71A or 71C if satisfied that, in the circumstances of the particular case, the amount ought not to be credited.

##### <a id="71E"></a>71E  Notices must be given to payers and payees in relation to registration decisions

Notices must be given

             (1)  This section applies if the Registrar decides, under section 71, 71A or 71C, to credit an amount received by the payee of an enforceable maintenance liability, or a third party, against the amount payable under the liability of the payer of that enforceable maintenance liability.

Note:          If the Registrar refuses to credit an amount under section 71, 71A or 71C, the Registrar must give a notice under subsection 42C(3).

             (2)  As soon as practicable after the Registrar credits the amount, the Registrar must serve a notice in writing of the decision on the payee and the payer.

Content of notices

             (3)  A notice served on a person under this section in relation to a decision (the **_original decision_**) must include, or be accompanied by, a statement to the effect that:

                     (a)  the person may, subject to this Act, object to the original decision; and

                     (b)  if the person is dissatisfied by a later decision of the Registrar on an objection to the original decision (no matter who lodges the objection), the person may, subject to this Act, apply to the SSAT for review of the later decision.

             (4)  A contravention of subsection (3) in relation to a decision does not affect the validity of the decision.

##### <a id="72"></a>72  Application of certain amounts to debts under this Act

             (1)  If, apart from this section:

                     (a)  the Commissioner would be required under section 8AAZLF of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ to refund an amount (the **_refund amount_**) to a person (the **_creditor_**); and

                     (b)  the creditor owes a debt to the Commonwealth under this Act;

then, despite anything contained in any law of the Commonwealth apart from this Act (including section 8AAZLF of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_):

                     (c)  the Registrar may require the Commissioner, at a particular time, to pay an amount to the Registrar not exceeding the lesser of the refund amount and the debt; and

                     (d)  if the Registrar so requires, the Commissioner must, as soon as practicable, pay the required amount to the Registrar.

             (2)  If the Commissioner pays an amount to the Registrar under subsection (1), the Registrar must:

                     (a)  apply the amount against the debt of the creditor; or

                     (b)  if the debt has been paid in full after the time mentioned in paragraph (1)(c)—pay the amount to the creditor; or

                     (c)  if the debt has been paid in part after the time mentioned in paragraph (1)(c):

                              (i)  apply the amount against the child support debt of the creditor; and

                             (ii)  if, after the amount has been applied, the child support debt has been paid in full, pay any excess to the creditor.

             (3)  If the Commissioner pays an amount to the Registrar under subsection (1), the amount that the Commissioner is required to refund under section 8AAZLF of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ to the person is taken to be reduced by the amount paid to the Registrar immediately after the amount is paid.

                     (g)  if the notice specifies an amount of money that is to be paid out of each payment that the notified person becomes liable, from time to time, to make to the debtor—that amount until the maximum notified deduction total is satisfied.

          (1A)  A notice given under subsection (1) requires the notified person to continue to make payments in accordance with that subsection until the maximum notified deduction total is satisfied.

          (1B)  For the purposes of subsection (1), **_maximum notified deduction total_** is an amount specified in a notice under that subsection that does not exceed the support debt of the child support debtor to whom the notice relates.

             (5)  If the Registrar gives a notice under subsection (1), the Registrar must provide a copy of the notice to the child support debtor.

             (6)  A notice is taken to be provided under subsection (5) if the Registrar sends the notice to the last address of the person known to the Registrar.

             (7)  A notice is taken to have been given to the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory if it is served on a prescribed person.

             (8)  If a person is convicted of an offence against subsection (1), the court may, in addition to imposing a penalty on the person, order the person to pay to the Registrar an amount that is not more than the amount, or sum of the amounts (as the case may be), that the person refused or failed to pay to the Registrar.

             (9)  A person who makes a payment in compliance with a notice under subsection (1) is taken to have made the payment under the debtor’s authority or the authority of any other person concerned and is indemnified in respect of that payment.

### Division 2—Payments to payees

##### <a id="76"></a>76  Entitlement of payees to be paid collected amounts

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2) of this section, subsection 79(2) and sections 79A and 79B, every payee of a registered maintenance liability is entitled to be paid, on or before the first Wednesday following the end of each calendar month (in this section called the **_current month_**), an amount equal to the aggregate of:

                     (a)  amounts deducted by an employer under Part IV in relation to the liability during the calendar month (in this section called the **_previous month_**) preceding the current month;

                     (b)  amounts received by the Registrar (otherwise than under Part IV) in payment of a child support debt in relation to the liability during the period (in this section called the **_payment period_**) beginning on the day following the closing day of the previous month and ending on the closing day of the current month; and

                     (c)  to the extent that they have not previously been paid to the payee, amounts that were:

                              (i)  deducted by an employer under Part IV in relation to the liability before the previous month; or

                             (ii)  received by the Registrar (otherwise than under Part IV) in payment of a child support debt in relation to the liability before the payment period;

but excluding (in the case of each of the amounts mentioned in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c)) any amount that was not due and payable by the payer on the seventh day of the current month.

             (2)  Subject to the regulations, where the amount that a person is, but for this subsection, entitled to be paid at any time under subsection (1) in relation to a registered maintenance liability is less than the amount prescribed for the purposes of this subsection, the person is not entitled to be paid the amount at that time.

##### <a id="77"></a>77  Unremitted deductions made by employers

                   Where:

                     (a)  the Registrar is satisfied that a deduction has been made under subsection 46(1) in a calendar month by an employer from the salary or wages of an employee; and

                     (b)  the amount of the deduction is not paid to the Registrar under paragraph 47(1)(a) on or before the closing day of the following calendar month;

an amount equal to the amount of the deduction unpaid on that closing day must be credited to the Account.

##### <a id="78"></a>78  Unexplained remittances from employers

             (1)  This section applies where:

                     (a)  on or before the closing day of a calendar month, the Registrar receives under paragraph 47(1)(a) an amount (in this section called the **_received amount_**) from an employer in relation to the amounts deducted by the employer under Part IV from the salary or wages of employees during the preceding calendar month;

                     (b)  the employer contravenes paragraph 47(1)(b) in relation to the preceding calendar month; and

                     (c)  the Registrar is unable to ascertain to the Registrar’s satisfaction, on or before the closing day, the portion of the received amount attributable to each of the employees (in this section called the **_relevant employees_**) in relation to whom a notice given to the employer under subsection 45(1) was in force during the preceding calendar month.

             (2)  The Registrar may, for the purposes of subsection 76(1):

                     (a)  subject to subsection (3), treat the received amount as the total of the amounts deducted by the employer under Part IV from the salary or wages of all the relevant employees during the preceding calendar month; and

                     (b)  apportion the amount between the relevant employees on the basis that appears to the Registrar to be the most appropriate in the circumstances.

             (3)  Where:

                     (a)  the received amount is less than the amount (in this subsection called the **_expected amount_**) that, according to the records held by the Registrar, should have been received from the employer under paragraph 47(1)(a) in relation to the preceding calendar month; and

                     (b)  the expected amount does not exceed the sum of the received amount and the product of the amount prescribed for the purposes of this subsection and the number of relevant employees;

then:

                     (c)  for the purposes of subsection (2) of this section, the received amount shall be deemed to be an amount equal to the expected amount; and

                     (b)  either of the following situations apply:

                              (i)  the payee was not entitled to be paid the amount; or

                             (ii)  the amount is, because of a subsequent variation to particulars of the entry in the Child Support Register in relation to the liability, repayable by the Registrar to the payer of the liability;

the amount is repayable by the payee to the Registrar and is a debt due by the payee to the Commonwealth.

             (2)  Where, in a case falling within subsection (1), the payee is entitled to receive further payments under subsection 76(1), the amount of the debt due to the Commonwealth by the payee may be recovered by reducing such of those payments by such amount as is determined in writing by the Registrar.

             (2)  If the Registrar makes a suspension determination on a day, the payee is not entitled to be paid an amount from that payer for the child on that or any later day mentioned in subsection 76(1) unless and until the Registrar makes a determination under subsection (3) of this section in relation to the payee and an amount payable by that payer for the child.

Note:          The Registrar must vary the Child Support Register after making the suspension determination (see section 79C).

Resumption determinations

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  the Registrar has made a suspension determination under subsection (1) in relation to the payee of a registered maintenance liability; and

                     (b)  the Registrar is satisfied that the proceeding referred to in subsection (1) has been:

                             (ii)  dismissed or withdrawn; or

                            (iii)  struck out by the court;

the Registrar must make a determination (a **_resumption determination_**) that:

Objections to particulars in the Child Support Register

             (2)  An objection to a decision of the Registrar as to particulars entered in the Child Support Register in relation to a registrable maintenance liability may be lodged:

                     (a)  on the ground that the relevant entry does not relate to a registrable maintenance liability; or

                     (b)  on any other ground.

             (3)  An objection to a decision of the Registrar as to particulars varied in the Child Support Register in relation to a registrable maintenance liability may only be made against:

                     (a)  the particulars varied; and

                     (b)  any other particulars affected by the variation.

Objections to administrative assessments—parentage

             (4)  An objection to a decision of the Registrar to accept an application for administrative assessment under subsection 30(1) of the Assessment Act may not be lodged on the ground that the person is not a parent of the child concerned.

Note:          In that case, a person may be able to apply to a court under section 107 of the Assessment Act for a declaration that a person should not be assessed in respect of the costs of the child because the person is not a parent of the child.

             (5)  An objection to a decision of the Registrar to refuse to accept an application for administrative assessment may not be lodged if one of the reasons for the Registrar so refusing was that the Registrar was not satisfied under section 29 that a person who was to be assessed in respect of the costs of a child is a parent of the child concerned.

Note:          In that case, an application may be made to a court under section 106A of the Assessment Act for a declaration that a person should be assessed in respect of the costs of the child because the person is a parent of the child.

Section does not apply to care percentage decisions

             (6)  This section does not apply to a decision that is a care percentage decision.

##### <a id="80A"></a>80A  Objections against care percentage decisions may be lodged

                   The following persons may lodge with the Registrar, or the Family Assistance Secretary, an objection to a care percentage decision:

                     (a)  the carer entitled to child support;

                     (b)  the liable parent.

### Division 3—Time limits on lodging objections

##### <a id="81"></a>81  Time limits on lodging objections

             (1)  An objection to a decision (other than an objection to an appealable collection refusal decision or a care percentage decision) must be lodged by a person within 28 days after a notice of the decision is served on the person.

             (2)  An objection to an appealable collection refusal decision must be lodged by a person within 28 days after the decision first comes to the notice of the person.

             (3)  For the purposes of subsection (1) or (2), if the person is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction, the person’s objection must be lodged within 90 days after the time specified in that subsection, instead of within 28 days.

##### <a id="82"></a>82  Applications for extensions of time

             (1)  A person may lodge an objection under this Part after the period for lodging such an objection has ended if, at the time of lodging the objection or a later time, the person applies to the Registrar to consider the objection despite the period ending.

             (2)  The application must state fully and in detail the grounds of the application, including the circumstances concerning, and the reasons for, the failure by the person to lodge the objection as required by section 81.

             (3)  The application must be made in the manner specified by the Registrar.

##### <a id="83"></a>83  Consideration of applications for extensions of time for lodging objections

             (1)  If an application is sent to the Registrar under section 82 in relation to an objection under this Part, the Registrar must:

                     (a)  consider the application; and

                     (b)  within 60 days after the application is received by the Registrar:

                              (i)  either grant or refuse the application; and

                             (ii)  if the application is granted—deal with the objection under subsection 87(1).

          (1A)  However, if the person who made the application is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction, the Registrar has 90 days, instead of 60 days, to act under paragraph (1)(b).

             (2)  If the Registrar does not either grant or refuse to grant the application within the period applicable under subsection (1) or (1A), the Registrar is taken, at the end of that period, to have refused to grant the application.

             (3)  The Registrar must serve notice in writing of the decision on the person who made the application.

             (4)  The notice must include, or be accompanied by:

                     (a)  the reasons for the decision; and

                     (b)  a statement to the effect that, if the person is aggrieved by the decision, application may be made, subject to this Act, to the SSAT for review of the decision.

             (5)  A contravention of subsection (4) in relation to a decision does not affect the validity of the decision.

             (6)  If an application under subsection 82(1) is granted, the person who made the application is, for the purposes of this Act, taken to have duly lodged the objection to which the application relates.

### Division 4—Requirements relating to objections

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply to an objection to a decision to make, or refuse to make, a departure determination under Part 6A of the Assessment Act if the Registrar is satisfied that the rights of the person who would otherwise be served with a copy of the objection and any accompanying documents will not be affected by any possible decision the Registrar could make in relation to the objection.

             (3)  Subsection (1) does not apply to an objection to a care percentage decision.

##### <a id="85A"></a>85A  Notification of objections to care percentage decisions

                   If:

                     (a)  a person objects to a care percentage decision under section 80A; and

                     (b)  more than one person could have objected to the decision under that section;

the Registrar must, as soon as practicable, notify each other person who could have objected to the decision of the objection referred to in paragraph (a).

##### <a id="86"></a>86  Other party served with copy of objection etc. may oppose or support objection

             (1)  A person served with a copy of the objection and any accompanying documents under section 85 may lodge with the Registrar a written notice in opposition to, or in support of, the objection.

             (2)  The notice must be lodged within 28 days after service on the person of the copy of the objection and any accompanying documents.

          (2A)  However, if the person is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction, the person’s notice must be lodged within 90 days after that time, instead of within 28 days.

             (3)  The notice must state fully and in detail the grounds relied on.

##### <a id="86A"></a>86A  Notified person may oppose or support an objection to a care percentage decision

             (1)  A person notified of an objection under section 85A may, within 28 days of being so notified:

                     (a)  lodge with the Registrar a written notice in opposition to, or in support of, the objection; or

                     (b)  otherwise inform the Registrar whether the person opposes or supports the objection.

             (2)  If a notice is lodged under paragraph (1)(a), the notice must state fully and in detail the grounds relied on.

             (3)  If paragraph (1)(b) applies, the person must give fully and in detail the grounds relied on.

             (4)  If the person is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction, subsection (1) applies as if the reference in that subsection to 28 days were a reference to 90 days.

### Division 5—Consideration of objections

##### <a id="87"></a>87  Consideration of objections by Registrar

             (1)  If an objection is lodged under this Part, the Registrar must:

                     (a)  consider the objection and:

                              (i)  if paragraph 86A(1)(b) applies in relation to the objection—any grounds relied on to oppose or support the objection; or

                             (ii)  otherwise—any notice lodged with the Registrar under section 86 or paragraph 86A(1)(a) in relation to the objection; and

                     (b)  within 60 days after the objection is lodged, either:

                              (i)  disallow the objection; or

                             (ii)  allow it in whole or in part.

          (1A)  However, if any of the following is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction:

                     (a)  the person objecting;

                     (b)  in a case where a person has been served with a copy of the objection and any accompanying documents under section 85—that person;

                     (c)  in a case where a person has been notified of the objection under section 85A—that person;

the Registrar has 120 days, instead of 60 days, to act under paragraph (1)(b).

          (1B)  If:

                     (a)  the objection is an objection to a care percentage decision; and

                     (b)  a review of a decision carried out under Division 1 of Part 5 of the Family Assistance Administration Act has involved (wholly or partly) a review of the determination to which the care percentage decision relates;

the Registrar must not allow the objection in a way that has the effect of varying the determination or substituting a new determination.

             (2)  The Registrar must serve notice in writing of the decision on:

                     (a)  the person who lodged the objection; and

                     (b)  each other person:

                              (i)  if the objection is an objection to a care percentage decision—who was entitled to be notified of the objection under section 85A; or

                             (ii)  otherwise—who was entitled to be served a copy of the objection and the accompanying documents under section 85.

             (3)  A notice served on a person under subsection (2) must include, or be accompanied by:

                     (a)  the reasons for the decision; and

                     (b)  a statement to the effect that if the person is aggrieved by the decision on the objection:

                              (i)  if the decision objected to was a decision by the Registrar under section 98E or 98R of the Assessment Act—the person may apply to a court for an order under Division 4 of Part 7 of that Act; or

                             (ii)  otherwise—the person may, subject to this Act, apply to the SSAT for review of the decision.

             (4)  A contravention of subsection (3) in relation to a decision does not affect the validity of the decision.

### Division 6—Date of effect of objections

##### <a id="87AA"></a>87AA  Date of effect of objections relating to care percentage decisions that are allowed

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a person lodges, under section 80A, an objection to a care percentage decision; and

                     (b)  the objection is lodged more than 28 days or, if the person is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction, 90 days after notice of the care percentage decision was served; and

                     (c)  the Registrar decides (the **_review decision_**), under section 87, to allow the objection in a way that has the effect of varying the determination to which the care percentage decision relates, or substituting a new determination;

the date of effect of the review decision is the day on which the person lodged the objection.

             (2)  If the Registrar is satisfied that there are special circumstances that prevented the person from lodging the objection within the period referred to in paragraph (1)(b), the Registrar may determine that subsection (1) applies as if:

                     (a)  in a case where the person is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction—the reference to 90 days in that paragraph were a reference to such longer period as the Registrar determines to be appropriate; or

                     (b)  otherwise—the reference to 28 days in that paragraph were a reference to such longer period as the Registrar determines to be appropriate.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  the Registrar decides to make a determination under subsection (2) in relation to a person; or

                     (b)  the Registrar decides not to make such a determination in relation to a person;

the Registrar must give written notice of the decision to each person affected by the decision.

             (4)  The notice must:

                     (a)  set out the reasons for the decision; and

                     (b)  include a statement to the effect that, if the person is aggrieved by the decision, application may be made, subject to this Act, to the SSAT for review of the decision.

             (5)  A contravention of subsection (4) in relation to a decision does not affect the validity of the decision.

                     (a)  both of the following apply:

                              (i)  the objection was to a refusal by the Registrar, under section 98E or 98R of the Assessment Act, to make a determination under Part 6A of that Act in respect of a child support assessment;

                             (ii)  the Registrar disallowed the objection; or

                     (b)  both of the following apply:

                              (i)  the objection was to a decision by the Registrar made in respect of a child support assessment;

                             (ii)  in making a decision on the objection, the Registrar, under section 98E or 98R of the Assessment Act, refused to make a determination under Part 6A of that Act in respect of the assessment.

Note:          In that case, the person may apply to a court for an order under Division 4 of Part 7 (departure orders) of the Assessment Act.

#### Subdivision B—Time limit on applications for review

##### <a id="90"></a>90  Time limit on applications for review

             (1)  An application for review under this Part (other than an application for review of a decision on an objection to a care percentage decision) must be made by a person within the period of 28 days starting on:

                     (a)  if the decision is set out in item 1 or 2 of the table in subsection 89(1)—the day on which the relevant notice under subsection 83(3) or 87(2) is served on the person; or

                     (b)  otherwise—the day on which the relevant notice under subsection 87AA(3), 110Y(4) or 110Z(4) is given to the person.

             (2)  However, if the person is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction, the application for review must be made within the period of 90 days starting on the day specified in paragraph (1)(a) or (b), instead of within 28 days.

##### <a id="91"></a>91  Application for extension of time

             (1)  If the period for applying for review under this Part has ended, a person may make an application for review under this Part that includes a written application (the **_extension application_**) asking the SSAT Principal Member to consider the application for review despite the ending of the period.

             (2)  The extension application must state the reasons for the person’s failure to apply for the review within the period required by section 90.

##### <a id="92"></a>92  Consideration of applications for extension of time for applying for review

             (1)  If a person applies to the SSAT under section 91 in relation to an application for review, the SSAT Principal Member must:

                     (a)  consider the extension application; and

                     (b)  within 60 days after the extension application is received by the SSAT, grant or refuse the extension application; and

                     (c)  if the extension application is granted—deal with the application for review under this Part.

          (1A)  However, if the person applying is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction, the SSAT Principal Member has 90 days, instead of 60 days, to act under paragraph (1)(b).

             (3)  The SSAT Principal Member must give written notice of the decision granting or refusing the extension application to the person who made the extension application.

             (4)  If the SSAT Principal Member refuses the extension application, the notice under subsection (3) must include, or be accompanied by, a statement to the effect:

                     (a)  that the person may, subject to the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_, apply to the AAT for review of the decision; and

                     (b)  except where subsection 28(4) of that Act applies—that the person may request a statement under section 28 of that Act.

                     (b)  otherwise—the day on which the decision under review has or had effect.

Note:          The SSAT cannot specify a day that the Registrar could not have specified (see subsection 103T(2)).

             (3)  If:

             (4)  If the SSAT is satisfied that there are special circumstances that prevented the application from being made within the period referred to in paragraph (3)(b), the SSAT may determine that subsection (3) applies as if:

                     (a)  in a case where the person is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction—the reference to 90 days in that paragraph were a reference to such longer period as the SSAT determines to be appropriate; or

                     (b)  a review of a decision carried out by the AAT under the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ has involved (wholly or partly) a review of the determination to which the care percentage decision relates;

then, despite section 43 of that Act, the AAT must not vary the original decision, or set the original decision aside and substitute a new decision, in a way that has the effect of varying the determination or substituting a new determination.

          (1B)  An application may be made to the AAT for review of:

                     (a)  a decision of the SSAT under subsection 103V(4) to make a determination under that subsection in relation to a person; or

service of the document on the person may be effected, without leave of a court, by posting the document or a sealed copy of it in a letter addressed to the person at the person’s last known place of business or residence in Australia.

##### <a id="116"></a>116  Evidence

             (1)  The mere production of a document signed by the Registrar purporting to be a copy of the entry in the Child Support Register in relation to a registrable maintenance liability is prima facie evidence:

                     (a)  that the liability is a registrable maintenance liability; and

                     (b)  that the liability is duly registered under this Act; and

                     (c)  that the particulars of the entry in the Child Support Register in relation to the liability are those set out in the document; and

                     (d)  that all of those particulars are correct.

          (1A)  Paragraphs (1)(a), (b) and (d) do not apply in relation to proceedings under Part VII or VIIA, or under Subdivision B of Division 3 of Part VIII, on an objection to a decision:

                     (a)  to register a registrable maintenance liability; or

                     (b)  as to particulars entered in the Child Support Register in relation to a registrable maintenance liability.

          (1B)  Paragraph (1)(c) does not apply in relation to proceedings under Part VII or VIIA, or under Subdivision B of Division 3 of Part VIII, on an objection to a decision as to particulars varied in the Child Support Register in relation to a registrable maintenance liability.

             (2)  The mere production of a certificate in writing signed by the Registrar, certifying that an amount specified in the certificate was, on the date of the certificate, due and payable by a specified person to the Commonwealth in relation to a specified registrable maintenance liability or under a specified provision of Part IV, is _prima facie_ evidence of the matters stated in the certificate.

             (3)  Without limiting the generality of subsection (2), a certificate under that subsection may specify the amount of the outstanding balance of one or more child support debts as described in section 67.

##### <a id="117"></a>117  Appearance by Registrar etc.

             (1)  In any action, prosecution or other proceeding under, or arising out of, this Act instituted by or on behalf of the Registrar, to which the Registrar is a party or in which the Registrar is a party or in which the Registrar intervenes or seeks to intervene, the Registrar may appear personally or may be represented by:

is guilty of an offence punishable on conviction by a fine not exceeding $2,000.

             (2)  In a prosecution of a person for an offence against subsection (1), it is a defence if the person proves that the person:

                     (a)  did not know; and

                     (b)  could not reasonably be expected to have known;

that the statement to which the prosecution relates was false or misleading.

             (3)  A reference in subsection (1) to a statement made to an officer is a reference to a statement made to a person exercising powers under or in relation to this Act, whether the statement is made orally, in a document or in any other form and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, includes a statement:

                     (a)  made in an application, form, notification, objection or other document made, given, lodged or furnished, or purporting to be made, given, lodged or furnished, under this Act;

                     (c)  the requirement; and

## 20  Payments and amounts referred to in section 75 of the _Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988_

(1)       If:

                     (a)  a payment purported to be a payment or repayment of an amount referred to in section 75 of the _Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988_ in relation to the maintenance of an exnuptial child because of the extension of that Act to Western Australia; and

                     (b)  the payment was made:

                              (i)  after a Child Support Act was amended by one or more other Acts in relation to the maintenance of exnuptial children; and

                             (ii)  before the earlier of the day on which Western Australia adopted the Child Support Act, as so amended, or the day on which this item commences;

then the payment may, to the extent that it has not already been repaid to the Commonwealth before this item commences, be recovered by the Commonwealth from the person as a debt due to the Commonwealth.

(2)       A person to whom a payment referred to in subitem (1) was made is entitled, on the commencement of this item, to be paid, by the Commonwealth, an amount equal to the amount of the debt due to it by the person under subitem (1).

(4)       The Commonwealth may set‑off the amount of a debt due to it by a person under subitem (1) against an amount that is payable to that person under subitem (2).

(5)       Despite subitems (1) and (2), in applying section 79 of the _Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988_ after the commencement of this item, any payment referred to in subitem (1) is to be counted as though it had been validly made under section 76 of that Act.

_Note:       A person will therefore be liable to repay to the Commonwealth the amount of any overpayment of that purported payment to the person._

(6)       This item does not, by implication, affect the recovery or set‑off of other overpayments purporting to be made under the _Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988_.

(7)       To avoid doubt, this item applies to a payment that, because of section 71AA of the _Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988_, is taken to have been paid under section 76 of that Act.

## 21  Validation of past rights and liabilities

(1)       This item applies if, and during the period when, the rights and liabilities of a person under a Child Support Act were different from the rights and liabilities that the person would have had under that Act because:

                     (a)  the Child Support Act was amended, before the commencement of this item, by one or more of the Acts mentioned in subitem 19(3) in relation to the maintenance of exnuptial children; and

                     (b)  Western Australia did not adopt the Child Support Act, as so amended.

(2)       During that period, the rights and liabilities of the person are, by force of this item, declared to be, and always to have been, the same as if:

                     (a)  the Child Support Act, as so amended, did not extend to Western Australia; and

                     (b)  the Child Support Act continued to extend to Western Australia in relation to the maintenance of exnuptial children as if those amendments had not been made.

_Tax Laws Amendment (Repeal of Inoperative Provisions) Act 2006 
 (No. 101, 2006)_

## Schedule 6

## 1  Application of Schedule 1 and 2 amendments

Except as mentioned in items 2 and 3, the repeals and amendments made by Schedules 1 and 2 apply:

                     (a)  so far as they affect assessments—to assessments for the 2006‑07 income year and all later income years; and

                     (b)  otherwise—to acts done or omitted to be done, or states of affairs existing, after the commencement of the repeals and amendments.

## 6  Object

The object of this Part is to ensure that, despite the repeals and amendments made by this Act, the full legal and administrative consequences of:

                     (a)  any act done or omitted to be done; or

                     (b)  any state of affairs existing; or

                     (c)  any period ending;

before such a repeal or amendment applies, can continue to arise and be carried out, directly or indirectly through an indefinite number of steps, even if some or all of those steps are taken after the repeal or amendment applies.

## 7  Making and amending assessments, and doing other things, in relation to past matters

Even though an Act is repealed or amended by this Act, the repeal or amendment is disregarded for the purpose of doing any of the following under any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_):

                     (a)  making or amending an assessment (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

                     (b)  exercising any right or power, performing any obligation or duty or doing any other thing (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

Example 1: On 31 July 1999, Greg Ltd lodged its annual return under former section 160ARE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The return stated that the company had a credit on its franking account and that no franking deficit tax was payable for the 1998‑99 franking year. Under former section 160ARH of that Act, the Commissioner was taken to have made an assessment consistent with the return.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of Part IIIAA of that Act, the Commissioner concludes that Greg Ltd fraudulently overfranked dividends it paid during the 1998‑99 franking year, and had a franking account deficit for that franking year. As a result, the Commissioner considers that franking deficit tax and a penalty by way of additional tax are payable.

                   The Commissioner can amend the assessment under former section 160ARN of that Act, because item 7 of this Schedule disregards the repeal of that section for the purposes of making an assessment in relation to the 1998‑99 franking year. Item 7 will also disregard the repeal of Division 11 of former Part IIIAA to the extent necessary for the Commissioner to assess Greg Ltd’s liability to a penalty by way of additional tax.

                   Despite the repeal of sections 160ARU and 160ARV, item 9 will ensure that the general interest charge will accrue on the unpaid franking deficit tax and penalty until they are paid.

                   Item 7 will also preserve Greg Ltd’s right, under former section 160ART of that Act, to object against the Commissioner’s amended assessment (including the penalty), since the objection is the exercise of a right in relation to a franking year that ended before the repeal of Part IIIAA.

Example 2: During the 1997‑98 income year, Duffy Property Ltd withheld amounts from its employees’ wages as required by former Divisions 1AAA and 2 of Part VI of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The company failed to notify the Commissioner of those amounts, and failed to remit them to the Commissioner.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of those Divisions, the Commissioner discovers that the withheld amounts have not been remitted. The company’s records are incomplete and the Commissioner is unable to completely ascertain the extent of its liability for the withheld amounts. Under section 222AGA of that Act, the Commissioner makes an estimate of the liability.

                   Item 7 will disregard the repeal of section 220AAZA of that Act (which empowered the Commissioner to recover the amount of the estimate). Even though the estimate is made after the repeal, it relates to amounts withheld before the repeal.

## 8  Saving of provisions about effect of assessments

If a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act deals with the effect of an assessment, the repeal or amendment is disregarded in relation to assessments made, before or after the repeal or amendment applies, in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

## 9  Saving of provisions about general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty

If:

                     (a)  a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act provides for the payment of:

                              (i)  general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty (all within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_); or

                             (ii)  interest under the _Taxation (Interest on Overpayments and Early Payments) Act 1983_; and

                     (b)  in a particular case, the period in respect of which the charge, penalty or interest is payable (whether under the provision or under the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_) has not begun, or has begun but not ended, when the provision is repealed or amended;

then, despite the repeal or amendment, the provision or part continues to apply in the particular case until the end of the period.

## 10  Repeals disregarded for the purposes of dependent provisions

If the operation of a provision (the **_subject provision_**) of any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_) made under any Act depends to any extent on an Act, or a provision of an Act, that is repealed by this Act, the repeal is disregarded so far as it affects the operation of the subject provision.

## 11  Schedule does not limit operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_

This Schedule does not limit the operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

_Note:       For the definition of agreement period, see subitem (6)._

Child support agreements that span 1 July 2008

(2)       If the agreement period for a child support agreement covered by subitem (1) begins before 1 July 2008, then:

                     (b)  the application relates to a period that ends on or after 1 July 2008.

Applications that span 1 July 2008

(2)       If the application relates to a period that begins on a day (the **_first day_**) before 1 July 2008, then:

                              (i)  making an order in response to the application;

(4)       The Registrar may make different decisions, and take different actions, in relation to different orders made in response to an application.

Effect of old law continues in certain cases

(5)       To avoid doubt, if:

                     (a)  an application is made to a court before Division 3 of Part 1 of this Schedule commences; and

                     (b)  immediately before that Division commences, the application has not been finally dealt with by the court;

then the Assessment Act and the Registration and Collection Act, as in force immediately before 1 July 2008, continue to apply after that time in relation to the following:

                     (c)  making an order in response to the application;

                     (d)  any appeal to another court in relation to an order made in response to the application;

                     (e)  any decision or action taken by the Registrar in relation to an order made in response to the application.

## 74  Registrar to review all agreements

(1)       Before 1 July 2008, the Registrar must:

                     (a)  review every child support agreement made before that day that will be in force:

                              (i)  immediately before that day; or

                             (ii)  after that day; and

                     (b)  determine in writing whether each such agreement is:

                              (i)  to be taken to be a binding child support agreement; or

                             (ii)  to be terminated.

(2)       If, in accordance with subitem 73(5), the Registrar accepts a child support agreement on or after 1 July 2008 under the Assessment Act as in force immediately before that day, the Registrar must:

                     (a)  review the agreement; and

                     (b)  determine in writing whether the agreement is:

                              (i)  to be taken to be a binding child support agreement; or

                             (ii)  to be terminated.

(3)       After the Registrar makes a determination under subitem (1) or (2), the Registrar must serve notice in writing of the determination on each of the parties to the agreement.

(4)       The notice must include, or be accompanied by, a statement to the effect:

                     (a)  that the party may, subject to the Registration and Collection Act, object to the decision (the **_original decision_**); and

                     (b)  that if the party is aggrieved by a later decision on an objection to the original decision (no matter who lodges the objection), the party may apply, subject to that Act, to the SSAT for review of the later decision.

(5)       A contravention of subitem (4) in relation to a decision does not affect the validity of the decision.

(6)       The Registration and Collection Act (as amended by Schedule 3 of this Act) applies as if the table in subsection 80(1) of that Act (as inserted by Schedule 3 of this Act) included the following table item:

<table>
<colgroup>
  <col width="10%">
  <col width="45%">
  <col width="45%">
</colgroup>

  <td>
    <div>16</div>

    <div>a determination under item 74 of Schedule 5 to the
      <i>Child Support Legislation Amendment (Reform of the Child Support Scheme—New

      child support agreement or is to be terminated</div>
  </td>
  <td>
    <div>a party to the agreement</div>
  </td>

## 75  Effect of determinations

Effect of determinations

(1)       If the Registrar makes a determination under subparagraph 74(1)(b)(i) or (2)(b)(i), then, for the purposes of the Assessment Act and the Registration and Collection Act, at the time specified in subitem (4) (if the agreement has not been previously terminated):

## Schedule 2

## 1  Employer determination made where expected or actual date of birth is before 1 July 2011

(1)       The _Paid Parental Leave Act 2010_ applies, with the modifications set out in this item, in relation to a person who has made a claim for parental leave pay for a child, if:

                     (a)  for a claim made before the day the child is born—the expected date of birth of the child is before 1 July 2011; or

                     (b)  for a claim made after the child is born—the day the child is born is before 1 July 2011.

_Note:       For a claim made before the day the child is born, see subitem (9) if the expected date of birth of the child is before 1 July 2011, but the child is born on or after that date._

(2)       Section 101 of that Act (and the other provisions of that Act so far as they relate to that section) applies in relation to the person as if subsections (1) and (2) of that section were omitted and the following subsection substituted:

             (1)  The Secretary must make a determination under this section (the **_employer determination_**) that a person’s employer is to pay the person instalments if the Secretary is satisfied, when making the determination, that:

                     (a)  a payability determination that parental leave pay is payable to the person, or an initial eligibility determination for the person, is in force; and

                     (b)  the employer has made an election under section 109 that applies to the person; and

                     (c)  the person has consented in the claim to the employer paying instalments to the person; and

                             (ii)  otherwise—the period of days for which instalments are likely, if the determination is made, to be payable to the person by the employer; and

                     (e)  the employer has an ABN; and

                      (f)  if paragraphs (b) to (e) are satisfied in relation to more than one employer of the person—the person nominated the employer in the claim as the employer who would be required to pay instalments to the person.

(3)       For the purposes of this item, an employer determination made under subsection 101(1), as that subsection applies because of subitem (2) of this item, is a **_transitional employer determination_**.

(4)       The following provisions of that Act do not apply in relation to a transitional employer determination:

                     (a)  section 103 (which deals with responding to a notice of an employer determination);

                     (b)  subsection 107(2) (which deals with when an employer determination comes into force);

(5)       Within 14 days after the date of the notice given under section 102 of that Act in relation to the transitional employer determination, the employer may give the Secretary a written notice (the **_acceptance notice_**) that complies with section 104 of that Act.

(6)       If the employer gives the acceptance notice to the Secretary within that 14 day period, the transitional employer determination comes into force on the day the Secretary receives the acceptance notice.

(7)       If the employer does not give the acceptance notice to the Secretary within that 14 day period, the following paragraphs have effect:

                     (a)  the Secretary must revoke the transitional employer determination;

                     (b)  the revocation comes into force on the day of the revocation;

                     (c)  to avoid doubt, subsection 108(5) of that Act (which deals with giving notice of the revocation) applies in relation to the revocation.

(8)       The Secretary may extend the 14 day period referred to in subitem (5) in relation to an employer. If the Secretary does so, subitems (6) and (7) have effect accordingly.

(9)       Despite paragraph (1)(a) and subitem (2) of this item, if the person’s child is born on or after 1 July 2011, then the following paragraphs have effect:

                     (a)  the Secretary may make an employer determination for the person and the person’s employer under section 101 of the _Paid Parental Leave Act 2010_, as that section applies apart from this item;

                     (b)  if the Secretary does so and has previously made a transitional employer determination for the person and the employer, the Secretary is taken never to have made the transitional employer determination.

(10)     The following provisions of the _Paid Parental Leave Act 2010_, apply in relation to this item as if it were a provision of that Act:

                     (a)  section 275 (which deals with how that Act applies to an adopted child);

                     (b)  section 276 (which deals with how that Act applies to claims made in exceptional circumstances).

## 2  Employer determination made where expected date of birth is on or after 1 July 2011 but child born before that date

(1)       This item applies if:

                     (a)  the Secretary makes an employer determination for an employer and a person under the _Paid Parental Leave Act 2010_; and

                     (b)  the person’s claim is made before the day the child is born; and

                     (c)  the expected date of birth of the child is on or after 1 July 2011; and

                     (d)  the child is born before 1 July 2011; and

                     (e)  the person’s employer has not made an election under section 109 of that Act that applies to the person.

(2)       If, after the employer determination is made, the Secretary makes a payability determination that parental leave pay is payable to the person for the child, the notice given to the employer under section 113 of that Act must:

                     (a)  state the day the child was born; and

                     (b)  be dated as at the date the preparation of the notice was completed; and

                     (c)  contain a statement to the effect that the employer determination will be revoked, unless the employer:

                              (i)  agrees to being required to pay instalments to the person, even though the child was born before 1 July 2011; and

                             (ii)  gives the Secretary a written notice indicating that agreement within 14 days of the date referred to in paragraph (b).

(3)       If the employer does not give the notice referred to in subparagraph (2)(c)(ii) to the Secretary within that 14 day period, the following paragraphs have effect:

                     (a)  the Secretary must revoke the employer determination;

                     (b)  the revocation comes into force on the day of the revocation;

                     (c)  to avoid doubt, subsection 108(5) of that Act (which deals with giving notice of the revocation) applies in relation to the revocation;

                     (d)  section 103 of that Act (which deals with responding to a notice of an employer determination) is taken to have never applied in relation to the employer determination.

(4)       The following provisions of that Act  apply in relation to this item as if it were a provision of that Act:

                     (a)  section 275 (which deals with how that Act applies to an adopted child);

                     (b)  section 276 (which deals with how that Act applies to claims made in exceptional circumstances).

## 6  Existing notifications given under section 45 of the _Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988_

To avoid doubt, if:

                     (a)  a notice was given under section 45 of the _Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988_ before the commencement of this item instructing an employer to make periodic deductions from a person’s salary or wages; and

                     (b)  the notice was in force immediately before that commencement;

the notice continues in force after that commencement as if those salary or wages included the person’s instalments of parental leave pay.

## 7  Application of section 72AD of the _Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988_ to existing liabilities

To avoid doubt, section 72AD of the _Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988_ as inserted by this Act applies in relation to:

                     (a)  a liability of a kind referred to in subparagraph (1)(b)(i) of that section; or
