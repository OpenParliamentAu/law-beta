If, however, the head of a consular post before obtaining the<lf> exequatur  is admitted to the exercise of his functions<lf> provisionally, his precedence shall be determined according to the<lf> date of the provisional admission; this precedence shall be<lf> maintained after the granting of the exequatur.<lf>   3\. The order of precedence as between two or more heads of<lf> consular posts who obtained the exequatur  or provisional admission<lf> on the same date shall be determined according to the dates on which<lf> their commissions or similar instruments or the notifications<lf> referred to in paragraph 3 of Article 11 were presented to the<lf> receiving State.<lf>   4\. Acting heads of posts shall rank after all heads of consular<lf> posts and, as between themselves, they shall rank according to the<lf> dates on which they assumed their functions as acting heads of posts<lf> as indicated in the notifications given under paragraph 2 of Article<lf> 15.<lf>   5\. Honorary consular officers who are heads of consular posts<lf> shall rank in each class after career heads of consular posts, in<lf> the order and according to the rules laid down in the foregoing<lf> paragraphs.<lf>   6\.

In a State where the sending State has no diplomatic mission<lf> and is not represented by a diplomatic mission of a third State, a<lf> consular officer may, with the consent of the receiving State, and<lf> without affecting his consular status, be authorized to perform<lf> diplomatic acts. The performance of such acts by a consular officer<lf> shall not confer upon him any right to claim diplomatic privileges<lf> and immunities.<lf>   2\. A consular officer may, after notification addressed to the<lf> receiving State, act as representative of the sending State to any<lf> inter-governmental organization.<lf>   When so acting, he shall be entitled to enjoy any privileges and<lf> immunities accorded to such a representative by customary<lf> international law or by international agreements;<lf> however, in respect of the performance by him of any consular<lf> function, he shall not be entitled to any greater immunity from<lf> jurisdiction than that to which a consular officer is entitled under<lf> the present Convention.<lf>                          Article 18<lf>   Appointment of the same person by two or more States as a consular<lf> officer Two or more States may, with the consent of the receiving<lf> State, appoint the same person as a consular officer in that State.<lf>                          Article 19<lf>          Appointment of members of consular staff<lf>   1\. Subject to the provisions of Articles 20, 22 and 23, the<lf> sending State may freely appoint the members of the consular staff.<lf>   2\. The full name, category and class of all consular officers,<lf> other than the head of a consular post, shall be notified by the<lf> sending State to the receiving State in sufficient time for the<lf> receiving State, if it so wishes, to exercise its rights under<lf> paragraph 3 of Article 2<lf>   3.<lf>   3\. The sending State may, if required by its laws and regulations,<lf> request the receiving State to grant an exequatur  to a consular<lf> officer other than the head of a consular post.<lf>   4\. The receiving State may, if required by its laws and<lf> regulations, grant an exequatur  to a consular officer other than<lf> the head of a consular post.<lf>                           Article 20<lf>                  Size of the consular staff<lf>   In the absence of an express agreement as to the size of the<lf> consular staff, the receiving State may require that the size of the<lf> staff be kept within limits considered by it to be reasonable and<lf> normal, having regard to circumstances and conditions in the<lf> consular district and to the needs of the particular consular post.<lf>                             Article 21<lf>   Precedence as between consular officers of a consular post The<lf> order of precedence as between the consular officers of a consular<lf> post and any change thereof shall be notified by the diplomatic<lf> mission of the sending State or, if that State has no such mission<lf> in the receiving State, by the head of the consular post, to the<lf> Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the receiving State or to the<lf> authority designated by that Ministry.<lf>                             Article 22<lf>               Nationality of consular officers<lf>   1\. Consular officers should, in principle, have the nationality of<lf> the sending State.<lf>   2\. Consular officers may not be appointed from among persons<lf> having the nationality of the receiving State except with the<lf> express consent of that State which may be withdrawn at any time.<lf>   3\. The receiving State may reserve the same right with regard to<lf> nationals of a third State who are not also nationals of the sending<lf> State.<lf>                              Article 23<lf>                      Persons declared non grata<lf>   1\. The receiving State may at any time notify the sending State<lf> that a consular officer is persona non grata  or that any other<lf> member of the consular staff is not acceptable.

If a consular officer passes through or is in the territory of<lf> a third State, which has granted him a visa if a visa was necessary,<lf> while proceeding to take up or return to his post or<lf> when returning to the sending State, the third State shall accord to<lf> him all immunities provided for by the other Articles of the present<lf> Convention as may be required to ensure his transit or return. The<lf> same shall apply in the case of any member of his family forming<lf> part of his household enjoying such privileges and immunities who<lf> are accompanying the consular officer or travelling separately to<lf> join him or to return to the sending State.<lf>   2\. In circumstances similar to those specified in paragraph 1 of<lf> this Article, third States shall not hinder the transit through<lf> their territory of other members of the consular post or of members<lf> of their families forming part of their households.<lf>   3\.

The provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article shall not exclude<lf> the possibility of offices of other institutions or agencies being<lf> installed in part of the building in which the consular premises are<lf> situated, provided that the premises assigned to them are separate<lf> from those used by the consular post. In that event, the said<lf> offices shall not, for the purposes of the present Convention, be<lf> considered to form part of the consular premises.<lf>                            Article 56<lf>             Insurance against third party risks<lf>   Members of the consular post shall comply with any requirement<lf> imposed by the laws and regulations of the receiving State in<lf> respect of insurance against third party risks arising from the use<lf> of any vehicle, vessel or aircraft.<lf>                              Article 57<lf>      Special provisions concerning private gainful occupation<lf>   1\.
