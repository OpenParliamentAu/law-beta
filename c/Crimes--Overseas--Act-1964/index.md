## An Act relating to Offences committed by certain Persons outside Australia

##### <a id="1"></a>1  Short title [_see_ Note 1]

                   This Act may be cited as the _Crimes (Overseas) Act 1964_.

##### <a id="2"></a>2  Commencement [_see_ Note 1]

                   This Act shall come into operation on the day on which it receives the Royal Assent.

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Interpretation

                   In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears:

                    <a name="commonwealth-offic"></a>**_Commonwealth officer_** has the same meaning as in the _Crimes Act 1914-1960_.

                    <a name="non-citizen"></a>**_non-citizen_** means a person who is not an Australian citizen.

                    <a name="person-whom-act-appli"></a>**_person to whom this Act applies_** means an Australian citizen, or a non-citizen ordinarily resident in Australia, who is serving in a country outside Australia under arrangements made between the Commonwealth and the United Nations, but does not include a member of the Defence Force.

                    <a name="territori"></a>**_Territory_** means an internal Territory.

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Crimes committed overseas

                   If:

                     (a)  a person to whom this Act applies does or omits to do an act in a country outside Australia;

                     (b)  under arrangements between the United Nations and the government of that country, that person was not, on the date on which the act or omission took place, to be subject to proceedings in the courts of that country in respect of the act or omission; and

                     (c)  the act or omission, if it had taken place in the Jervis Bay Territory, would have been an offence against;

                              (i)  a law of the Commonwealth in force in that Territory;

                             (ii)  the _Crimes Act 1900_ of the Australian Capital Territory in its application to the Jervis Bay Territory; or

                            (iii)  the _Police Offences Act 1930_ of the Australian Capital Territory, in its application to the Jervis Bay Territory, as amended or affected by Ordinances from time to time in force in the Jervis Bay Territory;

that person is guilty of an offence against this Act and is punishable by the same penalty as that by which he would have been punishable if he had been guilty of the first-mentioned offence.

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Which offences are indictable

                   The question whether an offence against this Act is to be, or may be, prosecuted or dealt with on indictment or summarily shall be determined in accordance with the law that would be applicable in relation to a prosecution under the laws in force in the Jervis Bay Territory if the act or omission alleged to constitute the offence had occurred in the Jervis Bay Territory.

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Arrest of offenders

             (1)  A Commonwealth officer may, with such assistance as is necessary, arrest without warrant, outside Australia, a person to whom this Act applies if the officer has reasonable grounds for suspecting that the person has committed, is committing, has attempted to commit or is attempting to commit an offence against this Act.

             (2)  The Commonwealth officer, or a person authorized by him, may hold the person so arrested in custody until he can be brought before a Justice of the Peace or other proper authority in Australia to be dealt with in accordance with law.

             (3)  This section does not authorize the holding of a person in custody for a longer time than is reasonably necessary in the circumstances to enable him to be taken to Australia and there brought before a Justice of the Peace or other proper authority.

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Trial of offenders

             (1)  Subject to the succeeding provisions of this section, jurisdiction is conferred on the several courts of the States and Territories with respect to offences against this Act.

             (2)  The jurisdiction conferred on courts by the last preceding subsection is conferred within the limits (other than limits having effect by reference to the places at which offences are committed) of their several jurisdictions, but, in the case of a court of a State, subject to the conditions and restrictions specified in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of subsection (2) of section thirty-nine of the _Judiciary Act 1903-1960_.

             (3)  The jurisdiction conferred on a court of summary jurisdiction by this section shall not be judicially exercised except by a Chief, Police, Stipendiary, Resident or Special Magistrate.

             (4)  The trial on indictment of an offence against this Act may be held:

                     (a)  in any State; or

                     (b)  in any Territory in which a court having jurisdiction to try the offence may sit.

             (5)  Subject to this Act, the laws of a State or Territory with respect to the arrest and custody of offenders or persons charged with offences and the procedure for:

                     (a)  their summary conviction;

                     (b)  their examination and commitment for trial on indictment;

                     (c)  their trial and conviction on indictment; and

                     (d)  the hearing and determination of appeals arising out of any such trial or conviction or out of any proceedings connected therewith;

and for holding accused persons to bail apply, so far as they are applicable, to a person who is charged in that State or Territory with an offence against this Act.

             (6)  Where a person is convicted of an offence against this Act and the laws of the State or Territory in which he is convicted make no provision, or insufficient provision, for carrying out the penalty imposed in respect of the offence, the penalty shall be enforced or carried into effect as the Governor-General directs.

             (7)  Except as provided by this Act, the _Judiciary Act 1903-1960_ applies in relation to offences against this Act.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Evidence

                   A certificate by the Attorney-General:

                     (a)  that a person specified in the certificate was, on a date specified in the certificate, a person to whom this Act applies; and

                     (b)  that, on that date, that person was a person who, under arrangements referred to in paragraph (b) of section four of this Act, was not to be subject to proceedings in the courts of a country specified in the certificate in respect of acts or omissions taking place in that country;

is evidence of the matter certified to.
