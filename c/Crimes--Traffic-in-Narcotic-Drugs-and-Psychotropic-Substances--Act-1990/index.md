<center><u>Adopted by the Conference at its 6th plenary meeting, on 19 December 1988</u></center>
 <u>The Parties to this Convention</u>,
 <u>Deeply concerned</u> by the magnitude of and rising trend in the illicit production of, demand for and traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, which pose a serious threat to the health and welfare of human beings and adversely affect the economic, cultural and political foundations of society,
 <u>Deeply concerned</u> also by the steadily increasing inroads into various social groups made by illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, and particularly by the fact that children are used in many parts of the world as an illicit drug consumers market and for purposes of illicit production, distribution and trade in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, which entails a danger of incalculable gravity,
 <u>Recognizing</u> the links between illicit traffic and other related organized criminal activities which undermine the legitimate economies and threaten the stability, security and sovereignty of States,
 <u>Recognizing also</u> that illicit traffic is an international criminal activity, the suppression of which demands urgent attention and the highest priority,
 <u>Aware</u> that illicit traffic generates large financial profits and wealth enabling transnational criminal organizations to penetrate, contaminate and corrupt the structures of government, legitimate commercial and financial business, and society at all its levels,
 <u>Determined</u> to deprive persons engaged in illicit traffic of the proceeds of their criminal activities and thereby eliminate their main incentive for so doing,
 <u>Desiring</u> to eliminate the root causes of the problem of abuse of

 narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, including the illicit demand for such drugs and substances and the enormous profits derived from illicit traffic,

 <u>Determined</u> to improve international co-operation in the suppression of illicit traffic by sea,
 <u>Recognizing</u> that eradication of illicit traffic is a collective responsibility of all States and that, to that end, co-ordinated action within the framework of international co-operation is necessary,
 <u>Acknowledging</u> the competence of the United Nations in the field of control of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and desirous that the international organs concerned with such control should be within the framework of that Organization,
 <u>Reaffirming</u> the guiding principles of existing treaties in the field of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and the system of control which they embody,
 <u>Recognizing</u> the need to reinforce and supplement the measures provided in the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961, that Convention as amended by the 1972 Protocol Amending the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961, and the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances, in order to counter the magnitude and extent of illicit traffic and its grave consequences,
 <u>Recognizing also</u> the importance of strengthening and enhancing effective legal means for international co-operation in criminal matters for suppressing the international criminal activities of illicit traffic,
 <u>Desiring</u> to conclude a comprehensive, effective and operative international convention that is directed specifically against illicit traffic and that considers the various aspects of the problem as a whole, in particular those aspects not envisaged in the existing treaties in the field of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances,
 <u>Hereby agree</u> as follows:
