The Parties shall ensure that their courts and other<lf> competent authorities having jurisdiction can take into account<lf> factual circumstances which make the commission of the offences<lf> established in accordance with paragraph 1 of this article<lf> particularly serious, such as:<lf> (a) The involvement in the offence of an organized criminal<lf> group to which the offender belongs;<lf> (b) The involvement of the offender in other international<lf> organized criminal activities;<lf> (c) The involvement of the offender in other illegal activities<lf> facilitated by commission of the offence;<lf> (d) The use of violence or arms by the offender;<lf> (e) The fact that the offender holds a public office and that<lf> the offence is connected with the office in question;<lf> (f) The victimization or use of minors;<lf> (g) The fact that the offence is committed in a penal<lf> institution or in an educational institution or social service<lf> facility or in their immediate vicinity or in other places to<lf> which school children and students resort for educational,<lf> sports and social activities;<lf> (h) Prior conviction, particularly for similar offences,<lf> whether foreign or domestic, to the extent permitted under the<lf> domestic law of a Party.<lf> 6\. The Parties shall endeavour to ensure that any discretionary<lf> legal powers under their domestic law relating to the<lf> prosecution of persons for offences established in accordance<lf> with this article are exercised to maximize the effectiveness<lf> of law enforcement measures in respect of those offences and<lf> with due regard to the need to deter the commission of such<lf> offences.<lf> 7\. The Parties shall ensure that their courts or other<lf> competent authorities bear in mind the serious nature of the<lf> offences enumerated in paragraph 1 of this article and the<lf> circumstances enumerated in paragraph 5 of this article when<lf> considering the eventuality of early release or parole of<lf> persons convicted of such offences.<lf> 8\. Each Party shall, where appropriate, establish under its<lf> domestic law a long statute of limitations period in which to<lf> commence proceedings for any offence established in accordance<lf> with paragraph 1 of this article, and a longer period where the<lf> alleged offender has evaded the administration of justice.<lf> 

9\. Each Party shall take appropriate measures, consistent with<lf> its legal system, to ensure that a person charged with or<lf> convicted of an offence established in accordance with<lf> paragraph 1 of this article, who is found within its territory,<lf> is present at the necessary criminal proceedings.<lf> 10\. For the purpose of co-operation among the Parties under<lf> this Convention, including, in particular, co-operation under<lf> articles 5, 6, 7 and 9, offences established in accordance with<lf> this article shall not be considered as fiscal offences or as<lf> political offences or regarded as politically motivated,<lf> without prejudice to the constitutional limitations and the<lf> fundamental domestic law of the Parties.<lf> 11\. Nothing contained in this article shall affect the<lf> principle that the description of the offences to which it<lf> refers and of legal defences thereto is reserved to the<lf> domestic law of a Party and that such offences shall be<lf> prosecuted and punished in conformity with that law.<lf>                            Article 4<lf>                          JURISDICTION<lf> 1\.

Each Party:<lf> (a) Shall also take such measures as may be necessary to<lf> establish its jurisdiction over the offences it has established<lf> in accordance with article 3, paragraph 1, when the alleged<lf> offender is present in its territory and it does not extradite<lf> him to another Party on the ground:<lf> (i) That the offence has been committed in its territory or on<lf> board a vessel flying its flag or an aircraft which was<lf> registered under its law at the time the offence was committed;<lf> or<lf> (ii) That the offence has been committed by one of its<lf> nationals;<lf> (b) May also take such measures as may be necessary to<lf> establish its jurisdiction over the offences it has established<lf> in accordance with article 3, paragraph 1, when the alleged<lf> offender is present in its territory and it does not extradite<lf> him to another Party.<lf> 3\. This Convention does not exclude the exercise of any<lf> criminal jurisdiction established by a Party in accordance with<lf> its domestic law.<lf>                           Article 5<lf>                         CONFISCATION<lf> 1\.

(a) Proceeds or property confiscated by a Party pursuant to<lf> paragraph 1 or paragraph 4 of this article shall be disposed of<lf> by that Party according to its domestic law and administrative<lf> procedures.<lf> (b) When acting on the request of another Party in accordance<lf> with this article, a Party may give special consideration to<lf> concluding agreements on:<lf> (i) Contributing the value of such proceeds and property, or<lf> funds derived from the sale of such proceeds or property, or a<lf> substantial part thereof, to intergovernmental bodies<lf> specializing in the fight against illicit traffic in and abuse<lf> of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances;<lf> (ii) Sharing with other Parties, on a regular or case-by-case<lf> basis, such proceeds or property, or funds derived from the<lf> sale of such proceeds or property, in accordance with its<lf> domestic law, administrative procedures or bilateral or<lf> multilateral agreements entered into for this purpose.<lf> 6\. (a) If proceeds have been transformed or converted into<lf> other property, such property shall be liable to the measures<lf> referred to in this article instead of the proceeds.<lf> (b) If proceeds have been intermingled with property acquired<lf> from legitimate sources, such property shall, without prejudice<lf> to any powers relating to seizure or freezing, be liable to<lf> confiscation up to the assessed value of the intermingled<lf> proceeds.<lf> (c) Income or other benefits derived from:<lf> (i) Proceeds;<lf> (ii) Property into which proceeds have been transformed or<lf> converted; or<lf> (iii) Property with which proceeds have been intermingled shall<lf> also be liable to the measures referred to in this article, in<lf> the same manner and to the same extent as proceeds.<lf> 7\.

The provisions of this article shall not be construed as<lf> prejudicing the rights of bona fide third parties.<lf> 9\.

This article shall apply to the offences established by the<lf> Parties in accordance with article 3, paragraph 1.<lf> 2\. Each of the offences to which this article applies shall be<lf> deemed to be included as an extraditable offence in any<lf> extradition treaty existing between Parties. The Parties<lf> undertake to include such offences as extraditable offences in<lf> every extradition treaty to be concluded between them.<lf> 3\. If a Party which makes extradition conditional on the<lf> existence of a treaty receives a request for extradition from<lf> another Party with which it has no extradition treaty, it may<lf> consider this Convention as the legal basis for extradition in<lf> respect of any offence to which this article applies. The<lf> Parties which require detailed legislation in order to use this<lf> Convention as a legal basis for extradition shall consider<lf> enacting such legislation as may be necessary.<lf> 4\. The Parties which do not make extradition conditional on the<lf> existence of a treaty shall recognize offences to which this<lf> article applies as extraditable offences between themselves.<lf> 5\. Extradition shall be subject to the conditions provided for<lf> by the law of the requested Party or by applicable extradition<lf> treaties, including the grounds upon which the requested Party<lf> may refuse extradition.<lf> 6\. In considering requests received pursuant to this article,<lf> the requested State may refuse to comply with such requests<lf> where there are substantial grounds leading its judicial or<lf> other competent authorities to believe that compliance would<lf> facilitate the prosecution or punishment of any person on<lf> account of his race, religion, nationality or political<lf> opinions, or would cause prejudice for any of those reasons to<lf> any person affected by the request.<lf> 7\. The Parties shall endeavour to expedite extradition<lf> procedures and to simplify evidentiary requirements relating<lf> thereto in respect of any offence to which this article<lf> applies.<lf> 8\. Subject to the provisions of its domestic law and its<lf> extradition treaties, the requested Party may, upon being<lf> satisfied that the circumstances so warrant and are urgent, and<lf> at the request of the requesting Party, take a person whose<lf> extradition is sought and who is present in its territory into<lf> custody or take other appropriate measures to ensure his<lf> presence at extradition proceedings.<lf> 9\. Without prejudice to the exercise of any criminal<lf> jurisdiction established in accordance with its domestic law, a<lf> Party in whose territory an alleged offender is found shall:<lf> (a) If it does not extradite him in respect of an offence<lf> established in accordance with article 3, paragraph 1, on the<lf> grounds set forth in article 4, paragraph 2, subparagraph (a),<lf> submit the case to its competent authorities for the purpose of<lf> prosecution, unless otherwise agreed with the requesting Party;<lf> (b) If it does not extradite him in respect of such an offence<lf> and has established its jurisdiction in relation to that<lf> offence in accordance with article 4, paragraph 2, subparagraph<lf> (b), submit the case to its competent authorities for the<lf> purpose of prosecution, unless otherwise requested by the<lf> requesting Party for the purposes of preserving its legitimate<lf> jurisdiction.<lf> 10\. If extradition, sought for purposes of enforcing a<lf> sentence, is refused because the person sought is a national of<lf> the requested Party, the requested Party shall, if its law so<lf> permits and in conformity with the requirements of such law,<lf> upon application of the requesting Party, consider the<lf> enforcement of the sentence which has been imposed under the<lf> law of the requesting Party, or the remainder thereof.<lf> 11\. The Parties shall seek to conclude bilateral and<lf> multilateral agreements to carry out or to enhance the<lf> effectiveness of extradition.<lf> 12\. The Parties may consider entering into bilateral or<lf> multilateral agreements, whether ad hoc or general, on the<lf> transfer to their country of persons sentenced to imprisonment<lf> and other forms of deprivation of liberty for offences to which<lf> this article applies, in order that they may complete their<lf> sentences there.<lf>                             Article 7<lf>                      MUTUAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE<lf> 1\. The Parties shall afford one another, pursuant to this<lf> article, the widest measure of mutual legal assistance in<lf> investigations, prosecutions and judicial proceedings in<lf> relation to criminal offences established in accordance with<lf> article 3, paragraph 1.<lf> 2\.

The Parties may afford one another any other forms of mutual<lf> legal assistance allowed by the domestic law of the requested<lf> Party.<lf> 4\. Upon request, the Parties shall facilitate or encourage, to<lf> the extent consistent with their domestic law and practice, the<lf> presence or availability of persons, including persons in<lf> custody, who consent to assist in investigations or participate<lf> in proceedings.<lf> 5\. A Party shall not decline to render mutual legal assistance<lf> under this article on the ground of bank secrecy.<lf> 6\. The provisions of this article shall not affect the<lf> obligations under any other treaty, bilateral or multilateral,<lf> which governs or will govern, in whole or in part, mutual legal<lf> assistance in criminal matters.<lf> 7\. Paragraphs 8 to 19 of this article shall apply to requests<lf> made pursuant to this article if the Parties in question are<lf> not bound by a treaty of mutual legal assistance. If these<lf> Parties are bound by such a treaty, the corresponding<lf> provisions of that treaty shall apply unless the Parties agree<lf> to apply paragraphs 8 to 19 of this article in lieu thereof.<lf> <p>8\. Parties shall designate an authority, or when necessary<lf> authorities, which shall have the responsibility and power to<lf> execute requests for mutual legal assistance or to transmit<lf> them to the competent authorities for execution. The authority<lf> or the authorities designated for this purpose shall be<lf> notified to the Secretary-General. Transmission of requests for<lf> mutual legal assistance and any communication related thereto<lf> shall be effected between the authorities designated by the<lf> Parties; this requirement shall be without prejudice to the<lf> right of a Party to require that such requests and<lf> communications be addressed to it through the diplomatic<lf> channel and, in urgent circumstances, where the Parties agree,<lf> through channels of the International Criminal Police<lf> Organization, if possible.<lf> 9\. Requests shall be made in writing in a language acceptable<lf> to the requested Party. The language or languages acceptable to<lf> each Party shall be notified to the Secretary-General. In<lf> urgent circumstances, and where agreed by the Parties, requests<lf> may be made orally, but shall be confirmed in writing<lf> forthwith.<lf> 10\. A request for mutual legal assistance shall contain:<lf> (a) The identity of the authority making the request;<lf> (b) The subject matter and nature of the investigation,<lf> prosecution or proceeding to which the request relates, and the<lf> name and the functions of the authority conducting such<lf> investigation, prosecution or proceeding;<lf> (c) A summary of the relevant facts, except in respect of<lf> requests for the purpose of service of judicial documents;<lf> (d) A description of the assistance sought and details of any<lf> particular procedure the requesting Party wishes to be<lf> followed;<lf> (e) Where possible, the identity, location and nationality of<lf> any person concerned;<lf> (f)  The purpose for which the evidence, information or action<lf> is sought.<lf> 11\. The requested Party may request additional information when<lf> it appears necessary for the execution of the request in<lf> accordance with its domestic law or when it can facilitate such<lf> execution.<lf> 12\. A request shall be executed in accordance with the domestic<lf> law of the requested Party and, to the extent not contrary to<lf> the domestic law of the requested Party and where possible, in<lf> accordance with the procedures specified in the request.<lf> 13\. The requesting Party shall not transmit nor use information<lf> or evidence furnished by the requested Party for<lf> investigations, prosecutions or proceedings other than those<lf> stated in the request without the prior consent of the<lf> requested Party.<lf> 14\. The requesting Party may require that the requested Party<lf> keep confidential the fact and substance of the request, except<lf> to the extent necessary to execute the request. If the<lf> requested Party cannot comply with the requirement of<lf> confidentiality, it shall promptly inform the requesting Party.<lf> 15\. Mutual legal assistance may be refused:<lf> (a) If the request is not made in conformity with the<lf> provisions of this article;<lf> (b) If the requested Party considers that execution of the<lf> request is likely to prejudice its sovereignty, security, ordre<lf> public or other essential interests;<lf> (c) If the authorities of the requested Party would be<lf> prohibited by its domestic law from carrying out the action<lf> requested with regard to any similar offence, had it been<lf> subject to investigation, prosecution or proceedings under<lf> their own jurisdiction;<lf> (d) If it would be contrary to the legal system of the<lf> requested Party relating to mutual legal assistance for the<lf> request to be granted.<lf> 16\. Reasons shall be given for any refusal of mutual legal<lf> assistance.<lf> 17\. Mutual legal assistance may be postponed by the requested<lf> Party on the ground that it interferes with an ongoing<lf> investigation, prosecution or proceeding. In such a case, the<lf> requested Party shall consult with the requesting Party to<lf> determine if the assistance can still be given subject to such<lf> terms and conditions as the requested Party deems necessary.<lf> 18\. A witness, expert or other person who consents to give<lf> evidence in a proceeding or to assist in an investigation,<lf> prosecution or judicial proceeding in the territory of the<lf> requesting Party, shall not be prosecuted, detained, punished<lf> or<lf> subjected to any other restriction of his personal liberty in<lf> that territory in respect of acts, omissions or convictions<lf> prior to his departure from the territory of the requested<lf> Party. Such safe conduct shall cease when the witness, expert<lf> or other person having had, for a period of fifteen consecutive<lf> days, or for any period agreed upon by the Parties, from the<lf> date on which he has been officially informed that his presence<lf> is no longer required by the judicial authorities, an<lf> opportunity of leaving, has nevertheless remained voluntarily<lf> in the territory or, having left it, has returned of his own<lf> free will.<lf> 19\. The ordinary costs of executing a request shall be borne by<lf> the requested Party, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties<lf> concerned. If expenses of a substantial or extraordinary nature<lf> are or will be required to fulfil the request, the Parties<lf> shall consult to determine the terms and conditions under which<lf> the request will be executed as well as the manner in which the<lf> costs shall be borne.<lf> 20\. The Parties shall consider, as may be necessary, the<lf> possibility of concluding bilateral or multilateral agreements<lf> or arrangements that would serve the purposes of, give<lf> practical effect to, or enhance the provisions of this article.<lf>                           Article 8<lf>                   TRANSFER OF PROCEEDINGS<lf> The Parties shall give consideration to the possibility of<lf> transferring to one another proceedings for criminal<lf> prosecution of offences established in accordance with article<lf> 3, paragraph 1, in cases where such transfer is considered to<lf> be in the interests of a proper administration of justice.<lf>                            Article 9<lf>              OTHER FORMS OF CO-OPERATION AND TRAINING<lf> 1\.

The Parties shall take the measures they deem appropriate to<lf> prevent diversion of substances in Table I and Table II used<lf> for the purpose of illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs or<lf> psychotropic substances, and shall co-operate with one another<lf> to this end.<lf> 2\.  If a Party or the Board has information which in its<lf> opinion may require the inclusion of a substance in Table I or<lf> Table II, it shall notify the Secretary-General and furnish him<lf> with the information in support of that notification. The<lf> procedure described in paragraphs 2 to 7 of this article shall<lf> also apply when a Party or the Board has information justifying<lf> the deletion of a substance from Table I or Table II, or the<lf> transfer of a substance from one Table to the other.<lf> 3\. The Secretary-General shall transmit such notification, and<lf> any information which he considers relevant, to the Parties, to<lf> the Commission, and, where notification is made by a Party, to<lf> the Board. The Parties shall communicate their comments<lf> concerning the notification to the Secretary-General, together<lf> with all supplementary information which may assist the Board<lf> in establishing an assessment and the Commission in reaching a<lf> decision.<lf> 4\. If the Board, taking into account the extent, importance and<lf> diversity of the licit use of the substance, and the<lf> possibility and ease of using alternate substances both for<lf> licit purposes and for the illicit manufacture of narcotic<lf> drugs or psychotropic substances, finds:<lf> (a) That the substance is frequently used in the illicit<lf> manufacture of a narcotic drug or psychotropic substance;<lf> (b) That the volume and extent of the illicit manufacture of a<lf> narcotic drug or psychotropic substance creates serious public<lf> health or social problems, so as to warrant international<lf> action, it shall communicate to the Commission an assessment of<lf> the substance, including the likely effect of adding the<lf> substance to either Table I or Table II on both licit use and<lf> illicit manufacture, together with recommendations of<lf> monitoring measures, if any, that would be appropriate in the<lf> light of its assessment.<lf> 5\. The Commission, taking into account the comments submitted<lf> by the Parties and the comments and recommendations of the<lf> Board, whose assessment shall be determinative as to scientific<lf> matters, and also taking into due consideration any other<lf> relevant factors, may decide by a two-thirds majority of its<lf> members to place a substance in Table I or Table II.<lf> 6\. Any decision of the Commission taken pursuant to this<lf> article shall be communicated by the Secretary-General to all<lf> States and other entities which are, or which are entitled to<lf> become, Parties to this Convention, and to the Board. Such<lf> decision shall become fully effective with respect to each<lf> Party one hundred and eighty days after the date of such<lf> communication.<lf> 7\. (a) The decisions of the Commission taken under this article<lf> shall be subject to review by the Council upon the request of<lf> any Party filed within one hundred and eighty days after the<lf> date of notification of the decision. The request for review<lf> shall be sent to the Secretary-General, together with all<lf> relevant information upon which the request for review is<lf> based.<lf> (b) The Secretary-General shall transmit copies of the request<lf> for review and the relevant information to the Commission, to<lf> the Board and to all the Parties, inviting them to submit their<lf> comments within ninety days. All comments received shall be<lf> submitted to the Council for consideration.<lf> (c) The Council may confirm or reverse the decision of the<lf> Commission. Notification of the Council's decision shall be<lf> transmitted to all States and other entities which are, or<lf> which are entitled to become, Parties to this Convention, to<lf> the Commission and to the Board.<lf> 8\. (a) Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions<lf> contained in paragraph 1 of this article and the provisions of<lf> the 1961 Convention, the 1961 Convention as amended and the<lf> 1971 Convention, the Parties shall take the measures they deem<lf> appropriate to monitor the manufacture and distribution of<lf> substances in Table I and Table II which are carried out within<lf> their territory.<lf> (b) To this end, the Parties may:<lf> (i) Control all persons and enterprises engaged in the<lf> manufacture and distribution of such substances;<lf> (ii) Control under licence the establishment and premises in<lf> which such manufacture or distribution may take place;<lf> (iii) Require that licensees obtain a permit for conducting the<lf> aforesaid operations;<lf> (iv) Prevent the accumulation of such substances in the<lf> possession of manufacturers and distributors, in excess of the<lf> quantities required for the normal conduct of business and the<lf> prevailing market conditions.<lf> <p>9\. Each Party shall, with respect to substances in Table I and<lf> Table II, take the following measures:<lf> (a) Establish and maintain a system to monitor international<lf> trade in substances in Table I and Table II in order to<lf> facilitate the identification of suspicious transactions. Such<lf> monitoring systems shall be applied in close co-operation with<lf> manufacturers, importers, exporters, wholesalers and retailers,<lf> who shall inform the competent authorities of suspicious orders<lf> and transactions.<lf> (b) Provide for the seizure of any substance in Table I or<lf> Table II if there is sufficient evidence that it is for use in<lf> the illicit manufacture of a narcotic drug or psychotropic<lf> substance.<lf> (c) Notify, as soon as possible, the competent authorities and<lf> services of the Parties concerned if there is reason to believe<lf> that the import, export or transit of a substance in Table I or<lf> Table II is destined for the illicit manufacture of narcotic<lf> drugs or psychotropic substances, including in particular<lf> information about the means of payment and any other essential<lf> elements which led to that belief.<lf> (d) Require that imports and exports be properly labelled and<lf> documented. Commercial documents such as invoices, cargo<lf> manifests, customs, transport and other shipping documents<lf> shall include the names, as stated in Table I or Table II, of<lf> the substances being imported or exported, the quantity being<lf> imported or exported, and the name and address of the exporter,<lf> the importer and, when available, the consignee.<lf> (e) Ensure that documents referred to in subparagraph (d) of<lf> this paragraph are maintained for a period of not less than two<lf> years and may be made available for inspection by the competent<lf> authorities.<lf> 10\. (a) In addition to the provisions of paragraph 9, and upon<lf> request to the Secretary-General by the interested Party, each<lf> Party from whose territory a substance in Table I is to be<lf> exported shall ensure that, prior to such export, the following<lf> information is supplied by its competent authorities to the<lf> competent authorities of the importing country:<lf> (i) Name and address of the exporter and importer and, when<lf> available, the consignee;<lf> (ii) Name of the substance in Table I;<lf> (iii) Quantity of the substance to be exported;<lf> (iv) Expected point of entry and expected date of dispatch;<lf> (v) Any other information which is mutually agreed upon by the<lf> Parties.<lf> (b) A Party may adopt more strict or severe measures of control<lf> than those provided by this paragraph if, in its opinion, such<lf> measures are desirable or necessary.<lf> 11\. Where a Party furnishes information to another Party in<lf> accordance with paragraphs 9 and 10 of this article, the Party<lf> furnishing such information may require that the Party<lf> receiving it keep confidential any trade, business, commercial<lf> or professional secret or trade process.<lf> 12\. Each Party shall furnish annually to the Board, in the form<lf> and manner provided for by it and on forms made available by<lf> it, information on:<lf> (a) The amounts seized of substances in Table I and Table II<lf> and, when known, their origin;<lf> (b) Any substance not included in Table I or Table II which is<lf> identified as having been used in illicit manufacture of<lf> narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances, and which is deemed<lf> by the Party to be sufficiently significant to be brought to<lf> the attention of the Board;<lf> (c) Methods of diversion and illicit manufacture.<lf> 13\. The Board shall report annually to the Commission on the<lf> implementation of this article and the Commission shall<lf> periodically review the adequacy and propriety of Table I and<lf> Table II.<lf> 14\. The provisions of this article shall not apply to<lf> pharmaceutical preparations, nor to other preparations<lf> containing substances in Table I or Table II that are<lf> compounded in such a way that such substances cannot be easily<lf> used or recovered by readily applicable means.<lf>                            Article 13<lf>                      MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT<lf> The Parties shall take such measures as they deem appropriate<lf> to prevent trade in and the diversion of materials and<lf> equipment for illicit production or manufacture of narcotic<lf> drugs and psychotropic substances and shall co-operate to this<lf> end.<lf>                           Article 14<lf>       MEASURES TO ERADICATE ILLICIT CULTIVATION OF NARCOTIC<lf>        PLANTS AND TO ELIMINATE ILLICIT DEMAND FOR NARCOTIC<lf>                DRUGS AND PSYCHOTROPIC SUBSTANCES<lf> 1\. Any measures taken pursuant to this Convention by Parties<lf> shall not be less stringent than the provisions applicable to<lf> the eradication of illicit cultivation of plants containing<lf> narcotic and psychotropic substances and to the elimination of<lf> illicit demand for narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances<lf> under the provisions of the 1961 Convention, the 1961<lf> Convention as amended and the 1971 Convention.<lf> 2\. Each Party shall take appropriate measures to prevent<lf> illicit cultivation of and to eradicate plants containing<lf> narcotic or psychotropic substances, such as opium poppy, coca<lf> bush and cannabis plants, cultivated illicitly in its<lf> territory. The measures adopted shall respect fundamental human<lf> rights and shall take due account of traditional licit uses,<lf> where there is historic evidence of such use, as well as the<lf> protection of the environment.<lf> 3\. (a) The Parties may co-operate to increase the effectiveness<lf> of eradication efforts. Such co-operation may, inter alia,<lf> include support, when appropriate, for integrated rural<lf> development leading to economically viable alternatives to<lf> illicit cultivation. Factors such as access to markets, the<lf> availability of resources and prevailing socio-economic<lf> conditions should be taken into account before such rural<lf> development programmes are implemented. The Parties may agree<lf> on any other appropriate measures of co-operation.<lf> (b) The Parties shall also facilitate the exchange of<lf> scientific and technical information and the conduct of<lf> research concerning eradication.<lf> (c) Whenever they have common frontiers, the Parties shall seek<lf> to co-operate in eradication programmes in their respective<lf> areas along those frontiers.<lf> 4\. The Parties shall adopt appropriate measures aimed at<lf> eliminating or reducing illicit demand for narcotic drugs and<lf> psychotropic substances, with a view to reducing human<lf> suffering and eliminating financial incentives for illicit<lf> traffic. These measures may be based, inter alia, on the<lf> recommendations of the United Nations, specialized agencies of<lf> the United Nations such as the World Health Organization, and<lf> other competent international organizations, and on the<lf> Comprehensive Multidisciplinary Outline adopted by the<lf> International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking,<lf> held in 1987, as it pertains to governmental and<lf> non-governmental agencies and private efforts in the fields of<lf> prevention, treatment and rehabilitation. The Parties may enter<lf> into bilateral or multilateral agreements or arrangements aimed<lf> at eliminating or reducing illicit demand for narcotic drugs<lf> and psychotropic substances.<lf> 5\. The Parties may also take necessary measures for early<lf> destruction or lawful disposal of the narcotic drugs,<lf> psychotropic substances and substances in Table I and Table II<lf> which  have been seized or confiscated and for the<lf> admissibility as evidence of duly certified necessary<lf> quantities of such substances.<lf>                            Article 15<lf>                       COMMERCIAL CARRIERS<lf> 1\. The Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure that<lf> means of transport operated by commercial carriers are not used<lf> in the commission of offences established in accordance with<lf> article 3, paragraph 1; such measures may include special<lf> arrangements with commercial carriers.<lf> 2\. Each Party shall require commercial carriers to take<lf> reasonable precautions to prevent the use of their means of<lf> transport for the commission of offences established in<lf> accordance with article 3, paragraph 1\. Such precautions may<lf> include:<lf> (a) If the principal place of business of a commercial carrier<lf> is within the territory of the Party:<lf> (i) Training of personnel to identify suspicious consignments<lf> or persons;<lf> (ii) Promotion of integrity of personnel;<lf> (b) If a commercial carrier is operating within the territory<lf> of the Party:<lf> (i) Submission of cargo manifests in advance, whenever<lf> possible;<lf> (ii) Use of tamper-resistant, individually verifiable seals on<lf> containers;<lf> (iii) Reporting to the appropriate authorities at the earliest<lf> opportunity all suspicious circumstances that may be related to<lf> the commission of offences established in accordance with<lf> article 3, paragraph 1.<lf> 3\. Each Party shall seek to ensure that commercial carriers and<lf> the appropriate authorities at points of entry and exit and<lf> other customs control areas co-operate, with a view to<lf> preventing unauthorized access to means of transport and cargo<lf> and to implementing appropriate security measures.<lf>                             Article 16<lf>          COMMERCIAL DOCUMENTS AND LABELLING OF EXPORTS<lf> 1\. Each Party shall require that lawful exports of narcotic<lf> drugs and psychotropic substances be properly documented. In<lf> addition to the requirements for documentation under article 31<lf> of the 1961 Convention, article 31 of the 1961 Convention as<lf> amended and article 12 of the 1971 Convention, commercial<lf> documents such as invoices, cargo manifests, customs, transport<lf> and other shipping documents shall include the names of the<lf> narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances being exported as<lf> set out in the respective Schedules of the 1961 Convention, the<lf> 1961 Convention as amended and the 1971 Convention, the<lf> quantity being exported, and the name and address of the<lf> exporter, the importer and, when available, the consignee.<lf> 2\. Each Party shall require that consignments of narcotic drugs<lf> and psychotropic substances being exported be not mislabelled.<lf>                          Article 17<lf>                    ILLICIT TRAFFIC BY SEA<lf> 1\. The Parties shall co-operate to the fullest extent possible<lf> to suppress illicit traffic by sea, in conformity with the<lf> international law of the sea.<lf> 2\. A Party which has reasonable grounds to suspect that a<lf> vessel flying its flag or not displaying a flag or marks of<lf> registry is engaged in illicit traffic may request the<lf> assistance of other Parties in suppressing its use for that<lf> purpose. The Parties so requested shall render such assistance<lf> within the means available to them.<lf> 3\. A Party which has reasonable grounds to suspect that a<lf> vessel exercising freedom of navigation in accordance with<lf> international law and flying the flag or displaying marks of<lf> registry of another Party is engaged in illicit traffic may so<lf> notify the flag State, request confirmation of registry and, if<lf> confirmed, request authorization from the flag State to take<lf> appropriate measures in regard to that vessel.<lf> 4\. In accordance with paragraph 3 or in accordance with<lf> treaties in force between them or in accordance with any<lf> agreement or arrangement otherwise reached between those<lf> Parties, the flag State may authorize the requesting State to,<lf> inter alia:<lf> (a) Board the vessel;<lf> (b) Search the vessel;<lf> (c) If evidence of involvement in illicit traffic is found,<lf> take appropriate action with respect to the vessel, persons and<lf> cargo on board.<lf> 5\. Where action is taken pursuant to this article, the Parties<lf> concerned shall take due account of the need not to endanger<lf> the safety of life at sea, the security of the vessel and the<lf> cargo or to prejudice the commercial and legal interests of the<lf> flag State or any other interested State.<lf> 6\. The flag State may, consistent with its obligations in<lf> paragraph 1 of this article, subject its authorization to<lf> conditions to be mutually agreed between it and the requesting<lf> Party, including conditions relating to responsibility.<lf> 7\. For the purposes of paragraphs 3 and 4 of this article, a<lf> Party shall respond expeditiously to a request from another<lf> Party to determine whether a vessel that is flying its flag is<lf> entitled to do so, and to requests for authorization made<lf> pursuant to paragraph 3\. At the time of becoming a Party to<lf> this Convention, each Party shall designate an authority or,<lf> when necessary, authorities to receive and respond to such<lf> requests. Such designation shall be notified through the<lf> Secretary-General to all other Parties within one month of the<lf> designation.<lf> 8\. A Party which has taken any action in accordance with this<lf> article shall promptly inform the flag State concerned of the<lf> results of that action.<lf> 9\. The Parties shall consider entering into bilateral or<lf> regional agreements or arrangements to carry out, or to enhance<lf> the effectiveness of, the provisions of this article.<lf> 10\. Action pursuant to paragraph 4 of this article shall be<lf> carried out only by warships or military aircraft, or other<lf> ships or aircraft clearly marked and identifiable as being on<lf> government service and authorized to that effect.<lf> 11\. Any action taken in accordance with this article shall take<lf> due account of the need not to interfere with or affect the<lf> rights and obligations and the exercise of jurisdiction of<lf> coastal States in accordance with the international law of the<lf> sea.<lf>                            Article 18<lf>                  FREE TRADE ZONES AND FREE PORTS<lf> 1\. The Parties shall apply measures to suppress illicit traffic<lf> in narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances and substances in<lf> Table I and Table II in free trade zones and in free ports that<lf> are no less stringent than those applied in other parts of<lf> their territories.<lf> 2\. The Parties shall endeavour:<lf> (a) To monitor the movement of goods and persons in free trade<lf> zones and free ports, and, to that end, shall empower the<lf> competent authorities to search cargoes and incoming and<lf> outgoing vessels, including pleasure craft and fishing vessels,<lf> as well as aircraft and vehicles and, when appropriate, to<lf> search crew members, passengers and their baggage;<lf> (b) To establish and maintain a system to detect consignments<lf> suspected of containing narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances<lf> and substances in Table I and Table II passing into or out of<lf> free trade zones and free ports;<lf> (c) To establish and maintain surveillance systems in harbour<lf> and dock areas and at airports and border control points in<lf> free trade zones and free ports.<lf>                             Article 19<lf>                       THE USE OF THE MAILS<lf> 1\. In conformity with their obligations under the Conventions<lf> of the Universal Postal Union, and in accordance with the basic<lf> principles of their domestic legal systems, the Parties shall<lf> adopt measures to suppress the use of the mails for illicit<lf> traffic and shall co-operate with one another to that end.<lf> 2\.
