                     (b)  the court is satisfied that the offence, if committed, was committed in that other part of Australia;

the court must forthwith order that the proceedings on the indictment be discontinued and, if the jury has been empanelled, that the jury be discharged, and that the defendant appear before that court or another court of the first‑mentioned State or Territory at a specified time, not later than 28 days after the day on which the order is made, to be dealt with in accordance with this section.

                     (a)  discharging the defendant from the obligation to appear before that court at that time; and

                     (b)  directing:

                              (i)  if the defendant is held in custody—that he or she be released; or

                             (ii)  if he or she has been admitted to bail—that the recognizances upon which he or she was admitted to bail be discharged.

                     (a)  if the defendant is in custody—forthwith; or

                     (b)  in any other case—as soon as practicable after the time at which the defendant is to appear before that court;

make an order directing that the defendant be taken, as soon as practicable, in the custody of such person as it directs, to the part of Australia in which the indictment was filed and there be delivered to the custody of a person having authority to arrest the defendant, and may make such further orders as it thinks necessary for facilitating the carrying into effect of the first‑mentioned order.

                     (c)  the defendant is in custody;

the first‑mentioned court must, at that time, make an order directing that the defendant be released.

             (6)  Where an order has been made under subsection (1) in relation to an indictment, the proceedings on that indictment do not, and that order does not, prevent or prejudice any other indictment, or any information, against the defendant, whether on the same charge or on any other charge.

             (7)  The jurisdiction of a court under subsection (3), (4) or (5) may be exercised by the court constituted by a single judge or magistrate.

##### <a id="21"></a>21  Section 38 of Judiciary Act

                   A matter arising under this Act, including a question of interpretation of the Convention for the purposes of this Act, is not, for the purposes of section 38 of the _Judiciary Act 1903_, a matter arising directly under a treaty.

# Schedule 1—United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic In Narcotic Drugs And Psychotropic Substances

_Section 3_

<u>Adopted by the Conference at its 6th plenary meeting, on 19 December 1988</u>

<u>The Parties to this Convention</u>,

<u>Deeply concerned</u> by the magnitude of and rising trend in the illicit production of, demand for and traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, which pose a serious threat to the health and welfare of human beings and adversely affect the economic, cultural and political foundations of society,

<u>Deeply concerned</u> also by the steadily increasing inroads into various social groups made by illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, and particularly by the fact that children are used in many parts of the world as an illicit drug consumers market and for purposes of illicit production, distribution and trade in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, which entails a danger of incalculable gravity,

<u>Recognizing</u> the links between illicit traffic and other related organized criminal activities which undermine the legitimate economies and threaten the stability, security and sovereignty of States,

<u>Recognizing also</u> that illicit traffic is an international criminal activity, the suppression of which demands urgent attention and the highest priority,

<u>Aware</u> that illicit traffic generates large financial profits and wealth enabling transnational criminal organizations to penetrate, contaminate and corrupt the structures of government, legitimate commercial and financial business, and society at all its levels,

<u>Determined</u> to deprive persons engaged in illicit traffic of the proceeds of their criminal activities and thereby eliminate their main incentive for so doing,

<u>Desiring</u> to eliminate the root causes of the problem of abuse of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, including the illicit demand for such drugs and substances and the enormous profits derived from illicit traffic,

<u>Considering</u> that measures are necessary to monitor certain substances, including precursors, chemicals and solvents, which are used in the manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, the ready availability of which has led to an increase in the clandestine manufacture of such drugs and substances,

<u>Determined</u> to improve international co‑operation in the suppression of illicit traffic by sea,

<u>Recognizing</u> that eradication of illicit traffic is a collective responsibility of all States and that, to that end, co‑ordinated action within the framework of international co‑operation is necessary,

<u>Acknowledging</u> the competence of the United Nations in the field of control of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and desirous that the international organs concerned with such control should be within the framework of that Organization,

<u>Reaffirming</u> the guiding principles of existing treaties in the field of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and the system of control which they embody,

<u>Recognizing</u> the need to reinforce and supplement the measures provided in the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961, that Convention as amended by the 1972 Protocol Amending the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961, and the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances, in order to counter the magnitude and extent of illicit traffic and its grave consequences,

<u>Recognizing also</u> the importance of strengthening and enhancing effective legal means for international co‑operation in criminal matters for suppressing the international criminal activities of illicit traffic,

<u>Desiring</u> to conclude a comprehensive, effective and operative international convention that is directed specifically against illicit traffic and that considers the various aspects of the problem as a whole, in particular those aspects not envisaged in the existing treaties in the field of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances,

<u>Hereby agree</u> as follows:

2.  Each Party shall take appropriate measures to prevent illicit cultivation of and to eradicate plants containing narcotic or psychotropic substances, such as opium poppy, coca bush and cannabis plants, cultivated illicitly in its territory. The measures adopted shall respect fundamental human rights and shall take due account of traditional licit uses, where there is historic evidence of such use, as well as the protection of the environment.

3.   (a)    The Parties may co‑operate to increase the effectiveness of eradication efforts. Such co‑operation may, inter alia , include support, when appropriate, for integrated rural development leading to economically viable alternatives to illicit cultivation. Factors such as access to markets, the availability of resources and prevailing socio‑economic conditions should be taken into account before such rural development programmes are implemented. The Parties may agree on any other appropriate measures of co‑operation.

(b)   The Parties shall also facilitate the exchange of scientific and technical information and the conduct of research concerning eradication.

(c)   Whenever they have common frontiers, the Parties shall seek to co‑operate in eradication programmes in their respective areas along those frontiers.

4.  The Parties shall adopt appropriate measures aimed at eliminating or reducing illicit demand for narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, with a view to reducing human suffering and eliminating financial incentives for illicit traffic. These measures may be based, _inter alia_, on the recommendations of the United Nations, specialized agencies of the United Nations such as the World Health Organization, and other competent international organizations, and on the Comprehensive Multidisciplinary Outline adopted by the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, held in 1987, as it pertains to governmental and non‑governmental agencies and private efforts in the fields of prevention, treatment and rehabilitation. The Parties may enter into bilateral or multilateral agreements or arrangements aimed at eliminating or reducing illicit demand for narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.

5.  The Parties may also take necessary measures for early destruction or lawful disposal of the narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances and substances in Table I and Table II which have been seized or confiscated and for the admissibility as evidence of duly certified necessary quantities of such substances.

<u>Article 15</u> 

COMMERCIAL CARRIERS

2.  Each Party shall require commercial carriers to take reasonable precautions to prevent the use of their means of transport for the commission of offences established in accordance with article 3, paragraph 1\. Such precautions may include:

       (i)    Training of personnel to identify suspicious consignments or persons;

       (ii)   Promotion of integrity of personnel;

(b)   If a commercial carrier is operating within the territory of the Party:

       (i)    Submission of cargo manifests in advance, whenever possible;

       (ii)   Use of tamper‑resistant, individually verifiable seals on containers;

       (iii)  Reporting to the appropriate authorities at the earliest opportunity all suspicious circumstances that may be related to the commission of offences established in accordance with article 3, paragraph 1.

3.  Each Party shall seek to ensure that commercial carriers and the appropriate authorities at points of entry and exit and other customs control areas co‑operate, with a view to preventing unauthorized access to means of transport and cargo and to implementing appropriate security measures.

<u>Article 16</u>

COMMERCIAL DOCUMENTS AND LABELLING OF EXPORTS

1.  Each Party shall require that lawful exports of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances be properly documented. In addition to the requirements for documentation under article 31 of the 1961 Convention, article 31 of the 1961 Convention as amended and article 12 of the 1971 Convention, commercial documents such as invoices, cargo manifests, customs, transport and other shipping documents shall include the names of the narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances being exported as set out in the respective Schedules of the 1961 Convention, the 1961 Convention as amended and the 1971 Convention, the quantity being exported, and the name and address of the exporter, the importer and, when available, the consignee.

The Parties so requested shall render such assistance within the means available to them.

3.    A Party which has reasonable grounds to suspect that a vessel exercising freedom of navigation in accordance with international law and flying the flag or displaying marks of registry of another Party is engaged in illicit traffic may so notify the flag State, request confirmation of registry and, if confirmed, request authorization from the flag State to take appropriate measures in regard to that vessel.

4.    In accordance with paragraph 3 or in accordance with treaties in force between them or in accordance with any agreement or arrangement otherwise reached between those Parties, the flag State may authorize the requesting State to, _inter alia_:

(c)   If evidence of involvement in illicit traffic is found, take appropriate action with respect to the vessel, persons and cargo on board.

5.    Where action is taken pursuant to this article, the Parties concerned shall take due account of the need not to endanger the safety of life at sea, the security of the vessel and the cargo or to prejudice the commercial and legal interests of the flag State or any other interested State.

6.    The flag State may, consistent with its obligations in paragraph 1 of this article, subject its authorization to conditions to be mutually agreed between it and the requesting Party, including conditions relating to responsibility.

7.    For the purposes of paragraphs 3 and 4 of this article, a Party shall respond expeditiously to a request from another Party to determine whether a vessel that is flying its flag is entitled to do so, and to requests for authorization made pursuant to paragraph 3\. At the time of becoming a Party to this Convention, each Party shall designate an authority or, when necessary, authorities to receive and respond to such requests. Such designation shall be notified through the Secretary‑General to all other Parties within one month of the designation.

8.    A Party which has taken any action in accordance with this article shall promptly inform the flag State concerned of the results of that action.

9.    The Parties shall consider entering into bilateral or regional agreements or arrangements to carry out, or to enhance the effectiveness of, the provisions of this article.

10.  Action pursuant to paragraph 4 of this article shall be carried out only by warships or military aircraft, or other ships or aircraft clearly marked and identifiable as being on government service and authorized to that effect.
