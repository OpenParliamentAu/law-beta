  (4) Subject to subsection (5), the interim dumping duty payable on goods the subject of a notice under subsection 269TG (1) or (2) of the Customs Act is an amount equal to the sum of:<lf>   (a) the difference between the export price of goods of that kind as ascertained, or last ascertained, by the Minister for the purpose of the notice and the normal value of goods of that kind as so ascertained, or last so ascertained;
