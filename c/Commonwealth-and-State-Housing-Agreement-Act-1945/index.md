(3) Each advance shall bear interest at a rate not exceeding the rate payable in respect of the long term Commonwealth Public Loan last raised prior to the date of the advance, or if a Loan is being raised at the date of any advance then that advance shall bear interest at the rate of interest to be paid in respect of the long term Loan then being raised. 

7.  (1)   Each State shall at least fourteen days before the first days of January, March, June and September in each year notify the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of all housing projects which it proposes to commence in the ensuing period of three months and in respect of the dwellings included in that housing project or projects shall furnish particulars to the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of the proposed nature and type and estimated cost of each dwelling or group of dwellings. 

(2) Each State shall within a reasonable time after the end of each such period of three months notify the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of the progress of the housing project and shall within a reasonable time after the completion of each housing project notify the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of the capital cost of each dwelling or group of dwellings erected and the economic rent of each of the dwellings. 

8.  The Commonwealth shall use its best endeavours to enable the States to obtain supplies of building materials and labour required by the States for the carrying out of their housing projects. 

9.  Each State shall in accordance with principles to be agreed upon from time to time between the Treasurer of the Commonwealth and the Treasurer of the State allocate dwellings amongst persons who are in need of proper housing accommodation and so that in each allocation not less than such number of dwellings erected in each financial year as shall from time to time be agreed upon between the Treasurer of the Commonwealth and the Treasurer of the State shall be allotted to members or discharged members of the Forces, or persons who are serving or served in the Merchant Navy during the war or the dependants of members or discharged members of the Forces or of such persons or widows of deceased members or deceased discharged members of the Forces or of such persons. 

10.  (1)   The weekly rent of dwellings shall be calculated in manner provided in the First Schedule to this Agreement. The amount so calculated is in this Agreement referred to as the “economic rent”. 

(2) The provisions for calculation of the economic rent as set out in the First Schedule to this Agreement may from time to time be varied in respect of any particular State by agreement between the Treasurer of the Commonwealth and the Treasurer of that State but so that any such agreement shall have no force or effect unless the Treasurers of all the States agree to the variation. 

11.  (1)   Each State agrees that tenants of dwellings may be granted a rebate of rent calculated in such manner as may from time to time be agreed upon between the Treasurer of the Commonwealth and the Treasurer of the State and unless and until otherwise agreed, in the manner provided in this clause (but so that in no case shall the rent of a dwelling be less than eight shillings per week), that is to say:—

(a)   if the family income of the tenant is equal to the basic wage the rebate shall be an amount equivalent to the sum by which the economic rent of the dwelling exceeds one‑fifth of the family income; 

(b)   if the family income of a tenant is less than the basic wage the rebate which would have been granted if the family income had been equal to the basic wage shall be increased by one‑quarter of the amount by which the family income is less than the basic wage; and 

(c)   if the family income exceeds the basic wage the rebate which would have been granted if the family income had been equal to the basic wage shall be decreased by one‑third of the amount by which the family income exceeds the basic wage. 

If any rebate as so calculated is not a multiple of sixpence, the rebate shall be the next lowest multiple of sixpence. 

(2) Any agreement between the Treasurer of the Commonwealth and the Treasurer of a State providing with respect to that State for the alteration of the manner in which a rebate of rental is to be calculated shall have no force or effect unless the Treasurers of all the States agree to such alteration. 

(3) No rebate of rent shall be granted in respect of any dwelling except upon application by the tenant and after a proper investigation of the family income of the tenant or if the housing authority thinks fit upon production by the tenant of evidence to the satisfaction of the housing authority of the family income which evidence may be by way of Statutory Declaration or otherwise as the housing authority may in any particular case decide. If any rebate is granted, then at the expiration of a period of six months after the granting thereof, the rebate shall cease to be granted and the economic rent of the dwelling shall be charged, unless the tenant makes application for the grant of a rebate and the housing authority, after proper investigation or the production of evidence as aforesaid as the housing authority thinks fit, is satisfied that, in pursuance of this Agreement, the rebate should be granted. Notwithstanding the aforesaid provisions, the housing authority may at any time investigate the family income of a tenant, and may decide that the rebate should be varied or should cease to be granted. 

(4) The agreement of tenancy in respect of any dwelling in respect of which any rebate of rent is granted shall provide that the rent of the dwelling shall be the economic rent thereof calculated in manner provided by the First Schedule to this Agreement, but subject to such a rebate ascertained as provided by this Agreement as may be granted from time to time by the housing authority. 

12.  (1)   The family income of a tenant of a dwelling shall for the purposes of clause 11 comprise the total of the following:— 

(a)   the whole of the weekly income of that one of the following persons who has the highest weekly income, namely, the tenant, the spouse of the tenant, and any person resident in the dwelling who is related to the tenant or the spouse of the tenant; 

(b)   two‑thirds of the weekly income of that one of the persons mentioned in paragraph (a) of this sub‑clause who has the next highest weekly income; 

(c)   one‑third of the weekly income of every other person such as is mentioned in paragraph (a) of this sub‑clause whose weekly income or any part thereof has not previously been included in the weekly income computed as aforesaid, but so that, in any such case, not more than thirty shillings of the weekly income of any person to whom this paragraph refers shall be included, and where the weekly income of any such person is less than ten shillings the income of that person shall be excluded in computing the family income; and 

(d)   one‑third of the weekly income of any person living with the tenant and resident in the dwelling (not being the spouse of the tenant or a person who is related to the tenant or the spouse of the tenant) whose weekly income, in the opinion of the housing authority, should be included in the weekly income, but so that, in any such case, not more than thirty shillings of the weekly income of any such person shall be included, and where the weekly income of any such person is less than ten shillings the income of that person shall be excluded in computing the family income. 

(2) In this clause weekly income of any person includes all income received by that person from whatsoever source, and includes the value of any allowances made to that person by his or her employer, but does not include any amount received under the _Child Endowment Act 1941‑1945_ of the Commonwealth, or the _Maternity Allowance Act 1912‑1943_ of the Commonwealth. In computing the weekly income of any person no allowance shall be made for taxation or other statutory deductions or payments, or superannuation payments and all such deductions and payments shall be deemed to be part of the weekly income. 

(3) For the purposes of this clause, a person who has been adopted by any other person shall be deemed to be related to that other person. 

(4) If pursuant to the order of any Court or pursuant to any separation agreement, the tenant and the spouse of the tenant are living apart or, if the housing authority is satisfied that the tenant (if a woman) has been deserted by her spouse, the weekly income of the spouse shall not be included in the family income for the purposes of this clause unless the housing authority is of opinion that that weekly income should be so included. 

(5) If at any time it is necessary to ascertain the weekly income of any person for the purposes of this clause and the housing authority is of opinion that, at that time, the weekly income is more or is less than the weekly income usually received by that person, the weekly income of that person shall, for the purposes of this clause, be presumed to be the usual weekly income of that person except in a case where the housing authority is of opinion that such a presumption would cause undue hardship. 

13.  The housing authority shall be responsible for the maintenance in good repair and condition of dwellings leased and their equipment. 

14.  (1)   A dwelling may be sold by a State at any time after its completion but except with the consent in writing of the Treasurer of the Commonwealth a dwelling shall not be sold at or for a price less than the capital cost of the dwelling ascertained in accordance with the provisions of the First Schedule to this Agreement: Provided that the total repayments of principal (included in the annual amortization allowance mentioned in sub‑paragraph (a) of paragraph 4 of the First Schedule to this Agreement) in respect of the dwelling may be regarded as part of the purchase price. 

(2) The State shall pay to the Commonwealth the full purchase price of the dwelling payable by the purchaser. 

(3) Any loss resulting from the sale of a dwelling as provided in sub‑clause (1) of this clause shall be included as a separate item in the annual statement supplied by the Treasurer of the State to Treasurer of the Commonwealth as provided in paragraph 1 of the Second Schedule to this Agreement and shall be borne as to three‑fifths by the Commonwealth and as to two‑fifths by the State. 

(4) This Agreement shall as from the date of sale of a dwelling cease to apply to that dwelling. 

15.  (1)   With the object of assisting each of the States in the administration of its housing projects, the Commonwealth subject to the State observing the provisions of this Agreement on its part to be observed will after the end of each financial year concerned contribute to each State a portion of any losses incurred in that financial year by the State in or in connexion with the administration by the State of its housing projects. Any such loss shall be ascertained in manner provided by the Second Schedule to this Agreement. 

(2) The provisions for calculation of the manner of ascertaining losses incurred by a State in respect of its housing projects as set out in the Second Schedule to this Agreement may from time to time be varied by agreement between the Treasurer of the Commonwealth and the Treasurer of the State but so that any such agreement shall have no force or effect unless the Treasurers of all the States agree to such variation. 

(3) In respect of the cost incurred in or in connexion with the provision by a State of community facilities associated with any housing project under this Agreement the Treasurer of the Commonwealth and the Treasurer of the State may enter into an arrangement providing for a contribution by the Commonwealth of such amount as may be agreed upon between them. 

16.  (1)   Subject as provided in sub‑clause (2) of this clause, this Agreement shall as between the Commonwealth and each State apply (in addition to a housing project carried out by a State after the third day of December, 1943, and before the date of this Agreement) to housing projects commenced or carried out during the period of ten years commencing on the date on which this Agreement between the Commonwealth and that State shall come into force. 

(2) Either the Commonwealth or a State may give to the other twelve calendar months’ notice in writing that this Agreement shall not as between the Commonwealth and that State apply to any housing project commenced after the expiration of a period of twelve calendar months after the date of the notice and thereupon this Agreement shall not apply to any housing project commenced by that State after the expiration of the said period of twelve calendar months. 

17.  Any notice or communication to be given or made by the Commonwealth to a State under this Agreement shall be deemed to have been duly given or made if signed by or on behalf of the Prime Minister and sent by prepaid post addressed to the Premier of the State and any notice or communication to be given or made by a State to the Commonwealth under this Agreement shall be deemed to have been duly given or made if signed by or on behalf of the Premier of the State and sent by prepaid post addressed to the Prime Minister. 

# The First Schedule to the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement  [_see_ Note 5]

PROVISIONS FOR CALCULATION OF ECONOMIC RENTS

1.  The capital cost of any housing project carried out by a housing authority shall be the total of the following amounts: 

(a)   the amount expended by the housing authority in the construction of the dwellings included in the housing project (including the provision of fencing, sewerage and other services), and in the construction of any outbuildings, and in carrying out any improvements on the land appurtenant to the dwellings; 

(b)   any interest paid or payable during the course of construction by the housing authority on the amounts expended as provided in sub‑paragraph (a) of this paragraph; 

(c)   any costs incurred or assessed by way of fees or salaries paid or payable to architects, clerks of works, surveyors or other persons, by the housing authority in the sub‑division of the land comprised in the housing project, in the design of the housing project or the dwellings comprised therein, the supervision of the construction of the dwellings, or in carrying out any other works necessary to prepare and complete the housing project; 

(d)   any administration costs incurred or assessed by the housing authority in the carrying out of the housing project or the construction of the dwellings comprised therein or incurred or assessed in the purchase of the land upon which the housing project is carried out, but so that the total of all such costs shall not exceed ten shillings per centum of the amount referred to in sub‑paragraph (a) of this paragraph or such other percentage as may from time to time be agreed upon by the Treasurer of the Commonwealth and the Treasurer of a State; 

(e)   the cost of the land upon which the housing project is carried out (including land dedicated or otherwise set apart for streets, roads or thoroughfares or for parks, gardens, reserves or other public open spaces) together with any interest paid or payable by the housing authority upon the purchase price of the land from the time of the purchase thereof until the completion of the housing project, and together with any local government, water, sewerage or other rates and taxes paid or payable by the housing authority in respect of the said land during the said period (whether any such rates and taxes are payable to the Government of the State or otherwise): Provided that the amount of the said cost in respect of land dedicated or set apart for parks, gardens, reserves or other public open spaces which may be included in the capital cost shall not exceed fifteen per centum of the cost of all the land referred to in this sub‑paragraph, or such other percentage as may from time to time be agreed between the Treasurer of the Commonwealth and the Treasurer of a State; 

(f)   the cost incurred by the housing authority for the purposes of forming, making, paving, kerbing or draining any streets, roads or thoroughfares for the purpose of the housing project; and 

(g)   the cost incurred by the housing authority of draining or otherwise making suitable for the purpose of the housing project, any land comprised in the housing project. 

2.  The capital cost of any dwelling included in a housing project shall be ascertained as follows:— 

(a)   If all the dwellings included in the housing project provide the same or substantially the same accommodation and are of the same kind of construction, the capital cost of each dwelling shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the capital cost of the housing project by the number of dwellings included therein. 

(b)   If more than one type of dwelling is included in the housing project and so that the accommodation provided in each type is substantially different from the accommodation provided in the other types of dwellings, the capital cost of the dwellings of each type which are of the same kind of construction shall be the total of— 

(i)    the quotient obtained by dividing the total of the amounts mentioned in sub‑paragraphs (a) and (b) of paragraph 1 of this Schedule and expended or paid or payable for the purpose of the construction of dwellings of that type and of that kind of construction, by the total number of dwellings of that type and of that kind of construction; and 

(ii)   the quotient obtained by dividing the total of the amounts mentioned in sub‑paragraphs (c) to (g) (inclusive) of paragraph 1 of this Schedule, by the total number of dwellings included in the housing project. 

(c)   If dwellings of more than one kind of construction are included in the housing project, the capital cost of dwellings of each kind of construction shall be ascertained in the manner provided by sub‑paragraph (b) of this paragraph and the provisions of that sub‑paragraph shall _mutatis mutandis_ apply accordingly. 

3.  If at any time it is necessary for the housing authority to ascertain the capital cost of a dwelling and to fix the economic rent thereof, and by reason of the non‑completion of the whole of the housing project in which the dwelling is comprised or for any other reason, the capital cost cannot be ascertained exactly, the housing authority shall make an estimate of the probable capital cost of the dwelling and fix the economic rent of the dwelling upon that estimate. The actual capital cost of the dwelling shall be ascertained by the housing authority as soon as may be and, if the actual capital cost differs from the estimated capital cost, the economic rent of the dwelling shall be varied accordingly. 

4.  The economic rent of any dwelling shall be calculated by the housing authority according to the following formula:—

(a)   The amortization allowance shall be an amount which is sufficient to make provision for the repayment to the Commonwealth of the advance concerned and interest thereon as provided for by clause 6 of this Agreement. The amortization allowance shall be so computed that the capital cost shall be recouped to the housing authority together with interest on the capital cost or any outstanding balance thereof, by means of equal annual instalments of principal and interest during the whole period for the amortization of the capital cost. 

(b)   The amount to be included for maintenance shall be the amount fixed by the housing authority from time to time. The amount so fixed shall, except when varied by the housing authority, be constant over the amortization period in respect of the dwelling and be an amount which, in the opinion of the housing authority, will be sufficient to provide for reasonable maintenance charges likely to be incurred throughout the amortization period. 

(c)   The amount to be included for rates and taxes shall be such amount as the housing authority from time to time considers sufficient to meet the payments of local government, water, sewerage and other rates and of taxes levied upon the dwelling and its appurtenant land. 

(d)   The amount to be included as insurance shall be such amount as the housing authority from time to time considers sufficient to provide for the purpose, but shall not exceed the appropriate basic premium rates from time to time determined by the War Service Homes Commissioner with respect to property insured in pursuance of section 38 of the _War Service Homes Act 1918_ of the Commonwealth as amended from time to time.

(e)   The amount to be included for administration shall be such amount, not exceeding five pounds per dwelling per annum, as is fixed from time to time by the housing authority. 

(f)   The amount to be fixed as the economic rent shall, if the amount fixed according to the formula is not a multiple of sixpence, be the next higher amount being such a multiple. 

5.  Subject to compliance with the other provisions of this Schedule, the housing authority may from time to time vary the economic rent payable in respect of any dwelling. 

6.  The housing authority may fix as the economic rent of any dwelling a sum which is greater or less than the amount which, in accordance with the formula in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, should be fixed as the economic rent, but the total of all rents fixed as economic rents for all dwellings in all the housing projects of the housing authority completed at the time of fixation shall be not less than the amount which would be the total of all economic rents fixed for all those dwellings if fixed in accordance with the formula in paragraph 4 of this Schedule.

# The Second Schedule to the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement 

MANNER OF ASCERTAINING LOSSES INCURRED BY A STATE IN OR IN CONNEXION WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF HOUSING PROJECTS

The following provisions shall apply for the purpose of preparing any such statement. 

2.  The basis on which any such statement shall be prepared for any such losses ascertained in respect of any financial year shall be the basis of cash receipts and payments for that financial year.
