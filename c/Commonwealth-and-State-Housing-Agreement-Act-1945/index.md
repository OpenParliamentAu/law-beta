The housing authority shall be responsible for the maintenance in<lf> good repair and condition of dwellings leased and their equipment.<lf> 14\. (1) A dwelling may be sold by a State at any time after its<lf> completion but except with the consent in writing of the Treasurer of<lf> the Commonwealth a dwelling shall not be sold at or for a price less<lf> than the capital cost of the dwelling ascertained in accordance with the<lf> provisions of the First Schedule to this Agreement: Provided that the<lf> total repayments of principal (included in the annual amortization<lf> allowance mentioned in sub-paragraph (a) of paragraph 4 of the First<lf> Schedule to this Agreement) in respect of the dwelling may be regarded<lf> as part of the purchase price.<lf> (2) The State shall pay to the Commonwealth the full purchase price of<lf> the dwelling payable by the purchaser.<lf> (3) Any loss resulting from the sale of a dwelling as provided in<lf> sub-clause (1) of this clause shall be included as a separate item in<lf> the annual statement supplied by the Treasurer of the State to Treasurer<lf> of the Commonwealth as provided in paragraph 1 of the Second Schedule to<lf> this Agreement and shall be borne as to three-fifths by the Commonwealth<lf> and as to two-fifths by the State.<lf> (4) This Agreement shall as from the date of sale of a dwelling cease to<lf> apply to that dwelling.<lf> 15\.

Any such loss shall be ascertained in manner provided<lf> by the Second Schedule to this Agreement.<lf> (2) The provisions for calculation of the manner of ascertaining losses<lf> incurred by a State in respect of its housing projects as set out in the<lf> Second Schedule to this Agreement may from time to time be varied by<lf> agreement between the Treasurer of the Commonwealth and the Treasurer of<lf> the State but so that any such agreement shall have no force or effect<lf> unless the Treasurers of all the States agree to such variation.<lf> (3) In respect of the cost incurred in or in connexion with the<lf> provision by a State of community facilities associated with any housing<lf> project under this Agreement the Treasurer of the Commonwealth and the<lf> Treasurer of the State may enter into an arrangement providing for a<lf> contribution by the Commonwealth of such amount as may be agreed upon<lf> between them.<lf> 16\.

The capital cost of any dwelling included in a housing project shall<lf> be ascertained as follows:-<lf> (a) If all the dwellings included in the housing project provide the<lf> same or substantially the same accommodation and are of the same kind of<lf> construction, the capital cost of each dwelling shall be the quotient<lf> obtained by dividing the capital cost of the housing project by the<lf> number of dwellings included therein.<lf> (b) If more than one type of dwelling is included in the housing project<lf> and so that the accommodation provided in each type is substantially<lf> different from the accommodation provided in the other types of<lf> dwellings, the capital cost of the dwellings of each type which are of<lf> the same kind of construction shall be the total of -<lf> (i) the quotient obtained by dividing the total of the amounts mentioned<lf> in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of paragraph 1 of this Schedule and<lf> expended or paid or payable for the purpose of the construction of<lf> dwellings of that type and of that kind of construction, by the total<lf> number of dwellings of that type and of that kind of construction; and<lf> (ii) the quotient obtained by dividing the total of the amounts<lf> mentioned in sub-paragraphs (c) to (g) (inclusive) of paragraph 1 of<lf> this Schedule, by the total number of dwellings included in the housing<lf> project.<lf> (c) If dwellings of more than one kind of construction are included in<lf> the housing project, the capital cost of dwellings of each kind of<lf> construction shall be ascertained in the manner provided by<lf> sub-paragraph (b) of this paragraph and the provisions of that<lf> sub-paragraph shall mutatis mutandis apply accordingly.<lf> 3\. If at any time it is necessary for the housing authority to ascertain<lf> the capital cost of a dwelling and to fix the economic rent thereof, and<lf> by reason of the non-completion of the whole of the housing project in<lf> which the dwelling is comprised or for any other reason, the capital<lf> cost cannot be ascertained exactly, the housing authority shall make an<lf> estimate of the probable capital cost of the dwelling and fix the<lf> economic rent of the dwelling upon that estimate. The actual capital<lf> cost of the dwelling shall be ascertained by the housing authority as<lf> soon as may be and, if the actual capital cost differs from the<lf> estimated capital cost, the economic rent of the dwelling shall be<lf> varied accordingly.<lf> 4\. The economic rent of any dwelling shall be calculated by the housing<lf> authority according to the following formula:-<lf> (a) Annual amortization allowance to provide for payment of interest (at<lf> the appropriate rate payable by the State to the Commonwealth) on the<lf> capital cost of the dwelling over 53 years or over such shorter period<lf> as may be agreed upon according to clause 6 of this Agreement and<lf> repayment of principal<lf> (b) Maintenance<lf> (c) Rates and taxes<lf> (d) Insurance<lf> Sub-total<lf> Vacancies and defaults (5 per cent. of sub-total)<lf> (e) Administration<lf> Annual Rent<lf> (f) Economic rent (7/365 of annual rent)<lf> (a) The amortization allowance shall be an amount which is sufficient to<lf> make provision for the repayment to the Commonwealth of the advance<lf> concerned and interest thereon as provided for by clause 6 of this<lf> Agreement. The amortization allowance shall be so computed that the<lf> capital cost shall be recouped to the housing authority together with<lf> interest on the capital cost or any outstanding balance thereof, by<lf> means of equal annual instalments of principal and interest during the<lf> whole period for the amortization of the capital cost.<lf> (b) The amount to be included for maintenance shall be the amount fixed<lf> by the housing authority from time to time. The amount so fixed shall,<lf> except when varied by the housing authority, be constant over the<lf> amortization period in respect of the dwelling and be an amount which,<lf> in the opinion of the housing authority, will be sufficient to provide<lf> for reasonable maintenance charges likely to be incurred throughout the<lf> amortization period.<lf> 

(c) The amount to be included for rates and taxes shall be such amount<lf> as the housing authority from time to time considers sufficient to meet<lf> the payments of local government, water, sewerage and other rates and of<lf> taxes levied upon the dwelling and its appurtenant land.<lf> (d) The amount to be included as insurance shall be such amount as the<lf> housing authority from time to time considers sufficient to provide for<lf> the purpose, but shall not exceed the appropriate basic premium rates<lf> from time to time determined by the War Service Homes Commissioner with<lf> respect to property insured in pursuance of section 38 of the War<lf> Service Homes Act 1918*5* of the Commonwealth as amended from time to<lf> time.<lf> (e) The amount to be included for administration shall be such amount,<lf> not exceeding five pounds per dwelling per annum, as is fixed from time<lf> to time by the housing authority.<lf> (f) The amount to be fixed as the economic rent shall, if the amount<lf> fixed according to the formula is not a multiple of sixpence, be the<lf> next higher amount being such a multiple.<lf> 5\. Subject to compliance with the other provisions of this Schedule, the<lf> housing authority may from time to time vary the economic rent payable<lf> in respect of any dwelling.<lf> 6\. The housing authority may fix as the economic rent of any dwelling a<lf> sum which is greater or less than the amount which, in accordance with<lf> the formula in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, should be fixed as the<lf> economic rent, but the total of all rents fixed as economic rents for<lf> all dwellings in all the housing projects of the housing authority<lf> completed at the time of fixation shall be not less than the amount<lf> which would be the total of all economic rents fixed for all those<lf> dwellings if fixed in accordance with the formula in paragraph 4 of this<lf> Schedule.<lf>   THE SECOND SCHEDULE TO THE COMMONWEALTH AND STATE HOUSING AGREEMENT<lf>   MANNER OF ASCERTAINING LOSSES INCURRED BY A STATE IN OR IN CONNEXION<lf>               WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF HOUSING PROJECTS<lf> 1\. As soon as practicable after the end of each financial year, the<lf> Treasurer of the State shall supply to the Treasurer of the Commonwealth<lf> a statement showing the amount of any losses incurred by the State<lf> during the financial year in respect of its housing projects. The<lf> following provisions shall apply for the purpose of preparing any such<lf> statement.<lf> 2\. The basis on which any such statement shall be prepared for any such<lf> losses ascertained in respect of any financial year shall be the basis<lf> of cash receipts and payments for that financial year.<lf> 3\. The statement shall be divided into two parts, one headed "Receipts"<lf> and the other headed "Payments".<lf> 4\. The part headed "Receipts" shall consist of the following:-<lf> (a) the amounts actually received during that financial year as rents<lf> from tenants of all dwellings included in the housing projects; and<lf> (b) any other amounts actually received as revenue during that financial<lf> year from the housing projects.<lf> 5\. The part headed "Payments" shall consist of the following:-<lf> (a) the total of any amounts paid by the housing authorities during that<lf> financial year for the administration costs of the housing authorities<lf> in respect of the letting and management of dwellings included in the<lf> housing projects, and otherwise in the administration and management of<lf> the housing projects but not including any administration costs included<lf> as part of the capital costs of any dwellings;<lf> (b) the total of any amounts paid by the housing authorities during that<lf> financial year for the maintenance of the dwellings included in the<lf> housing projects and any land appurtenant to any such dwellings;<lf> (c) the total of any amounts paid by the housing authorities during that<lf> financial year by way of local government, water or sewerage, or other<lf> rates or by way of taxes payable in respect of the dwellings included in<lf> the housing projects, or any land appurtenant to any such dwellings, and<lf> whether any such rates or taxes were paid to the Government of the State<lf> or otherwise;<lf> (d) the total of any amounts paid by the housing authorities during that<lf> financial year to rebuild or repair any dwelling included in the housing<lf> projects which has been destroyed or damaged by fire or otherwise;<lf> (e) the total of any amounts paid by the housing authorities during that<lf> financial year as interest on any loan advanced to the housing<lf> authorities by the State for the purpose of carrying out any housing<lf> project and which has not been included as part of the capital cost of<lf> the housing project; and<lf> (f) the total of any amounts paid by the housing authorities in<lf> repayment of any loan advanced to them by the State for the purpose of<lf> carrying out any housing project.<lf> 6\. If the total of the part headed "Payments" exceeds the total of the<lf> part headed "Receipts" the total of the part headed "Receipts" shall be<lf> subtracted from the total of the part headed "Payments" and the sum so<lf> obtained shall be deemed to be the loss incurred by the State in that<lf> year and shall be allocated as to three-fifths to the Commonwealth and<lf> as to two-fifths to the State.<lf> 7\. Any statement made pursuant to this Schedule shall be certified as<lf> correct by the Auditor-General of the State.<lf> 8\. For the purpose of ascertaining any loss incurred during any<lf> financial year in respect of housing projects the receipts and payments<lf> in respect of that financial year only shall be taken into account and<lf> no regard shall be had to any receipts and payments in any previous<lf> financial year received or made by the housing authority, the<lf> Commonwealth, or the State.<lf> *3* Schedule - The agreement executed under the authority of the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement Act 1945 has been varied by the agreement approved by the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement Act 1955 and set out in the Schedule to that Act.
