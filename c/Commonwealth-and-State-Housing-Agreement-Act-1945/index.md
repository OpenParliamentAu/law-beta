The amortisation allowance shall be so computed that the capital cost shall be recouped to the housing authority together with interest on the capital cost or any outstanding balance thereof, by means of equal annual instalments of principal and interest during the whole period for the amortisation of the capital cost.<lf> <lf>   (b)  The amount to be included for maintenance shall be the amount fixed by the housing authority from time to time. The amount so fixed shall, except when varied by the housing authority, be constant over the amortisation period in respect of the dwelling and be an amount which, in the opinion of the housing authority, will be sufficient to provide for reasonable maintenance charges likely to be incurred throughout the amortisation period.<lf> <lf>   (c)  The amount to be included for rates and taxes shall be such amount as the housing authority from time to time considers sufficient to meet the payments of local government, water, sewerage and other rates and of taxes levied upon the dwelling and its appurtenant land.<lf> <lf>   (d)  The amount to be included as insurance shall be such amount as the housing authority from time to time considers sufficient to provide for the purpose, but shall not exceed the appropriate basic premium rates from time to time determined by the War Service Homes Commissioner with respect to property insured in pursuance of section 38 of the War Service Homes Act 1918 of the Commonwealth as amended from time to time.<lf> <lf>   (e)  The amount to be included for administration shall be such amount, not exceeding five pounds per dwelling per annum, as is fixed from time to time by the housing authority.<lf> <lf>   (f)  The amount to be fixed as the economic rent shall, if the amount fixed according to the formula is not a multiple of sixpence, be the next higher amount being such a multiple.<lf> <lf>   5\. Subject to compliance with the other provisions of this Schedule, the housing authority may from time to time vary the economic rent payable in respect of any dwelling.<lf> <lf>   6\. The housing authority may fix as the economic rent of any dwelling a sum which is greater or less than the amount which, in accordance with the formula in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, should be fixed as the economic rent, but the total of all rents fixed as economic rents for all dwellings in all the housing projects of the housing authority completed at the time of fixation shall be not less than the amount which would be the total of all economic rents fixed for all those dwellings if fixed in accordance with the formula in paragraph 4 of this Schedule.<lf> <lf>                                   -----------<lf> <lf>       THE SECOND SCHEDULE TO THE COMMONWEALTH AND STATE HOUSING AGREEMENT<lf> MANNER OF ASCERTAINING LOSSES INCURRED BY A STATE IN OR IN CONNEXION WITH THE<lf>                        ADMINISTRATION OF HOUSING PROJECTS<lf> <lf>   1\.

The part headed ''Receipts'' shall consist of the following:-<lf> <lf>   (a)  the amounts actually received during that financial year as rents from tenants of all dwellings included in the housing projects; and<lf> <lf>   (b)  any other amounts actually received as revenue during that financial year from the housing projects.<lf> <lf>   5\. The part headed ''Payments'' shall consist of the following:-<lf> <lf>   (a)  the total of any amounts paid by the housing authorities during that flnancial year for the administration costs of the housing authorities in respect of the letting and management of dwellings included in the housing projects, and otherwise in the administration and management of the housing projects but not including any administration costs included as part of the capital costs of any dwellings;<lf> <lf>   (b)  the total of any amounts paid by the housing authorities during that financial year for the maintenance of the dwellings included in the housing projects and any land appurtenant to any such dwellings;<lf> <lf>   (c)  the total of any amounts paid by the housing authorities during that financial year by way of local government, water or sewerage, or other rates or by way of taxes payable in respect of the dwellings included in the housing projects, or any land appurtenant to any such dwellings, and whether any such rates or taxes were paid to the Government of the State or otherwise;<lf> <lf>   (d)  the total of any amounts paid by the housing authorities during that financial year to rebuild or repair any dwelling included in the housing projects which has been destroyed or damaged by fire or otherwise;<lf> <lf>   (e)  the total of any amounts paid by the housing authorities during that financial year as interest on any loan advanced to the housing authorities by the State for the purpose of carrying out any housing project and which has not been included as part of the capital cost of the housing project; and<lf> <lf>   (f)  the total of any amounts paid by the housing authorities in repayment of any loan advanced to them by the State for the purpose of carrying out any housing project.<lf> <lf> <p>  6\. If the total of the part headed ''Payments'' exceeds the total of the part headed ''Receipts'' the total of the part headed ''Receipts'' shall be subtracted from the total of the part headed ''Payments'' and the sum so obtained shall be deemed to be the loss incurred by the State in that year and shall be allocated as to three-fifths to the Commonwealth and as to two-fifths to the State.<lf> <lf>   7\. Any statement made pursuant to this Schedule shall be certified as correct by the Auditor-General of the State.<lf> <lf>   8\. For the purpose of ascertaining any loss incurred during any financial year in respect of housing projects the receipts and payments in respect of that financial year only shall be taken into account and no regard shall be had to any receipts and payments in any previous financial year received or made by the housing authority, the Commonwealth, or the State.<lf> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -- <lf> </lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></p></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></p></lf></p></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></p></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf>
