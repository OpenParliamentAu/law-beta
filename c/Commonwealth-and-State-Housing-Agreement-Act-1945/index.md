In computing the<lf> weekly income of any person no allowance shall be made for taxation or other<lf> statutory deductions or payments, or superannuation payments and all such<lf> deductions and payments shall be deemed to be part of the weekly income.<lf> <p>  (3) For the purposes of this clause, a person who has been adopted by any<lf> other person shall be deemed to be related to that other person.<lf> <p>  (4) If pursuant to the order of any Court or pursuant to any separation<lf> agreement, the tenant and the spouse of the tenant are living apart or, if the<lf> housing authority is satisfied that the tenant (if a woman) has been deserted by her spouse, the weekly income of the spouse shall not be included in the family<lf> income for the purposes of this clause unless the housing authority is of<lf> opinion that that weekly income should be so included.<lf> <p>  (5) If at any time it is necessary to ascertain the weekly income of any<lf> person for the purposes of this clause and the housing authority is of opinion<lf> that, at that time, the weekly income is more or is less than the weekly income<lf> usually received by that person, the weekly income of that person shall, for the purposes of this clause, be presumed to be the usual weekly income of that<lf> person except in a case where the housing authority is of opinion that such a<lf> presumption would cause undue hardship.<lf> <p>  13\. The housing authority shall be responsible for the maintenance in good<lf> repair and condition of dwellings leased and their equipment.<lf> <p>  14\. (1) A dwelling may be sold by a State at any time after its completion but except with the consent in writing of the Treasurer of the Commonwealth a<lf> dwelling shall not be sold at or for a price less than the capital cost of the<lf> dwelling ascertained in accordance with the provisions of the First Schedule to<lf> this Agreement: Provided that the total repayments of principal (included in the annual amortization allowance mentioned in sub-paragraph (a) of paragraph 4 of<lf> the First Schedule to this Agreement) in respect of the dwelling may be regarded as part of the purchase price.<lf> <p>  (2) The State shall pay to the Commonwealth the full purchase price of the<lf> dwelling payable by the purchaser.<lf> <p>  (3) Any loss resulting from the sale of a dwelling as provided in sub-clause<lf> (1) of this clause shall be included as a separate item in the annual statement<lf> supplied by the Treasurer of the State to Treasurer of the Commonwealth as<lf> provided in paragraph 1 of the Second Schedule to this Agreement and shall be<lf> borne as to three-fifths by the Commonwealth and as to two-fifths by the State.<lf> <p>  (4) This Agreement shall as from the date of sale of a dwelling cease to apply to that dwelling.<lf> <p>  15\. (1) With the object of assisting each of the States in the administration<lf> of its housing projects, the Commonwealth subject to the State observing the<lf> provisions of this Agreement on its part to be observed will after the end of<lf> each financial year concerned contribute to each State a portion of any losses<lf> incurred in that financial year by the State in or in connexion with the<lf> administration by the State of its housing projects. Any such loss shall be<lf> ascertained in manner provided by the Second Schedule to this Agreement.<lf> <p>  (2) The provisions for calculation of the manner of ascertaining losses<lf> incurred by a State in respect of its housing projects as set out in the Second<lf> Schedule to this Agreement may from time to time be varied by agreement between<lf> the Treasurer of the Commonwealth and the Treasurer of the State but so that any such agreement shall have no force or effect unless the Treasurers of all the<lf> States agree to such variation.<lf> <p>  (3) In respect of the cost incurred in or in connexion with the provision by a State of community facilities associated with any housing project under this<lf> Agreement the Treasurer of the Commonwealth and the Treasurer of the State may<lf> enter into an arrangement providing for a contribution by the Commonwealth of<lf> such amount as may be agreed upon between them.<lf> <p>  16\.

Any notice or communication to be given or made by the Commonwealth to a<lf> State under this Agreement shall be deemed to have been duly given or made if<lf> signed by or on behalf of the Prime Minister and sent by prepaid post addressed<lf> to the Premier of the State and any notice or communication to be given or made<lf> by a State to the Commonwealth under this Agreement shall be deemed to have been duly given or made if signed by or on behalf of the Premier of the State and<lf> sent by prepaid post addressed to the Prime Minister.<lf> <p>                                  -----------<lf> <lf>                 THE  FIRST  SCHEDULE  TO  THE  COMMONWEALTH  AND<lf>                             STATE HOUSING AGREEMENT<lf> <lf>                   PROVISIONS FOR CALCULATION OF ECONOMIC RENTS<lf> <lf>   1\. The capital cost of any housing project carried out by a housing authority<lf> shall be the total of the following amounts:<lf> <lf>   (a) the amount expended by the housing authority in the construction of the<lf> dwellings included in the housing project (including the provision of fencing,<lf> sewerage and other services), and in the construction of any outbuildings, and<lf> in carrying out any improvements on the land appurtenant to the dwellings;<lf> <lf>   (b) any interest paid or payable during the course of construction by the<lf> housing authority on the amounts expended as provided in sub-paragraph (a) of<lf> this paragraph;<lf> <lf>   (c) any costs incurred or assessed by way of fees or salaries paid or payable<lf> to architects, clerks of works, surveyors or other persons, by the housing<lf> authority in the sub-division of the land comprised in the housing project, in<lf> the design of the housing project or the dwellings comprised therein, the<lf> supervision of the construction of the dwellings, or in carrying out any other<lf> works necessary to prepare and complete the housing project;<lf> <lf>   (d)  any administration costs incurred or assessed by the housing authority in the carrying out of the housing project or the construction of the dwellings<lf> comprised therein or incurred or assessed in the purchase of the land upon which the housing project is carried out, but so that the total of all such costs<lf> shall not exceed ten shillings per centum of the amount referred to in<lf> sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph or such other percentage as may from time to time be agreed upon by the Treasurer of the Commonwealth and the Treasurer of a<lf> State;<lf> <lf>   (e)  the cost of the land upon which the housing project is carried out<lf> (including land dedicated or otherwise set apart for streets, roads or<lf> thoroughfares or for parks, gardens, reserves, or other public open spaces)<lf> together with any interest paid or payable by the housing authority upon the<lf> purchase price of the land from the time of the purchase thereof until the<lf> completion of the housing project, and together with any local government,<lf> water, sewerage or other rates and taxes paid or payable by the housing<lf> authority in respect of the said land during the said period (whether any such<lf> rates and taxes are payable to the Government of the State or otherwise):<lf> Provided that the amount of the said cost in respect of land dedicated or set<lf> apart for parks, gardens, reserves or other public open spaces which may be<lf> included in the capital cost shall not exceed fifteen per centum of the cost of<lf> all the land referred to in this sub-paragraph, or such other percentage as may<lf> from time to time be agreed between the Treasurer of the Commonwealth and the<lf> Treasurer of a State;<lf> <lf>   (f)  the cost incurred by the housing authority for the purposes of forming,<lf> making, paving, kerbing or draining any streets, roads or thoroughfares for the<lf> purpose of the housing project; and<lf> <lf>   (g)  the cost incurred by the housing authority of draining or otherwise<lf> making suitable for the purpose of the housing project, any land comprised in<lf> the housing project.<lf> <p>  2\. The capital cost of any dwelling included in a housing project shall be<lf> ascertained as follows:-<lf> <lf>   (a)  If all the dwellings included in the housing project provide the same or<lf> substantially the same accommodation and are of the same kind of construction,<lf> the capital cost of each dwelling shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the capital cost of the housing project by the number of dwellings included therein. <p>  (b)  If more than one type of dwelling is included in the housing project and<lf> so that the accommodation provided in each type is substantially different from<lf> the accommodation provided in the other types of dwellings, the capital cost of<lf> the dwellings of each type which are of the same kind of construction shall be<lf> the total of-<lf> <lf>       (i)  the quotient obtained by dividing the total of the amounts mentioned<lf> in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of paragraph 1 of this Schedule and expended or<lf> paid or payable for the purpose of the construction of dwellings of that type<lf> and of that kind of construction, by the total number of dwellings of that type<lf> and of that kind of construction; and<lf> <lf>      (ii)  the quotient obtained by dividing the total of the amounts mentioned<lf> in sub-paragraphs (c) to (g) (inclusive) of paragraph 1 of this Schedule, by the total number of dwellings included in the housing project.<lf> <p>  (c)  If dwellings of more than one kind of construction are included in the<lf> housing project, the capital cost of dwellings of each kind of construction<lf> shall be ascertained in the manner provided by sub-paragraph (b) of this<lf> paragraph and the provisions of that sub-paragraph shall mutatis mutandis apply<lf> accordingly.<lf> <p>  3\. If at any time it is necessary for the housing authority to ascertain the<lf> capital cost of a dwelling and to fix the economic rent thereof, and by reason<lf> of the non-completion of the whole of the housing project in which the dwelling<lf> is comprised or for any other reason, the capital cost cannot be ascertained<lf> exactly, the housing authority shall make an estimate of the probable capital<lf> cost of the dwelling and fix the economic rent of the dwelling upon that<lf> estimate. The actual capital cost of the dwelling shall be ascertained by the<lf> housing authority as soon as may be and, if the actual capital cost differs from the estimated capital cost, the economic rent of the dwelling shall be varied<lf> accordingly.<lf> <p>  4\. The economic rent of any dwelling shall be calculated by the housing<lf> authority according to the following formula:-<lf> <lf>   (a)  Annual amortization allowance to provide for payment of<lf> interest (at the appropriate rate payable by the State to the<lf> Commonwealth) on the capital cost of the dwelling over 53 years<lf> or over such shorter period as may be agreed upon according to<lf> clause 6 of this Agreement and repayment of principal . . . . . . ----------- (b)  Maintenance  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ----------- (c)  Rates and taxes  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ----------- (d)  Insurance  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ----------- Sub-total  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ----------- Vacancies and defaults (5 per cent. of sub-total)  . . . . . ----------- (e) Administration . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ----------- Annual Rent  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -----------   (f) Economic rent (7/365 of annual rent) . . . . . . . . . . . -----------<lf>   (a)  The amortization allowance shall be an amount which is sufficient to make provision for the repayment to the Commonwealth of the advance concerned and<lf> interest thereon as provided for by clause 6 of this Agreement. The amortization allowance shall be so computed that the capital cost shall be recouped to the<lf> housing authority together with interest on the capital cost or any outstanding<lf> balance thereof, by means of equal annual instalments of principal and interest<lf> during the whole period for the amortization of the capital cost.<lf> <p>  (b)  The amount to be included for maintenance shall be the amount fixed by<lf> the housing authority from time to time. The amount so fixed shall, except when<lf> varied by the housing authority, be constant over the amortization period in<lf> respect of the dwelling and be an amount which, in the opinion of the housing<lf> authority, will be sufficient to provide for reasonable maintenance charges<lf> likely to be incurred throughout the amortization period.<lf> <p>  (c)  The amount to be included for rates and taxes shall be such amount as the housing authority from time to time considers sufficient to meet the payments of local government, water, sewerage and other rates and of taxes levied upon the<lf> dwelling and its appurtenant land.<lf> <p>  (d)  The amount to be included as insurance shall be such amount as the<lf> housing authority from time to time considers sufficient to provide for the<lf> purpose, but shall not exceed the appropriate basic premium rates from time to<lf> time determined by the War Service Homes Commissioner with respect to property<lf> insured in pursuance of section 38 of the War Service Homes Act 1918*5* of the<lf> Commonwealth as amended from time to time.<lf> <p>  (e)  The amount to be included for administration shall be such amount, not<lf> exceeding five pounds per dwelling per annum, as is fixed from time to time by<lf> the housing authority.<lf> <p>  (f)  The amount to be fixed as the economic rent shall, if the amount fixed<lf> according to the formula is not a multiple of sixpence, be the next higher<lf> amount being such a multiple.<lf> <p>  5\. Subject to compliance with the other provisions of this Schedule, the<lf> housing authority may from time to time vary the economic rent payable in<lf> respect of any dwelling.<lf> <p>  6\. The housing authority may fix as the economic rent of any dwelling a sum<lf> which is greater or less than the amount which, in accordance with the formula<lf> in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, should be fixed as the economic rent, but the<lf> total of all rents fixed as economic rents for all dwellings in all the housing<lf> projects of the housing authority completed at the time of fixation shall be not less than the amount which would be the total of all economic rents fixed for<lf> all those dwellings if fixed in accordance with the formula in paragraph 4 of<lf> this Schedule.<lf> <p>                                  -----------<lf> <lf>       THE SECOND SCHEDULE TO THE COMMONWEALTH AND STATE HOUSING AGREEMENT<lf> <lf> MANNER OF ASCERTAINING LOSSES INCURRED BY A STATE IN OR IN CONNEXION WITH THE<lf>                        ADMINISTRATION OF HOUSING PROJECTS<lf> <lf>   1\. As soon as practicable after the end of each financial year, the Treasurer<lf> of the State shall supply to the Treasurer of the Commonwealth a statement<lf> showing the amount of any losses incurred by the State during the financial year in respect of its housing projects. The following provisions shall apply for the purpose of preparing any such statement.<lf> <p>  2\. The basis on which any such statement shall be prepared for any such losses ascertained in respect of any financial year shall be the basis of cash receipts and payments for that financial year.<lf> <p>  3\. The statement shall be divided into two parts, one headed  "Receipts" and<lf> the other headed  "Payments ".<lf> <p>  4\. The part headed  "Receipts"  shall consist of the following:-<lf> <lf>   (a)  the amounts actually received during that financial year as rents from<lf> tenants of all dwellings included in the housing projects; and<lf> <lf>   (b)  any other amounts actually received as revenue during that financial year from the housing projects.<lf> <p>  5\. The part headed  "Payments"  shall consist of the following:-<lf> <lf>   (a)  the total of any amounts paid by the housing authorities during that<lf> financial year for the administration costs of the housing authorities in<lf> respect of the letting and management of dwellings included in the housing<lf> projects, and otherwise in the administration and management of the housing<lf> projects but not including any administration costs included as part of the<lf> capital costs of any dwellings;<lf> <lf>   (b)  the total of any amounts paid by the housing authorities during that<lf> financial year for the maintenance of the dwellings included in the housing<lf> projects and any land appurtenant to any such dwellings;<lf> <lf>   (c)  the total of any amounts paid by the housing authorities during that<lf> financial year by way of local government, water or sewerage, or other rates or<lf> by way of taxes payable in respect of the dwellings included in the housing<lf> projects, or any land appurtenant to any such dwellings, and whether any such<lf> rates or taxes were paid to the Government of the State or otherwise;<lf> <lf>   (d)  the total of any amounts paid by the housing authorities during that<lf> financial year to rebuild or repair any dwelling included in the housing<lf> projects which has been destroyed or damaged by fire or otherwise;<lf> <lf>   (e)  the total of any amounts paid by the housing authorities during that<lf> financial year as interest on any loan advanced to the housing authorities by<lf> the State for the purpose of carrying out any housing project and which has not<lf> been included as part of the capital cost of the housing project; and<lf> <lf>   (f)  the total of any amounts paid by the housing authorities in repayment of<lf> any loan advanced to them by the State for the purpose of carrying out any<lf> housing project.<lf> <p>  6\. If the total of the part headed  "Payments"  exceeds the total of the part<lf> headed  "Receipts"  the total of the part headed  "Receipts"  shall be<lf> subtracted from the total of the part headed  "Payments"  and the sum so<lf> obtained shall be deemed to be the loss incurred by the State in that year and<lf> shall be allocated as to three-fifths to the Commonwealth and as to two-fifths<lf> to the State.<lf> <p>  7\. Any statement made pursuant to this Schedule shall be certified as correct<lf> by the Auditor-General of the State.<lf> <p>  8\. For the purpose of ascertaining any loss incurred during any financial year in respect of housing projects the receipts and payments in respect of that<lf> financial year only shall be taken into account and no regard shall be had to<lf> any receipts and payments in any previous financial year received or made by the housing authority, the Commonwealth, or the State.<lf> <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -- <lf> *3* Sch.-The agreement executed under the authority of the Commonwealth and<lf> State Housing Agreement Act 1945 has been varied by the agreement approved by<lf> the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement Act 1955 and set out in the<lf> Schedule to that Act.
