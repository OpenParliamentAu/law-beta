##### <a id="48"></a>48  Determination of number of members of House of Representatives to be chosen in States and Territories

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2G), the Electoral Commissioner shall, as soon as possible after he or she has ascertained, in accordance with section 46, the numbers of the people of the Commonwealth and of the several States and Territories:

                     (a)  determine, in accordance with subsection (2), the number of members of the House of Representatives to be chosen in the several States at a general election; and

                     (b)  determine, in accordance with subsections (2A), (2B), (2C) and (2F), the number of members (if any) of the House of Representatives to be chosen in the several Territories at a general election.

             (2)  The number of members of the House of Representatives to be chosen in the several States at a general election shall, subject to the Constitution, be determined by the Electoral Commissioner in the following manner:

                     (a)  a quota shall be ascertained by dividing the number of people of the Commonwealth, as ascertained in accordance with section 46, by twice the number of the senators for the States;

                     (b)  the number of members to be chosen in each State shall be determined by dividing the number of people of the State, as ascertained in accordance with section 46, by the quota and, if on such division there is a remainder greater than one-half of the quota, one more member shall be chosen in the State.

          (2A)  The Electoral Commissioner shall divide the number of people of each Territory, as ascertained in accordance with section 46, by the quota ascertained under paragraph (2)(a) and, subject to subsections (2B), (2C) and (2F), shall determine:

                     (a)  if the result of the division is less than or equal to 0.5—that no member of the House of Representatives be chosen in the Territory at a general election;

                     (b)  if the result of the division is greater than 0.5 and less than or equal to 1.5—that one member of the House of Representatives be chosen in the Territory at a general election; or

                     (c)  in any other case—that the number of members of the House of Representatives to be chosen in the Territory at a general election is the number ascertained by the division or, if there is a remainder greater than one-half of the quota, that number increased by one.

          (2B)  At least one member of the House of Representatives shall be chosen in the Australian Capital Territory and in the Northern Territory at a general election.

          (2C)  Subject to subsection (2F), if the Electoral Commissioner determines that, at a general election, no member of the House of Representatives is to be chosen in either or both of the following Territories:

                     (a)  the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands;

                     (b)  the   Territory of Christmas Island;

                     (e)  subject to subsection (2G), the Electoral Commissioner shall, as soon as possible:

                              (i)  ascertain, under section 46, the number of the people of the Northern Territory; and

                             (ii)  determine, under this section, the number of members of the House of Representatives to be chosen in the Northern Territory at a general election.

          (2D)  To avoid doubt, subsection 46(1A) does not apply to the ascertainment of the number of the people of the Northern   Territory under subparagraph (2C)(e)(i) of this section.

Note:          Subsection 46(1A) might otherwise require the fresh ascertainment of the number of the people of the Northern Territory under subparagraph (2C)(e)(i) of this section to be made immediately after the end of the 12 month period referred to in subsection 46(1).

           (2E)  This subsection applies if:

                     (a)  apart from this subsection and subsection (2F), the result of dividing the number of the people of the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory, as ascertained in accordance with section 46, by the quota ascertained under paragraph (2)(a) is:

                             (ii)  a remainder that is less than or equal to one-half of that quota; and

                             (ii)  the number of the people of the Territory, as ascertained in accordance with section 46;

                            is less than or equal to twice the standard error of the measure of the Australian Statistician’s estimate of the net undercount for that Territory at the last Census.

           (2F)  If subsection (2E) applies to the Australian   Capital Territory or the Northern Territory:

                     (a)  the determination made under subsection (1) in accordance with:

                              (i)  subsection (2A); or

                             (ii)  subparagraph (2C)(e)(ii);

                            in respect of that Territory is taken never to have been made; and

                     (b)  the number of the people of that Territory, as ascertained in accordance with section 46, is taken to be increased by a number equal to twice the standard error referred to in paragraph (2E)(b); and

                     (c)  subject to subsection (2G), the Electoral Commissioner must, as soon as possible, determine under this section the number of members of the House of Representatives to be chosen in that Territory at a general election.

Note:          In certain circumstances, the number of the people of the Northern Territory will have been re-ascertained in accordance with section 46 because of the operation of subsection (2C).

          (2G)  The determinations made under subsection (1), and paragraphs (2C)(e) and (2F)(c), must be made within 1 month after the end of the period of 12 months referred to in subsection 46(1).

             (3)  Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law, but subject to the Constitution and to section 39B and Part VII of the _Judiciary Act 1903_, a decision by the Electoral Commissioner made, or purporting to be made, under subsection (1):

                     (a)  is final and conclusive;

                     (b)  shall not be challenged, appealed against, reviewed, quashed, set aside or called in question in any court or tribunal on any ground; and

                     (c)  is not subject to mandamus, prohibition, certiorari or injunction, or the making of a declaratory or other order, in any court on any ground.

             (4)  A determination under subsection (1) shall be made by instrument in writing.

             (5)  In this section:

                    <a name="standard-error"></a>**_standard error_** of the measure of the Australian Statistician’s estimate of the net undercount for a Territory in the last Census means the standard error estimate of the sampling error for that estimate of the net undercount that the Australian Statistician supplies to the Electoral Commissioner under paragraph 47(1)(b).

##### <a id="125"></a>125  Register of Political Parties

                   The Electoral Commission shall establish and maintain a Register, to be known as the Register of Political Parties, containing a list of the political parties that are registered under this Part.

##### <a id="126"></a>126  Application for registration

             (1)  An application for the registration of an eligible political party may be made to the Electoral Commission by:

                     (d)  who has previously made an application for the registration of that Parliamentary party (the **_first party_**);

makes an application for the registration of another party, the Commission must not proceed with the application for the registration of that other party unless the Commission is satisfied that the member is no longer a member of the first party. If the Commission is so satisfied, the Commission must take any action required by section 136 immediately.

             (2)  An application for the registration of an eligible political party shall be in writing, signed by the applicant or applicants and by the person who is to be the registered officer of the party, and shall:

                     (a)  a member who is relied on by 2 or more parties may nominate the party entitled to rely on the member, but if a party is not nominated after the Electoral Commission has given the member at least 30 days to do so, the member is not entitled to be relied on by any of those parties;

                     (b)  the members on whom a registered party relies may be changed at any time by an amendment of the Register of Political Parties;

                     (c)  the registration of a party is not to be cancelled because of this subsection unless the Electoral Commission has taken action to determine whether the party should be deregistered because of paragraph 137(1)(a), (b) or (c).

                     (b)  is obscene;

                     (c)  is the name, or is an abbreviation or acronym of the name, of another political party (not being a political party that is related to the party to which the application relates) that is a recognised political party;

                     (d)  so nearly resembles the name, or an abbreviation or acronym of the name, of another political party (not being a political party that is related to the party to which the application relates) that is a recognised political party that it is likely to be confused with or mistaken for that name or that abbreviation or acronym, as the case may be; or

##### <a id="187"></a>187  Duty of witness

             (1)  A person shall not witness the signature of another person (in this section called the **_elector_**) on an application for a postal vote unless:

                     (a)  a postal vote certificate printed on an envelope; and

                     (b)  one postal ballot paper for a Senate election or one postal ballot paper for a House of Representatives election, or both, as the case requires; and

                     (c)  if the envelope on which the postal vote certificate is printed is not itself addressed to:

                              (i)  if the application is provided to an Assistant Returning Officer outside Australia—the Assistant Returning Officer or to the DRO for the Division for which the applicant declares that he or she is enrolled; or

                             (ii)  otherwise—the DRO for the Division for which the applicant declares that he or she is enrolled;

                            an envelope addressed to that Assistant Returning officer or DRO.

Note:          An application may be taken to be properly witnessed because of subsection 184(3A).

             (2)  Subject to subsection (3), if the DRO or Assistant Returning Officer receives the application for a postal vote at or before 6 pm on the Friday that is 8 days before polling day in the election, the material required by subsection (1) must be sent to the applicant by post or by another means (not being an electronic means, such as fax or email).

                     (a)  the DRO or Assistant Returning Officer receives the application for a postal vote at or before 6 pm on the Friday that is 8 days before polling day in the election; and

                     (b)  in accordance with the approved form referred to in subsection 184(1), the applicant has requested a particular means of delivery (not being an electronic means such as fax or email); and

                     (c)  the DRO or Assistant Returning Officer considers that that means is reasonable and practicable in the circumstances;

the material required by subsection (1) must be sent to the applicant by that means.

             (4)  If the DRO or Assistant Returning Officer receives the application for a postal vote after 6 pm on the Friday that is 8 days before polling day in the election and at or before 6 pm on the Thursday that is 2 days before polling day in the election, the material required by subsection (1) must be sent to the applicant by the means (not being an electronic means such as fax or email) that the DRO or Assistant Returning Officer considers is the most reasonable and practicable in the circumstances.

Note:          If the application is received after 6 pm on the Thursday that is 2 days before polling day in the election, it fails to meet the deadline (see subsection 184(5)), and therefore no material is required by subsection (1) to be sent to the applicant.

                     (b)  in the case of a response of the kind referred to in subparagraph (5)(c)(ii)—that the reason for the failure to vote is a valid and sufficient reason;

the DRO must send by post or deliver to the elector, at his or her latest known address, a notice in an approved form, notifying the elector that:

                     (c)  the DRO is not so satisfied; and

                     (d)  if the elector does not wish to have the apparent failure to vote without a valid and sufficient reason for such failure dealt with by a court, he or she may, within the prescribed time, pay to the DRO a penalty of $20.

           (10)  If, in response to a notice under subsection (9), the penalty of $20 is paid to the DRO within the prescribed time, proceedings against the elector for a contravention of subsection (15) are prohibited.

           (11)  If an elector is unable, by reason of absence from his or her place of living or physical incapacity, to respond to a penalty notice or to a notice under subsection (9) within the prescribed time, any other elector who has a personal knowledge of the facts may, subject to the regulations, respond to the notice within that time, and such response is to be treated as compliance by the first-mentioned elector with the notice.

                     (a)  whether there has been a response to the notice; and

                     (b)  if there has been a response:

                              (i)  whether the DRO is satisfied that the elector did in fact vote or that there was a valid and sufficient reason for the elector’s failure to vote; or

           (13)  The DRO must note on the list prepared under subsection (12) in relation to each elector to whom a notice under subsection (9) has been sent or delivered:

                     (a)  the fact that a notice has been sent or delivered under subsection (9); and

                     (b)  whether there has been a response to the notice; and

                     (c)  if there has been a response—whether the penalty has been paid.

           (14)  Without limiting the circumstances that may constitute a valid and sufficient reason for not voting, the fact that an elector believes it to be part of his or her religious duty to abstain from voting constitutes a valid and sufficient reason for the failure of the elector to vote.

           (15)  An elector is guilty of an offence if the elector fails to vote at an election.

                    Penalty:  $50.

                     (a)  subject to subsection (2), it is not authenticated by the initials of the presiding officer or the issuing officer (within the meaning of Division 3 of Part XVA), or by the presence of the official mark;

                     (b)  subject to section 269 and subsection 270(1), in a Senate election, it has no vote indicated on it, or it does not indicate the voter’s first preference for 1 candidate and the order of his or her preference for all the remaining candidates;

                     (c)  in a House of Representatives election, it has no vote indicated on it, or it does not indicate the voter’s first preference for 1 candidate and an order of preference for all the remaining candidates: 

                    Provided that, where the voter has indicated a first preference for 1 candidate and an order of preference for all the remaining candidates except 1 and the square opposite the name of that candidate has been left blank, it shall be deemed that the voter’s preference for that candidate is the voter’s last and that accordingly the voter has indicated an order of preference for all the candidates:

                    Provided further that, where there are 2 candidates only and the voter has indicated his or her vote by placing the figure 1 in the square opposite the name of 1 candidate and has left the other square blank or placed a figure other than 2 in it, the voter shall be deemed to have indicated an order of preference for all the candidates;

                     (d)  it has upon it any mark or writing (not authorized by this Act or the regulations to be put upon it) by which, in the opinion of the Divisional Returning Officer, the voter can be identified: 

                    Provided that paragraph (d) shall not apply to any mark or writing placed upon the ballot paper by an officer, notwithstanding that the placing of the mark or writing upon the ballot paper is a contravention of this Act; or

                     (e)  in the case of an absent vote—the ballot paper is not contained in an envelope bearing a declaration made by the elector under subsection 222(1) or (1A).

             (2)  A ballot paper to which paragraph (1)(a) applies shall not be informal by virtue of that paragraph if the Divisional Returning Officer responsible for considering the question of the formality of the ballot paper is satisfied that it is an authentic ballot paper on which a voter has marked a vote and the officer has endorsed the ballot paper with the words ‘I am satisfied that this ballot paper is an authentic ballot paper on which a voter has marked a vote.’.

             (3)  A ballot paper shall not be informal for any reason other than the reasons specified in this section, but shall be given effect to according to the voter’s intention so far as that intention is clear.

##### <a id="269"></a>269  Formal votes according to group voting ticket

             (1)  A ballot paper in a Senate election shall not be informal by virtue of paragraph 268(1)(b) if the voter has marked a vote on the ballot paper in accordance with subsection 239(2).

             (2)  If a ballot paper in a Senate election:

                     (a)  has been marked in accordance with subsection 239(2); and

                     (b)  has been marked in accordance with paragraph 239(1)(a) so that, if it were not marked in accordance with subsection 239(2), it would not be informal by virtue of paragraph 268(1)(b);

the ballot paper shall, for the purposes of sections 272 and 273, be deemed not to have been marked in accordance with subsection 239(2).

             (3)  For the purposes of this section and sections 272 and 273, a voter shall not be taken to have marked a vote in accordance with subsection 239(2) if the voter has placed a preference mark in 2 or more of the squares printed on the ballot paper in accordance with subsection 211(5) or 211A(6).

             (4)  In this section, **_preference mark_** means a tick, a cross or the figure 1.

##### <a id="270"></a>270  Certain votes with non-consecutive numbers to be formal

             (1)  Where a ballot paper in a Senate election:

                     (b)  has:

                              (i)  in a case where there are more than 9 candidates in the election—in not less than 90% of the squares opposite to the names of candidates, numbers in a sequence of consecutive numbers commencing with the number 1 or numbers that with changes to no more than 3 of them would be in such a sequence; or

                             (ii)  in any other case—in all the squares opposite to the names of candidates or in all those squares except one square that is left blank, numbers in a sequence of consecutive numbers commencing with the number 1 or numbers that with changes to no more than 2 of them would be in such a sequence; and

                     (c)  but for this subsection, would be informal by virtue of paragraph 268(1)(b);

then:

                     (d)  the ballot paper shall not be informal by virtue of that paragraph;

                     (e)  the number 1 shall be taken to express the voter’s first preference;

                      (f)  where numbers in squares opposite to the names of candidates are in a sequence of consecutive numbers commencing with the number 1—the voter shall be taken to have expressed a preference by the other number, or to have expressed preferences by the other numbers, in that sequence; and

                     (g)  the voter shall not be taken to have expressed any other preference.

             (3)  In considering, for the purposes of subsection (1) whether numbers are in a sequence of consecutive numbers, any number that is repeated shall be disregarded.

             (8)  The number of first preference votes given for each candidate and the total number of all such votes shall be ascertained and a quota shall be determined by dividing the total number of first preference votes by 1 more than the number of candidates required to be elected and by increasing the quotient so obtained (disregarding any remainder) by 1, and any candidate who has received a number of first preference votes equal to or greater than the quota shall be elected.

             (9)  Unless all the vacancies have been filled, the number (if any) of votes in excess of the quota (in this section referred to as **_surplus votes_**) of each elected candidate shall be transferred to the continuing candidates as follows:

                     (b)  the total number of ballot papers of the elected candidate that express the first preference vote for that candidate and the next available preference for a particular continuing candidate shall be multiplied by the transfer value, the number so obtained (disregarding any fraction) shall be added to the number of first preference votes of the continuing candidate and all those ballot papers shall be transferred to the continuing candidate;

and any continuing candidate who has received a number of votes equal to or greater than the quota on the completion of any such transfer shall be elected.

           (10)  Unless all the vacancies have been filled, the surplus votes (if any) of any candidate elected under subsection (9), or elected subsequently under this subsection, shall be transferred to the continuing candidates in accordance with paragraphs (9)(a) and (b), and any continuing candidate who has received a number of votes equal to or greater than the quota on the completion of any such transfer shall be elected.

           (13)  Where, after the counting of first preference votes or the transfer of surplus votes (if any) of elected candidates, no candidate has, or fewer than the number of candidates required to be elected have, received a number of votes equal to the quota:

                     (a)  the candidate who stands lowest in the poll must be excluded; or

                     (b)  if a bulk exclusion of candidates may be effected under subsection (13A), those candidates must be excluded;

and the ballot papers of the excluded candidate or candidates must be distributed in accordance with subsection (13AA).

      (13AA)  Where a candidate is, or candidates are, excluded in accordance with this section, the ballot papers of the excluded candidate or candidates must be transferred as follows:

                     (a)  the total number of ballot papers:

                              (i)  expressing a first preference for an excluded candidate; or

                             (ii)  received by an excluded candidate on distribution from another excluded candidate at a transfer value of 1 vote;

                            being ballot papers expressing the next available preference for a particular continuing candidate must be transferred at a transfer value of 1 vote to the continuing candidate and added to the number of votes of the continuing candidate;

                     (b)  the total number (if any) of other ballot papers obtained by an excluded candidate or the excluded candidates, as the case may be, must be transferred beginning with the ballot papers received by that candidate or those candidates at the highest transfer value and ending with the ballot papers received at the lowest transfer value, as follows:

                              (i)  the total number of ballot papers received by the excluded candidate or candidates, as the case may be, at a particular transfer value and expressing the next available preference for a particular continuing candidate must be multiplied by that transfer value;

                             (ii)  the number so obtained (disregarding any fraction) must be added to the number of votes of the continuing candidate;

                            (iii)  all those ballot papers must be transferred to the continuing candidate.

        (13A)  The procedure for a bulk exclusion, and the circumstances in which such an exclusion may be made, are as follows:

                     (a)  a continuing candidate (in this subsection called **_Candidate A_**) shall be identified, if possible, who, of the continuing candidates who each have a number of notional votes equal to or greater than the vacancy shortfall, stands lower or lowest in the poll;

                     (b)  a continuing candidate (in this subsection called **_Candidate B_**) shall be identified, if possible, who:

                              (i)  stands lower in the poll than Candidate A, or if Candidate A cannot be identified, has a number of notional votes that is fewer than the vacancy shortfall;

                             (ii)  has a number of notional votes that is fewer than the number of votes of the candidate standing immediately higher than him or her in the poll; and

                            (iii)  if 2 or more candidates satisfy subparagraphs (i) and (ii)—is the candidate who of those candidates stands higher or highest in the poll;

                     (c)  in a case where Candidate B has been identified and has a number of notional votes fewer than the leading shortfall—Candidate B and any other continuing candidates who stand lower in the poll than that candidate may be excluded in a bulk exclusion; and

                     (d)  in a case where Candidate B has been identified and has a number of notional votes equal to or greater than the leading shortfall:

                              (i)  a continuing candidate (in this subsection called **_Candidate C_**) shall be identified who:

                                        (A)  has a number of notional votes that is fewer than the leading shortfall; and

                                        (B)  if 2 or more candidates satisfy sub-subparagraph (A)—is the candidate who of those candidates stands higher or highest in the poll; and

                             (ii)  Candidate C and all other continuing candidates who stand lower in the poll than that candidate may be excluded in a bulk exclusion.

         (13B)  Where, apart from this subsection, the number of continuing candidates after a bulk exclusion under subsection (13A) would be fewer than the number of remaining unfilled vacancies, subsection (13A) shall operate to exclude only the number of candidates, beginning with the candidate who stands lowest in the poll, that would leave sufficient continuing candidates to fill the remaining unfilled vacancies.

         (13C)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section (other than subsection (18)), where a candidate or candidates has or have been elected and there are surplus votes as a result of that election, paragraphs (13A)(a), (b), (c) and (d) may be applied as if references in those paragraphs to notional votes were references to adjusted notional votes.

           (14)  Any continuing candidate who has received a number of votes equal to or greater than the quota on the completion of a transfer under subsection (13) or (15) of ballot papers of an excluded candidate or candidates, as the case may be, shall be elected, and, unless all the vacancies have been filled, the surplus votes (if any) of the candidate so elected shall be transferred in accordance with paragraphs (9)(a) and (b), except that, where the candidate so elected is elected before all the ballot papers of the excluded candidate or candidates, as the case may be, have been transferred, the surplus votes (if any) of the candidate so elected shall not be transferred until the remaining ballot papers of the excluded candidate or candidates, as the case may be, have been transferred in accordance with paragraphs (13AA)(a) and (b) to continuing candidates.

           (15)  Subject to subsection (17) where, after the transfer of all of the ballot papers of an excluded candidate or the excluded candidates, as the case may be, no continuing candidate has received a number of votes greater than the quota:

                     (a)  the continuing candidate who stands lowest in the poll must be excluded; or

                     (b)  if a bulk exclusion of candidates may be effected under subsection (13A), those candidates must be excluded;

and the ballot papers of the excluded candidate or candidates must be transferred in accordance with subsection (13AA).

           (16)  Where a candidate is elected during a transfer of ballot papers under subsection (13) or (15), no other ballot papers of an excluded candidate or candidates, as the case may be, shall be transferred to the candidate so elected.

           (17)  In respect of the last vacancy for which two continuing candidates remain, the continuing candidate who has the larger number of votes shall be elected notwithstanding that that number is below the quota, and if those candidates have an equal number of votes the Australian Electoral Officer for the State shall have a casting vote but shall not otherwise vote at the election.

           (18)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, where the number of continuing candidates is equal to the number of remaining unfilled vacancies, those candidates shall be elected.

           (19)  At the conclusion of the scrutiny, the Australian Electoral Officer shall place in parcels all the ballot papers transmitted to the officer under subsection (5), seal up the parcels and indorse on each parcel a description of the contents thereof.

           (20)  For the purposes of this Act and the _Representation Act 1983_:

                     (a)  the order of election of candidates in a Senate election shall be taken to be in accordance with the order of the count as a result of which they were elected, the candidates (if any) elected on the count of first preference votes being taken to be the earliest elected; and

                     (b)  where 2 or more candidates are elected as a result of the same count, the order in which they shall be taken to have been elected shall be in accordance with the relative numbers of their votes, the candidate with the largest number of votes being taken to be the earliest elected, but if any 2 or more of those candidates each have the same number of votes, the order in which they shall be taken to have been elected shall be taken to be in accordance with the relative numbers of their votes at the last count before their election at which each of them had a different number of votes, the candidate with the largest number of votes at that count being taken to be the earliest elected, and if there has been no such count the Australian Electoral Officer for the State shall determine the order in which they shall be taken to have been elected.

           (21)  Subject to subsections (22) and (23), where, after any count under this section, 2 or more candidates have surplus votes, the order of any transfers of the surplus votes of those candidates shall be in accordance with the relative sizes of the surpluses, the largest surplus being transferred first.

           (22)  Subject to subsection (23), where, after any count under this section, 2 or more candidates have equal surpluses, the order of any transfers of the surplus votes of those candidates shall be in accordance with the relative numbers of votes of those candidates at the last count at which each of those candidates had a different number of votes, the surplus of the candidate with the largest number of votes at that count being transferred first, but if there has been no such count the Australian Electoral Officer for the State shall determine the order in which the surpluses shall be dealt with.

           (23)  Where, after any count under this section, a candidate obtains surplus votes, those surplus votes shall not be transferred before the transfer of any surplus votes obtained by any other candidate on an earlier count.

           (25)  Where a candidate is elected by reason that the number of first preference votes received by the candidate, or the aggregate of first preference votes received by the candidate and all other votes obtained by the candidate on transfers under this section, is equal to the quota, all the ballot papers expressing those votes shall be set aside as finally dealt with.

           (26)  A ballot paper shall be set aside as exhausted where on a transfer it is found that the paper expresses no preference for any continuing candidate.

           (27)  In any case to which subsection 239(4) applies, a vote indicated on a ballot paper opposite the name of a deceased candidate shall be counted to the candidate next in the order of the voter’s preference, and the numbers indicating subsequent preferences shall be deemed to be altered accordingly.

           (28)  For the purposes of this section:

                     (a)  a transfer under subsection (9), (10) or (14) of all the surplus votes of an elected candidate;

                     (b)  a transfer under paragraph (13AA)(a) of all ballot papers of an excluded candidate or excluded candidates, received by that candidate, or one of those candidates:

                              (i)  as the first preference vote; or

                             (ii)  on distribution from another excluded candidate at a transfer value of 1 vote; or

                     (c)  a transfer under paragraph (13AA)(b) of all ballot papers received by the excluded candidate or candidates, as the case may be, at a particular transfer value;

each constitutes a separate transfer.

           (29)  In this section:

                    <a name="adjusted-notion-vote"></a>**_adjusted notional vote_**, in relation to a continuing candidate, means, in a case where a candidate or candidates has or have been elected, the sum of:

                     (a)  the number of notional votes of the continuing candidate; and

                     (b)  the number, before the transfer of any of the surplus votes, of those surplus votes.

                    <a name="continu-candid"></a>**_continuing candidate_** means a candidate not already elected or excluded from the count.

                    <a name="lead-shortfal"></a>**_leading shortfall_**, in relation to a particular stage during the scrutiny in a Senate election, means the shortfall of the continuing candidate standing highest in the poll at that stage.

                    <a name="notion-vote"></a>**_notional vote_**, in relation to a continuing candidate, means the aggregate of the votes obtained by that candidate and the votes obtained by each other candidate who stands lower in the poll than him or her.

                    <a name="shortfal"></a>**_shortfall_**, in relation to a continuing candidate at a particular stage during the scrutiny in a Senate election, means the number of votes that the candidate requires at that stage in order to reach the quota referred to in subsection (8).

                    <a name="state"></a>**_State_** includes Territory.

                    <a name="vacanc-shortfal"></a>**_vacancy shortfall_**, in relation to a particular stage during the scrutiny in a Senate election, means the aggregate of the shortfalls of that number of leading candidates equal to the number of remaining unfilled vacancies, the leading candidates being ascertained by taking the continuing candidate who stands highest in the poll, the continuing candidate who stands next highest in the poll, and so on in the order in which the continuing candidates stand in the poll.

           (30)  In this section, a reference to votes, or ballot papers, as the case may be, of or obtained or received by a candidate includes votes, or ballot papers, as the case may be, obtained or received by the candidate on any transfer under this section.

           (31)  For the purposes of this section, at any time after the counting of first preference votes the order of standing of the continuing candidates in the poll shall be determined as follows:

                     (a)  subject to paragraph (b), the continuing candidates shall stand in the poll in the order of the relative number of votes of each continuing candidate, with the continuing candidate with the greatest number of votes standing highest in the poll and the continuing candidate with the fewest number of votes standing lowest in the poll;

                     (b)  if 2 or more continuing candidates have the same number of votes, those candidates shall stand in the poll in the order of the relative number of votes of each of those candidates at the last count at which each of them had a different number of votes, with the continuing candidate with the greater or greatest number of votes at that count standing higher in the poll and the continuing candidate with the fewer or fewest number of votes at that count standing lower in the poll, but if there has been no such count the Australian Electoral Officer for the State shall determine the order of standing of those candidates in the poll.

           (32)  When the last vacancy is filled, the scrutiny shall immediately cease and any exclusion in progress shall not be completed.

##### <a id="273A"></a>273A  Computerised scrutiny of votes in Senate election

Determination that computerised scrutiny applies

             (1)  The scrutiny of votes in a Senate election for a particular State or Territory may be conducted by complying with the requirements set out in this section.

Processing of ballot papers by Assistant Returning Officers

             (2)  Each Assistant Returning Officer must deal with ballot-boxes and ballot papers in the manner required by subsection 273(2).

Processing of ballot papers by Divisional Returning Officers

             (3)  Each Divisional Returning Officer must deal as follows with all ballot papers received by him or her:

                     (a)  reject any of the wholly above-the-line ballot papers that are informal and arrange the unrejected ones into parcels by placing under the name of each candidate all the ballot papers on which a first preference is indicated for that candidate;

                     (b)  reject any informal ballot papers that have no mark at all on them, and any other ballot papers that are obviously informal, and place the rejected ballot papers in one or more parcels;

                     (c)  place in a parcel or parcels all the ballot papers received by the Divisional Returning Officer, other than:

                              (i)  the unrejected wholly above-the-line ballot papers; and

                             (ii)  the ballot papers rejected as informal;

                     (d)  seal up all the parcels and endorse on each parcel a description of the contents, and permit any scrutineers present, if they so desire, to countersign the endorsement;

                     (e)  as soon as possible, transmit the parcel or parcels referred to in paragraph (c) to the Australian Electoral Officer;

                      (f)  transmit the following information to the Australian Electoral Officer:

                              (i)  the number of first preference votes given for each candidate on unrejected wholly above-the-line ballot papers;

                             (ii)  the total number of ballot papers rejected as informal.

Processing of ballot papers received by Australian Electoral Officer

             (4)  The Australian Electoral Officer must scrutinise all the ballot papers received by him or her, and must reject the informal ones.

Determining election result

             (5)  The Australian Electoral Officer must then ascertain the successful candidates, and their order of election, by using a computer to apply the principles set out in subsections 273(8) to (32) (inclusive). A tie at any step in the process is to be resolved in the same way as a tie in the corresponding step is resolved under section 273.

Rights of scrutineers

             (6)  For proceedings under subsections (4) and (5) of this section, the requirements of paragraph 265(1)(c) are met if the scrutineers have access to:

                     (a)  a record of the preferences on the ballot papers that have been received by the Australian Electoral Officer and whose details have been stored in the computer (including informal ballot papers, and formal ballot papers that are not sequentially numbered); and

                     (b)  a record of the ballot papers that are notionally transferred, or exhausted, at each count; and

                     (c)  a record of the progress of the count of the votes, at each count.

Modified rules for re-count

             (7)  If ballot papers that are to be re-counted under section 278 are in the possession of the Australian Electoral Officer immediately before the re-count begins, the Australian Electoral Officer must deal with those ballot papers as follows:

                     (a)  open the parcels (for those ballot papers that are in parcels) in the presence of a person appointed or engaged under the _Public Service Act 1999_ and of any scrutineer who attends;

                     (b)  scrutinise all the ballot papers, and make a decision on each one either to admit it or reject it;

                     (c)  after scrutinising all the ballot papers, restore the ones that were in parcels to their original covers, and place the remaining ballot papers in a parcel or parcels;

                     (d)  seal up all the parcels and write on each cover:

                              (i)  the number of ballot papers contained in the cover; and

                             (ii)  a statement that all the ballot papers have been the subject of decisions by the Australian Electoral Officer;

                     (e)  sign the cover of each parcel and permit other persons who were present when the ballot papers were scrutinised to add their signatures.

             (8)  If:

                     (a)  a re-calculation by computer occurs following a re-count; and

                     (b)  during the re-calculation, the same tie that occurred on the previous calculation by computer occurs again;

for the purposes of the re-calculation that tie is to be resolved in favour of the candidate in whose favour it was resolved during the previous calculation.

             (9)  If a re-count is required under section 282, the Australian Electoral Officer must conduct the re-count by using a computer to apply the principles set out in subsections 273(8) to (30) (inclusive), modified in the way set out in section 282.

##### <a id="273B"></a>273B  Combination of manual and computer scrutiny permitted

                   A scrutiny of votes for a Senate election may be conducted partly under section 273 and partly under section 273A, as long as the requirements of at least one of those sections are met in respect of the scrutiny for that election.

##### <a id="274"></a>274  Scrutiny of votes in House of Representatives elections

             (1)  In a House of Representatives election the scrutiny shall, subject to section 266, be conducted in the manner set out in this section.

             (2)  Each Assistant Returning Officer shall, in the presence of a polling official, and of such authorized scrutineers as may attend:

                     (a)  exhibit for the inspection of the scrutineers:

                     (c)  count the first preference votes given for each candidate on all unrejected ballot papers;

                     (d)  make out and sign a statement (which may be countersigned by a polling official, and, if they so desire, by such scrutineers as are present) setting out the number of first preference votes given for each candidate, and the number of informal ballot papers;

                     (e)  place in a separate parcel all the ballot papers which have been rejected as informal;

          (2A)  If, in a House of Representatives election, there are more than 2 candidates for a Division, the Australian Electoral Officer for the State or Territory that includes the Division must, in writing, direct each Assistant Returning Officer for the Division, and the Divisional Returning Officer for the Division, to conduct a count of preference votes (other than first preference votes) on the ballot papers that, in the opinion of the Australian Electoral Officer, will best provide an indication of the candidate most likely to be elected for the Division.

          (2B)  An Assistant Returning Officer to whom a direction is given under subsection (2A) must:

                     (a)  count the preference votes in accordance with the direction; and

                     (b)  transmit to the Divisional Returning Officer any information required by the direction;

in the manner specified in the direction.

          (2C)  A Divisional Returning Officer to whom a direction is given under subsection (2A) must count the preference votes in accordance with the direction:

                     (a)  at the time of the fresh scrutiny under subsection (7); and

                     (b)  at the time at which the Divisional Returning Officer examines and counts ballot papers recording declaration votes other than ballot papers recording declaration votes that were examined and counted at the time of the fresh scrutiny.

             (3)  The Divisional Returning Officer shall open all ballot-boxes not opened by an Assistant Returning Officer, and shall conduct the scrutiny of the ballot papers contained therein in the manner aforesaid as far as applicable.

             (4)  The Divisional Returning Officer shall, in the manner prescribed by this Act or the Regulations, examine, count, and deal with all ballot papers used for casting declaration votes.

             (7)  The Divisional Returning Officer:

                     (a)  shall open the sealed parcels of ballot papers received from the Assistant Returning Officers in or for the Division;

                     (b)  shall make a fresh scrutiny of the ballot papers contained in the parcels, and, for the purpose of that scrutiny, shall have the same powers as if it were the original scrutiny, and may reverse any decision given by an Assistant Returning Officer in relation to the original scrutiny;

                     (c)  from the result of the scrutiny of the votes counted under the provisions of subsections (3) and (4), and the fresh scrutiny conducted under the provisions of this subsection, shall ascertain the total number of first preference votes given for each candidate and the number of informal ballot papers; and

                    (ca)  must then proceed with the scrutiny and the counting of the votes as follows:

                              (i)  if, after ascertaining the first preference votes given for each candidate, no candidate has an absolute majority of votes, the Divisional Returning Officer must apply subsection (7AA);

                             (ii)  if, after ascertaining the first preference votes given for each candidate, a candidate has an absolute majority of votes, that candidate is elected; and

                     (d)  if, after applying subsection (7AA), subparagraph (7AA)(b)(i) applies, shall proceed with the scrutiny and the counting of the votes as follows:

                              (i)  the candidate who has received the fewest first preference votes shall be excluded, and each ballot paper counted to the candidate shall be counted to the candidate next in the order of the voter’s preference;

                             (ii)  the process of excluding the candidate who has the fewest votes, and counting each of his or her ballot papers to the unexcluded candidate next in the order of the voter’s preference, shall be repeated until only 2 candidates remain in the count; and

                            (iii)  if, following the exclusion of candidates under this paragraph, a candidate has an absolute majority of votes, that candidate shall be elected.

       (7AA)  If, after ascertaining the total number of first preference votes for each candidate under paragraph (7)(ca), no candidate has an absolute majority of votes, the Divisional Returning Officer must take the following steps:

                     (a)  rank the candidates consecutively in order of their standing in the poll as set out in subsection (7AB); 

                     (b)  then:

                              (i)  if the total number of first preference votes for all the candidates, other than the first and second ranked candidates, is equal to or more than the number of first preference votes for the second ranked candidate—proceed with the scrutiny as set out in paragraph (7)(d); or

                             (ii)  if the total number of first preference votes for all the candidates, other than the first and second ranked candidates, is less than the number of first preference votes for the second ranked candidate—exclude all the candidates other than the first and second ranked candidates;

                     (c)  if subparagraph (b)(ii) applies—count each ballot paper of an excluded candidate to whichever of the first or second ranked candidates is earlier in the order of preference expressed on the ballot paper.

        (7AB)  The ranking of candidates under paragraph (7AA)(a) is to be done as follows: 

                     (a)  the candidate with the highest number of first preference votes is to be the first ranked candidate, the candidate with the second-highest number of votes is to be the second ranked candidate, and so on;

                     (b)  if 2 or more candidates have an equal number of first preference votes, the ranking as between those candidates is to be decided, by lot, by the Divisional Returning Officer.

        (7AC)  If, following the exclusion of candidates under subparagraph (7AA)(b)(ii) and the count of ballot papers under paragraph (7AA)(c), a candidate has an absolute majority of votes, that candidate is elected.

          (7A)  The fresh scrutiny referred to in paragraph (7)(b) shall, if the Australian Electoral Officer for the State or Territory that includes the relevant Division so directs in writing, include a scrutiny of such preferences (other than first preferences), on such of the ballot papers, as are required by the direction, and shall be conducted in the manner specified in the direction.

             (9)  If, on any count other than the final count:

                     (a)  2 or more candidates (**_lowest ranking candidates_**) have an equal number of votes; and

                     (b)  one of them has to be excluded;

the candidate to be excluded is the candidate with less votes than any of the other lowest ranking candidates at the last count at which one of those candidates had less votes than any of the others, but, if there has been no such count, the Divisional Returning Officer must decide by lot which of them is to be excluded.

          (9A)  If, in the final count, 2 or more candidates have an equal number of votes, the Divisional Returning Officer shall make a fresh scrutiny of the votes scrutinised under subsection (7) and a fresh scrutiny of all declaration ballot papers rejected at the preliminary scrutiny.

          (9B)  If, after the fresh scrutinies referred to in subsection (9A), a candidate has received an absolute majority of votes, that candidate shall be elected.

          (9C)  If, after the fresh scrutinies referred to in subsection (9A), 2 or more candidates have an equal number of votes, the Divisional Returning Officer shall give to the Electoral Commissioner written notice that the election cannot be decided.

           (10)  In this section an absolute majority of votes means a greater number than one-half of the whole number of ballot papers other than informal ballot papers.

           (12)  The Divisional Returning Officer shall:

                     (a)  place in a separate parcel all the ballot papers which have been rejected as informal;

                     (b)  place in a separate parcel all the unrejected ballot papers; and

                     (c)  seal up the parcels and indorse on each parcel a description of the contents thereof, and permit any scrutineers present, if they so desire, to countersign the indorsement.

##### <a id="275"></a>275  Scrutiny prior to receipt of declaration ballot papers

                   Where the Australian Electoral Officer, in the case of a Senate election, or the Divisional Returning Officer, in the case of a House of Representatives election, is satisfied that the votes:

                     (a)  on any ballot papers issued at some remote polling place in connexion with the election which have not been received by the Divisional Returning Officer; or

                     (b)  on ballot papers used for casting declaration votes and not dealt with under section 266;

              1.  Throughout the hours of polling on polling day, the elector will be absent from the State or Territory for which the elector is enrolled.

              2.  The elector will not, at any time during the hours of polling on polling day, be within 8 kilometres by the nearest practicable route of any polling booth in the State or Territory for which the elector is enrolled.

              3.  Throughout the hours of polling on polling day, the elector will be travelling under conditions that will prevent the elector attending a polling booth in the State or Territory for which the elector is enrolled.

            3A.  Throughout the hours of polling on polling day, the elector will be absent from the Division for which the elector is enrolled.

              4.  The elector will be unable to attend a polling booth on polling day because of:

                     (a)  serious illness;

                     (b)  infirmity; or

                     (c)  approaching childbirth.

(In the case of an elector who will be a patient at a hospital on polling day, this paragraph applies regardless of the operation of sections 224 and 227.)

              5.  On polling day, the elector will be unable to attend a polling booth because the elector will be at a place (other than a hospital) caring for a person who is seriously ill or infirm or who is expected shortly to give birth.

              6.  Throughout the hours of polling on polling day, the elector will be a patient at a hospital and unable to vote at the hospital.

            7A.  The elector will be unable to attend a polling booth on polling day because of a reasonable fear for, or a reasonable apprehension about, his or her personal wellbeing or safety.

              8.  Because of the elector’s religious beliefs or membership of a religious order, the elector:

                     (a)  is precluded from attending a polling booth; or

                     (b)  for the greater part of the hours of polling on polling day, is precluded from attending a polling booth.

              9.  On polling day, the elector will be serving a sentence of imprisonment or otherwise under detention.

             10.  The elector’s address has been excluded from the Roll under section 104.

             11.  Throughout the hours of polling on polling day, the elector will be engaged in his or her employment or occupation and:

                     (a)  if the elector is an employee, the elector is not entitled to leave of absence under section 345; and

                     (b)  in any other case, the absence of the elector for the purpose of attending at a polling booth to vote would be likely to cause loss to the person in his or her occupation.

# Schedule 3—Rules for the conduct of a preliminary scrutiny of declaration votes

_Subsection 266(3)_

              1.  The DRO shall produce unopened all envelopes containing declaration votes of the kind to which the preliminary scrutiny relates received by the DRO:

                     (a)  in the case of the first preliminary scrutiny—before the commencement of that scrutiny; and

                     (b)  in the case of a subsequent preliminary scrutiny—after the commencement of the last preceding preliminary scrutiny and before the commencement of the subsequent preliminary scrutiny.

              2.  All written applications for postal votes not already dealt with at a preliminary scrutiny shall be produced at each preliminary scrutiny of postal votes.

              3.  The DRO shall compare the signature of the elector on each postal vote application with the signature on the relevant postal vote certificate and allow the scrutineers to inspect both signatures.

            3A.  For each postal vote certificate not dealt with under paragraph 3, the DRO must compare the signature of the elector on the postal vote certificate with the signature of the elector on:

                     (a)  the elector’s application for registration as a general postal voter; or

                     (b)  the elector’s application for enrolment or transfer of enrolment;

and allow the scrutineers to inspect both signatures.

              4.  The DRO shall divide the envelopes being dealt with into groups, as follows:

                     (a)  in one group, the envelopes that meet the requirements of paragraph 6;

                     (b)  in another group, the envelopes that do not meet those requirements.

              5.  The DRO shall, without opening the envelopes, subject to the operation of paragraphs 23 and 24, exclude from further scrutiny the ballot papers contained in envelopes that do not meet the requirements of paragraph 6.

              6.  An envelope meets the requirements of this paragraph if the DRO is satisfied:

                     (a)  in the case of an envelope purporting to contain a postal ballot paper, other than an envelope sent under section 186 to a registered general postal voter who was registered on the ground specified in paragraph 184A(2)(e) or (f), that the signature on the certificate is that of the elector and that:

                              (i)  the signature purports to be witnessed by an authorised witness; or

                             (ii)  the signature is taken to be witnessed by an authorised witness because of subsection 194(1A); and

                     (b)  in the case of an envelope purporting to contain a pre-poll vote ballot paper, that the certificate has been signed in accordance with section 200E and that the signature purports to be witnessed by the officer who issued the certificate; and

                     (c)  in the case of an envelope purporting to contain an absent vote ballot paper or a provisional vote ballot paper, that the certificate has been signed in accordance with section 222 or 235 or subsection 234(4), as the case requires, and that the signature purports to be witnessed in accordance with that section or subsection, as the case may be; and

                    (ca)  in the case of an envelope purporting to contain a provisional vote ballot paper—if the elector (other than an elector to whom subsection 104(4) applies) did not provide evidence of his or her identity in accordance with section 235 at the time of casting the vote, the elector has provided that evidence by the first Friday following the polling day for that election; and

                    (cb)  in the case of an envelope purporting to contain a postal ballot paper, a pre-poll vote ballot paper, an absent vote ballot paper or a provisional vote ballot paper, cast by an elector who is provisionally enrolled—that, by the first Friday following the polling day for that election, the elector has provided an officer with evidence that the elector has become an Australian citizen under the _Australian Citizenship Act 2007_; and

                     (d)  in the case of an envelope purporting to contain a ballot paper recording a vote cast at a station in Antarctica, the envelope is signed in accordance with subsection 260(1); and

                     (e)  in the case of an envelope purporting to contain a postal ballot paper, that the vote marked on the ballot paper was recorded prior to the close of the poll.

            6A.  If the DRO is satisfied that more than one envelope that meets the requirements of paragraph 6 purports to contain a declaration vote by the same elector, the DRO must:

                     (a)  treat only one of the envelopes, as selected by the DRO, as meeting the requirements of paragraph 6; and

                     (b)  exclude from further scrutiny the ballot papers contained in the other envelope or envelopes, without opening the envelope or envelopes; and

                     (c)  seal up in a parcel the envelope or envelopes excluded from further scrutiny by subparagraph (b); and

                     (d)  write on the parcel a description of its contents, the name of the Division and the date of the commencement of the preliminary scrutiny.

In applying subparagraph (a), the DRO should, to the extent that it is possible, select the envelope that was received first.

            6B.  Paragraphs 23 and 24 do not apply to envelopes excluded from further scrutiny because of subparagraph 6A(b).

              7.  Where the envelope purporting to contain a postal ballot paper bears a postmark that includes a date after polling day, the vote marked on the ballot paper shall be taken not to have been recorded prior to the close of the poll.

            7A.  A vote marked on a postal ballot paper must be taken not to have been recorded prior to the close of the poll if:

                     (a)  in the case of a ballot paper taken to be witnessed because of subsection 194(1A)—the envelope purporting to contain the ballot paper does not bear a legible postmark; or

                     (b)  in any other case—the envelope purporting to contain the ballot paper does not bear a legible postmark and the signature of the witness bears a date after polling day.

              8.  An envelope purporting to contain an absent vote ballot paper or a provisional vote ballot paper or a pre-poll vote ballot paper shall not be regarded as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph 6 only because the declaration or certificate, as the case requires, is not witnessed if the voter’s name appears on a record made under subsection 232(2) or section 200G, as the case requires, or, if neither of those requirements is met, if the DRO is satisfied that the ballot paper was properly issued. 

              9.  The DRO shall seal up in a parcel the envelopes that do not meet the requirements of paragraph 6 and shall write on the parcel a description of its contents, the name of the Division and the date of commencement of the preliminary scrutiny.

             10.  If the preliminary scrutiny relates to a Senate election held concurrently with a House of Representatives election or a Senate election held alone, the DRO shall divide the envelopes that meet the requirements of paragraph 6 into groups as follows:

                     (a)  in one group, the envelopes bearing certificates or declarations by persons who are enrolled for the Division or whose claims for enrolment are claims to which subsection 102(4A) of the Act applies;

                     (b)  in another group the envelopes to which paragraph 12 applies;

                     (c)  in another group, the envelopes bearing certificates or declarations by persons who are not enrolled for the Division but are enrolled for the State or Territory in which the Division is situated;

                     (d)  in another group, the envelopes bearing certificates or declarations by persons who are not enrolled for the Division or for the State or Territory in which the Division is situated.

             11.  If the preliminary scrutiny relates to a House of Representatives election not held concurrently with a Senate election, the DRO shall divide the envelopes that meet the requirements of paragraph 6 into groups as follows: 

                     (a)  in one group, the envelopes bearing certificates or declarations by persons who are enrolled for the Division or whose claims for enrolment are claims to which subsection 102(4A) of the Act applies; 

                     (b)  in another group, the envelopes to which paragraph 12 applies; 

                     (c)  in another group, the envelopes bearing certificates or declarations by persons who are not enrolled for the Division. 

             12.  This paragraph applies to an envelope if the DRO is satisfied: 

                     (a)  that the elector who signed a certificate or declaration on the envelope is not enrolled for the Division; and 

                     (b)  after making enquiry: 

                              (i)  that the elector was, at the time of voting, entitled to be enrolled for the Division; and 

                             (ii)  that the omission of the elector’s name from the Roll for the Division was due to an error made by an officer or to a mistake of fact; and

                            (iii)  that the omission was not attributable to subsection 118(4A).

             13.  Subparagraph 12(b) does not apply if: 

                     (a)  more than one election (excluding the election to which the scrutiny relates) has been held since the error or mistake was made; or 

                     (b)  where there has been a redistribution of the State or Territory that includes the Division since the last election but one before the election to which the scrutiny relates, the error or mistake was made before the last such redistribution. 

             14.  In paragraph 13, **_election_** means: 

                     (a)  a general election for the House of Representatives; 

                     (b)  a Senate election not held concurrently with a general election for the House of Representatives; or 

                     (c)  a referendum not held concurrently with a general election. 

             15.  The DRO shall, without opening the envelopes, subject to the operation of paragraphs 23 and 25, exclude from further scrutiny the ballot papers contained in envelopes referred to in subparagraphs 10(d) and 11(c). 

             16.  The DRO shall seal up in a parcel the envelopes referred to in subparagraphs 10(d) and 11(c) and shall write on the parcel a description of the contents, the name of the Division and the date.

             17.  The DRO shall, after the close of the poll for the Division, without unfolding or inspecting them or allowing any other person to do so, withdraw the ballot papers from the envelopes referred to in paragraph 10 or 11 that still remain in the preliminary scrutiny. 

             18.  Ballot papers withdrawn from envelopes referred to in subparagraph 10(a) or (b) or 11(a) or (b) shall be placed in a ballot-box by themselves for further scrutiny. 

             19.  A ballot paper for a Senate election withdrawn from an envelope referred to in subparagraph 10(c) shall be placed in the ballot-box referred to in paragraph 18 for further scrutiny. A ballot paper for a House of Representatives election withdrawn from such an envelope shall be excluded from further scrutiny. 

             20.  The DRO shall seal up in a parcel ballot papers excluded under paragraph 19 and shall write on the parcel a description of its contents, the name of the Division and the date. 

             21.  Where a ballot paper has been finally excluded from further scrutiny, other than because of subparagraph 6A(b), the DRO shall send to the voter a written statement of the reason for the rejection. 

             22.  For the purposes of paragraph 17, an envelope that contains a ballot paper for a referendum shall be dealt with as if it did not contain that ballot paper. 

             23.  In the course of a preliminary scrutiny of declaration votes, the DRO, as soon as practicable after the ballot papers that are required, under that scrutiny, to be placed in a ballot-box under paragraph 18 or 19 are so placed, but not before the close of the poll for the Division, must: 

                     (a)  open the parcel of envelopes that contains the ballot papers that are, under paragraph 5 and subject to the operation of this paragraph and paragraph 24, excluded from scrutiny, and deal further with those declaration votes in accordance with paragraph 24; and 

                     (b)  open the parcel of envelopes that contains the ballot papers that are, under paragraph 15 and subject to the operation of this paragraph and paragraph 25, excluded from scrutiny, and deal further with those declaration votes in accordance with paragraph 25\. 

             24.  For the purpose of dealing further with declaration votes referred to in subparagraph 23(a), paragraphs 3 to 22, inclusive, reapply in relation to those votes as if: 

                     (a)  the words “subject to the operation of paragraphs 23 and 24,” were omitted from paragraph 5; and 

                     (b)  the words “subject to the operation of paragraphs 23 and 25,” were omitted from paragraph 15\. 

             25.  For the purpose of dealing further with declaration votes referred to in subparagraph 23(b), paragraphs 10 to 22, inclusive, reapply in relation to those votes as if the words “subject to the operation of paragraphs 23 and 25,” were omitted from paragraph 15.

            the DRO or AEO must cause the person’s current name to be removed from the Roll and replaced with the name by which the person is or has been generally known in the community.

(5)        The DRO or AEO must cause a person’s current name to be removed from the Roll, without being replaced with another name, if:

                     (a)  the person fails to comply with a request under subitem (3); or

                     (b)  the person complies with a request under subitem (3) but either or both of paragraphs (4)(a) and (b) do not apply.
