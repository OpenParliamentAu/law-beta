                     (b)  any conditions specified in the regulations or Civil Aviation Orders;

                     (c)  any conditions imposed by CASA under section 28BB.

             (2)  If a condition of an AOC referred to in paragraph (1)(a) or (aa) is breached, the AOC continues, despite the breach, to authorise flights or operations to which the condition relates.

          (2A)  If a condition of an AOC referred to in paragraph (1)(ab), (b) or (c) is breached, the AOC does not authorise any flight or operation to which the condition relates while the breach continues.

             (3)  If a condition of an AOC is breached, CASA may, by written notice given to its holder, suspend or cancel:

                     (a)  the AOC; or

                     (b)  any specified authorisation contained in the AOC;

whether or not the breach is continuing.

             (4)  Before making a decision under subsection (3), CASA must:

                     (a)  give the holder of the AOC a notice setting out the reasons why CASA is considering making the decision; and

             (5)  If CASA makes a decision under subsection (3), the notice of its decision must include a summary of section 31A. However, a failure to include such a summary does not affect the validity of the notice.

##### <a id="28BAA"></a>28BAA  Certain conditions for grant of AOC also have effect as ongoing conditions on the AOC

             (1)  An AOC has effect subject to the condition that CASA remains satisfied as mentioned in paragraphs 28(1)(a) and (b) in relation to the operations that are covered by the AOC.

          (2B)  Subject to subsection (2C), CASA may suspend or cancel an AOC of the kind to which paragraph (2)(a) applies or an authorisation to which paragraph (2)(b) applies if the condition of the AOC or the condition relating to the authorisation, as the case may be, that section 28BI is complied with has been breached in relation to any operation, covered by the AOC or authorisation, to which that section applies.

          (2C)  To the extent that an AOC, or an authorisation contained in a mixed authority AOC, authorises carriage by air that is not covered by Part IA, II, III or IV of the _Civil Aviation (Carriers’ Liability) Act 1959_, CASA does not have power to suspend or cancel the AOC or authorisation because of a breach of the condition that section 28BI is complied with unless the holder of the AOC is a constitutional corporation.

             (3)  The financial position of the holder of the AOC is one of the matters that CASA may take into account in forming a view for the purposes of subsection (1), paragraph (1A)(a), subsection (2) and paragraph (2A)(a).

             (2)  If the holder is a body having legal personality, each of its directors must also take the steps specified in subsection (1).

             (3)  It is evidence of a failure by a body and its directors to comply with this section if an act covered by this section is done without a reasonable degree of care and diligence mainly because of:

                     (a)  inadequate corporate management, control or supervision of the conduct of any of the body’s directors, servants or agents; or

             (1)  If CASA suspends a civil aviation authorisation under section 30DC, CASA may, before the end of the fifth business day after the day on which the holder of the authorisation was notified of the suspension, apply to the Federal Court for an order under this section.

             (2)  If the Federal Court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the holder has engaged in, is engaging in, or is likely to engage in, conduct that contravenes section 30DB, the Court must make an order that prohibits the holder from doing anything that is authorised by the authorisation but that, without the authorisation, would be unlawful.

             (3)  In deciding under subsection (2), the Federal Court must have regard to section 3A and subsection 9A(1).

             (4)  Subject to section 30DF, an order continues in force for the period determined by the Federal Court when making the order, being the period (not more than 40 days) that the Court considers reasonable to allow CASA to complete an investigation into the circumstances that gave rise to CASA’s decision to suspend the authorisation.

##### <a id="30DF"></a>30DF  Court may vary period of order

             (1)  On application by CASA or the holder of the civil aviation authorisation, the Federal Court may:

                     (a)  extend (but not for more than 28 days); or

                     (b)  shorten;

the period determined by the Court in relation to an order under subsection 30DE(4) (the **_original period_**).

             (2)  An application under subsection (1) must be made before the end of the original period.

             (3)  CASA may apply only once to extend the period of an order.

             (4)  If the Court has heard and determined an application under subsection (1) in relation to an order, no further applications to vary the period of that order may be made.

             (5)  If:

                     (a)  a party (being CASA or the holder of the civil aviation authorisation concerned) applies to vary the period of an order; and

                     (b)  before the Court determines the application, the other party also applies to vary the period of the order;

the Court must hear the applications together.

             (6)  If an application is made to vary the period of an order, the order continues in force until the day worked out under the table.

#### Subdivision D—Investigation and further action by CASA

##### <a id="30DG"></a>30DG  CASA must investigate circumstances giving rise to suspension decision

                   If the Federal Court makes an order under section 30DE in relation to a civil aviation authorisation, CASA must, by the end of the period that the order is in force, complete an investigation into the circumstances that gave rise to CASA’s decision to suspend the authorisation under section 30DC.

##### <a id="30DH"></a>30DH  CASA may give a show cause notice within 5 days after end of order

             (1)  This section applies if, after CASA’s investigation under section 30DG:

                     (a)  CASA has reason to believe that a serious and imminent risk to air safety would exist if the civil aviation authorisation were not varied, suspended or cancelled; and

                     (b)  the grounds for CASA’s belief are related to the circumstances that gave rise to CASA’s decision to suspend the authorisation under section 30DC.

             (2)  CASA may, within 5 business days after the last day on which the order is in force:

                     (a)  give the holder of the authorisation a show cause notice; and

                     (b)  allow the holder to show cause, within such reasonable time as CASA specifies in the notice (not more than 28 days), why the authorisation should not be varied, suspended or cancelled.

Note:          The suspension under section 30DC continues in force beyond the end of the order and may continue until at least the end of the 5 days that CASA has to decide whether to give a show cause notice—see section 30DJ.

##### <a id="30DI"></a>30DI  CASA may vary, suspend or cancel an authorisation within 5 days after end of show cause period

             (1)  This section applies if, after the end of the period specified in a show cause notice given under section 30DH:

                     (a)  CASA is satisfied that a serious and imminent risk to air safety would exist if the civil aviation authorisation were not varied, suspended or cancelled; and

                     (b)  the grounds for CASA’s belief are related to the circumstances that gave rise to CASA’s decision to suspend the authorisation under section 30DC.

             (2)  CASA may vary, suspend or cancel the authorisation, by written notice given to the holder of the authorisation within 5 business days after the end of the period specified in the show cause notice.

Note:          The suspension under section 30DC continues in force beyond the end of the period specified in the show cause notice and may continue until the end of the 5 days that CASA has to decide whether to vary, suspend or cancel the authorisation—see section 30DJ.

##### <a id="30DJ"></a>30DJ  When a suspension under section 30DC ends

                   If CASA suspends a civil aviation authorisation under section 30DC and applies to the Federal Court for an order under section 30DE, the suspension continues in force until the time worked out under the table (unless earlier revoked).

#### Subdivision C—Consequences of incurring demerit points

##### <a id="30DY"></a>30DY  First-time demerit suspension notice

             (1)  CASA must give the holder of a civil aviation authorisation a demerit suspension notice under this section if:

                     (a)  the holder incurs demerit points for a prescribed offence; and

                     (b)  taken together with demerit points incurred by the holder for offences committed by the holder in the 3 years ending on the day the offence was committed, the holder has incurred at least 12 demerit points in relation to the same class of authorisations; and

                     (c)  the holder has not previously been given a demerit suspension notice in relation to that class of authorisations.

          (1A)  If a person incurs demerit points before becoming a holder of a civil aviation authorisation, then, for the purpose of paragraph (1)(b), those points are taken to have been incurred by the holder for offences committed by the holder.

             (2)  The effect of giving the notice is that:

                     (a)  from the start date specified in the notice, all of the holder’s civil aviation authorisations of that class are suspended for the suspension period; and

                     (b)  the holder is not entitled to be granted a civil aviation authorisation of that class, from the date of the notice until the end of the last day on which a civil aviation authorisation of that class is suspended as a result of the notice.

             (3)  The suspension period for an authorisation is:

                     (a)  if the total of the demerit points counted under paragraphs (1)(a) and (b) is 12, 13, 14 or 15—90 days; or

                     (b)  if the total of the demerit points counted under paragraphs (1)(a) and (b) is 16, 17, 18 or 19—120 days; or

                     (c)  otherwise—150 days.

Note:          The suspension period for a particular authorisation may be affected by section 30EB.

##### <a id="30DZ"></a>30DZ  Second-time demerit suspension notice

             (1)  CASA must give the holder of a civil aviation authorisation a demerit suspension notice under this section if:

                     (a)  the holder incurs demerit points for a prescribed offence; and

                     (b)  taken together with demerit points incurred by the holder for offences committed by the holder in the 3 years ending on the day the offence was committed, the holder has incurred at least 6 demerit points in relation to the same class of authorisations; and

                     (c)  the holder has, once previously, been given a demerit suspension notice in relation to that class of authorisations.

          (1A)  If a person incurs demerit points before becoming a holder of a civil aviation authorisation, then, for the purpose of paragraph (1)(b), those points are taken to have been incurred by the holder for offences committed by the holder.

             (2)  The effect of giving the notice is that:

                     (a)  from the start date specified in the notice, all of the holder’s civil aviation authorisations of that class are suspended for the suspension period; and

                     (b)  the holder is not entitled to be granted a civil aviation authorisation of that class, from the date of the notice until the end of the last day on which a civil aviation authorisation of that class is suspended as a result of the notice.

             (3)  The suspension period for an authorisation is:

                     (a)  if the total of the demerit points counted under paragraphs (1)(a) and (b) is 6, 7, 8 or 9—90 days; or

                     (b)  if the total of the demerit points counted under paragraphs (1)(a) and (b) is 10, 11, 12 or 13—120 days; or

                     (c)  otherwise—150 days.

Note:          The suspension period for a particular authorisation may be affected by section 30EB.

##### <a id="30EA"></a>30EA  Details in a demerit suspension notice

                   A demerit suspension notice must state the following:

                     (a)  the date of the notice;

                     (b)  the start date, being the date that the suspension period begins (which must not be earlier than the 28th day after the date of the notice);

                     (c)  the suspension period;

                     (d)  the class of authorisations covered by the notice;

                     (e)  any other information required by the regulations.

##### <a id="30EB"></a>30EB  Suspension period not to be served concurrently

                   A day is not counted for the purposes of a suspension period that applies to a holder’s civil aviation authorisation under this Division if:

                     (a)  on that day, a suspension of the authorisation has effect under another provision of this Act or the regulations; or

                     (b)  the day is a day prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this section.

Example:    At the time that a 90 day suspension under section 30DY comes into force, another suspension of one of the affected civil aviation authorisations has been stayed under section 31A. 20 days into the section 30DY suspension, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal reviews the other suspension and upholds it. The other suspension runs for 30 days. Those 30 days do not count for the purposes of the section 30DY suspension of the relevant authorisation. The section 30DY suspension of that authorisation has 70 days to run after the end of the other suspension.

##### <a id="30EC"></a>30EC  Demerit cancellation notice

             (1)  CASA must give the holder of a civil aviation authorisation a demerit cancellation notice if:

                     (a)  the holder incurs demerit points for a prescribed offence; and

                     (b)  taken together with demerit points incurred by the holder for offences committed by the holder in the 3 years ending on the day the offence was committed, the holder has incurred at least 6 demerit points in relation to the same class of authorisations; and

                     (c)  the holder has, twice previously, been given a demerit suspension notice in relation to that class of authorisations.

          (1A)  If a person incurs demerit points before becoming a holder of a civil aviation authorisation, then, for the purpose of paragraph (1)(b), those points are taken to have been incurred by the holder for offences committed by the holder.

             (2)  The effect of giving the notice is that:

                     (a)  from the start date specified in the notice, all of the holder’s civil aviation authorisations of that class are cancelled; and

                     (b)  the holder is not entitled to be granted a civil aviation authorisation of that class for 3 years from the date of the notice.

##### <a id="30ED"></a>30ED  Details in a demerit cancellation notice

Note:          Demerit points incurred after the date of the notice but before the suspension or cancellation begins are not disregarded.

             (2)  If a person incurs demerit points before becoming a holder of a civil aviation authorisation, then, for the purpose of subsection (1), those points are taken to have been incurred by the holder.

##### <a id="30EF"></a>30EF  CASA may reinstate if satisfied that holder’s livelihood depends on authorisation

             (1)  A holder of a civil aviation authorisation who has been given a demerit suspension notice or demerit cancellation notice may apply to CASA to have the authorisation reinstated.

             (2)  Subsection (1) applies despite paragraphs 30DY(2)(b), 30DZ(2)(b) and 30EC(2)(b).

             (3)  If, and only if, CASA is satisfied that the suspension or cancellation would cause the holder severe financial hardship because, without the authorisation, the holder would not be able to earn the holder’s principal or only income, CASA may:

                     (a)  reinstate the authorisation; and

                     (b)  impose on the authorisation such conditions as CASA considers appropriate in the circumstances.

                     (b)  the date the offence was committed; and

                     (c)  the class of authorisations in relation to which the demerit points are incurred.

             (2)  If a person incurs demerit points before becoming a holder of a civil aviation authorisation, then, for the purpose of subsection (1), those points are taken to have been incurred by the holder.

##### <a id="30EJ"></a>30EJ  Expired points to be removed from register

                   CASA must remove from the register demerit points that can no longer be taken into account under subsection 30DY(1), 30DZ(1) or 30EC(1).

                     (a)  after having considered the terms of the information prepared under subsection (2); and

                     (b)  after having received any further information that the magistrate may require about the grounds on which the issue of the warrant is being sought;

        (5BA)  However, an instrument issued under a regulation made under paragraph (5A)(b) is not a legislative instrument if the instrument is expressed to apply in relation to:

                     (a)  a particular person; or

                     (b)  a particular aircraft; or

                     (c)  a particular aeronautical product.

          (5C)  Subsection (5A) is not taken to affect CASA’s power to issue directions or instructions under paragraph 98(3)(h).

          (5D)  Despite section 14 of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_, a legislative instrument made under this Act or the regulations may apply, adopt or incorporate any matter contained in any instrument or other writing:

                     (a)  as in force or existing at a particular time; or

                     (b)  as in force or existing from time to time;

even if the other instrument or writing does not yet exist when the legislative instrument is made.

             (6)  The preceding provisions of this section (including provisions that do not contain references to the States or to a Territory) have effect as if the Northern Territory were a State.

          (6A)  The regulations may contain provisions relating to medical standards that are inconsistent with the _Sex Discrimination Act 1984_ if the inconsistency is necessary for the safety of air navigation.

Note:          See also Part 2 of Schedule 1 to the _Civil Aviation Amendment Act 2005_.

          (6B)  The regulations may contain provisions that are inconsistent with the _Disability Discrimination Act 1992_ if the inconsistency is necessary for the safety of air navigation.

Note:          See also Part 2 of Schedule 1 to the _Civil Aviation Amendment Act 2005_.

          (6C)  CASA must consult the Australian Human Rights Commission about any proposal that regulations be made containing provisions that are inconsistent as mentioned in subsection (6A) or (6B). However, a failure to consult the Commission does not affect the validity of any regulations so made.

             (7)  A law of a Territory (not being a law of the Commonwealth) does not have effect to the extent to which it is inconsistent with a provision of the regulations having effect in that Territory, but such a law shall not be taken to be inconsistent with such a provision to the extent that it is capable of operating concurrently with that provision.
