##### <a id="269SM"></a>269SM  Overview of Part

             (1)  This Part deals with the taking of anti-dumping measures in respect of goods whose importation into Australia involves a dumping or countervailable subsidisation of those goods that injures, or threatens to injure, Australian industry. Those measures might consist of the publication of a dumping duty notice or a countervailing duty notice or the acceptance of an undertaking on conditions that make it unnecessary to publish such a notice.

             (2)  If a notice is published, that notice creates a liability under the Dumping Duty Act, in relation to any goods to which the notice extends, to pay a special duty of customs on their importation into Australia and, pending assessment of that special duty, to pay interim duty.

             (3)  Divisions 1, 2 and 3 deal with the preliminary and procedural matters leading to a Ministerial decision to publish or not to publish a dumping duty notice or a countervailing duty notice or to accept an undertaking instead of publishing such a notice.

             (4)  Division 4 allows a person who has been required to pay interim duty to seek an assessment of duty payable under the Dumping Duty Act and reconciles interim duty paid by that person with duty as so assessed.

             (5)  Division 5 deals with the rights of persons, periodically, on the basis of changed circumstances, to seek review by the Minister of decisions to publish dumping duty notices or countervailing duty notices or to accept undertakings. 

             (6)  Division 6 deals with the rights of new exporters and exporters not previously investigated to seek an early review by the Minister of decisions to publish dumping duty notices or countervailing duty notices.

             (7)  Division 6A ensures that interested parties are informed of the impending expiration of anti-dumping measures and allows them to seek continuation of those measures.

             (8)  Division 7 deals with procedural and evidentiary matters that are relevant both to applications for the taking of anti-dumping measures and for the various review procedures after such measures are taken.

             (9)  Divisions 8 and 9 establish an independent reviewer, the Trade Measures Review Officer, and provide for the Review Officer to review Ministerial decisions to publish or not to publish dumping duty notices or countervailing duty notices and also a range of decisions made by the CEO.

             (3)  Subsection (2) applies in respect of goods that have not been imported into Australia at the time of the CEO’s determination of a matter in respect of those goods as if:

                     (a)  the CEO’s determination of the matter were being made after an importation of those goods into Australia; and

                     (b)  the importation had occurred at the time of the anticipated importation of those goods into Australia.

             (4)  Nothing in this section implies that the determination of a matter by the CEO affects the power of the Minister to make a final determination in respect of that matter for the purposes of the Dumping Duty Act.

##### <a id="269TEA"></a>269TEA  Report to Minister concerning publication of notices under this Part

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  application has been made under section 269TB for publication of a dumping duty notice or a countervailing duty notice; and

                     (b)  the CEO has initiated an investigation in respect of the application under section 269TC;

the CEO must, after holding such an investigation and before the end of the period for reporting to the Minister that is referred to in paragraph 269TC(4)(bf), give the Minister a report in respect of the goods the subject of the application that:

                     (c)  recommends whether any such notice should be published and the extent of any duties that are, or should be, payable under the Dumping Duty Act because of that notice; and

                     (d)  recommends, in particular, whether the Minister ought to be satisfied as to the matters in respect of which the Minister is required to be satisfied before such a notice can be published; and

                     (e)  recommends, where applicable, whether the Minister ought to give notice to the exporter under subsection 269TG(3D) or to the government of the country of export or to the exporter under subsection 269TJ(2A).

             (2)  The CEO’s report must, to the extent that it is practicable to do so, also extend to any like goods not covered by the application but imported into Australia during the period starting on the date of initiation of the investigation and ending 20 days after the statement of essential facts in respect of the investigation is placed on the public record.

             (3)  Subject to subsection (4), in deciding on the recommendations to be made to the Minister in the CEO’s report in relation to an application under section 269TB for publication of a dumping duty notice or a countervailing duty notice, the CEO:

                     (a)  must have regard to:

                              (i)  the application; and

                             (ii)  any submission concerning the publication of that notice to which the CEO has had regard for the purpose of formulating the statement of essential facts; and

                            (iii)  the statement of essential facts; and

                            (iv)  any submission made in response to that statement that is received by Customs within 20 days after the placing of that statement on the public record; and

                     (b)  may have regard to any other matters that the CEO considers to be relevant.

             (4)  The CEO is not obliged to have regard to any submission made in response to the statement of essential facts that is received by Customs after the end of the period referred to in subparagraph (3)(a)(iv) if to do so would, in the CEO’s opinion, prevent the timely preparation of the report to the Minister.

             (5)  The report to the Minister must include a statement of the CEO’s reasons for any recommendation contained in the report that:

                     (a)  sets out the material findings of fact on which that recommendation is based; and

                     (b)  provides particulars of the evidence relied on to support those findings.

##### <a id="269TEB"></a>269TEB  CEO recommendations concerning undertakings offered after preliminary affirmative determination

             (1)  A person who:

                     (a)  if application has been made for publication of a dumping duty notice in respect of goods—is an exporter of such goods; or

                     (b)  if application has been made for publication of a countervailing duty notice in respect of goods—is the government of the country of export, or is an exporter, of such goods;

may, at any time after the making of a preliminary affirmative determination in respect of the application, indicate in writing to the CEO the terms in which the government or exporter would be prepared to give an undertaking to the Minister.

             (2)  The CEO must consider whether he or she is satisfied that those terms are adequate to remove the injury, or the threat of injury, to which the application is addressed so far as the government or exporter offering the undertaking is concerned and, by notice in writing:

                     (a)  if the CEO is so satisfied—recommend to the Minister that he or she accept the undertaking; or

                     (b)  if the CEO is not so satisfied—indicate to the government or exporter the reasons why he or she is not so satisfied.

             (3)  A government or an exporter may, having regard to those reasons, indicate to the CEO that the government or exporter is prepared to give an undertaking to the Minister in revised terms.

             (4)  If an undertaking in revised terms is proposed to the CEO, the CEO must:

                     (a)  if he or she is not satisfied that the undertaking as so revised is adequate to remove the injury, or the threat of injury, to which the application is addressed—inform the government or exporter to that effect; and

                     (b)  if he or she is so satisfied—recommend to the Minister that the Minister accept the undertaking as revised.

             (5)  If the Minister accepts the undertaking proposed by a government, investigation of the application is suspended so far as it relates to goods exported from that country.

             (6)  If the Minister accepts the undertaking proposed by an exporter, investigation of the application is suspended so far as it relates to goods exported by that exporter.

             (7)  If:

                     (a)  investigation of an application is suspended:

                              (i)  so far as it relates to goods exported from a particular country; or

                             (ii)  so far as it relates to goods exported by a particular exporter;

                            on the Minister’s acceptance of an undertaking proposed by the government of that country or by that exporter; and

                     (b)  that government or exporter breaches that undertaking;

the Minister may take such steps as he or she considers necessary to facilitate the resumption of the investigation in so far as it relates to goods exported from that country or by that exporter.

             (8)  Without limiting the generality of subsection (7), the Minister may, in writing, require the CEO to resume the investigation so far as it relates to goods exported from the country, or by the exporter, who breached the undertaking subject to such conditions as to the conduct of the investigation as the Minister considers appropriate.

             (9)  In determining the steps to be taken in order to facilitate the resumption of an investigation, and, where the Minister requires that the CEO resume the investigation, to determine the conditions on which the resumed investigation is to be conducted, the Minister must have regard to:

                     (a)  the procedures that had been completed when the undertaking was accepted; and

                     (b)  the length of time that has elapsed since the acceptance of the undertaking.

           (10)  The CEO is not obliged to consider the terms of any proposed undertaking provided by a government or an exporter if to do so would prevent the timely making of a recommendation by the CEO to the Minister under section 269TEA.

           (11)  If the CEO does not recommend the acceptance of an undertaking under this section, the CEO may nonetheless recommend to the Minister that he or she seek an undertaking from the government or exporter who proposed the undertaking and set out the terms of the undertaking that he or she recommends the Minister seek.

##### <a id="269ZA"></a>269ZA  Applications and requests for review of anti-dumping measures

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  anti-dumping measures have been taken in respect of goods; and

                     (b)  an affected party considers that it may be appropriate to review those measures as they affect a particular exporter of those goods, or as they affect exporters of those goods generally, because:

                              (i)  one or more of the variable factors relevant to the taking of the measures in relation to that exporter or those exporters have changed; or

                             (ii)  if those measures had not been taken—the Minister would not be entitled to take any such measures;

the affected party may, by application lodged with the CEO, request that the CEO initiate such a review.

             (2)  An application for review of anti-dumping measures must not be made:

                     (a)  if the measures involve the publication of a dumping duty notice or a countervailing duty notice—earlier than 12 months after:

                              (i)  the publication of the notice; or

                             (ii)  the publication of a notice declaring the outcome of the last review of the notice (whether that last review was undertaken at the applicant’s request or not); and

                     (b)  if the measures involve the acceptance of an undertaking—earlier than 12 months after:

                              (i)  the publication of notice of the acceptance of that undertaking; or

                             (ii)  the publication of a notice declaring the outcome of the last review of the undertaking (whether that last review was undertaken at the applicant’s request or not).

Example:    If an application under section 269TB resulted in:

(a)           the publication of the acceptance of an undertaking from exporter A on 1 January 1999; and

(b)           the publication of a dumping duty notice covering exporters B and C on 1 March 1999;

                   an affected party could seek review of the undertaking on 2 January 2000 but could not seek review of both the undertaking and the dumping duty notices until 2 March 2000.

                   However, the Minister could decide to review the notices before 2 March 2000 either on his or her own initiative or on the recommendation of the CEO. See subsection (3).

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  anti-dumping measures have been taken in respect of goods; and

                     (b)  the Minister considers (either as a result of a recommendation from the CEO under subsection 269ZC(4) or on his or her own initiative) that it may be appropriate to review those measures as they affect a particular exporter of those goods, or as they affect exporters of those goods generally, because:

                              (i)  one or more of the variable factors relevant to the taking of the measures in relation to that exporter or those exporters may have changed; or

                             (ii)  if those measures had not been taken—the Minister would not be entitled to take any such measures;

the Minister may, at any time, by notice in writing, request that the CEO initiate a review under this Division.

             (4)  If, as a result of a person’s application under Division 6 for accelerated review of a dumping duty notice or a countervailing duty notice, the Minister has made a declaration under subsection 269ZG(3):

                     (a)  that person may not make an application, under subsection (1) of this section, for a review of that notice earlier than 12 months after the making of that declaration; but

                     (b)  for the purpose of determining whether subsection (2) permits any other person to apply for a review of the notice, the making of that declaration is not to be treated as a review of the notice.

             (5)  If:

                     (a)  a person applies, under Division 9, for a review of the Minister’s decision to publish a dumping duty notice or a countervailing duty notice or not to publish such a notice; and 

                     (b)  as a result of that review:

                              (i)  a dumping duty notice or a countervailing duty notice is published by the Minister despite an earlier decision not to publish such a notice; or

                             (ii)  a dumping duty notice or countervailing duty notice originally published by the Minister is varied; or

                            (iii)  another dumping duty notice or countervailing duty notice is substituted for the notice originally published by the Minister;

then, for the purpose only of determining whether subsection (2) permits a review of the new notice, the notice as varied or the substituted notice, that new notice, notice as varied or substituted notice has affect as if it had been published at the time of the Minister’s decision not to publish a notice, or at the time of publication of the original notice, as the case requires.

##### <a id="269ZB"></a>269ZB  Content and lodgment of applications for review of anti-dumping measures

             (1)  An application under subsection 269ZA(1) for review of anti-dumping measures must:

                     (a)  be in writing; and

                     (b)  be in an approved form; and

                     (c)  contain such information as the form requires; and

                     (d)  be signed in the manner indicated by the form.

             (2)  Without otherwise limiting the matters that can be required by the approved form to be included, the application must include:

                     (a)  a description of the kind of goods to which the measures the subject of the application relate; and

                     (b)  a description of the measures the subject of the application; and

                     (c)  if the application is based on a change in variable factors—a statement of the opinion of the applicant concerning:

                              (i)  the variable factors relevant to the taking of the measures taken that have changed; and

                             (ii)  the amount by which each such factor has changed; and

                            (iii)  the information that establishes that amount; and

                     (d)  if the application is based on any other circumstances that in the view of the applicant would prevent the Minister, in the absence of the anti-dumping measures, from taking such measures—a statement of those other circumstances.

             (3)  An application may be lodged with Customs:

                     (a)  by leaving it at a place allocated for lodgment of such applications at Customs House in Canberra; or

                     (b)  by posting it by prepaid post to a postal address specified in the approved form; or

                     (c)  by sending it by electronic facsimile to a facsimile number specified in the approved form;

and the application is taken to have been lodged when the application, or a facsimile of the application, is first received by an officer of Customs doing duty in relation to applications for review of anti-dumping measures.

             (4)  The day on which the application is taken to have been lodged must be recorded on the application.

##### <a id="269ZC"></a>269ZC  Consideration of applications and requests for review

             (1)  If an application for review of anti-dumping measures is lodged with Customs under section 269ZB, the CEO must, within 20 days after Customs receives the application:

                     (a)  examine the application; and

                     (b)  if the CEO is not satisfied, having regard to the application and to any other information that the CEO considers relevant, of one or more of the matters referred to in subsection (2);

the CEO must reject the application and inform the applicant, by notice in writing, accordingly.

             (2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), the matters to be considered in relation to an application are:

                     (a)  whether the application complies with section 269ZB; and

                     (b)  whether there appear to be reasonable grounds for asserting either:

                              (i)  that the variable factors relevant to the taking of anti-dumping measures have changed; or

                             (ii)  that, if the anti-dumping measures to which the application relates had not been taken, the Minister would not be entitled to take such measures.

             (3)  The notice informing the applicant of the rejection of the application must set out the reasons why the CEO was not satisfied of one or more of the matters set out in subsection (2).

             (4)  If the CEO decides not to reject an application for review of anti-dumping measures, the CEO must either:

                     (a)  publish a notice in a newspaper circulating in each State, in the Australian Capital Territory and in the Northern Territory indicating that it is proposed to review the measures covered by the application; or

                     (b)  if the application for review related only to the review of the measures as they affect particular exporters and the CEO is satisfied that there is a reasonable prospect that a review of such measures as they affect other particular exporters, or as they affect exporters generally, may be justified—recommend to the Minister that the review applied for be extended accordingly.

             (5)  If the CEO is requested by the Minister to undertake a review of anti-dumping measures, either as a result of a recommendation made to the Minister under subsection (4) or otherwise, the CEO must, on receipt of that request, publish a notice in a newspaper circulating in each State, in the Australian Capital Territory and in the Northern Territory indicating that it is proposed to review the measures covered by the request.

             (6)  If:

                     (a)  the CEO recommends to the Minister under paragraph (4)(b) the extension of a review of anti-dumping measures; but

                     (b)  the CEO is informed by the Minister, within 20 days after that recommendation is made, that the Minister does not require the review to be so extended;

the CEO must, on being so informed, publish a notice in a newspaper circulating in each State, in the Australian Capital Territory and in the Northern Territory indicating that it is proposed to review the anti-dumping measures under this Division covered by the original application.

             (7)  The notice published by the CEO under subsection (4), (5) or (6) must:

                     (a)  describe the kind of goods to which the review relates; and

                     (b)  describe the measures to which the review relates; and

                     (c)  indicate that a report will be made to the Minister:

                              (i)  within 155 days after the date of publication of the notice; or

                             (ii)  if the 110 days referred to in paragraph (e) is extended by the Minister—within the period of 155 days as similarly so extended; and

                     (d)  invite interested parties to lodge with the CEO, within a specified period of not more than 40 days after the date of publication of the notice, submissions concerning the review; and

                     (e)  state that:

                              (i)  within 110 days after the publication of the notice; or

                             (ii)  such longer period as the Minister allows under section 269ZHI;

                            the CEO will place on the public record a statement of the essential facts on which the CEO proposes to base a recommendation concerning the measures under review; and

                      (f)  invite interested parties to lodge with the CEO, within 20 days of that statement being placed on the public record, submissions in response to that statement; and

                     (g)  indicate the address at which, or the manner in which, submissions under paragraph (d) or (f) can be lodged.

##### <a id="269ZD"></a>269ZD  Statement of essential facts in relation to review of anti-dumping measures

             (1)  If the CEO publishes a notice under subsection 269ZC(4), (5) or (6) in relation to the review of anti-dumping measures, he or she must, within the time limit specified for so doing on that notice, place on the public record a statement of the facts (the **_statement of essential facts_**) on which the CEO proposes to base a recommendation to the Minister in relation to the review of those measures.

             (2)  Subject to subsection (3), in formulating the statement of essential facts, the CEO:

                     (a)  must have regard to:

             (3)  The CEO is not obliged to have regard to any submissions relating generally to the review that are received by Customs after the end of the period referred to in subparagraph (2)(a)(ii) if to do so would, in the CEO’s opinion, prevent the timely placement of the statement of essential facts on the public record.

##### <a id="269ZDA"></a>269ZDA  Report on review of measures

             (1)  The CEO must, after conducting a review of anti-dumping measures and before the end of the period referred to in paragraph 269ZC(7)(c) as it applies to those measures, give the Minister a report recommending:

                     (a)  to the extent that the measures involved the publication of a dumping duty notice or a countervailing duty notice:

                              (i)  that the notice remain unaltered; or

                             (ii)  that the notice be revoked in its application to a particular exporter or to a particular kind of goods or revoked generally; or

                     (b)  to the extent that the measures involved the acceptance by the Minister of an undertaking:

                              (i)  that the undertaking remain unaltered; or

             (4)  The CEO is not obliged to have regard to any submission made in response to the statement of essential facts that is received by Customs after the end of the period referred to in subparagraph (3)(a)(iv) if to do so would, in the CEO’s opinion, prevent the timely preparation of the report to the Minister.

             (5)  The report to the Minister must include a statement of the CEO’s reasons for any recommendation contained in the report that:

                     (a)  sets out the material findings of fact on which that recommendation is based; and

                            (iii)  that, with effect from a date specified in the declaration, the notice is to be taken to have effect or to have had effect, either in relation to a particular exporter or to exporters generally, as if the Minister had fixed different variable factors in respect of that exporter or of exporters generally, relevant to the determination of duty; and

                     (b)  to the extent that the anti-dumping measures concerned involved the acceptance by the Minister of an undertaking:

                              (i)  that the undertaking is to remain unaltered; or

                             (ii)  that if, before a date specified in the declaration, the terms of the undertaking are altered in a manner specified in the declaration, the undertaking as so varied will be acceptable to the Minister; or

                            (iii)  that the undertaking is no longer acceptable to the Minister and that the investigation of the need for a dumping duty notice or a countervailing duty notice is to be resumed immediately; or

                            (iv)  that, with effect from a date specified in the declaration, the person who gave the undertaking is released from the undertaking and that the investigation giving rise to the undertaking is terminated.

                     (c)  interim duty paid on such goods on the basis of the variable factors as previously fixed exceeds the interim duty that would be payable on the basis of the new variable factors;

the person who paid the interim duty may apply under Division 3 of Part VIII for a refund of the excess.

             (4)  The Minister must, as soon as practicable after the making of a declaration under subsection (1) that affects an exporter or person giving an undertaking, inform that exporter or person of the terms of the declaration.

             (5)  Nothing in this section is to be taken to imply that the Minister cannot simultaneously make the same declaration in relation to more than one exporter or person giving an undertaking.

             (6)  For the purposes of a declaration under subsection (1), the Minister must not fix a date:

                     (a)  in a circumstance to which subparagraph (1)(a)(ii) or (iii) applies—that is earlier than the date of publication under section 269ZC of a notice indicating the proposal to undertake the review concerned; and

                     (b)  in a circumstance to which subparagraph (1)(b)(ii) or (iv) applies—that is earlier than the date of the declaration.

the CEO must reject each such application and inform the applicant, by notice in writing, accordingly.

             (2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), the matters to be considered in relation to an application are:

                     (a)  whether the application complies with section 269ZHC; and

                     (b)  whether there appear to be reasonable grounds for asserting that the expiration of the anti-dumping measures to which the application relates might lead, or might be likely to lead, to a continuation of, or a recurrence of, the material injury that the measures are intended to prevent.

             (3)  A notice informing an applicant of the rejection of an application must set out the reasons why the CEO was not satisfied of one or more of the matters set out in subsection (2).

             (4)  If the CEO decides not to reject an application for continuation of anti-dumping measures taken in respect of goods as they affect a particular exporter of those goods, the CEO must publish a notice in a newspaper circulating in each State, in the Australian Capital Territory and in the Northern Territory indicating that it is proposed to inquire whether continuation of the measures is justified.

             (3)  The CEO is not obliged to have regard to any submissions relating generally to the inquiry that are received by Customs after the end of the period referred to in subparagraph (2)(a)(ii) if to do so would, in the CEO’s opinion, prevent the timely placement of the statement of essential facts on the public record.

##### <a id="269ZHF"></a>269ZHF  Report on application for continuation of anti-dumping measures

             (1)  The CEO must, after conducting an inquiry into the continuation of anti-dumping measures and before the end of the period referred to in paragraph 269ZHD(5)(c) as it applies to those measures, give the Minister a report recommending:

                     (a)  to the extent that the measures comprise a dumping duty notice—that notice expires; and

                     (b)  to the extent that the measures comprise a countervailing duty notice—that notice expires; or
