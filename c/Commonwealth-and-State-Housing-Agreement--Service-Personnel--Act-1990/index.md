 2.	(1)	This agreement shall be deemed to have come into effect in respect of the Commonwealth and the States of New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania on the first day of July 1989, and in respect of the Commonwealth and other States on the first day of July previous to the date when it is signed on behalf of each other State.
 	(2)	Notwithstanding that in this agreement all the States are named as parties, this agreement shall operate as an agreement between the Commonwealth and the party or parties in respect of which it comes into force as fully and effectually as if the party or parties in respect of which it comes into force were the only party or parties so named other than the Commonwealth.
 	(3)	Save as to the obligations under the earlier agreements referred to in clause&#160;7, the provisions of the earlier agreements relating to housing stock shall be deemed to have ceased to operate on and from the date of commencement of this agreement.
 3.
