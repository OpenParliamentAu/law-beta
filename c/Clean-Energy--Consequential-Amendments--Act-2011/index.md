##### <a id="420‑5"></a>420‑5  The 4 key features of tax accounting for registered emissions units

                   The purpose of income tax accounting for registered emissions units is to produce the same tax treatment, irrespective of your purpose in acquiring or holding the registered emissions units.

                   There are 4 key features:

             (1)  You bring your gross expenditure and gross proceeds to account, not your net profits and losses on disposal of a registered emissions unit.

             (2)  The gross expenditure is deductible.

             (3)  The gross proceeds are assessable income.

             (4)  You must bring to account any difference between the value of your registered emissions units held at the start and at the end of the income year. This is done in such a way that:

                     (a)  any increase in value is included in assessable income; and

                     (b)  any decrease in value is a deduction.

##### <a id="420‑21"></a>420‑21  Incoming international transfers of emissions units

Unit held as trading stock or as a revenue asset

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  any of the following conditions is satisfied:

                              (i)  a * carbon unit is transferred from your foreign account (within the meaning of the _Clean Energy Act 2011_) to your Registry account (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_) or your nominee’s Registry account (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_);

                             (ii)  a carbon unit is transferred from your nominee’s foreign account (within the meaning of the _Clean Energy Act 2011_) to your Registry account (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_) or your nominee’s Registry account (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_);

                            (iii)  an * international emissions unit is transferred from your foreign account (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_) to your Registry account (within the meaning of that Act) or your nominee’s Registry account (within the meaning of that Act);

                            (iv)  an international emissions unit is transferred from your nominee’s foreign account (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_) to your Registry account (within the meaning of that Act) or your nominee’s Registry account (within the meaning of that Act);

                             (v)  an * Australian carbon credit unit is transferred from your foreign account (within the meaning of the _Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Act 2011_) to your Registry account (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_) or your nominee’s Registry account (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_);

                            (vi)  an Australian carbon credit unit is transferred from your nominee’s foreign account (within the meaning of the _Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Act 2011_) to your Registry account (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_) or your nominee’s Registry account (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_); and

                     (b)  as a result of the transfer, you start to * hold the unit as a * registered emissions unit; and

                     (c)  just before the transfer, the unit was your * trading stock or * revenue asset;

you are treated as if:

                     (d)  just before the transfer, you had sold the unit to someone else for its * cost; and

                     (e)  you had, immediately after the sale, bought it back as a registered emissions unit for the same amount.

Example:    An Australian resident company carries on a business of trading in emissions units. The units are trading stock. The company owns 10,000 emission reduction units (a type of international emissions unit) that are registered in New Zealand. 5,000 of those emission reduction units are transferred from the company’s New Zealand registry account to the company’s Australian registry account.

                   The company is treated as having sold each unit to someone else at its cost just before it became a registered emissions unit. As the unit was previously held as trading stock, the unit ceases to be trading stock (section 70‑12). The cost of the unit just before it became a registered emissions unit is included in the company’s assessable income.

                   The company is also treated as having bought 5,000 registered emissions units for the same amount. The company is entitled to a deduction for that amount (section 420‑15).

Unit held otherwise than as trading stock or as a revenue asset

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  any of the following conditions is satisfied:

                            (iii)  an * international emissions unit is transferred from your foreign account (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_) to your Registry account (within the meaning of that Act) or your nominee’s Registry account (within the meaning of that Act);

                            (iv)  an international emissions unit is transferred from your nominee’s foreign account (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_) to your Registry account (within the meaning of that Act) or your nominee’s Registry account (within the meaning of that Act);

                             (v)  an * Australian carbon credit unit is transferred from your foreign account (within the meaning of the _Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Act 2011_) to your Registry account (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_) or your nominee’s Registry account (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_);

                     (b)  as a result of the transfer, you start to * hold the unit as a * registered emissions unit; and

                     (c)  just before the transfer, the unit was neither your * trading stock nor your * revenue asset;

you are treated as if:

                     (d)  just before the transfer, you had sold the unit to someone else for its * market value just before the transfer; and

                     (e)  you had, immediately after the sale, bought it back as a registered emissions unit for the same amount.

##### <a id="420‑22"></a>420‑22  Becoming taxable in Australia on the proceeds of sale of registered emissions units

                   If:

                     (a)  you start to * hold a * registered emissions unit at a particular time; and

                     (b)  assuming that you had sold the unit to someone else immediately after you started to hold the unit, the proceeds of the sale would not have been included in your assessable income under section 420‑25; and

                     (c)  you hold the unit until a later time (the **_taxable status commencement time_**), where the following conditions are satisfied:

                              (i)  assuming that you had sold the unit to someone else immediately before the taxable status commencement time, the proceeds of the sale would not have been included in your assessable income under section 420‑25;

                             (ii)  assuming that you had sold the unit to someone else at the taxable status commencement time, the proceeds of the sale would have been included in your assessable income under section 420‑25;

you are treated as if:

                     (d)  immediately after the taxable status commencement time, you had bought the unit from someone else for its * market value; and

                     (e)  you had started to hold the unit immediately after the taxable status commencement time instead of at the time mentioned in paragraph (a).

Note:          Under the _International Tax Agreements Act 1953_, for some foreign residents, the proceeds of the sale of a registered emissions unit are not assessable income in Australia.

##### <a id="420‑30"></a>420‑30  Non‑arm’s length transactions and transactions with associates

                   If:

                     (a)  an entity (the **_transferor_**) ceases to * hold a * registered emissions unit; and

                     (b)  the cessation is because of the transfer of the unit to:

                              (i)  a Registry account (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_); or

                             (ii)  a foreign account (within the meaning of that Act);

                     (d)  the transferee did not pay or give consideration equal to the * market value of the unit for the transfer of the unit;

the transferor is treated as if the transferor were entitled to receive an amount equal to that market value because the transferor ceased to be the holder of the unit.

Note:          In the application of Division 13 of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_(about international transfer‑pricing arrangements), this section is disregarded—see subsection 136AB(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

##### <a id="420‑35"></a>420‑35  Outgoing international transfers of emissions units

                   If:

                     (a)  you stop * holding a * registered emissions unit; and

                     (b)  you do so as a result of the transfer of the unit to:

                              (i)  if the unit is a * carbon unit—your foreign account (within the meaning of the _Clean Energy Act 2011_) or your nominee’s foreign account (within the meaning of that Act); or

                             (ii)  if the unit is an * international emissions unit—your foreign account (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_) or your nominee’s foreign account (within the meaning of that Act); or

                            (iii)  if the unit is an * Australian carbon credit unit—your foreign account (within the meaning of the _Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Act 2011_) or your nominee’s foreign account (within the meaning of that Act);

you are treated as if:

                     (c)  just before the transfer, you had sold the unit to someone else for its * market value just before the transfer; and

                     (d)  you had, immediately after the sale, bought it back for the same amount.

Example:    An Australian resident company carries on a business of trading in emission units. The company owns 10,000 emission reduction units (a type of international emissions unit) that are registered in Australia. 5,000 of those units are transferred from the company’s Australian registry account to the company’s New Zealand registry account.

                   The company is treated as having sold each unit to someone else at its market value just before it stopped being a registered emissions unit. As the unit was a registered emissions unit, the market value is included in the company’s assessable income (section 420‑25).

                   The company is also treated as having bought 5,000 emission reduction units for the same amount. As those units are trading stock, the company may be able to deduct that amount under section 8‑1.

##### <a id="420‑40"></a>420‑40  Disposal of registered emissions units for a purpose other than gaining assessable income

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  an entity (the **_first entity_**) incurs expenditure in:

                              (i)  becoming the * holder of a * registered emissions unit; or

                             (ii)  ceasing to hold a registered emissions unit; and

                     (b)  the first entity has deducted or can deduct the expenditure under section 420‑15 or 420‑42; and

                     (c)  the first entity ceases to hold the unit in a particular income year; and

                     (d)  the cessation is neither:

                              (i)  in gaining or producing the first entity’s assessable income; nor

                             (ii)  in carrying on a * business for the purpose of gaining or producing the first entity’s assessable income; and

                     (e)  section 420‑30 (non‑arm’s length transactions and transactions with associates) did not apply to the first entity ceasing to hold the unit;

the first entity’s assessable income for that income year includes an amount equal to the amount the first entity has deducted or can deduct.

Death

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  the first entity is an individual; and

                     (b)  the cessation is because of the first entity’s death; and

                     (c)  the * registered emissions unit devolves to the first entity’s * legal personal representative;

then:

                     (d)  the first entity’s legal personal representative is treated as having bought the unit for the amount included in the first entity’s assessable income under subsection (1); and

                     (e)  if the unit * passes to a beneficiary in the first entity’s estate:

                              (i)  the first entity’s legal personal representative is treated as having disposed of the unit for the amount included in the first entity’s assessable income under subsection (1); and

                             (ii)  the beneficiary is treated as having bought the unit for the amount included in the first entity’s assessable income under subsection (1).

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  the first entity is an individual; and

                     (b)  the cessation is because of the first entity’s death; and

                     (c)  the * registered emissions unit * passes to a beneficiary in the first entity’s estate without devolving to the first entity’s * legal personal representative;

the beneficiary is treated as having bought the unit for the amount included in the first entity’s assessable income under subsection (1).

Transfer—treatment of acquirer

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  the cessation is because of the transfer of the unit to another entity; and

                     (b)  neither subsection (2) nor (3) applies;

the other entity is treated as having bought the unit for the amount included in the first entity’s assessable income under subsection (1).

             (5)  If subsection (4) applies to the transfer of the unit to another entity:

                     (a)  the first entity must inform the other entity that, as a result of subsection (4) applying, the other entity is treated as having bought the unit for a particular amount; and

                     (b)  the first entity must do so:

                              (i)  at, or as soon as practicable after, the time of the transfer; or

                             (ii)  by a later time allowed by the Commissioner.

Source

             (6)  An amount included in the first entity’s assessable income under subsection (1) is taken, for the purposes of the * income tax laws, to have a source in Australia.

##### <a id="420‑41"></a>420‑41  Ceasing to be taxable in Australia on the proceeds of sale of registered emissions units

                   If:

                     (a)  you start to * hold a * registered emissions unit; and

                     (b)  assuming that you had sold the unit to someone else immediately after you started to hold the unit, the proceeds of sale would have been included in your assessable income under section 420‑25; and

                     (c)  you hold the unit until a later time (the **_taxable status cessation time_**), where the following conditions are satisfied:

                              (i)  assuming that you had sold the unit to someone else immediately before the taxable status cessation time, the proceeds of the sale would have been included in your assessable income under section 420‑25;

                             (ii)  assuming that you had sold the unit to someone else at the taxable status cessation time, the proceeds of sale would not have been included in your assessable income under section 420‑25;

you are treated as if:

                     (d)  just before the taxable status cessation time, you had sold the unit to someone else for its * market value; and

                     (e)  you had, at the taxable status cessation time, bought it back for the same amount.

Note:          Under the _International Tax Agreements Act 1953_, for some foreign residents, the proceeds of the sale of a registered emissions unit are not assessable income in Australia.

##### <a id="420‑42"></a>420‑42  Deduction for expenses incurred in ceasing to hold a registered emissions unit

Disregard value of unit if sale proceeds would not be assessable

             (5)  For the purposes of this Subdivision, disregard the * value of a * registered emissions unit you * held at the end of the income year if, assuming that you had sold the unit to someone else immediately after you started to hold the unit, the proceeds of the sale would not have been included in your assessable income under section 420‑25.

Note:          Under the _International Tax Agreements Act 1953_, for some foreign residents, the proceeds of the sale of a registered emissions unit are not assessable income in Australia.

##### <a id="420‑50"></a>420‑50  Value of registered emissions units at start of income year

             (1)  The **_value_** of a * registered emissions unit you * held at the start of an income year is the same amount at which it was taken into account under this Subdivision at the end of the last income year.

             (2)  The **_value_** of the unit is a nil amount if the unit was not taken into account under this Subdivision at the end of the last income year.

##### <a id="420‑51"></a>420‑51  Valuation methods

             (1)  The **_value_** of a * registered emissions unit you * held at the end of an income year is worked out using one of the following methods:

                     (a)  the * FIFO cost method;

                     (b)  the * actual cost method;

                     (c)  the * market value method.

Sections 420‑55 and 420‑57 tell you which method applies.

             (2)  This section has effect subject to section 420‑58 (certain free carbon units).

##### <a id="420‑52"></a>420‑52  FIFO cost method of working out the value of units

                   The **_FIFO cost method_** for working out the * value of the * registered emissions units you * held at the end of an income year means that the value of the units is the * cost of the registered emissions units, and, for the purposes of the application of this Subdivision to you for the income year:

                     (a)  if any of the registered emissions units are:

                              (i)  * carbon units that have a * vintage year that is the same as, or earlier than, the financial year to which the income year relates; or

                             (ii)  eligible international emissions units (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_); or

                            (iii)  * Australian carbon credit units;

                     (b)  if:

                              (i)  any of the registered emissions units are carbon units that have the same vintage year; and

                             (ii)  that vintage year is later than the financial year to which the income year relates;

                            you must account for those units on a first‑in first‑out basis; and

                     (c)  if any of the registered emissions units are * Kyoto units that are not eligible international emissions units (within the meaning of the _Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011_)—you must account for those units on a first‑in first‑out basis.

##### <a id="420‑53"></a>420‑53  Actual cost method of working out the value of units

                   The **_actual cost method_** for working out the value of the * registered emissions units you * held at the end of the income year means that the value of the units is the * cost of the units, and, for the purposes of the application of this Subdivision to you for the income year, you must not account for any of those units on a first‑in first‑out basis.

##### <a id="420‑54"></a>420‑54  Market value method of working out the value of units

                   The **_market value method_** for working out the value of the * registered emissions units you * held at the end of the income year means that the value of the units is the * market value of the units at the end of the income year.

##### <a id="420‑55"></a>420‑55  Valuation method for first income year at the end of which you held registered emissions units

Scope

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (c)  the * market value method;

for working out the **_value_** of the * registered emissions units you * held at the end of the income year.

FIFO cost method applies if no choice made

             (3)  If you do not make a choice under subsection (2) for the income year, the **_value_** of the * registered emissions units you * held at the end of the income year is worked out using the * FIFO cost method.

Time for making choice

             (4)  You must make a choice under subsection (2) before you lodge your * income tax return for the income year for which you make the choice.

No revocation of choice

             (5)  A choice made under subsection (2) cannot be revoked.
